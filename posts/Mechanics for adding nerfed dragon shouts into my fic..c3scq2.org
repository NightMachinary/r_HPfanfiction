my current thought is too have it be a type of battle magic that is focused by a tattoo on the throat just above the adams apple. I am also considering there being a grey beards type faction. would love input on how to improve this or general ideas for how something like this could work

Edit: thank you guys so much. I would like to add that This mechanic will not be used regularly until well after Harry graduates hogwarts the only thing thuum related he will get in Hogwarts will be something akin to aura whisper. My overall plot is very much Au due to the additions to the world I am making.


** Langlock, Silencio.

Not to mention that there are maybe five or so shouts that don't have a better wand magic equivalent---and all of them are "destroy or kill everything within the ten acres surrounding me" or stronger, and nerfing them would just remove the point of them.

** It's not like many shouts are especially strong compared to magic.\\
Storm call, become ethereal, maybe aura whisper (depending on just how good spells like Revilio are), and bend will (but only if there's dragons to use it on). The rest are easily outdone with spells.

*** Unrelenting Force is a useful Flippendo.

Slow Time basically means that any Wizard would be fodder to you

Soul Tear counters Horcruxes by literally ripping the Soul out of a body and sealing it in a Soul Gem.

Bend Will = Permanent Imperius with no mental drain on Dragons, which are hard as fuck for Wizards to deal with.

Whirlwind Sprint = Speedblitz Wizards casually.

Storm Call/Alduin's Stormcall = 1 person could solo Voldemort's entire army.

Call Dragon = Dragons are hard to deal with for Wizards, so Giants, Vampires and Werewolves have no chance, especially given how much stronger Skyrim style Dragons are.

Become Ethereal: Can't Touch this. Intangibility hax that Obito Uchiha would be proud of.

Fire Breath could (probably) destroy Horcruxes as I think it was mentioned that Dragon Fire could. (Easier to control than Fiendfyre which does the same or better, Control = more useful, see Crabbe in Book 7)

Animal Alleigance on Aragog/Hagrid's Spider Army during the Final Battle = Death Eaters get wrecked by a fucktonne of Gigantic Spiders.

Battle Fury: AoE Attack Speed Buff, would work on Spells if you can Silent/Chain Cast.

Disarm: AoE Expelliarmus.

Throw Voice: Good for pranks, or tricking the enemy into looking away whilst you shoot them in the back.

Spells outdo the rest, but I wouldn't underestimate the Thu'um. Slow Time alone would have meant Harry could have killed Voldemort again in the Graveyard in Fourth Year EASILY.

#+end_quote

Hardly better than a banishing charm.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah that's one of the good ones.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Maybe, really depends how it interacts with the horcrux as a soul anchor, they might resist it.

#+begin_quote
  Bend Will = Permanent Imperius with no mental drain on Dragons, which are hard as fuck for Wizards to deal with.
#+end_quote

Decent against dragons on the rare occasion you see one, but mostly just an imperius with a time limit.

#+begin_quote
  Whirlwind Sprint = Speedblitz Wizards casually.
#+end_quote

They can teleport, and in some rare cases fly, it's no big deal.

#+begin_quote
  Storm Call/Alduin's Stormcall = 1 person could solo Voldemort's entire army.
#+end_quote

It's really not that good, it's a thunderstorm with some lightning. It's also completely random and just as likely to hit your allies.

#+begin_quote
  Call Dragon = Dragons are hard to deal with for Wizards, so Giants, Vampires and Werewolves have no chance, especially given how much stronger Skyrim style Dragons are.
#+end_quote

That's not how it works. Call dragon is literally just shouting a dragon's name, Odahving comes because of curiosity the first time and because he agreed to. It won't magically summon a Skyrim dragon and since the Harry potter ones aren't even sapient you can't use it on them.

#+begin_quote
  Become Ethereal: Can't Touch this. Intangibility hax that Obito Uchiha would be proud of.
#+end_quote

Yeah that's handy (if nothing else you can leap off the astronomy tower and survive unharmed)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There's no mention of dragonfire working. I really doubt this would do it, it needs to put the object beyond repair, the special thing about fiendfyre is that it's cursed and you can't fix what it burns. Skyrim dragon breath seems no different to ordinary fire.

#+begin_quote
  Animal Alleigance on Aragog/Hagrid's Spider Army during the Final Battle = Death Eaters get wrecked by a fucktonne of Gigantic Spiders.
#+end_quote

I doubt it would work, they're spider shaped, but human intelligence, so it's likely be as useless as using it on a Kahjit.

#+begin_quote
  Battle Fury: AoE Attack Speed Buff, would work on Spells if you can Silent/Chain Cast.
#+end_quote

Doesn't buff cast times in the game, so this is debatable.

#+begin_quote
  Disarm: AoE Expelliarmus.
#+end_quote

Ok I guess. But that's not the best spell.

#+begin_quote
  Throw Voice: Good for pranks, or tricking the enemy into looking away whilst you shoot them in the back.
#+end_quote

Not likely to work unless they don't see you use it, in which case they're already not looking at you.

***** Harry facing down a whole lot of Death Eaters. Disarm, they're all Wandless, and outside of Dumbledore, Voldemort and a little bit Harry, no one is any good at Wandless magic (Harry did a Lumos whilst has wand was on the floor) so most Wizards instantly lose without Wands, outside of Animagi.

Throw voice would be good for breaking into places, making the guards go the wrong way. It's a Misdirection spell.

Alduin's Stormcall drops Meteors, and Wizards aren't dodging Lightning anyway save for a Lucky Apparate.

Whirlwind Sprint would work because Wizards have human reactions. You could dodge spells with it, or say "WULD" faster than someone could say Avada Kedavra, and knock them to the ground.

I thought only Aragog could talk and they listened to him because he was the biggest and strongest Spider, and he died in Book 6, so the Spiders might be tameable with Animal Alleigance.

Bend Will for the First Task of the Triwizard or on Norbert, or the Gringotts Dragons, you now have a Tame pet Dragon, that if you could attach a Portkey to, a weapon that terrifies Wizards.

Durnhevir might work if you somehow know the shout even if Odahviing wouldn't. (Our world/HP World could be a different plane to the one of Skyrim, but still connected to the Soul Cairne) as he's literally being pulled from the Soul Cairne. (That assumes it's a Crossover and not just "Generically X Character/Characters can shout, admittedly)

** So my thoughts after reading the comments would be:

Harry could have limited knowledge of the shouts i.e. only the first word. so if he is fighting something that is much faster than him he could slow the creature down to a manageable speed with that single word. in other words it would only slow something down that is immensly faster than he is.
