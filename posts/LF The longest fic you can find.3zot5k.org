**** You'd have to include the Star Wars (pre-Disney) and Star Trek universes among others. While I can't be 100% sure of an estimated number of words, I'd imagine that one or both would be larger than 25mb. In short, I'd say no, it doesn't really count. If it did, you could arbitrarily say any number of stories regardless of their relation were in the same universe.

** If a series counts, the main 5 stories in the Dangerverse add up to about 2m words. linkffn(living with danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

The R series by greengecko adds up to around 1.5m, though the third wasn't fully completed. linkffn(Resonance by greengecko)

If you only wanted an individual story, the longest single complete story I've read is linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie) coming in at almost 800k words.

(Generally I only check out completed works, so that's what I personally know of).

Edit: this seems to be the longest single, English, complete HP work on ao3: linkao3(Harry potter and the super bowl breach)

  Ever wonder what would happen if the Muggles found out about the Harry Potter world? If so, this is for you.In the movie version of Order of the Phoenix, Harry is filmed flying right next to a boat filled with Muggles when he is being escorted to 12 Grimmauld Place. Unknown to any of the wizards, an American soft drink company is filming a commercial for the 1996 Super Bowl from the boat at the time Harry is flying past. It's a pity the wizards never knew that Disillusionment Charms would not work against electronic video equipment.

** well, linkffn(Harry Potter The New Marauders) is 1,390,144 words, and it's a sequel to linkffn(Harry Potter Happily Ever After), so add another 287,402 words for the complete story. And as a bonus, absolutely nothing happens during the entire thing! It's just the world's longest ever slice of life story.

If we're allowed to leave the Harry Potter fandom, linkffn(MLP Loops) is 1,697,596 words. And there's also linkffn(The Wheel and the Butterfly A Dan X Pinkie Pie Saga) at 700,515 words.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/70312/Barb-LP][The Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] is over 1m words, plus another 200k for the prequel. It was one of the best things to come out of the three year summer but doesn't age very well. linkffn(288212).

linkffn(Brave New World by Bellerophon30) is 890k.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=20282][Serena SeaAngel]] has a series in progress over 1.5m on hpff. Never read it though.

linkffn(The Legacy by StorytellerSpW) is over 700k and still going. It's not very well paced though. Almost half of it probably could be shredded and it'd be a much better story.

The Story by Dad by Dad9 is at 960k, though hasn't updated since March. It's got a few interesting and funny buts but isn't really groundbreaking. linkffn(3302452)
