** I'm pickier than most; if I don't like the writing style, I'll stop reading halfway into the first chapter. If you're picky, you really just might run out of good fanfiction that meets your tastes. I ran out of books I liked at my library when I was younger until years later, when my tastes changed and more books got published. If you're up to it, read a different era/genre or fandom. Or PM the authors of fics you like and see what /they/ recommend. Recs from random people can be very, very broad. The most likely people to have your tastes are the authors writing the stories you like.

I also hope people are leaving reviews for the stories they like. When I stopped finding fics I liked, I started writing fic myself. Which isn't for everyone. But it changed the way I read. The effort that goes into a good story is insane. In 50k+ words, all the grammar mistakes you think won't happen, will happen. Tens of hours go into a chapter--which was easy before college and work sank my time, and I understand why fics get abandoned. The only way you foster better authors is by providing feedback, both critique and praise. Show them that readers are still here, that the community is still here, that you see promise in their story, because it can be one committed reader that inspires an author to keep going. Every time I look at my old writing, even writing I loved six months ago, I think /that reads like shit./ And I look at writing from four years back and I wonder how I got any readers at all. But there are people who have told me my fics are the best fics they've ever read, and that makes a huge difference even when I don't feel that way myself.

*** Back in my day (heh!) People practically lived with their betas! No story was published without a beta, and once you got a good one, you worked together for years. Dramione's SoftObsidian74 and TarnishedAngel were the best writer/beta team out there. A lot of those stories had several betas, one for plot, another for line edits, another for consistency and timing. These resources don't seem to exist anymore, and IMO, many newer writers weren't even around for that period so they don't get the importance. They just get out their story and call it good. This is totally fine for imagination, but the quality has just evolved. As with every fandom, there are writers, and then there are fans who write.

** As a fan fiction author that struggles with grammar errors I realize it can be frustrating. I am fortunate enough to have a beta to help me with my grammar errors, and even take time out of his day to teach me what it was I was doing wrong and why, but not all fanfic authors have that. There isn't a lot of betas that are reliable out there. Maybe instead of just becoming frustrated with authors you could privately message them that they need a beta, or offer them your services. Most of them want to improve, but they just don't know where to begin.

More importantly, a lot of writers don't even know they're making a mistake. The example you pointed out might be a general typo or something they just forgot. Yet, a lot of writers don't understand that they're doing something wrong in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  "Come on, Harry," Hermione jumped towards him.

That's a common mistake I see so many writers make, but if no one bothers to correct them, they're going to keep making it. I kept making an error and it took 500k words before anyone even bothered telling me I was doing it wrong the whole time. So, if you see something, leave a review. It doesn't have to be caustic or anything, but any little bit helps when they don't have a beta.

*** Hello. It's nice to see that you're active on reddit---I myself have finished your [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][tOBWL]] relatively recently!

#+end_quote

Hmm, I've provided 4 full-length feedbacks to stories so far (one of which being to tOBWL, BTW), and from the four authors only one bothered to respond to the rather lengthy listing of all the typos and errors found during the read-through (props to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3712368/Cauchy][Cauchy]] for being that one).

Since feedbacks themselves can take several hours to compose and gather into a single reply, I stopped bothering after that because I wasn't sure whether the authors even wanted the feedback or I just annoyed them by pointing out their mistakes. Now I only underline the mistakes in my locally stored copies just to ground my frustration (especially with “your\you're”-s and missing\wrong punctuation marks) and leave it at that.

*tl;dr* --- To author themselves: give feedback to feedbacks /+(WHOA!)+/ too, if you find them to be helpful for you.

**** Oh trust me, the authors see the reviews! If you left one on OBWL, I probably haven't responded because I've left the review responses alone since that was completed. It also pains me to look back and what rubbish that story was, but that's a whole other issue.

But I understand the frustration there. I can't speak for other author's, but I usually respond if there's corrective reviews on a WIP. For the completed stories, I usually wash my hands of it since I have little motivation to correct the mistakes I've made back in Chapter 1. Take solace in the fact that almost all authors will see that constructive review and try to incorporate the corrections in future works. I certainly do.

It would be nice if the authors had a good way of giving feedback. I read most of the reviews on my phone though and it's hard to give feedback on FF on the mobile.

Oh well, I guess the proper approach would be to inform the author about a list of highlighted mistakes in your possession and then compose a full “report” if the said author writes back telling that (s)he's interested. Keeping in touch with ~1k reviews per story can be rather time demanding after all, even (especially?) if they are spread out across time.

If it's just a couple of times, that's understandable, but if it happens within every quote, it's grating. I'm not a professional writer, but I remember learning that in the seventh grade.

Sometimes I will let it slide, especially if it only happens a few times per chapter, but if it happens all the time, that's a problem.

**** First of all, try to get your terms right: grammar is not the same as punctuation.

Secondly, punctuation is not universal. The rules for where you do or do not place commas around quotes is different from country to country. So maybe the authors aren't wrong but are simply using a different system than you are used to.

#+begin_quote
  "No, Ron!!!!!!!!"
#+end_quote

While not technically correct, this could be used as a tool to portray a sense of urgency and drama. The multiple exclamation points certainly give off a different vibe than a simple

I know that. No need to nitpick.

I know some punctuation is different, but even so, there are still obvious errors. (I know that some punctuation rules place the comma outside of quotes, for example, but I have not seen that often in fics.) Usually people will just use a period instead of a comma or not have a comma at all.

And I am less lenient with the multiple exclamation marks than I am with the commas. That really throws me off. I am more willing to forgive someone who uses a period instead of a comma in a certain spot before someone who uses too many exclamation points/question marks, etc.

The OP isn't in here attacking your taste in fanfiction, they are asking for recommendations after explaining their personal tastes. That doesn't make them a snob. If they were framing it like you, then maybe my opinion would change.

Saying you hate anyone who values something which you do not, which causes no harm to you, while telling them to go fuck themselves, makes you much worse than a snob.

** I wish I had read and replied to this sooner! First question, how long have you been into fan fiction? I'm only asking because I used to be the same way...

My OTP is and always will be Dramione. That's just where it's at, even still. But when I started, I had rules, restricting rules. Only novel-length, completed, excellent quality, no veela, no h/c, no 1st person, no present tense. No slash, no babies, no three ways with Ron, no Harry, and absolutely No K-T rated stuff--only M. I was picky, until I read about 30 fics in 2 months and pretty much ran out. This was in 2008. I started a blog, LovesDramione, and eventually I evolved out of my restrictions.

No more life story, but once I grew out of that, I became more open to different pairings, and dove into all the works by each author (which gets you lots of content if they're prolific), then LJ awards (which were big back then). I still can't read Ron, veela--ew, can barely stand Snape, and am to this day physically revolted by Harry/Ginny (never gonna happen).

I also can't read a fic that isn't well-written. I'll stop within the first few sentences if it looks like the person didn't even bother to put in effort or if the tone is off. But you probably already know to check the stats. How many reviews, faves, likes? How long is it? I can overlook a few grammar errors if the story is there, and the fan base is there. The entire crack genre would be off limits if I worried about sentence structure as tightly as I used to.

Where do you read? That first year, I was strictly AFF.net, which to is still an excellent resource for the deeper, riskier, gritty stuff. It's also a great archive where writers tested their stuff out first--sometimes stories never got put elsewhere. Things that were long deleted off FF.net and LJ are still on AFF, though it IS harder to sort through. I never got into the quidditch pitch, but HPF.net is also still hanging on, and their top lists were ace. A lot of the stories taken off of there were moved to Wattpad, like the Sirius/OC Match. God that fic is amazing, and it was my first Marauders read. Everyone should read that one, it's very sweet.--- Anywho, have you gone through the old awards lists? I have a few masterficlists that may have some fics from old LJ groups in them for you.

Also, I'm late to the party, but Archive of Our Own has been my newest savior. When I gave up on new DHr for a while years ago (I don't like H&V, and Granger Enchanted has always been heaps of complicated) I just read and re-read my old faves. Dabbled in other fandoms, fell in love with Lumione, and Harry /Luna. But there is really no shortage of fics, even when you feel you've seen them all.

I'll stop now, but I'll share one more thing. There was this one Lumione fic that, before it was put on FF.net, was in some random folder in some hidden LJ journal. That was SnapesDiary, and the fic is Lucius' Bookshelves. I couldn't have found that at the time without having the link, I somehow stumbled across it years ago, and read it on my BlackBerry. Keep stumbling!

When you really love fan fiction, the rush it gives, the freedom, the joy at finding "just the right one," the grammar snob in you will back down. There are some seriously amazing works out there that are unbetaed and full of errors. Just gotta see past it.

I guess I felt like since the series was over, I didn't want it to end, so I turned to fanfiction more. But I remember loving Malindaleo (sp) way back in the day. I was hooked on the Power of Emotion, Curse of the Damned, and The Seventh Horcrux. It's a little weird reading them now, considering I know how the series ends, but it's pretty easy to suspend disbelief at this point.

I don't want to waste time reading a poor quality fic or sifting through a bunch of new fics of unknown quality, so I'm relying on numbers to help narrow my search down. And it works really well. I don't typically take many chances on brand new fics because I'd rather focus my reading time on stories that seem to have done well with other readers.

Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if anyone is interested. I know most prefer to find completed fics, I know I do!! =) I will add more and links when I get to work!! All of these can be found on Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com.

***** I'd love some In-Progress ones if you have them! I'm not really into BDSM, but I won't write it off entirely. :) Thanks loads for these!

****** Hi! Just wanted to say [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/623639/chapters/1125898][Divinity]] is definitely very dark, heavy hurt-comfort leanings, set in post-war/7th year and plays on the marriage law trope... so basically what I'm trying to say is it's not everyone's thing, and trigger warning, definitely, for some content.

However, it's also one of my personal favourites, well-written imo, and I like to think the characters are quite believably written too (No less believable than any other HP/SS pairing) - so would like to recommend it for those who are into the angstier sort of thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing The Sun]] isn't in-progress but it is massive and excellent - again, some angst in there but unlike Divinity, there's a clear romance... and /ahem/ bedroom life at times, though it's not quick to show by any means, nor is it forced.

I wanted to avoid saying this because I didn't want to take the wind out of your sails, but I'm not really an HR/SS shipper. :/ I just can't read it and believe it, knowing how Snape is in canon... :( But I will definitely give Chasing the Sun a try! I love Harry/Ginny, assuming that's what it is? And angst is fine. I love Angst/Drama, to be honest!

*edit*: Okay, I take that back. :/ I didn't know it was Hermione/Snape, though I should have recognized it based on your otehr recs. I might give it a shot.

******** Ah, sorry. Don't worry! And I meant HR (HR = Hermione, right) not HP - sorry, was typing quickly :P

Not liking a particular ship is fine by me, everyone has different tastes :) It's fine if you don't like them, just wanted to add a couple more.

I am not the user who posted a huuuuuuge list of fanfics, btw, I am merely a meagre clinger-on-er adding a few to the list.

By the way, can you ever ship Harry/Draco? They're not really my sort of thing usually, but I don't hate them and there's a very angsty and dark fic (with happy ending) called The Unbearable Burden of Caring on Archive of Our Own... if that sounds like your sort of thing. If not, ignore. :)

********* I will read Harry/Draco if it's good, but I don't seek it out. I will check that out, though!

** I've been there. in 2005 I had had enough fanfiction and went on a break from HP fandom. But I enjoyed it too much to go for very long, so I switched pairings. Went from 100% Harry/Draco to Harry/Snape. And that change of pace brought me so many new fics to read. The same things that annoyed the crap out of me about HD fics didn't seem to bother me as much with the Snarry.

I've noticed that once I start feeling like I have trouble finding a 'good' fic(and I think I have high standards), then I take a break. Maybe switch to a different pairing or a different fandom entirely. HD is my absolute OTP, but I switch between it when I get bored.

Also, what's helped in the past has been finding someone who does reviews and likes similar things to you. I used to have people that I'd see recommend great stories that I loved. So I'd stalk their reviews and get reading material that way.

*** Good point! Yeah, I've been flip-flopping between H/HR and H/G because I really haven't read a lot of H/HR.

** I agree completely, I can enjoy stories that clearly don't have a beta and has some mistakes/flaws, but if the author doesn't have a certain grasp of the English language (my barometer is like American High School freshman English level) nope, can't do it.

I think a fair amount of it is to me, if they can't master basics of writing then I don't have any faith they can write a plot that could hold my interest.
