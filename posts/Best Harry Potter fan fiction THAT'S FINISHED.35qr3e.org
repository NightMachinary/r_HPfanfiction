**** Yeah. But then when you get to find out all of Harry's future memories, especially the last part before the time jump... it opens a whole new understanding to what emotional place he was starting with from from the start.

***** Oh, I totally agree. Just to me, what the author has labeled as the epilogue fits in more as a final chapter and I would've liked a comprehensive epilogue that shows what the world is like after. The author's note at the end explains that the author had no interest in doing so, which is totally fair, but I wanted it.

** There are others that have been mentioned, so I'll just name those that haven't, and that spring immediately to mind. I've left out oneshots, because I doubt you're interested.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Dissapearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] - simply beautiful elegance in scope of storytelling. All-but perfectly canon-compliant, and one of my favorite fics of all
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity is probably the best next-generation fic around. His Alexandra Quick series is not complete, but individual years are, and some of them (specifically the second one) are good enough to warrant a mention regardless
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by EmeraldAshes - for humor/crack
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure - Delightful worldbuilding, very canon-compliant, but suffers from the flaws of a realistic First-Year fic
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] by Sesc is a great thriller/crime noir novel.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] by MasterSlytherin is also amazing, with a great twist.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella is a canon-perspective story of what went on in Riddle's Diary, and a great thriller

I'll also second Renegade Cause, The Unforgiving Minute and The Skitterleap

There's always more, but that's what comes to mind.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer after the War]] and it sequel [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters after the War]] - These fics are novel-length, canon-compliant pairing-wise, kind of cliché in that Harry and Ron are Aurors fighting evil, but have good characterization, a good mystery plot, and some great OCs. The first fics I read and some of the best.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/288347?view_full_work=true][The Rewards of Perseverance]] AU where Voldemort wins, absolutely devastating. Has a sequel as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] - Freaking hilarious, Harry is the laziest bastard to ever come to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] - Sirius breaks out earlier than expected and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. Has one complete novel-length sequel and a third in progress, but even just Innocent by itself is excellent. & FWIW, the WIP is updating currently and regularly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7008836/1/For-Love-of-Family][For Love of Family]] - A somewhat sappy fic where an adult Harry becomes disabled, canon-compliant, has a great mystery subplot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] - Year 7 from the perspective of Hogwarts, mainly Neville. Will rip your heart out, put it back, rinse and repeat. Like Innocent, has one complete novel-length sequel which is...a bit strange, but good, and an incomplete third, but in this case I think the threequel is abandoned. But feel free to skip the sequels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] - AU I guess? Set about a generation after the books in the United States. Has a very well-developed canon and magical culture, and a scrappy protagonist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]] is an epic at 95 chapters, and worth every minute you spend on it. The author, Little0bird, also has a lot of one-shots, small vignettes, and short stories that fit into the same universe as the main deal. My favourite of these being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3957753/1/Firewhisky-Advice][Firewhisky Advice]]

On that note I would look at both the silliest ways voldemort dies thread from a few days ago as well as the funny stories with plot from a few days ago. Both are great resources that are fairly up to date.

** Hmm... an interesting question. While there are plenty of good finished fics that I like, all my favourite fics are WIP/abandoned.

Summary: After Sirius's death, Harry devotes himself to learning magic in a desperate attempt to protect the people he loves. Warnings: Profanity, Extreme Violence, References to Non-Con -Not of Main Character-, Dark/Questionable Harry

/A massively underrated fic. Features lots of magical theory, a talented Harry and a fine depiction of magical guerrilla warfare. I think the reason why it's relatively unknown is the slow, and quite angsty start. But once it pulls through the first arc, the fic really comes into its own. Unfortunately the ending was rather abrupt -- it felt like the author closed things prematurely in lieu of abandoning the fic -- but it isn't a deal-breaker./

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is hard to describe. It is finished and it does set up an almost immediately abandoned sequel. It does stand on its own, however. It's not always brilliantly written, but the story and the characters are excellent. It's finished for me, because I imagine the last 500 words differently.

It's also an almost singularly unpleasant story at times, only equaled by [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]]. That one is complete, really good, frequently rage inducing, because it makes you care about the characters so much.

Both of those stories are Harry/Hermione.

There are some really amazing stories from the LEGACIES series by The Dark Lord Nedved, too the author madscientist's books.

Unsung hero has always been my personal favorite though. Up to the ending i would have paid MeghanReviews. I honestly got choked up with emotion reading it for the first time all those years ago and it was an absolute pleasure with my only regret being i'll never be able to read it for the first time again. I'm yet to find a story as good with Harry/Hermione as the main couple.

I also would have ended the story differently but honestly its an extremely sad tale in my eyes worthy of being mentioned in this thread.

** [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], hands down. It's described as "literally life-changing" over and over again for a reason: /it improves its readers' thinking/ (on purpose, no less) while still being fun to read. It's also epic-length (just over 660k words written over the course of 5 years) and has novel-length completed fanfics of its own, so there's plenty there to read.

Don't let the quality of the first few chapters or the fact that Harry doesn't act like a normal eleven-year-old deter you; the writing improves after the first few chapters and this Harry's not supposed to be a normal child (more like a partly-adult mind in a child's body, really). So take the author's advice (from the note at the start of Chapter 1):

#+begin_quote
  This fic is widely considered to have really hit its stride starting at around Chapter 5. If you still don't like it after Chapter 10, give up.
#+end_quote

Those first 10 chapters are relatively short (covering just up to and including Harry's Sorting) and well worth it to try out the fic. Just don't pick it up too close to when you plan to go to bed, or you might keep yourself up late reading.

That's a strong statement. I couldn't get past the incongruity of McGonagall - an inhabitant of an insular magical world - being able to provide a random word in Hebrew for Harry while they were in Diagon Alley.

**** that was what did it? an 80 year old witch knowing some hebrew? out of left field, sure, but not a stretch really. dumbledore in canon knows some hundreds of language or whatever it is. don't see why mcgonagall should be stuck with english. especially as most everyone in the story has some sort of intelligence bump.

anyway, i'm not sure what "that's a strong statement" means in this instance, but i'll corroborate the above as an anonymous second opinion -- hpmor certainly has impacted my thinking patterns, and i had fun reading it. it changed my life in a relatively major way.

***** The [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/dumbledore.html#Skills][HP Lexicon]] indicates that AD spoke Mermish and understood Parseltongue and Gobbledegook. Being an inhabitant of the magical world, we can also infer that he's familiar with Latin. Anything else is strictly fanon.

YMMV, but for me it was so incongruous that I stopped reading. Many other people enjoy it and I'm happy for them.

****** interesting -- is there not a line in canon about how many languages he speaks? I think there is, but I think it might also be hyperbole/exaggeration from Harry or Hermione

The other point is that, obviously, Dumbledore displays knowledge of the languages the plot requires him to, and there's no limiting factor. But yeah

In any case, definitely. Each his own

  That's a strong statement.

  This content was not only impressive from the perspective of an engaging story, but it taught me real, applicable things, and made my mind move in ways it hadn't before. ....

  “HPMOR changed my life” may sound like an overstatement. In my case, however, it's only the truth: HPMOR changed my outlook on life, my dreams and my future career.

***** Sure. Old Germanic languages that predate Hebrew. If the magical world is so curiously obsessed with Latin, then why would McGonagall spend time learning a language that has nothing to do with Western culture?

If she had supplied a word in Old Welsh or Common Brittonic, I might have continued to read. If EY failed such a common sense test of logic, I thought it would be unlikely for him to get much else right in the story.

******* No. My thinking reflects the fact that they probably weren't given the opportunity to contribute due to a few laws in England's past.

I know about JKR's recent tweets concerning Anthony Goldstein.

Given that the language spoken by Myrddin Wyllt's people in the sixth century was Common Brittonic, that would have been a much more logical choice.

*** Yes, yes, yes. For all the hate it gets on this subreddit, HpMoR is probably the single best fanfiction out there. It's fun to read, it is written well, but most importantly - it is educational. You learn something from it. You feel like you gained something. Its a fantastic piece of writing, truly.

***** You could call it platonic Harry/Hermione with the potential for more later, since they do become close friends, but seeing as the entire fic takes place in their first year there's not much in the way of romance.

** I just finished reading this one this morning: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/811088/1/Not-Myself][Not Myself]].

AU started a year before OoTP was published.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard...
#+end_quote

~350k words if you remove author responses. Linked novel follows all seven years of Hogwarts, and there are four short sequels.

It's got some minor grammar/spelling problems throughout, but nothing that breaks the story. Handful of original characters, and some characters are quite OOC because of a different (explained) character background.

I really enjoyed it, and with how old the story is, it's really easy for me to not be annoyed by things that may be overused these days.
