** FFN is severely understaffed. A story could go years before it gets taken down, even in a popular fandom like HP. They're more likely to do it in waves, rather than case-by-case.

** A few days ago, I posted a one shot that contained a lot of dark themes and two minimally descriptive sexual scenes.

A few hours after posting it, I got a PM from a reader saying that the story might be deleted by the FFN mods if they ever came across it, despite me rating the story as M and writing warnings in the Summary.

I've heard of stories being deleted from the Harry Potter fandom by the mods before, and I'm really wondering, as of 2016, does FFN actually censor its authors and delete their stories?

*** Only when prodded by other users. If they don't receive a bunch of reports on a story, it probably goes uninvestigated. When there are multiple complaints, they take action.

That said, if you're posting controversial stuff it would be sensible to post it on Ao3 as well, possibly a few other sites just to make sure you're covered.

***** A lot of people like FFN over AO3, but [[/u/wordhammer]] is correct. AO3 is definitely where you want to be at if you're writing anything risque. I went into it in depth a while back with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4wim1c/readers_which_do_you_prefer_ffnet_or_ao3/d67eyar?st=isarlewn&sh=81d13833][this comment]] for why I chose AO3 over FFN for my smutty short stories.

****** Smut isn't what I'm worried about. Its the dark themes like violence and abuse that perforates the story.

Anyways. I cleaned the story up and reposted it.

Is there any way I could convince you to take a quick look at it to see if its okay to stay on FFN? Its oretty short. Not asking for reviews or anything, just help with the rating. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118000/1/Wither][Here]] it is, if you won't mind doing so.

******* I wouldn't be too worried about dark themes getting your story canned on FFN. I'm currently reading a story where Harry and Tom Riddle kill and consume some Norwegian army deserters during WWII and no one's batted an eye about it.

Unfortunately it's incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2013. It's a good read though, and the author says she hasn't abandoned it. And it's quite long despite being incomplete, which is nice.

Definitely dark af, though.

But with FFN there's no telling, honestly.

****** I don't get why. I once heard from a friend that FFN was labeled as "The Pit", because it was filled to the brim with badfic. I figured when AO3 came along, it would usurp the throne.

I only really ever used FFN because it integrated with OpenOffice back in the day.

*** For reference, FFN specifically says NOT to post smut or anything explicitly sexual on the site. People do it anyway of course, but FFN has in the past done site-wide mass deletions of stories that broke the guideline. I personally try to not toe the line, but there are also plenty of stories that have explicit sex and manage to stay under the radar of the mods.

The M rating does not really count for much; if you look through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][the guidelines]] it says that M is for; Fiction M can contain adult language, themes and suggestions. Detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature is considered Fiction MA.

However, the site does not allow a story to be flagged as MA, which means you cannot accurately mark a story containing explicit sex or dark themes, meaning you technically should not post it, as you cannot follow the sites guidelines and terms of service when doing so. This means FFN does have the right to rip your story down if they find it. They don't do it often, but it does happen.

Basically the risk of it happening is small, but it is there, and it's up to you if you think its negligible enough to not worry about. Maybe backup the story somewhere else or post a less explicit version to FFN and the full version elsewhere.

*** I believe it relies on reports from other users and how effectively the site admin acts on those reports, I don't know. If you are confident that your story doesn't break the rules, then you probably don't have anything to worry about, but you should always keep a backup in case (says the person whose own backup is a very old draft). There are so many stories there that openly flout the rules and have been there for years, that I rather doubt they act very often. But it's best not to take anything for granted, and there are users who seem to make it their sole purpose in life to look for things to report.

Edit; if it's the 'Wither' story, I can see nothing whatsoever in that to worry about. I think you've picked up one of the self-appointed vigilantes. Ignore them.

*** I know smut is not (officially) allowed on FFN, but I haven't heard of any stories being deleted because of dark themes or graphic violence. It's hard to say without having read your story, but from what you've said I'd guess you shouldn't worry about it being removed.

** They do have rules against MA material, but realistically you probably don't have to worry about it. The people that run the site obviously don't give that much of a shit. Unless a bunch of users report you, you'll be fine. Though, I would definitely suggest keeping a coy yourself or posting to a different site as well. Better safe than sorry.
