Harry, Narcissa, Hermione, and others are discussing a trip to Europe and Narcissa mentions that she wants to see Thermopylae. Sirius calls her out basically saying nobody could actually hate muggles and understand the significance. Narcissa replies saying she didn't have anything else to do while stuck in the manor so she read history. Not being able to remember which story it's from is driving me crazy. Thanks in advance.


** I believe its from Perfect Slytherins: Tales from the fourth year by Jeconais. They go horcrux hunting in Greece fairly early on from memory.

** Hmm. That sounds incredibly familiar but I'm not sure either. I'll try to hunt it down but I doubt I'll find it.
