As far as I can remember, Harry time traveled back to when his parents were in school. He was hired on as a professor at Hogwarts and maintained close relationships with his parents. Lily looked up to him and he helped James and Sirius stop being bullies. I believe I recall a scene where Harry had Sirius (and maybe Snape too) in detention where he tried to give him some advice. I think that in this fic, Harry was working against Voldemort (someone may have attempted to recruit Harry).

Any help finding this story would be much appreciated.


** Was Harry friends with Bellatrix in the fic you're thinking of? A lot of that sounds like Delenda Est. linkffn(5511855)
