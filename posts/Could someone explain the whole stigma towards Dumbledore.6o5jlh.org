In fanfics, there's the trope, something that most people, if not everyone, has seen before. He's completely and utterly evil, a manipulative bloody bastard, out to get what he wants and will do everything to fulfil a prophecy or to satiate his own greed. He controls Voldemort, the government, is evil, etc. I can't say that I haven't read a good fic or two where he's evil, but why do people take him to the extreme? I understand why people dislike him what with the fact that he condemned Harry to the Dursleys and that he can be really shady/suspicious. But why do people want to make a guy, who is rather good overall, completely and utterly evil, writing him so that horns are growing out of his head, he's drinking children's blood for fun, and he's sacrificing virgins every fortnight under the gibbous moon because he believes it'll fulfil the prophecy?


** I think it's a lot of fans thought of him as this paragon if goodness in the series, sort of like Harry did, and then when it turned out he wasn't perfect, they felt betrayed, like Harry did at first. The difference is these "fans" can't seem to get over it and started writing fanfiction where all they do is exaggerate his bad traits. These same people often can't seen to realize that things aren't just black and white and there shades of grey instead.

Dumbledore made a lot of mistakes in his life but he was not evil. He never set out wanting cause Harry or anyone for that matter, harm. He cared deeply for society as a whole. Yes he was manipulative. Yes he liked to keep secrets to himself. Yes he did cause Harry pain by mistakes he made but in the end he worked tirelessly to save society as a whole and even found a possible way for Harry to survive when all hope seemed lost.

*** Well said as well. After all, many of these mistakes were made with the idea of attempting to keep Magical Britain safe fro a deranged terrorist. Many of these choices were difficult, weren't they? But they, I guess, were also necessary. He's a good man who made some questionable choices with a noble cause. That raises the question, one that you don't have to answer because free will. Does the end justify the means?

*** That may be true, but I promise, some of us have been questioning Dumbledore's goodness right from the moment that he decided to put a sleeping baby on a doorstep with a note, at the beginning of November, and just walk off and leave him there. Some of us have always thought that he should have stayed and done the handover in person, and that a /good/ person would not do as he did.

I don't argue that this is incompatible with his being a very good person with very severe flaws, but it is an in-canon action that needs no reinterpretation to make someone think that if he's evil, rather than merely utterly blind to basic humanity and child welfare, it might be an interesting direction to write in and, for some of us, rather easier than trying to justify his actions.

**** I understand that argument. It is a very questionable decision but I think was done by JK as a stylist choice. I think it was supposed to be a reflection of fairytails and other folklore where babies were delivered to the front step. Its like the whole myth about babies being delivered to the front door by storks. That's the impression I got out of it. In a way I think it was chosen to reaffirm the idea that his Aunt and Uncle didn't choose to take him in.

I'm not defending Dumbledore's action here either, but you have to think of this from a wizarding angle too. It may not be as big a deal to them in this situation. He could put protections around Harry so he'd be fine until his relatives found him. Charms to keep him warm, etc... Like I said I'm not defending what Dumbledore did, but I try to remember that the wizarding world is essentially a different culture with different morals and POV based on the ability to use magic.

*** Can't let go? That guy stashes Harry away from his world (protection is a crappy reason, a fidelius (as long as there's no traitor and it's not like Dumbledore himself can't be Harry's secret-keeper!) is just as good as that blood-protection for most things and without any love lost between Petunia and Harry it's probably a wounder the blood protection even worked after all those years (magic in HP is based on INTENT after all and Petunia didn't intend to keep Harry save and Harry didn't really think much of her either, hell he didn't consider Number 4 his home either - no! Hogwarts was his home!)), keeps him ignorant and doesn't even check up on him (why wasn't child-services (wizard equivalent of course!) involved? Who gave that old geezer the right to just do this?)...so he kind of IS a manipulative old goat!

He might not be a dark lord (that's debatable, he is still kind of hung up on his "for the greater good" philosophy, even if he doesn't use Grindelwald's or Voldemort's methods to achieve his ends anymore after Ariana died in that three way duel!), but he's still a chess master who isn't above sacrificing his pieces (Harry for example...he never even tried to remove the horcrux, no he set Harry up (in a convoluted plan that could have backfired, which would have ended Harry's life for good!) to die and he wasn't that remorseful IMHO! It also looks like he never actively tried to kill Voldemort (sure it would have only lead to the guy returning as a spirit, but that would have delayed his plans for conquest enough so that they would have had time to deal with his soul-jars!))

Yes he did set out to cause Harry pain (dying isn't painless in most cases and Voldemort loves to torture his victims, so sending him to fight Voldemort he caused Harry pain!), he might not have enjoyed doing it, but he wasn't all torn up about it either!

So all his mistakes and the decisions that compounded those mistakes should be forgiven because he cared for society and didn't mean it?

The whole problem with Dumbledore is comes down to a relative moral debate. "Do the ends justify the means and do these specific ends justify these means?" That's for the audience to decide for themselves.

Personally, I don't think Dumbledore is Evil, but neither would I listen to his plans after knowing what he did in canon. He's seen as infallible by the good characters and ends up sending them through the meat grinder.

**** Oh I'm not saying he should automatically be forgiven. I just don't think he is evil. If you disagree with his actions, that's fine, but I just want those people to at least acknowledge that he had good intentions. It only bugs me when I see people going on about how Dumbledore is "pure evil" and that he orchestrated all these events in Harry's life because he wanted to see him suffer or some other BS like that. He may have orchestrated some of the bad things in Harry's life but it wasn't because he got his kicks from it, it was a tough decision he made because he thought it was the only way. Whether it's true or not that it was the only way is up for debate but that's not what I'm talking about.

I know some people like to write Evil!Dumbledore in fanficiton, and thats fine. Fanfiction is in it's essence an AU where you can do whatever you want. Even I, who is usually a fan of Dumbledore, have read and been amused by Evil!Dumbledore stories, but it's when some "fans" than insist that those kind of ridiculous interpretations are actually reflections of his canon personality, that's what annoys me.

** For me, it's that coming up with a justification for every decision he is seen to make in canon is very, very easy if you assume he's evil. You can also assume that he's stupid, senile, or good. For many of us, assuming that he is good /and/ wise tends to lead to having to scrape up some information from somewhere that didn't come up in canon, to justify several decisions made in the books.

Of course, many find the in-canon justifications to be ample in themselves, and find writing a good Dumbledore easy. For those of us who vehemently disagree with his in-canon reasoning, however, we are left with a range of responses, from adding in extra non-canon information that resolves the conflict with our own moralities, to deciding it was all a super-genius but utterly evil plan.

The whole 'we are betrayed because Dumbledore wasn't perfect and therefore we will exaggerate his evil' does /not/ cover all of us. Many of us we banging our heads on the desk long before the whole revelation of his past in the later books.

Examples of decisions that lead to conflict with reader morality:

Leaving Harry with the Dursleys for ten years, with a spy in place, and never acting to rein in the child abuse. What Harry went through /in canon/ is considered severe child abuse and/or neglect in many countries, very much so in the UK. The difference in clothing, treatment, accomodation between Harry and Dudley would raise questions in all reasonable adults here. In the UK specificially, keeping a child downstairs at all, let alone in a cupboard, is completely illegal. Was Dumbledore right? Misinformed? Neglectful? Utterly callous? All of these are possible interpretations of the situation /as presented/. There needs be no beating by adults nor prolonged starvation prior to Harry's first year at Hogwarts, for him to be a very severely abused and neglected child, by UK moral standards. 'Dumbledore is evil' needs no extra justification in a fanfiction. 'Dumbledore is good' may take some explaining.

Being the Chief Wizengamot and never bringing Sirius Black to legal trial. This can easily explained away by adding non-canon information. It can also be accepted that there's something we don't know. The in-canon explanation may be sufficient. Or we can come up with justifications that explain the circumstances without adding non-canon information, but don't fit Dumbledore being a good person.For example, it is plausible than an evil Dumbledore would have wanted Harry's godfather out of the way in order to keep Harry isolated. Back before the last two books came out, this very circumstance was avidly discussed. It doesn't need knowledge that Harry had to be willing to suicide himself, to wonder /why/ Dumbledore didn't step in to save Black by using his political power.

There are many, many other points in canon that lead to speculation of this sort, including Dumbledore's conduct as a headmaster in every book right from the first. And in all explorations, 'Dumbledore is evil' offers itself as a nice, tempting, easy write. Some of us find 'Dumbledore is good, but flawed' rather more difficult, right from the very first book. We don't feel betrayed; we've always disagreed with Harry's interpretation of Dumbledore as a good, wise man.

*** I like the last sentence as it creates so many questions for us to ask. These points make sense and Harry's sentence is not only questionable but downright wretched.

So, to paraphrase, Dumbledore has made so many choices that show he's flawed and the readers don't like the fact that he's being shown as this heavenly angel coming from a rainbow being excreted by a Unicorn. They've drawn their own parallels, come to their own conclusions, and don't like Harry's portrayal of the man.

A completely 'good' or 'bad' representation of Dumbledore is the 'easy' way to approach the man when writing, but a flawed man is harder yet more realistic.

People tend to portray him as one or the other because of the fact that they simply look at evidence supporting their side but are unwilling to merge the evidence to create this man who is flawed.

Did I get it right? Also, the words in quotes or apostrophes are subjective.

** I can't speak for the over exaggerations of evil, but in actual canon, he left Harry in an extremely abusive situation. Even if he didn't know anything about how he was treat from the moment he left Harry on the doorstep to when he came to Hogwarts at 11, there was no skirting around the fact after he came to Hogwarts and it became very apparent abuse happened.

There is never a good reason to leave a child in an abusive home. Ever. I wouldn't exactly call that evil, but it is not "mostly good". It's a horrible thing, justified with the "greater good" even if he never actually said the words.

If you want to ignore the abusive home thing, in canon, the reason he turned down the position of Minister of Magic is because he had a strong desire for power and he knew it wouldn't be positive. His willpower to stay away from real power also fails in canon when he put on the Gaunt Ring, putting his life in danger. While most of the time Evil!Dumbledore is usually written poorly, but I can see how a writer would try to focus on things like his lust for power and the failings in his willpower.

*** So, one major reason that this is the case is that the series suffers from a drastic genre shift after the third book.

The whole "left on a doorstep in November" and "baited challenges solved by three first years" things (amont others) are totally reasonable in the context of a fairy tale-esque story, which is what the first book aims for. However, it's when the tone shifts in the later book to more serious young adult fiction that those earlier actions end up at odds with the bigger emphasis on consistency and characterization.

Sure, at the end of the day, the Watsonian reasons don't matter, but I think it helps to realize why certain things are as they are.

**** Sirius didn't get a trial...I think. So that was something that would've prevented any of his rights being taken from him. Especially because they wanted to do it quickly and illegally because corruption, so such an event would be dealt hastily I guess.

To be honest, if Dukbeldoe hadn't told Hagrid to take Harry away, then Sirius would probably be free. As for the abusive home thing, I personally like to say /no/ because a child is being traumatized for the entirety of his childhood, affecting his personality, ideals, etc. The effects were downplayed in a book intended for children, but still. It was a hard decision made with good intentions, but it's still deplorable. If Harry were to go to his next kin then he could be taken in by the Malfoys or the Tonks because I doubt a pureblood run government would want to send their children to the filthy Muggles.

It was his responsibility because he not only knew Harry was the key to killing the Dark Lord (yes, I'm showing my master respect), but he was responsible for Harry's upbringing with the Dursleys. What if the frying pan connected in book two? He'd be dead. The Ministey doesn't even /know/ about Harry and the Dursleys.

He did set Mrs Figg there to watch him but as we know the Dursleys were sure to give off a good front in front of the neighbours.

****** If you go simply by the books, nothing is stated at all except that Sirius is his godfather and that Harry inherited from him.\\
If you accept the films as canon, there are Dorea Black and Charlus Potter in the Black family tree, which make it tempting to cast those as James' parents.

If you accept Pottermore, his parents are stated to be Euphemia and Fleamont and Charlus Potter/Dorea Black are apparently not related to him at all.

They are also on Rowling drawn version of the tree. But if they were supposed to be Harry's grandparents then Sirius would mention this and they would be blasted off for helping him.

******** True on the drawn version, that's why I personally accept a lot of film canon in addition to the books as it was based on JKR's material and does not conflict with it.

**** Dumbledore ignores any laws he wants. James and Lily made it clear that Harry should go to Sirius, and if he couldn't take him Remus (and then Peter, but he was just as unable to take him as Sirius was). Remus never got the chance to take care of Harry. Dumbledore made the executive decision to send Harry to the Dursleys. On top of that, laws or not, abuse is abuse.

Also, even with the allowance I made in my original post about the time between infancy to 11, when Harry went off to Hogwarts, he still purposely had Mrs. Fig keeping an eye on him. She would tell him the absolute truth that the Dursleys mistreated him. But, ignoring that, once Harry became a student at Hogwarts, as a Headmaster, Dumbledore is responsible for him in a number of ways. There's no way that he didn't know about the abuse then and elected to continue sending him back to his abusive guardians.

***** Yes Harry was supposed to go to Sirius in the event of his death but where was it ever stated that he as supposed to go to Remus and then Peter after. That was never stated in canon and is more of a common fanfiction trope than anything.

The Dursleys were paranoid about appearing normal to their neighbours. How would Ms Figg really know if he was abused or not. From what we can tell he was not regularly physically abused as to where it would leave visible marks.

Harry never spoke about his relatives to really anyone. How would Dumbledore know to want extent they went with him. He already knew they would be overly loving but without the blood wards Dumbledore thought Harry would most likely be murdered. I'm not saying Dumbledore made the right choice here but I don't think it's as black and white as it may seem.

*** Well said. I'm not downplaying nor ignoring the fact that he sent a child to be systematically abused ("systematically" could be debated but it sounds more sirius), but yeah, I guess that's one of the reasons why. Thanks!

** Basically he's a person in a position of power - multiple ones, even - and yet he seems to be nigh completely ineffective. A school's first responsibility is the safety of its students. This was disregarded multiple times. A government's first responsibility is to the people. Dumbledore was seemingly ineffective in his capacity as Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump, both in keeping Death Eaters imprisoned and the otherwise terrible state of post-Voldemort Britain. Finally, a person's first responsibility is toward those in their care. While it was not completely unreasonable for Dumbledore to think that Harry would be treated well by and Aunt and Uncle /who were forced, without their consent,/ into raising him, it was disgustingly irresponsible to not do follow up visits to ensure that he was, in fact, being treated well. Thinking it would be enough to have Arabella Figg watching from afar is incredibly naive, because neighbors see exactly jack shit of what goes on inside a household. And let's not even get into his habit of holding his cards close to his chest all the time.

Basically, Dumbledore tried and failed to juggle a dozen balls, and they all came crashing down all at once. He overextended himself, tried to be the Duct Tape holding Wizarding Britain together and ended up just being Scotch* Tape that fell apart as soon as force was applied.

Hanlon's Razor states "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity", but people don't think stupidity is very compelling when it comes to plot.

*** To be fair, the only two prisoners that got out under Dumbeldore's tenure asSupreme Mugwump were Barty Jr. and Sirius Black--and both were rather exceptional.

Dumbledore had been sacked from that position by Fudge some six months previously before the mass break-out.

** While I agree with you, the idea doesn't come out of thin air.

Remember, Dumbledore's original plan was /not/ to have Harry survive.

He was to be protected and groomed, and led to the slaughter so that he and Voldemort could kill each other.

*** I believe that he had suspiscions from the very beginning that there was a connection between him and the Dark Lord. If he just popped in and stated things about Horcruxes, it would seem foolish that Dumbledore didn't have his suspicions. He wasn't necessarily protected nor groomed, and, according to Dumbledore's shaky word, the only way for him to get rid of the Horcrux was for Harry to die. Perhaps Dumbledore could've done that himself, but he had the incident with Ariana and Grindelwald...
