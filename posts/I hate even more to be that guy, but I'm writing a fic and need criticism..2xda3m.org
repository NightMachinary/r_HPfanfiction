Yeah, it could really use some improvement... I'm not a great (or even good) writer so I'd gladly appreciate some advice from you all.... Please! :D

Thank you all!


** I really enjoyed it. I don't really read many hp/GoT crossovers, but the speech seems too modern.

I would suggest that you look in the GoT books, and try and mimic the language used by characters in there.

** I'm kind of confused, honestly. I'm not sure if it's because I left off GoT after season 2, but I have no idea where we're supposed to be, or who's who. Why do we know Harry to begin with? Who is Harry? I'm assuming Potter, but he could just as easily be a minor character from GoT.

If you added a sentence or two at the beginning, just describing the room, or at least the meeting, that would really help. You could even use the councilor dude as a mouth piece, i.e., "may the meeting of the blank about the blank commence," or whatever. A bit clarifying why we care what gods Harry follows would also be helpful.

whether you want to write clearly from Harry's POV, it would probably be best to find a way to introduce him, rather than giving one of the two dudes a name right off the bat. Whether you introduce them both by one physical trait, like glasses, hair colour, height, dress sense, or general presence, you could always pan from Harry giving the introduction of the room to the further perspective of the two men exchanging glances.

or something. sorry for going off like that, but you asked for advice, and I figured I'd just throw that in there.

The general concept is pretty cool, and the pacing is good. I certainly haven't read this particular combination before, which is pretty rare, and also pretty awesome. I liked it! :)

*** Fwoof, thank you! I'll revise the first chapter and try to show who Harry is at the beginning and all that juicy stuff :D

Maesters don't really come into play that much in the TV series until season 4 and (probably) 5 :p they're in the Citadel, the home of the Maesters, a supposed elite order of scholars.

** Okay, a few things: the series is called "a Song of Ice and Fire", not "Game of Thrones". GoT is merely the first book.

Now, I've never read "a Song of Ice and Fire" so I can't say too much about the specific content.

But a few pointers in general:

- How did Harry (I assume Potter?) end up in this universe? This is a really really big question that needs an answer ASAP. I will forgive the prologue, but it really should have a proper answer in chapter 1.

- In the same vein: what kind of cross-over is this? A full crossover? Do you acknowledge that Harry is THE Harry from the books that traveled through dimensions to get there? If so, how? When? Does he attempt to get back? Will Hermione and Ron try to find him? Perhaps show up later? All questions that need an answer.

Other than that, I did not see any spelling or grammatical mistakes. So keep that up.

*** Thank you for the feedback!

Game of Thrones is the TV series and A Song of Ice and Fire is the book series afaik. The events are practically the same so I'm using the words interchangeably until that changes :D

Those concerns have been raised before so resolving those are on my to-do list. In essence, he's not the same Harry, but his 'memories' will slowly come back to him over the next few chapters. I'm not sure how to explain this in the actual writing, though...

Again, thank you!

**** I suppose it's acceptable if it's a part of the mystery for him as well. You can make it quite suspenseful that way.

But really, YOU must know the definitive answer to it. Don't make this up on the fly, it will make or break the entire crossover.
