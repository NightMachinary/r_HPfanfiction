** Latet Anguis in Herba by Slide tells the story of a group of Slytherins in the year above Harry. It has 3 direct sequels until the desth of Voldemort and a next generation story which is now in its second part. Really well written and marvelous character development.

** I suppose this isn't quite what you're looking for, but I highly recommend "Solo" by Crookshanks22 on fanfiction.net. It has Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot. They don't really struggle with Order/Voldemort stuff, but it details their fairly 'average' lives in really interesting and heartfelt ways.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]] (190,399, Complete, after Harry's 4th year), which is narrated by Daphne Greengrass, almost all regular events are happening off-screen and she's almost never “in the know” about them.

This story had both interesting and boring parts, so if you're not usually interested in romance stories, I'd suggest skipping over the boring ones (e.g. gossip) to see if the rest is ok with you.
