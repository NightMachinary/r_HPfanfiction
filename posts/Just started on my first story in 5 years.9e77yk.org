I'm an almost 30 yo mom of 2 and I read HP fanfic constantly, but I haven't written any in 5 years, since before my oldest was born. But today I had some me time at Starbucks and researched for, outlined, wrote, and published the first chapter of a story that I have had in my mind for a while. Seems silly and definitely not huge news to anyone but me ðŸ˜‚, but as a mom who doesn't have a ton of time to myself, I'm super excited to be getting back to my old hobbies again!

Damn, I wish that I had that kind of writing speed. Then again, I usually get bogged down in the research part and spend half an hour digging through Finnish Weather archives because I want to know the snow height in Lapland during January 1997 for one reference in one chapter.

Do you have a link to your story?

*** I've already researched weather for a later chapter, so I get it. To be fair, the first chapter is just kind of an intro and only a measly 700 words. I hate for it to be that short, but it just felt right. But to give myself credit, I am also a master at utilizing my kid free time.

It was free of obvious errors and while not my cup of tea (not a fan of those Weasely family stories, even though I like Ginny), it was definitely not bad.

** Well done! I know what it's like to never have the time to write and how wonderful it is to get it done. Take your time over things and enjoy it :)
