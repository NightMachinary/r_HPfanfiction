In canon, the killing curse is instantly lethal against humans and small animals while having an explosive effect against objects. However, magical resistance is a thing in canon for giants and the curse is designed against humans and possibly magical creatures. Therefore, in no particular order, what do you think would happen if a killing curse hit:

- A giant?

- Big magical creatures such as dragons and Basilisks?

- An alien? Would the result change if the alien was larger than a human?

- An Armoured robot? Would the result change if it was sapient/conscious or not?

- Energy shields?

- Cyborgs such as the Borg?

- A human wearing spaced armour?

- Tanks, bunkers and similar objects made to be hit and stay functional?

  “I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!”

  Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist. His mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.

  But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.

  “By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guards desk, which burst into flame.

  Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces,

There are no rules. In quote 1, the killing curse bounces harmlessly off of an animated part of the statue. In quote 2, it hits a desk, causing it to catch fire. In quote 3, it hits yet another part of the animated statue, this time causing it to explode.

At the same time, the killing curse is one of the absolutes -- Harry is the the only known survivor. The other side of is it is that it apparently needs 'hate' to cast (and I suppose this is why 'love' counters it).

I think it would work fine against anything living, regardless of size; can you say it is possible to have the same amount of hate for a tank as you can for any living being? Is it possible to hate giants when you (and your society) have little no interaction with them?

** A giant... it would definitely have an effect, but not death. If it really only took a simple Avada to kill one, they wouldn't be considered such a menace.

A dragon would probably fry you before you could get in range. (Wait, how far can a spell cast go and still be effective?)

I have absolutely no idea about the alien. It could do nothing, it could have a different effect entirely.

You said the spell explodes against an inanimate object, I'd imagine the same for a robot's armor, regardless of sentience, since the armor is only covering the circuitry.

What do you mean by energy shields? Like the Force? I'll base it off Protego. It would probably have some kind of effect, like causing it to bend, or break entirely depending on the shield's strength.

A cyborg would obliterate you before you got the chance.

Human dies every time.

Tanks, bunkers and the like are non-magical objects. When hit by magic, it would probably take a LOT of damage if not completely obliterated. If they had enchantments on them, I have no idea.

*** Energy shields as in generic, technological created forcefields. Be it on a personal level (Halo, Mass Effect) or on a ship level (Star Trek).

But wouldn't hitting the first layer of armour trigger the explosiv effect since it's a solid plate of steel twenty or more centimetres away from the person.

I'd argue that the effective range of a spell os how far you can aim. Which translates to roughly pistol range since the overall aiming should be not that different.

I see lighter tanks and IFVs exploding pretty easily, but I doubt something like a U-Boot bunker which was designed to absorb bomb hits would particularly care.

**** It would depend on the strength of the energy shield, then. Yes, in that case that layer of armor would likely explode. One Avada wouldn't do too much, but what about multiple casts (more than one wand)?

** It is difficult. Mainly from the writer's point of view: you don't want to have ultimate all-killing charm which trumphs everything. I liked killing of nundu in chapter 83 of linkao3(14078862) ... in the end it was /Avada Kedavra/ (fired by Dumbledore of all people), but it was a way more complicated to get it through.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

Spaced armour, not space armour. So something like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Pz-IVG-latrun-4.jpg][this additional plate around the turret]] kept at a distance to ensure HEAT projectiles exploded away from the hull and lose their energy in the open space in between the layers. You could easily create a suit of armour or flak vest with that concept and thanks to magic it should be pretty comfortable to wear (featherlight charms).

*** In book 5, one of Voldemorts killing curses at the end of the book hits a desk, and it splinters and catches fire. Sounds like an explosive effect to me, and /that/ is Canon, not your headcanon explanation for it

clearly the killing curse caused the desk to catch fire. it might be a logical leap, but its your head canon

** If the spell actually hits a living target and affects it the target dies.

The curse has been shown to be capable of being deflected. It very likely depends on the angle of impact.

The more magically defensive the hide or armor is would give a more favorable angle of impact. ultimately the target would die if the spell is not deflected.

** My headcanon says it works by stopping the heart, and it's soulmagic and only soulmagic can counter soulmagic. So unless you've got a slumbering soulmage or necromancer around, it's pretty much unblockable. However, if whatever you're aiming at doesn't have a heart, doesn't ‘need' it, or has more then one, it'll be fine.

Additionally, magic that effects the heart or the mind is soulmagic, because “your mind is stored in you soul, and your soul is anchored to your body through your heart”, as one of the more useful books on the subject says. Soulmagic is a branch of magic though, it ‘has' shields, but most of them require a willing or unwilling sacrifice. Oh, and it's Very illegal; it's practically been completely eradicated.

So, in summary: Yes, Yes, (if it only has one heart and it needs it to live) Yes, Nope (unless it has a soul, then maybe), (soulmagic shields biult on a sacrifice, willing or not? If not) Nope, (the biological part anyways) Yes, Yes, (not alive so) Nope.
