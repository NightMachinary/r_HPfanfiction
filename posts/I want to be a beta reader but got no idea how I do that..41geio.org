*** I'm currently beta-ing a story, even though I don't fit the FFN.net requirements to be an official beta. Instead of working with the author on FFN.net, we use Google docs. Personally, I find Google Docs the most efficient method to give beta feedback. Both the author and beta can work at the same time, leave notes as suggestions, chat/talk about the story with Google Hangout, all at the same time. It provides flexiblity that FFN.net can't offer. I highly recommend using this method when you beta.

***** Yes, Google Docs is a great way to do it. It's clear where betas are making their comments, and each one gets its own little thread so it's easy to keep track.

For one of the stories I beta, the author isn't very good at formatting text, and the way we do it is for me to send a totally revised version back, noting any major changes. It's not ideal, but if you look at linkffn(10949411) - We Found Wonderland - and compare chapter 1 to chapter 6 (where I started) you can see the scale of the formatting problem. For that, Google Docs wouldn't work nearly as well.

  Hermione Granger has always been exceptional. When the war with Voldemort is finally over, it has taken everything from her. Including her ability to die properly, it seems. And now she's in the 1940s, living in an orphanage. What could possibly go wrong? Only time will tell.

**** As it was suggested to me, if you ever come across an author requesting a beta, just use google documents for the manuscript trades. much easier and more versatile, and there's no need to fulfill the silly word requirement.

** I typically message authors of stories I'm enjoying. It works pretty well so far, obviously not everyone accepts. I currently beta for 5 or 6 stories now.

** For the two stories I currently beta, I left a review, chatted to the author via PMs and then offered.

I have a beta reader profile but the one time I was asked to look at a story via that route, I didn't enjoy it at all.

** I do a lot of beta reading but never bothered with all of FFN's bulldust to list a beta profile.

I started by finding unfinished works I was really enjoying and messaged the authors volunteering to beta. The offer was usually accepted (3 out of 5 times on average)

Somewhere along the way one of the author's thanked me in the A/N since then other people have found and messaged me asking if I would be interested in taking on their pieces.
