i am tired of him being either an evil idiot who keeps getting beat by an 11 year old or is an idiot who is constantly bashed or is worse than voldemort or is senile.

That's funny, because while the story has certainly just barely begun, the prose is just so fucking long winded the work has already reached novel length.

All of Kathryn and Plum's fics are super long but always feel confusingly short.
