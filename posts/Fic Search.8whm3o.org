I remember the beginning. Harry finds Fleur after the battle at hogwarts and I think everybody was dead besides them or a large majority.

Thanks in advance.


** It wouldn't happen to be this linkffn(When a veela Cries) would it ? It just isn't after the seventh book, but it is after a massive battle in Hogwarts that everyone dies in.

  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
