(Note that this fic was re uploaded in a rather cringey way, so here's an [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9h_D4aobhLMIXcW5OUDKpFdZPDidre8/view?usp=sharing][epub]] version with actual chapter separation and no random author notes in the middle of it if you prefer.)

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.
