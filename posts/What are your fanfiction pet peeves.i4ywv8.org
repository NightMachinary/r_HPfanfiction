** I guess I'll copy my answer from another post, because hey, it ain't broke

- Political intrigue between 11 years old
- The real heroes^{TM} were the Slytherins^{TM} we met along the way
- Love potions ? Yes. Love Potions on the "scion of a Noblest and Ancienester House" ? Nah, go to jail with these soul sucking demon.
- Dumbledore, hero acclaimed in the Magical World, the masses love him, and - oh wait, this 11 year old and his 3 friends managed to destroy all of that, now he's a hateable hobo.
- "Griphook ?" "Oh my, Mister Potter, you remembered my name, this never happened in the 1000 years since the founding of Gringotts or whatever despite muggleborns being a thing, look just let us break any contracts and oaths of honor and the like for you"
- Gringotts, the bank that also doubles as this convenient plot device. A bank, yes; but also, lawyers, politicians, blacksmithes, a black market ...
- Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Slytherin-Bogwatter-Twilight-Wolfgang-Mozart-Merlin, and his immense fortune (more than half of the wizarding world's money !), houses, manors, and actions in both the magical and muggle world.
- "With friends like you, I don't need enemies" speaking about Ron I guess, and Hermione too, and basically all Weasleys that aren't the twins. And Dumbledore. And The entire Order. Speaking of which :
- The famous "order of the fried chicken", aka "order of the burnt turkey" or whatever.
- Moldyshorts. Voldy. Dumby. Death Munchers. How original, I guess. Next.
- Chad Potter and the time all of Hogwarts' girls decided he, the suddenly buff dude he was, was the only interesting prospect of the school. Also Neville I guess. Speaking of which :
- Neville is Ron Weasley, but better !
- Luna Lovegood is Hermione Granger, but better ! Also her nonsense actually means things like she's a seer or whatever
- Daphne Greengrass is Hermione Granger, but better ! And Pureblood ! And more beautiful !
- Draco Malfoy is Ron Weasley, but better, because he leanrs things or whatever
- Draco Malfoy is Hermione Granger, but better because - I don't even know
- Draco Malfoy is Harry Potter but better because he's better or something - look I really don't like Draco Malfoy as a character, he's a bully, a loser, who only speaks in "Father will hear this" and "wait 'till father hears about that". The peak of Pureblood suprematism, and yet people like him ?
- Speaking of which, Pureblood were right, Mudbloods (which aren't muggleborns) are a threat to their way of life and Magic. Muggleborns are not Mudbloods if they're willing to learn. Or something.
- Muggles are actually better than wizards, and Magic can't fight against Technology.
- Also, Electricity does work around Magic ! It's just that the Ministry hates Muggle things.
- I spent a minute training now I can do anything with a wand, but wandless !

I've covered a good amount of things, but there's a ton of tropes that didn't make the list. I hate when Ron isn't treated as something other than a joke, when there's a harem but every girls are the same except with different hair color I guess, and many more. But, I think I'll end right now, satisfied.

** - Twinspeak. Gods this gets so annoying in a hurry.
- Death Eater Apologetics
- Remus/Tonks. Awful in canon, unbearable in fanon.
- When the pairing tags are longer than the story
- Grammar and spelling errors to the point of pain.
- Inheritance tests with pages of suppressed abilities. It's not connected to the reason for the test in any way.
- Dumbledork has gotten annoying.

** Shipping fics which romanticize abusive relationships, or push OOC relationships.

Any and all uses of the term "wards".

Excessive nicknaming.

"Hurt/comfort" as a genre.

Animagi/werewolves constantly displaying animal traits in human form.

House elf slavery appologetics.

Slytherin/Pure blood supremacy appologetics.

Muggle wank. Either Muggle weapons/military wank or the "civilized (Western) Muggle nations would never be so backward as Wizards" variety.

Character bashing.

Especially Dumbledore bashing.

Exaggerating/playing up the Dursleys' abuse, and its effects on Harry. Its bad enough as is.

Ruthless "grey" Harry fics which are basically Harry In Name Only power fantasies.

Magical cores as a concept.

Anything that smacks of reducing magic to "power levels".

Luna as generic "crazy girl".

​

​

Those are the main ones, I think. Yeah, I have a real hard time finding fics I like.

*** This is one of those places where I firmly believe canon is wrong. There is no way that someone named "Hermione" wouldn't get a nickname, whether she wants it or not. And "Mione" may not be great, but it's probably the best option available.

**** It is not in canon though. And the length of the name is not something that forces nicknames in every situation. This is a magical society where everyone is willing to say "Professor Dumbledore" 3 or 4 times per chapter.

I imagine Ron was not that eager in using pet names and nicknames after hearing Krum mispronounce Hermione's name. He insisted on her name being 'Hermione'.

Is it a possibility that Ron had called her that after starting a relationship? Maybe. But in he didn't do it in during the Hogwarts years. Harry is even less likely. Though you have a bunch of characters calling her that in fanfics.

***** I know it's not in canon. That's why I said canon was wrong.

And length may not force nicknames, but it is a strong indicator. And Hermione's friends would be using her name a lot more than they use Dumbledore's.

And nicknames and let names are completely different things. Ron, Harry, and anyone else might be unlikely to use pet names, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't give her a nickname.

****** Not everyone likes shortened names. I personally despise when anyone attempts to shorten my name. Considering how probable it is that young!Hermione was mocked for having a "weird" name, I can see her being very firm about it being spoken properly and fully, even by friends.

** -Involving Hermione in every story.

-Making Hermione the romantic lead of every story.

-Being an apologist to the Dursleys terrible behavior.

-Making Draco Malfoy into a "sex god".

-Sweeping the Slytherins and the Death Eaters bad deeds under the rug.

-Harem stories.

My own limits are:

Ron bashing.

Dumbledore bashing.

Dialogue that no one would say.

Pygmypuffonacid style editing.

Magic being only intent and belief.

Luna treated as someone who isn't merely a conspiracy nut and has some special abilities.

Muggle wank as opposed to canon where wizards control the schedule of muggle leaders at a whim.

50 thousand words and 200 chapters.

If on AO3, an inane amount of tags.

Wandless magic that replaces wand magic.

Thematically inconsistent worldbuilding. Healers do not conduct surgery.

Goblins being anything but bankers. Go to a damn healer to fix your eyesight.

Stupid nicknames. Bumblebee, Moldyshorts, etc
