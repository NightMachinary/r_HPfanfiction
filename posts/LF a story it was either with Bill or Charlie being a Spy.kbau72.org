Can't remember if it was Bill or Charlie, they pretended to be a spy to get more information, Voldemort forced the person to take control of Draco.

Can't remember much, unfortunately. Just remember that premise, I can't even remember what site it was on. Or even if Severus was found out to be a spy or was still a spy.

I believe it was kind of dark, where Bill or Charlie was forced to punish Draco or other people to prove their loyality.
