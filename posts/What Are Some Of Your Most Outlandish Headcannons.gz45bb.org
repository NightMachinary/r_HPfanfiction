From Filch being Merlin in disguise to Umbridge being a muggleborn, what are some of your weirdest headcannon ideas?

***** Muriel would be older than that - she's 107 as of DH, so she'd be 48-55 while Riddle was in school. But maybe he was hot for teacher?

Actually, /that/ was his issue with Dumbles all along! Tom had a massive unrequited crush on him, and Dumbles was too awkward to shut it down, and Tom knows he has a thing for Dark Lords... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

** - A patronus cast by focusing on angry thoughts rather than happy thoughts is likely to be far more effective against dementors. Anger overwhelms fear in a way happiness cannot. Plus dementors cannot suck angry thoughts so it's easier to do this while under attack.

- It is possible to cast spells so they don't need a vocal component (aka silent casting). Therefore it is also possible to cast spells with the wrong vocal component e.g. yell AK but shoot out a tickling charm or yell AK and shoot out a harmless green light (confusing your opponent into dodging while you spend only a minuscule amount of power).

- It is possible to engrave runes on the bones in your arm and turn your arm into a wand with your blood as the core.

- Phoenixes are created when a bird familiar gives its life to protect its master from fiendfyre.

** Rowena Ravenclaw actually turned her left arm into a giant raven's claw in the process of trying to learn to be an animagus. Most portraits and sculptures of her either show her after she had fixed the problem (several years later) or with her cloak covering her left arm.

No matter how much she insisted that people call her Rowena ap Aquila, the name 'Ravenclaw' stuck. It mortified her that her animagus form was a scavenger crow rather than a majestic hunter eagle. Helga's insistence that crows were generally smarter than eagles offered little comfort.

** That Hogwarts doesn't do anything to electricity/electronics. The professors made up/sustain the myth because they don't understand kids these days and their newfangled gadgets plus the heads of houses were pretty damn tired of being asked where the power outlets were.

Edit: Colin's camera, which we can safely assume to have been made sometime in the eighties at the earliest, likely had /some/ electronic parts and yet it works just fine. We can chalk this up to Rowling simply not being good at STEM-related stuff, or we can take it as subtle proof ;)

** Well since all muggle-born's are decentands of Squibs, I think all of those who carry the gene, as in are directly decendant of some witch or wizard, are squibs as well, like the parent Hermione got her magical gene from would be squib, though they have no knowledge of Wizarding World, as it has been many generations of squibs.

So at least one of Hermione's parent might be able to see some magical stuff that regural muggles couldn't same way as Flich and Arabella, though as the parents don't know as much about magic as those two they might not realise that it's magic.

** Werewolves exist due to an ancient animagus ritual where the wizard petitions the spirit of the beast for the use of the form. Wolf was not impressed with the petitioner, and when the wizard tried to force the issue, Wolf cursed him.

Dragons are the natural predator of dementors and dragonfire can actually kill them. As dragons are moved to reserves, the numbers of dementors rise.

** Merlin is in Slytherin because he's Slytherin's ancestor. And this is why Slytherin was a Parseltongue because, well, Merlin's dad was some kind of snake monster. Obviously there's time travel involved, but aside from being part human, part (iirc) demon, that's basically Merlin's thing. Oh, and getting trapped/killed by Nimue.

This next one is less weird in the sense of "insane" and more in the sense "no one else seems to agree". So, we've met the names Ginny gives pets. They're... bad. We've also seen that Ginny is very pro-Harry (see: the sectumsempra issue). So, if you get a situation where these two people have to name some children... well, you know the result. Most people, of course, just go "poor Ginny, doesn't name her kids at all (er, except that Luna middle name)".

Ginny has neither OWLS nor NEWTS having ditched Hogwarts after her repeated sixth year to play Quidditch (and the whole Dumbledore's dead issue in her fifth year). This is weird because most people take it as given that they just invited Harry's cohort back to go to school along with Ginny's. I don't think that makes sense... like anyone learnt anything in that sixth year; I think that everyone repeated the year with two cohorts taking the first year syllabus. And much like Fred and George, I don't see Ginny sticking around for an extra two years when she knows what she wants to do and knows if things had been otherwise she'd already be finished.
