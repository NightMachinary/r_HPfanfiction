Step 1: Cast two simultaneous Avada Kedavra to instantly unbind both souls from their flesh container.

Step 2: Immediately Crucio the flesh container. This ensures that electrical signals from the brain continue to function, and that the heart continues to beat.

Step 3: Imperio both souls and separate them entirely. Insert the wraith-like interloper into an inanimate container to properly dispose of at a later point in time. Do this prior to returning the rightful soul to his or her body. Just in case.

Done right, the victim afflicted will not feel a thing, other than relief.


** You know, this is not the first time I've seen non-torture uses for the /Cruciatus/ curse. Most often, I see it used as something similar to a magical defibrillator. One fanfic I've seen it as once used to prevent or treat nerve damage.

**** By forcing a wizard's magic to pay attention to it? I honestly don't recall which fanfiction it was, unfortunately.

** Honestly, I've never really liked the idea of giving the unforgivables 'benign' uses (usually as part of pureblood wank to demonstrate how blinkered and ignorant the Ministry/'Dumbledore Stooges' are).

Bad people really exist, and some people just want to inflict pain, dominate others, or kill with a thought. Don't try to whitewash wizards into a race of saints. It's just boring. I'd be more interested in hearing the story of the terrible Dark Witch or Wizard who first developed the Killing Curse. Can you imagine the fear people felt when they realised he or she could kill them regardless of the magical protection they tried to use? The Imperius is similar, how dangerous would that new when people didn't even know it existed, let alone that it could be resisted. Or what kind of sick person would develop the Cruciatus?

Let's see a story following Salazar Slytherin hunting down the mughleborn woman who murdered an entire village of pure blooded wizards using her newly developed unblockable spell because she thought they were possessed by the devil, and she by an angel.

** I prefer them being entirely evil, it goes a long way to explaining why they're so unforgivable.

Many spells can cause pain, but crucio does nothing but cause it, there's no reasonable use for it, it's just sadistic torture in spell form. It is therefore considered unforgivable.

You can kill someone with any number of spells and plenty of other ways besides, but while each of those other spells can be used for other tasks, the killing curse is only useful for murder. Unforgivable.

Imperio is a bit more unique in effect, but it really does only have one use, and it's one that any supporter of free will will not like.
