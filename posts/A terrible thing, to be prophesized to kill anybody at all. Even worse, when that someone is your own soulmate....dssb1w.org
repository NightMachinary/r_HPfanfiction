The prophecy holds true, Harry or Voldemort must kill the other. But, they're also soulmates, and should be incapable of killing the other.

Where they can't live while the other survives, and yet, cannot survive if the other isn't living.

A tragedy.

"Fated and born to be together for their entire life, prophesized and born to kill each other..."


** Harry looked through the sights of his rifle and took a deep breath. The disfigured, snake like head of his nemesis was right there, magnified eight times. The moment to end his reign of terror has come. He never understood prophecies, or the whole soul mate buisness. He didn't understand why, but his magic refused to work against Voldemort just like Voldemort was incapable of cursing him. But Voldemort had been able to murder his parents just fine. And now he would finally pay for it.

For four years, Harry had looked for a way to kill the monster. But no matter which wand he tried, which potion, obscure spell or ancient ritual he attempted, nothing worked. Four years where he could do nothing but watch in abstract horror as Voldemort killed thousands. However, the solution had been right there in front of him the whole time. He breathe out and pulled the trigger. It may be impossible to harm Voldemort with magic, but if his head happened to be in the path of a supersonic piece of Tungsten designed to penetrate almost an inch of armour, well, that's too bad. As Voldemort collapsed from the gaping hole in his head, Harry felt a weight lifted from his shoulders. Finally, he was free, free of the prophecy and free from Voldemort. And yet, Harry cycled the rifle and took aim again. It wouldn't hurt to make sure.
