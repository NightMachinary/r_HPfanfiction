I was reading a fic a few days ago on ao3. Half way though my read, my computer decided that it would reboot itself, and I lost my history as well. I don't remember the name of the story, I tried to look for it using the search bar by typing what I remember reading of the first chapter which wasn't much. The story was about a young Harry getting an invitation to a different school even though he was not 11 yet. The school had three track for future students to choose from. I remember vernon and petunia debating which track they should choose to for Harry, when Petunia remembered that Lily once told her that Necromancy was illegal in Britain, That they would by choosing that ensure that Harry would not come back to the country. That is where I stopped. any help would be appreciated, thanks!!

*** I feel your pain. I can't even open more than 3 tabs at any given time. I need a new computer, but I don't have the money for it at the moment. Don't worry about it I'm sure someone knows. If not, I can get recommendations if anyone is welling to share a new fic, where Harry goes to a new school.

** No idea but did you try to look through your browser history (sorted by date).

And depending your browser you can tell him to reopen where you left it (tabs and all). Like this if your computer or browser crash, no problem it's still there.
