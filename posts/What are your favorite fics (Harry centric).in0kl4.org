I know all of you "love" Robst, but which fics do you actually love?

**** It's been a while since I've read Forests of Valbone, but from what I recall it's one of the only fics where Harry vibes with the Sorting Hat in an enjoyable way. I also recall the magic being pretty interesting.

Since I last read it in like mid 2019 I don't quite remember how it ended, or if it ended at all, so keep in mind that for all I know it's unfinished. Still a great read though.

** Hmmm. It is interesting to look at my list of favorite HP fics through the lens of Harry-Centric. It appears that a lot of my favorites delve into the lives of the minor characters. Even so, I still have a pretty good list of favorite Harry-centric stories:

I really love [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/oliversnape/pseuds/oliversnape][Oliversnape's]] work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

linkao3(329404)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel.

linkffn(6554218)

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]], instead of having his name in the Goblet of Fire, he's sent as an exchange student to Durmstrang. This is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor.

linkffn(6673903)

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

linkao3(601542)

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Linear Circle series]], is really brilliant; and even though it doesn't at first seem like it fits the criteria, it does... but I don't want to spoil the big plot twist.

** Innocent by marauderlover7 is probably my all time favourite. It starts off with Sirius adopting 8 year old harry. The story is long and is presently in the 5th book of the series. The character development is definitely the best I've ever seen in a fanfic and i also love the way the characters interact with each other. The writing is also amazing and feels Rowling-esque (before she lost her marbles).

It'll take a while to read, but is well worth the time and effort you spend on it OP.

I Know A Secret- it's on ffn, sad but also really creepy.

Thirteen Reasons Why- basically what the title says, Harry Potter style. The one I know is on ffn, but I'm pretty sure there's another on ao3.

To Whom It May Concern- this one has major bashing so be warned. It's written in the style of a suicide note sent to a stranger. You spend until the second to last chapter guessing the person reading's identity. The letter is sent by Harry. There's a good ending and a bad ending.

And

Freak(is that the title? I haven't read this one in a while)- Minor bashing I believe. Basically, Harry is done, and gone. All that's left is Freak. The freak of the Dursleys. The freak of the Wizarding World.

It's a HP x Marvel crossover, but not super Marvel-y, just has some of the characters but it all takes place in the HP universe

** Ruined in a Day by Net Girl: Series of One-shots where Harry has a much darker inner-monologue and more Voldemort tendencies due to a second personality. It is very thoroughly well done and well-written though it is very angsty.

Old Blood by Oil on Canvas: Very well-made AU with interesting characters and new problems. Voldemort is different in this fic as is Harry and pretty much everything else because of a key change nearly a thousand years before the story takes place.

Lesser Evils by Scott Press: Another well-written fic with a darker/more morally ambiguous Harry that is slowly on his quest to become a BAMF. It has a sequel up that's getting slow updates but this story itself is worth a price of admission.

By the Divining Light by Enembee: Probably my favourite fanfic of all-time. It has pretty much everything you could want: badass Harry, mentor Dumbledore, incredible amounts of Magic and wonder along with very real and high stakes.

I know not everyone will agree, I LOVE mjimeyg's Death series although they are all crossovers,well sorta for Potter's Protector,but M-day and Death's Little Brother definitely... i wasn't as happy with Full Circle. If you don't mind the crossovers his(her?) Geth and Five-0 are fun reads as well... and i did enjoy Gungan and Family(not a cross). Most of my others have already been mentioned...

‚Äã

edit: forgot Bobmin(not a huge fan of their final works, but the mid-era stuff yes.

also I Love some of Jeconais's work... Blue Steel, The Perfect Slytherin Stories(the series is unfinished though :( and possibly the last "book"), Perfect Situations and its sequel Matryoshka Vignettes. Hmm... Let's see...This Means War, the only Harry/Ginny I can point at and say "That's pretty damn good" about...though it was written in 07 so.... somethings that were later disproved are in it. I also enjoy Hogwarts' Dawn, but its unfinished.. and I'll end this horribly formated post with White Knight, Grey Queen....

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.Warnings in author's notes.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** My Unordered Top HP 20 Fics: a copypasta.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

Ongoing: Before I read Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. A classic.

Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: Astronaut!Ron, CleverGirl!Hermione, and the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or ‚ÄúHolly‚Äù fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a few things I take issue with, like the whole age line thing for instance. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and because I'm Hinny trash.

Finished: That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]]) is the only crossover in this list, that being with Doctor Who. That being said, you don't need to know a thing about Doctor Who to enjoy this story. Essentially, one of the most powerful monsters from that show is Harry's boggart, and the monster has some unique attributes that make them immune to the Ridikkulus spell. Honestly, the less you know, the better. Enjoy the thrills!

Finished: Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/]]) is a classic comedy fic. Instead of the main character being Harry, it's the part of Voldemort that became the Scarcrux. Hilarity ensues because Harry's insane, but not evil.

Finished(sort of): Like A Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/]]) Harry has red hair, and so is mistaken for a Weasley. They don't mind, and in fact, they adopt him. A classic crack fic, that's basically a fever dream crafted by Fred and George, and McGonagall is close to having an aneurysm.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Three's the Charm by MissCHSparkles linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

Ongoing: A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14041326]]) and it's sequel by Shrikanth1808 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14082594]]) is tagged as a ‚Äúreverse parody,‚Äù in which it takes the premise of Umbridge finding and reading out loud to Hogwarts the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, and attempts to takes it seriously. There are a bunch of fics out there like it, but this is by far the best executed.

Ongoing: Strange Visitors From Another Century by Izzyaro linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/]]) In an accident in the DoM's Time Room when their trying to rescue Sirius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up stranded during the time of the Hogwarts Founders. Salazar doesn't have a good time when he learns what the future thinks of him. They learn that there have always been and will always be Dark Lords. The version of the Founders in this fic is my official headcanon.

Ongoing: The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/]]) is a fic where Harry, and then eventually Hermione and Dean all either live at or become a common visitor of a Muggle facility for disadvantaged kids. Only for both the doctors and the kids to realise they can do magic. McGonagall doesn't know what she's in for when she arrives with letters.

Abandoned: Second Chances by Mara Rome linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4564794/1/]]) is the only traditional Severitus fic I can say I've completely enjoyed so far. Harry and Snape aren't related in any way, thank god, and it has all the things I love so much in hurt/comfort fics. It's set in the summer between GoF and OotP, and it all starts off when Harry uses a glamour charm when he gets checked on by Arthur. Cue warning from Ministry, Snape wants to catch the brat red-handed, only to find very familiar bruises.

Finished: Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/]]) in which Luna steals Ginny's diary and become friends with. Naturally, Tom hates every minute of it, and it's great. Not only is it funny to see the lord of evil just BSoD at all of the Luna he has to deal with, but it also has a really heartwarming ending.

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time.

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

** I tend to read a lot of crossovers-

Harry's Strings- a HP/FNaF crossover where Harry's the puppet. I think it's discontinued, though. I'm writing a story loosely based on this and a few others with the same premise. It's on FFN, bot isn't working for me for some reason.

Brother In Arms- this is a creepypasta crossover, it has 93 chapters and counting but the author has writer's block last time I checked. Even then, you've got 93 long chapters to read. It's like 99% Harry(or Isaac, in this case)-centric but it's third-person limited with the first chapter following Ticci Toby and small scenes every once in a while of various creeps killing. The gore isn't really described, but expect a bit of it, it is Creepypasta after all. This one's on FFN

The Master (Of Death)- this is a Doctor Who crossover. It's a series on both FFN and Ao3 with the first fic being Count To Four. Basically, Harry is The Master reincarnate, and regains his memories. Also he dies??? I don't think he's dead??? But he goes through the Veil at one point. In the last chapter of that fic. Wow, way to give a cliffhanger.

Death is but the Next Greatest Adventure- a well-written MoD! Harry fic where things happen but I can't say to much because spoilers. Also it has the explicit warning thing- from where I've read up to so far it's not really smut just alluded to bc Death is a bitch sometimes.

Also warning most of these have slash.

Right now my only problem is that I can't figure out how to write William and have him sound non-threatening. In this particular scene, he's dressed as Spring Bonnie and is supposed to tell the kids he knows where there's cake and that he'll take them there, then lead them to the back room, reveal he's not Bonnie, and kill them. But I can't figure out how to write it so the kids would trust him and it seems natural.

Yeah that's hard.

Maybe you should have him trick 1 kid first (the kid should be young to fall for it) telling him about how there is a /secret/ room with cake, sweets and toys, that he should see!!!

And then after he tricks one kid, he convinces about 3 others telling them that their friend went to get all the free toys for himself! ( using the first kid's name, and knowing their names after tricking thr first kid).

Dunno if it helps, but i'm looking forward to it nonetheless!

****** That's a good idea! I might have to change a few things though, either in my story or in that set up.

My current scene has him approach the kids(including Harry) while they're having fun at one kids birthday party. Harry thinks he's off(my Harry is much better than he should be at recognizing someone's body language- it's how he survived with the Dursleys), but gives him the benefit of the doubt because he doesn't seem threatening despite the vibe he's giving off. William then convinces at least one kid to come with him somehow, and the others follow, Harry being the first to realize something's wrong because he already thought something was off and kept an eye out.

So I'd have to either change the setting for your setup or change my current setup a bit.

It does help, though. It's mostly I have no idea how to pattern his speech lol.

******* Your set up does sound good though!

I like to imagine william as a really good actor. He is a psycopathic evil bastard but a really good one at dealing with kids. If he really does have kids (as the theories and lore implies) he would probably know how to talk to them in a way that sounds friendly and enticing.

You can actually see how ads "talk" with children; bright colours and nice/excited words. So for example:

William already has the bonnie custom, but what if he brought candies/toys/whatever with him to convince them?

So he goes

"Hello children! Are you having funnnnn?"

"OH- it's bonnie!!!!! Yes mr bonnie, the pizza is great.... But there are no sweets here...."-says the child looking at the candy that coincidentally is in aftons hands (paws? Lol)

-" Oh no! Why not? Did your parents hide them to eat them all by themselves???"- AFTON

- " They said there wasn't any mr bonnie! Were they lying because they didn't want us to it them???"

- "uhm...maybe....maybe i can give you guys some....but no, i would be really in trouble with your parents when you told them...."

-" We PROMISE we won't tell them mr bonnie!"

-" well then, are you sure??? It's in my super secret room with toys and cake! But then you can't tell your parents and have to come with me now!"

"woah mr bonnie, a SECRET room????"

"Yes, where you can have fun fun fun fun...."

"let's go then!!!!"

"Of course children....of course"

So ahm that's an idea if you like it rip.
