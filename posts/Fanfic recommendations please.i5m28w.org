:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi , I am looking for a long and interesting Fanfiction (at least 80-100 chapter). I would prefer the kind of fanfics where Snape is Harry's father, or Slytherin Harry or the story is centered towards another character who is not Harry (eg; Draco Malfoy is a hero). Please suggest me some fanfics. Thank you.


** Dodging prison and stealing witches is a good fic , it's on ao3 . It's a wbwl, deaths champions ,Slytherin Harry fic, that has a pseudo harem( characters have been too young to actually do anything ) and has a awesome oc in Sirius daughter
