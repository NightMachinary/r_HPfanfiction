Sorry I'm gonna be a bit vague on the details. I want to say Harry ends up being more powerful/Super!Harry but specifically what I'm remembering from the fic is that a good portion of it revolves around Orion Black and Charlus Potter. They weren't friends, but had some sort of peaceful understanding between each other. I recall specifically that Lily had a scene with Orion while she was pregnant and IIRC he gave her the means (spell/ritual) to protect Harry when she sacrificed herself.


** Edit: title should read fic, not doc. Typing on mobile sure is frustrating.

*** Skimming the plot summary my instinct says no but I've definitely read this one before so you could be right. I'll reread it anyway. Thanks for the link!

**** I'll second this recommendation. I just read it recently, and your description sounds very similar to a few things that happened in the story.
