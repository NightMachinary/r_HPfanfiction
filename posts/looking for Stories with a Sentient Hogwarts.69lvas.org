** In linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt), Hogwarts is some sort of a hive mind. This story is very well worth reading/following for other merits as well.

I don't remember much of linkffn(Reconnaissance by Albernheit), but it also features sentient Hogwarts.

**** It's a long series. There are sequel bits that travel to different universes after this story ends. I love Mijimeyg's stories. You might even enjoy Harry Brown, it's a long one chapter story, you don't really need to know anything about the show it crosses over with. It's basically just covers what happens in Tri-Wizard year.

Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for.
