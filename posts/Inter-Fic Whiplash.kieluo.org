Do you guys ever go from reading one fic to another which has core elements so different that it shocks you for a bit? I just finished a nearly 900k fic where Sirius is a central character who makes it to the end of the story to a fic that is only on second year and Sirius is killed in a headline without ever actually being introduced. I sat there for a genuine 30 seconds just digesting the fact he was just whisked away.


** For me, it's when minor characters have radically different personalities between fics that gets me

*** Yes!!! The side characters in Marauder fics really get me because we don't see them in canon so it really is open to interpretation.

One minute Mary McDonald is this strong, badass tiny blonde lesbian who is snarky and plays quidditch and the next she's a shy pudgy girl who hides behind Lily and is just there for emotional support..

Frank Longbottom has been promoted to and demoted from head boy, perfect, auror, quidditch captain more times than I can count.

Alice has no consistency to what year she's in at all...

Remus Lupins parents vary in their 'aliveness' fic to fic...

** Weasley/Dumbledore bashing v. canonical characters. Shock was couple of times so bad, that I am now more careful not to read bashing stories, so I don't spoil my palate.

*** ikr. i have read a lot of weasley/Dumbledore bashing because i love reading independent!Harry and sometimes i really hate weasleys like while watching the movies etc.

tbh, i do feel like Dumbledore had planned everything when i read the books, including meeting with Weasleys. why the fuck they were yelling about muggles and asking the platform number..? they were coming there for years!

**** "Yelling about Muggles"

They weren't yelling. Harry just picked up on the word Muggle

"asking the platform number"

To test the youngest children's knowledge

***** you honestly believe that? i just think it's a book, author needed to introduce the characters, and she did. BUT i like to make things more realistic, i like to think that there a deeper story. and no i don't think Dumbledore being manipulative is a bad thing. if in the end we had learnt that it was all Dumbledore's plan, i wouldn't have hated Dumbledore still. the man literally sacrificed himself so that his spy would be more trusted (even though he was dying, i think it is still a sacrifice cuz they would find a way to get rid of the curse, maybe pay a visit to his pal flamel)

it is a book. maybe Rowling didn't think the fans would think this deep, she didn't think people would question why Dumbledore did that, why Dumbledore did those, why didn't he check on Harry, he was being abused bla bla. it was children's book in the beginning

** I tend to read multiple fics at a time so I often get confused for a good 1-2k words about which set of characters im reading, who is alive, which trope is active ect

*** lmao ohmygod same. I have so many tabs with different fics open, I just jump on one and I'm like, "okay it's got so-and-so tropes, these characters are alive, these characters are focused on, and magic's more complicated in this way."

But then I click off, come back, and start reading a fic that looks similar only to realize that it's a completely different ones. There's so many fics I just haven't finished and try to come back to, only to realize I'm completely misremembering the whole story and I have to start over because I just can't quite remember what the fic was even about.
