:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been struggling the last while trying to remember a fic I read a year or two ago now. After Harry's name came out of the Goblet, it led to him being attacked by his Gryffindor housemates. Somehow he ended up outside the tower and was found by Fleur. They either talked or she took him back to the Beauxbatons carriage to help him. Or maybe both.

Thanks in advance for any help!

** I'm not particularly sure which one you're talking about, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]] does something similar (where he's alienated from Gryffindor), and it gets really good if you can get past the first few terribly cliche chapters.
