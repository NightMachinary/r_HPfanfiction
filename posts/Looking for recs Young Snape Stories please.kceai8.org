Hi,

I am looking for stories any that involve Snape before Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts. Snape as a child, Snape as a Hogwarts student, as a Death Eater or teacher.

Can be any pairing, but I am really in the mood for gen. Long and finished preferred.

No "Harry travels back in time" stories please, I've read too many of those already. I am trying to branch out from my usual fare, thus I am looking more for Snape-Lily friendship fics or Marauder-era fics or similar.

Thank you very much.


** linkao3(147439)- Into the Fold- Brilliant look at First War Snape. It alternates between his last few years at Hogwarts and his time as a Death Eater, eventually ending at Lily's death. Covers a lot of good material, the invention of Sectumsempra, his first meeting with Voldemort, the breakdown of his relationship with Lily. I really love it.

linkao3(868256)- Under Pressure by tofsla- A really good look at Snape's becoming a teacher post the first war. Really handles his grief, depression, and the distrust shown by those around him very well.

linkao3(3082463)- To Dwell on Dreams- Post-Lily's death. Snape brews potions in order to hallucinate Lily; he becomes addicted to it. Quite an engaging and heartbreaking read.

linkao3(638566)- St. Mungo's Grim Reaper- One of my personal favourites. It's based on Snape's time as a Death Eater. He's given an assignment to work at St.Mungo's by Voldemort. Quite harrowing and sad.

linkao3(638325)- Romance of the Age- A contemptuous look at Snape and the entire Marauders' generation.

linkao3(13922226)- immortalists with points to prove- Very interesting look at Snape and Moody's relationship. Covers a bit of his Death Eater trial and his years as a spy post that.

linkao3(107750850)- Happy Memories- An interesting fic about Snape learning to cast a patronus.

All of these are gen and canon-compliant. Hope you enjoy!

** Have a go on my Favorit canon, from „Dear Miss Stevens,“

Being a member of the order, fighting for the greater good was a matter of sheer will and commitment. It was mostly people who weren't much into family, riches or working only from nine-to-five. It had been a very lonly job next to teaching potions. With a protege on his side however it wasn't that lonely anymore. It was hard work and Severus didn't really see the effort yet that was to gained from her beeing a member in the order. He tried however. He tried because she tried as well. She really wanted to do the job. He found her commitment, fearlessness and determination was worthan attempt.

Stevens left the Great Hall with Barrel at her side. She was a Hufflepuff and much to nice to everyone for her own good. He contemplated about Thomas Barrel and how he was no good influence on his student, for Barrel was a true Slytherin. His marks weren't anything to be proud of, especially as his best subject was care of magical creature with this dimwited, hairy and highly irresponsible goof Hagrid. Severus' mood got even worse as his thoughts wandered to Hagrid. Were they about to go outside maybe? Severus shook his head as he catched himself actually worrying about Stevens and Barrel. She was quite capable to look after herself. As nice as she was to everyone, she would also show no mercy if it came to telling somone the truth. Stevens was full of honesty and it was nearly impossible for her to hide something that bugged her. He still better took a stroll around. He remembered last year, as a bunch of Gryffindors had smuggled firewhiskey outside and two of them had been taken into the hospital wing. It was nothing more then fullfilling his job as a teacher, he thought. He wasn't dancing anyway. With whom though? The first year he had consented into one song with Pomona in order to be polite, regreted it however immediately: Dragon Dung! He shuddered just by the thought of her smelly hat, tingling right under his nose as he was so tall and she so small. Students around gave him the space he needed, when passing huge crowds. Severus was used to people making him way, sometimes their faces looked even fearful. He couldn't understand where that was coming from. Not with Stevens though, she never went out of his way. Which could be annoying at some point, but mostly he was wonderous why she was always this friendly and kind towards him, for no one else was.

He walked down the marble stair case and crossed the entrance hall. The big oaken front doors were wide opened and led onto the wounded path lined with rosebushes. Fairylights and fireflies brightend the cold winter night. Severus didn't hear or see anyone around. he had his hands in his pockets and gazed into the starry night. The sky was clearly visible and Severus breathed in the fresh air, emptying his mind and tried to think of nothing.

He couldn't. His arm.

The dark mark was already slightly warmer then some hours ago. It was a reminder. There was still that one open comission no one yet had dared to do. Other Deatheaters had suggested that he himself would be best for the job. It would involve getting Information out of a known accomplice from a member of the order. Not doing it made Severus suspicious. He had still hoped that Avery would stepp in to do the job. It was unlikely however and Severus didn't really know why he was putting the assignment of. Setting it aside made it only worse. It had to be done. The Dark Lord had no mercy. No sympathy for personal situations. He just couldn't get himself to do it. Not now. He had done those things in past already, yes. At the moment however he found it difficult to leave the castle. Leaving his safeplace. Not knowing how it would end. Especially not after this evening of pure frustration. Sadness fell upon him as he walked alone on the crunchy, graveled way through the Hogwarts Grounds. He had to get a grip on himself. He heard laughter from across the path. It must have come from behind the flowerbushes. Severus took two more long strides and peered cautiously around. It was Barrel and Stevens, slowly making their way towards the gazebo. Well at least he wasn't up to anything suspicious. Severus was just about to turn around as he saw how Barrel took off his cloak and layed it around Stevens' shoulders. It appeared to be a gentle guesture and Stevens really looked cold. Severus' jaw clenched and he turned harshley to walk back inside again, trying to ignore his forearm. Aiming for the common room, he thought he would better be checking on the Slytherins. He wanted to be appointed Headteacher of Slytherinhouse and needed to get a feeling for his students. The current Headteacher Horace Slughorn was only months away from retireing. Severus had just gained the Title of Potionsmaster after finishing important studies and a long examination under the mentoring and guidance of Horace. There hadn't been a lot that Slughorn could teach him anymore, yet the procedures had to be followed.

Entering the common room he was glad that it was empty. Chattering from the dormatories could be heard, which was quite alright for his feeling. He left and aimed just for another check in the Great Hall. Some seventh years crossed his path back to the entrance hall, noding cautiously towards him. He was pleased that this year hadn't been any trouble. Walking up the stairs into the light and warmths of the Entrance Hall he saw just two strugglers left behind. Barrel and Stevens again. Severus rolled his eyes and waited respectfully, just wanted to get the evening over with.

"... Thanks for inviting me." He heard Stevens say to Barrel. Thomas was facing the stairs towars the dungeons and Severus rolled his eyes even deeper into his head as he saw that Barrel took her hands and kissed it. He looked quite pathetic, thought Severus, as Barrel glanced up from the kiss on her Hand - maybe expecting to get a goodnight kiss back. "Not one my watch..." Severus whispered and moved towards them.

** linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is universally regarded as a good fic by most people, Snape fans and those neutral to him alike. It depicts his life, from shortly before he is born, to his ultimate death. One of very few fics that depicts his pre-Hogwarts life. It's also interesting in being pretty much the only canon compilant Snape fic I've seen that /doesn't/ make him romantically interested in Lily (their relationship is platonic). My only 2 issues with the fic is that the Defense O.W.L. scene isn't a clean break in the friendship between him and Lily (and thus strongly violates my headcanon for the matter), but "only" cause them to go from best friends to being more distant, but still friendly. It also tries too hard at times to excuse legitimately despicable behaviour (such as the first Potions lesson with Harry Potter).

You mention looking for stories where Snape is a teacher, but also "young Snape". Do you mean teacher only as far as starting out, or him being a teacher in general? I find [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15475770/chapters/35925678][The Hogwarts Potions Professor]] to be an excellent fic, but it's set in 1991 (it's a Snape-centric fic with a focus on his teaching, and an AU where he is actually a good teacher).

I can also link a couple of Marauder-era non-time travel LESS fics if you don't mind the ship, but most people seem to detest the mere mention of it.

EDIT: No idea why linkao3 no longer seems to work, so I changed it to a direct link instead.

*** To be honest, I am open to anything that is Snape-centric and does not also focus on Harry and his generation.

So teacher in general as well as being a young teacher would be great. I really liked "Snape Head of Hufflepuff" by Sheankelor and was hoping there were more stories with similar themes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11062798/1/Snape-Head-of-Hufflepuff]]

I would consider myself omnivorous when it comes to pairings and eras. But just like somebody who considers himself not racist and then goes out and does this totally racist thing, I haven't actually read much outside my usual fare of Drarry, Severitus and Snarry. (Yeah, shame on me.)

It took reading "The Bureaucratic Error" by Iniga to realise that my knowledge of good Marauder-era fics is pretty much zero. So yes, I would really appreciate some recs for Marauder-era fics.

**** If you'd like to try a (non-time travel) LESS fic, I'd suggest linkffn(Letters from the Dark). I like the fic because it tries to convey them working out their issues with each other and coming to terms with them and over time getting close again. I think the fic treats the Marauders too harshly (there's no blatant bashing, but they're not treated as very good people), but I like the fic otherwise. It's also shorter than the much, much slower (and incomplete) linkffn(The Path Not Tread) which has a similar premise of them working out their issues with each other over time, but is far too slow-paced IMO. To clarify, the fic starts around March 1976 and has only come as far as January 1977 despite being as long as it is.
