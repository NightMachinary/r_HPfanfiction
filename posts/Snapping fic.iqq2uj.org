Hello everyone,

I was wondering if you knew some fics where the MC (Harry or not) just completely snaps and become merciless, causing the Death Eaters to go from usual taunting to "Oh fuck" and being afraid to fight ?

Not really psychopath and cruel, but more like "gloves are off"

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
