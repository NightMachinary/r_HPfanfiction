Just what it says on the tin. I really want to start doing this for the better fanfics out there. I suffered through the steaming pile that is HPMoR because it was the only "fanfic on tape" i could find to make my drive to work bearable. So I'm trying to gauge community interest.


** Hmm. The whole permission issue might be a bit tricky. I feel that all fan fiction should be under some sort of non-commercial by attribution creative commons licence, but I don't think it is. So keep that in mind.

The big stumbling block, however, is reading out loud. It clearly is hard. I listened to the Methods of Rationality podcast for a while. I did that because I liked the voice (and cadence) of whoever spoke Hermione. I did not like the rest of the cast.

Audiobooks are hard. Just look at the the official ones. Jim Dale did the American versions and he did a fantastic job. Passionately acted with uncountable different characters. And yet his work was obliterated by what the British got. Stephen Fry is who he is and he can make everything sound wonderful. Jim Dale couldn't make the best version of the audiobooks -- how hard must it be to even approach okay?

*** People can't sue you for podcasting fanfiction unless you get money out of it and even then I think Rowling would be the one allowed to sue you.

So it's probably morally wrong to do it without permission, but they can't do anything to you anyway. (Not because I'm suggesting they should do it, but because it might be impossible to get it, some authors have left the fandom forever and there's no way to contact them)

** There are actually [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com/harry-potter][lots of them]] so I say go ahead.

Any doubts you might have you can ask [[http://podfic-tips.livejournal.com/][in a community.]]

** There's actually a long-running (200+ episodes), weekly podcast at [[http://potterficweekly.com/][PotterFicWeekly]] that interviews authors (jbern was interviewed some years back, e.g.), plays audiobooks of stories, etc. They also have (last time I checked) a pretty active forum. It's worth checking out if this is your thing.

(Incidentally, this wouldn't be a bad sidebar link.)

** These are already a thing aren't they? I've seen some stories on ao3 advertised as podcast so there must be a group of people interested in this idea already. Either way good luck.

** Download the Android App Voxdox.

It's a pretty decent text to speech program that I use to listen to text at work or when I'm driving. It isn't perfect, but I've listened to over 10,000 pages of stories (something like 3-5 million words) in the last ~3 months. I think you get 1000 pages initially, which is enough for about 300k-400k words (depending on text size), and the 500 pages per month if you use the free version. I went ahead and paid $3.99 for the gold edition which is 5,000 pages per month (which I've used up in both of the last 2 months).

The default reading speed is decent, but you can increase or decrease it if you want. The speech is a bit monotone, although they do add inflection for question marks and exclamation points. There are male and female voices in both US and UK accent, and they all read a bit different. For instance, I generally use the US female voice "Rebecca" because she's very easy to understand, but the downside is that she spells out any contractions. I've tried several other voices, and some of them pronounce certain words better, but they are all useable depending on preference. Most of them will even sound out spell names pretty successfully.

*** There are free android options without the limitations. You can download ivona tts in an accent you like (Amy is the most popular for UK accent, Kendra for US) and AI reader (other e reader apps might have a read aloud option as well) , then download your fics in an epub format with ficsave. No word/page count limit to my knowledge.

** This would be great if it were done with long fics. I've seen it before with oneshots and stuff, but just didn't care.
