I am not looking for an evil/manipulative Dumbledore story. I am not interested in bashing him either. However it would be nice to see him explain more clearly why he didn't act when he realized students were potential collateral victims of Draco's attempts. Or why didn't he explain to Harry from the start exactly how he intended to destroy the Horcrux before they went on the quest for the locket.


** I think he wasn't able to act against Draco because Snape's unbreakable vow would kill him and disrupt Dumbledore's final plan if he didn't take action to protect him. Remember, he swore to aid Draco in his task as much as possible. I think the plan was for Snape to “help” Draco and gain an insight into his plans to prevent collateral damage, but that plan didn't come to fruition because of Draco's distrust of Snape.

** Albus and Harry's World Trip just updated again, and covers a lot of that. Not just Dumbledore either. It's like the author took a number of the reasons to bash and gave them historical/rational/logical explanations.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  "Lily, you don't understand---""I understand that we unfortunately have different priorities, Albus," Lily interrupted, the fire in her eyes familiar to all who knew her. Familiar, but not the same. The fire had somehow turned very cold."I died for my son," Lily continued, her gaze passing judgment on everyone present. She turned back to the Headmaster. "My son, Harry. Not your Chosen One. Not your Boy-Who-Lived," she spat.
