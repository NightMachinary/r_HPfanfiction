I was recently having a discussion with a friend of mine about the lack of interesting (to me) Harry Potter crossover fics.

Now thinking on this, I feel like since Vampires already exist in the Harry Potter universe, it feels like incorporating Twilight characters into a HP world would be somewhat easy, although the reverse might be harder. We're also discussing how half of them consist of slash fanfic Harry/Jasper Harry/Edward Harry/Jacob you name it and they will be there even some minor Twilight male characters. But Twilight female population other than the bland Bella doesn't get a look in. The best I can hope for is Leah while both Alice and Rosalie played more prominant role than her in movies.

Therefore, I am curious if anyone has come across any decent Harry Potter / Twilight crossover stories where it features Harry/Alice? I still can find at least couple of Harry/Rosalie fanfic like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8038269/1/Firework-Magic-and-Destiny][Firework, Magic and Destiny]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11063820/1/Chrysochlorous][Chrysochlorous]] but the other one is scarce at best except may be one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9397304/1/Green-Meets-Gold][Green Meets Gold]].

So if any one of you (who read this) know any decent good long fiction of those two I will be really grateful.

#+begin_quote
  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.

****** Yes, indeed. It certainly does have weaknesses, but offers enough uniqueness and fluff to be appealing as a pleasureable read.
