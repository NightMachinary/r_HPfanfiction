I want to read but I can't find anything that catches my interest.

What I would like for you to do is to recommend ANY fic that is Harry-centric and contains minimal drama in the form of marriage contracts, love potions etc.

Thanks in advance.


** I'm not sure what you've already read, but I can recommend some of my favorites in a variety of genres: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville; Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes; The Augurey by La-Matrona; Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm; Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof) are all complete. Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) are also quite good and complete.

I also love linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) although it hasn't updated recently. Linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) is a good fem!Harry that is in progress.

Hopefully some of these are new to you and sound interesting!

** One off the top of my head is an au but really long and well thought out search for. Teeth. The name is misleading it about a rushed animagus form and its conquences.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
