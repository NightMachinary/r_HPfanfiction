** Hagrid as some crazed civilization hating pseudo-druid mustering the dark creatures of the forbidden forest to fight for him would make for an interesting story.

** The figure looked towards the last standing ruins of the ministry. Small shadows cowered in between with nowhere left to run, surrounded as they were by tooth and claw and fire-breath. His enormous shadow stole the light and grew, of man shape maybe, but far greater. Eyes as black beatles gleamed with cruel desire from between the dark mass of hair. With one hand he stroked the shell of the enormous blast-ended skrewt, with the other he held a once pink umbrella, now a deep red, as if stained with blood.

"if ye won't love my beautiful beasties-" Hagrid growled menacingly, "i will MAKE ye love them."

He heaved his tiny umbrella high and pointed it towards the last bastion. Thousand of beastly eyes in all sizes followed it, as if hypnotized. The air was dreadfully tense. All was silent for that one moment. Then, hagrid pressed the button with his thumb, the umbrella shot open and all monsters stormed forward to the awaiting feast. The screams began.

"the world, canne sustain humans, see. Tha's just not balanced. So now, there'll be only creatures. Only us."

He mounted his dragon, Norberta, who had grown bigger than all other things in the sky on a diet of wizard flesh.

"and now it is balanced. As all things shouda been."

And there were no more screams.

** Alt universe, Tom riddle does not get hagrid expelled but instead protects and shelters him

Grown up hagrid becomes chief animal breeder for Voldemort, creating all kinds of toxic and nasty monsters for the wizarding public to deal with

after the defeat of voldemort, hagrid escapes into the wilds only to realise something, Voldemort often turned down some of hagrids more wild ideas

and now hagrid is free to unleash his vile experiments on the world to and he will kill that potter boy and gain his revenge for that potter boy killing tom

** Hmm...I think I read a one-shot once where Hagrid killed Harry by slipping him poison during one of their teas. He started off good, but turned to Voldemort when the latter promised to further the rights of non-humans (since Voldemort does employ werewolves/giants/etc in canon).

I think it was on AO3, but I can't find it...
