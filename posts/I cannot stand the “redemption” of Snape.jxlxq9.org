The “redemption” of Snape in books 6 and 7 that carries over to Fanfiction is awful. He is, without a doubt, one of the least likeable people in the entire series for about 6.75 books when all of a sudden we get a flashback about how he snuck a sword to Harry Potter because he loved Lily Potter or something. Snape couldn't get over being rejected by a childhood crush at the age of 15-17 because he was associating himself quite willingly with individuals who hated the thought of people like his “one love” breathing air.

He then proceeds to join a terrorist group. In a war. Where he proceeds to perform countless acts of who even knows what. Let's not forget that he doesn't even turn spy until the tail end of the war in ‘81, so all of a sudden any acts he performed until then get swept under the rug because he is “needed.”

From there, he proceeds to absolutely murder the potions curriculum at Hogwarts, allow the Slytherin house to continue to be those hateful bullies he so despised. This all before we even talk about his conduct once Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom arrive at Hogwarts. He terrifies a child so much that he literally becomes what that child fears the most. To speak nothing of his attitude towards an 11 year old Harry, or anything he does to protect Draco's actions before our second candidate for resident slimeball of Hogwarts takes his own little mark. He demonstrably does nothing in books 5-7 to aid the order until the very end by delivering a message telling a kid to take an AK. Clap clap clap.

For me this bleeds over into fanfiction, I just cannot deal with stories that somehow paint Snape in a good light without changing his character significantly unless he's thrown on the side somewhere. Personally, I'm glad Snape died and significant part of the reason I can't read any fanfiction that is close to the actual canon ending is because of how little spite Snape sees. Harry Potter naming his child in part after the man who tormented him in his formative years, to say nothing of what 5th year would qualify as. Albus Severus Potter. What a joke.

What makes you think that? I always thought he turned spy sometime during the winter of 1980-1981, judging by the "leafless trees" present in his meeting with Dumbledore and the fact he already knows the Potters' child is a boy.

Factually incorrect. He was a spy for the Order in books 5&6, in book 5 he told the Order Harry and his friends were missing and probably in the Department of Mysteries, and in book 7 he gave the Order the idea of the Seven Potters through Mundungus Fletcher, he protected the Hogwarts students as best he could from the Carrow twins, and he left Harry the Sword of Gryffindor, under Dumbledore's instruction, in a place where it would be taken "under conditions of need and valour". And that's only what was said explicitly.

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: he was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George... a Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin's back- /"Sectumsempra!"/ shouted Snape. But the spell, intended for the Death Eater's wand hand, missed and hit George's ear instead-

"And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort's good books, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows..."

If he ever had prejudice against Muggleborns (which I doubt, it was more likely Muggles he had a problem with, given his father) it is long gone:

"Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood-" "Do not use that word!" "-the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!"

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

He agreed readily to take up the task of protecting Harry once it was explained to him that Harry would actually /need/ protection. He saved Harry's life in his first year, there's no way he would heve survived that fall without Dumbledore there.

"I have spied for you, and lied for you, and put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe."

To reply to anyone who tries to say that Snape wasn't in love with Lily because "it's not stated in the books what sharing a Patronus means", it /is/ stated on Pottermore. Sorry. He did love her.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

All this does nothing to make up for his actions during the first war or at Hogwarts, but you write it as though he did nothing good whatsoever.
