I'm talking about the 2-3 sentence blurb that the author writes about their fic. Preferably non crack fic/parody since those are meant to be ridiculous.

This question is inspired by linkffn(13059607) because of that name alone.


** 99% of HP/Twilight crossovers fall into this category but I saw this trainwreck by accident:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13190378/1/Can-You-Forgive][Can You Forgive?]]* By: /Radiant Arabian Nights/

#+begin_quote
  The Cullen's but Rose where going to abort Bella's baby so she calls for help from her twin Harry. She gives birth in England to eleven babies and she stays in England to raise them what happens when the Cullen's see her 6 years later after she sent Edward papers for divorce?...And the fact Bella is a High Elf with her brother. (The children age normally. Cross Twilight/Harry/Percy
#+end_quote

What makes this trainwreck so spectacular is that it moves at the same speed as that introduction. Obviously every good character has at least seven names. The babies too.

**** My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me, "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through". I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because that summary gave me cancer anyway.

*** I love Lily and the Art of Sisyphus. It has one of the most unique and entertaining writing styles that I have seen in fanfiction that works really well. It manages to balance being absurd while being entirely serious at the same time. Not everyone likes the writing style, but it is quite popular and a good fic otherwise.

Lily (fem!Harry) likes to give others nicknames and wizard Lenin is her name for the Voldemort horcrux in her head. She is kind of weird and extremely casually OP to the point where everyone is constantly confused as to how she randomly manages to break the laws of magic.

**** I enjoy Carnivorous Muffin's other works (Unwinding Golden Thread, Do Androids Dream) but I can't get over LatAoS's writing style. Not only does it have a lot of convoluted phrasing that a proper editor would have snipped out for being imprecise or cheesily overdone, but the punctuation is barely there. Even the summary suffers from it:

#+begin_quote
  and come hell or high water play it she will
#+end_quote

My brain tells me there should be a comma between "water" and "play".

#+begin_quote
  and come hell or high water, play it she will

I read the first 20 or so chapters and it was a recurring problem that drove me bonkers, and ruined my enjoyment whenever my inner editor noticed it. It ruined the immersion to the story's actual content.
