I read a Tomarry fanfic called ‘Seventeen Years' by Rendered Reversed and it was really cute. It's about Tom and Harry being reborn as muggles and how it was bound to happen. It's not for everyone though. It's summary is:

“Voldemort is a day old when he realises those blasted muggles had named him ‘Tom'. And he's a day old when it fully sinks in that, yes, being reborn, legitimately, instead of from an experimental ritual, sucked. Because he has no idea where he is, what time he's in, who these people are... and he can't control who he is born with. Namely, some other brat who would take the title of his twin... his brother.

He is a year old when it sinks in who his twin could possibly be.

Because his twin might, possibly, probably, be Harry Potter.”

Anyway, I was wondering if there was anything like this and if there is, if someone would let me know. Thank you!
