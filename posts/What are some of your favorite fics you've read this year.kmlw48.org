  It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world...but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth.Lily Evans wants a fresh start.James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him.Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story.Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon.Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered. The Howling Nights is the first book of The Last Enemy series, which follows the lives of the heroes and villains of the First Wizarding War from 1975-1981. Watch the trailer! (New chapters posted on Mondays and Thursdays)

** I discovered linkao3(the imposter complex by notus_oren) a couple weeks ago and I'm OBSESSED. Binge read the whole thing in like two days and am now forcing myself to take my time rereading it slowly to enjoy it. It's one of the best fics I've ever read with amazing world building and great characterizations. It was last updated in august so I guess it counts as semi recently updated! I really hope it continues as the storyline is so complex and good.
