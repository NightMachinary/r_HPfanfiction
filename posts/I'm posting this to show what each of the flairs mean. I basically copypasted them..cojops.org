** According to the "How to flair your post" link in the sidebar, "looking for fics that fit a certain criteria" is simply [Request] not [Seeking Recommendations] as stated when submitting a post. It also describes [Wiki] and [Recommendation] flairs which aren't mentioned in the post submission page (which implies by omission that such should simply be [Misc]).

Personally I have flairs simply turned off across reddit. I find they're more trouble than they're worth. /HPfanfiction is hardly a high-traffic subreddit and it's usually easy to figure out a post's intent from the title.

*** ...I know. I pointed that out in my post, but I also pointed out that I, and a bunch of my friends, have never read that. We type what we want to post, and then we just submit it. It's probably the same for a large portion of this sub, hence putting this up, and referencing where it is.

**** It's not about how many points it gets you, it's more about vote manipulation being very bad and not good.

Just asking is a decent way to get banned, and I don't mean from this subreddit specifically.

***** How is it vote manipulation if I don't gain any votes? I'm asking legitimately, because I don't really care about karma, or such. So this whole vote manipulation thing is new to me.

****** What do you even mean how is it vote manipulation. It's pretty definitely vote manipulation, and saying "downvote me elsewhere to even it out" isn't going to change that, if anything it makes it worse.

You are trying to influence how people are voting to make something more viewed, and that is therefore vote manipulation. Period. That you're also trying to counterbalance your gained votes isn't really relevant because it's not about the karma so much as it's about the visibility. You just need to trust that people are going to upvote you if they feel this needs to be visible, and trying to influence them 'cuz everyone needs to see this!' isn't necessary or a valid excuse.

** Thanks for this, definitely helpful!

Can you maybe put each flair on its own line i.e. change formatting? It's hard to read on mobile!
