I am looking for a work that I remember reading but can't remember the title of or what site I found it on (I am hoping it wasn't Granger Enchanted as if that is the case I will never find it)

It involved Hermione doing some type of ritual after she and Ron broke up. The purpose was to show/get back at Molly Weasley for saying that she wasn't strong because she was a Muggle Born witch. It put doubts in Ron's head and caused her and Ron to break up. The spell was an old spell that was supposed to bring someone who hadn't had an heir from Molly's line back to life/to bond to Hermione and instead of one wizard it brought back several. Including Fred, one of the Prewett Brothers, Abraxas Malfoy (which later proved Lucius wasn't the Malfoy heir), Cedric Diggory and a few others. Ron went nuts after he found out and the men protected Hermione and Molly was calling her a necromancer. Harry was a git at first but eventually sided with Hermione.

I am remembering the story and the general gist of it but I am super annoyed that I can't remember the title or where it was. Does this ring a bell for anyone or does anyone have any suggestions? It's driving me a bit batty!


** It is called "Harem"

*** I actually really enjoyed it and am pretty bummed it was unfinished but truthfully it was pretty well written. Every one has their own opinion though :)

*** Having never read it I can't presume to have any idea how good or bad it is, but that summary does set off a /lot/ of red flags.
