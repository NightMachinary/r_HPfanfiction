I really like his wisened, grandfather-ly personality in Blindness and Harry Potter and the Game. The way he always knows more than he should, almost like some form of omniscience, is always nice.

Any fics with a lot of that? Not necessarily starring him, but fics where he's a prevalent and returning character who shows up in the bulk of the fics chapters.


** Well I suppose linkffn(The Ollivanders), though that is tad on the nose

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
