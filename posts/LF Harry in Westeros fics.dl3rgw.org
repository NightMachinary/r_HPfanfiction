  Another task had been given to him. Not one of prophecy, but of choice. He had long ago accepted his need to help people, to protect those who could not protect themselves. War was all he had known, all he was good at. It was time to help heal. But, sometimes, to save a life, you had to take one.

*** Does Into The Wild Westeros get anymore legible as it goes on? There are heaps of grammatical errors and misplaced words in the prologue!

**** I haven't read it since the update, which was like 5.5 months ago. I don't recall, it couldn't be atrocious or I'd not read it. I personally always skip ahead to a later chapter to see if grammar, sentence structure and if those sorts of things improve as the fic moves on. What I liked about the fic was it had some interesting ideas for the world building.

I have a sneaking suspicions it will be one of the fics that is all world building and will be abandoned after that's complete. I read it as I found the world building part interesting and it has been updated somewhat recently, so I threw it on the list. It's hard to rec fics that are dead and only in world building stages. There isn't a ton of really long HP/ASOIAF or GOT ones that make it far. It's partly why I quite like Sage1988, the fics actually get completed.

If the original poster wants there is another fic that you have to search google for. Last Hero's Heir. Harry follows Kreacher and the House Elves, who are Children of the Forest, back to Westeros post book 7. He gets paired with Lyanna. The author 'completed' it by posting the end of what they had intended to write. The fic starts great and continues being a breath of fresh air in the HP/ASOIAF crossovers. Eventually it kind of loses itself, or at least I think it does. I believe the author started getting a lot of horrid messages and deleted it.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

He will not be a sword at the side of his brother, a knight of the Kingsguard or what else his family plans. He will make his own destiny and show the world what 'Growing Strong' really means.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.
