** "Can you help us find Harry,sir ?" asked Hermione

"Sure." grunted the grizzled man in front of them before striking a match in his hand. "He's in the room on the left,he's been through a rough patch so be gentle."

"Thanks mate." said Ron

"Antime." said the man before downing a bottle of Firewhiskey

** 'Harry?' Dumbledore said stunned. The 30 year old in front of him didn't look much like Harry, with his long black hair, calloused fingers and several scars littering his face, but he still had his mother's eyes.\\
'Hm. Figured if I was gonna kill a man, might as well train for it were he couldn't find me,' the man said, idly messing around with a lighter. He seemed to contemplate setting his glass of whiskey on fire, but settled on drinking it.\\
'We thought you were dead!'\\
Harry refilled. 'Well, I appreciate your try at retrieving my dead body,' he said almost sardonically. 'But I've got to get going, got a client waiting. Sorry, could you just...' he gestured towards a room in the back.\\
McGonnagal was the only one who dared to ask the question.\\
'Client? For what?'\\
Harry aimed a sharp grin at her.\\
'Someone wants someone to kill his wife's lover,' he clarified. 'That or dismantle some explosives. It isn't always clear.'

They left.

#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978
