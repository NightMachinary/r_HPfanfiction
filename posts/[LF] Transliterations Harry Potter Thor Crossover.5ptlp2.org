It was a crossover by ikkiichiyuu on FFN, but the story can no longer be found. Does anyone know if it was archived somewhere, or anyone have a download? I tried searching but couldn't turn up anything.


** Only HP/Thor crossover I can think of is Child of the Storm linkffn(8897431)

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
