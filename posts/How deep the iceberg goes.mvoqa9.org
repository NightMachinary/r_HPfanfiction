For the past few days I'm contemplating about the fact that I know about the existence of these beautifully unique pieces of fanfiction:

A House Elf's Needs

Severus Snape, Professor and Lover

And because it won't leave my mind for some time, unfortunately... I want to know what is a deeper part of Harry Potter fanfiction's iceberg.

Sooo, can someone tell me? Pretty please.


** I'm gonna go on a limb and just assume what the two fics you mentioned are about and share the deepest iceberg I know. There I was, an innocent low-teens kid, wandering the pre-smut-purge fan fiction net. Searching for a new Severus Snape fic. Well, I probably found hundreds but two still stand out in my memory, literally more than a decade later.

Severus Snape/Hagrid. As far as I remember, Severus was... living in Hagrid's hut? I think it was because Severus was battling an addiction of some sort? Perhaps he had cancer, who knows. What's more important is that Severus for sure wasn't older than 15 or so. I bailed the moment Hagrid's ginormous dick was first mentioned.

This next one left a bigger impression on me however. It was... Severus Snape/Hedwig. He was sincerely and deeply in love with the owl. It was a passionate and heart wrenching romantic love. Also, he wanted to fuck the owl. Alas, their love was forbidden and no one could find out about it! Luckily, my mind has managed to forget literally everything else.

There's probably more... niche fics out there, but good god it's a relief to get this off my chest. Poor 12(?) year old me.

** 30Hs, although it's pretty well known. Imagine if Dethklok rewrote My Immortal.

** Missing Days by Charlotte Sometimes. What happened to Umbridge when she was carried off by centaurs. Spoiler alert: they humiliated, beat, and f***ed her. (Remember, Dumbledore didn't rescue her until a couple days later in canon.)

Oh wait, I can't link noncon. The only working link I have is on aff. There's an author of that name on FFN but without this story. (The stories there are nothing like this one, so I have no idea if it's even the same person.)
