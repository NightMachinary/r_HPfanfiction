Canon-compatible preferred, can take place during the books or post-DH.

  Sirius decides that it's time for Harry to receive 'The Talk', Harry just wishes he could escape- little does he know, he will never look at donuts or bananas the same way again.

** I'm not sure why this should be interesting in a well put-together canon story. Unless it is somehow, oh I don't know, Umbrige being forced to give him the talk.

Wait here for reader screams to end.

That's one way to prevent magical teen pregnancy. Or maybe it increases teen soul bonds by 40%.

Aaaaanyway, here's the outline for an unpublished scene from a chapter in my canon-adjacent story that I really should get out someday. It's almost that interesting.

--------------

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)

--------------

Goes something like this:

Harry ends up getting The Talk from Hermione's parents. And this is a Peggy-Sue second chance story, so he's like 30-something but in a teen's body. Very embarrassing. It's really awkward for him and he eventually just asks if he can write down what he knows already and they can fill in any gaps. He's so flustered, he actually writes down /everything/ technical he knows. It takes several pages. This, oddly enough, impresses the two serious and highly-intelligent *doctors*. (it has been so long since I outlined this, I'm a little fuzzy on whether or not I saw something like this part somewhere before.)

Then they /appear/ to start to give him the "warn Harry off their teenage daughter" bit every fluffy Harry/Hermione romance story seems to demand occurs. But it's sort of...off.

It turns out that they're actually warning /him/ that Hermione's a /year older than him/, as well as curious and precocious as geniuses often are, and he shouldn't let /her/ talk him into doing things he's not comfortable with or ready for yet. He should feel free to tell their daughter "no", and that their daughter is smart and level-headed, so that won't end their friendship if she truly cares for and respects him.

And Hermione's been eavesdropping, of course.

Her parents know this too, knowing their daughter's tendances, and because they aren't stupid ultra-prudes and are actually genius-level intelligence /adults/, they planned it that way. They're too smart to simply try to declare that two young people not do what comes naturally, eventually. Two young people with superpowers they don't understand, and who spend all but three months a year, during nearly all of their puberty, in Scotland. In a magical castle. With like eight adults amongst hundreds of kids. Yeah...

They know that the best way to discourage and demystify sexual experimentation is to talk about it openly. Not like sitcom characters.

--------------

I don't think I've ever seen someone actually have Hermione's parents react to a Harry/Hermione superfriends situation like rational, understanding, intelligent human beings. It's always, they're total nudists and don't mind a little friendly frottage between ohseriously?-year-olds, are walking stereotypes from the boring-old her father has a gun-trope, or are out of nowhere mega-conservatives who threaten Hermione with female genital mutilation if she so much as hugs a boy so it's a good things he's a Lord now and can just straight-up marry her.

Whew. That last one was painfully low on exaggerations.

It's not hard to write the parents of a highly intelligent young person as highly intelligent /adults/. Making them lunatic fringe or uncompromising bigots just for drama is so cheap and stupid. As is the usual The Talk people write for such characters.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** One of the best, if not THE, examples of the Talk I've ever seen in fanfiction can be found in chapter sixteen of linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs).

Here's it is:

Black looked at Harry. "Know what sex is?"

"Er, mostly."

"Do it before you're sixteen and I'll kick your ass."

"Oh, okay."

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
