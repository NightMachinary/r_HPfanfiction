Plot For example: The very sad scene cuts to James and Lily dying and leaving Harry as an orphan. Many years later, Harry now a man, has a family of his own and now an auror working in thr ministry and living with a peaceful.

Although, Due to some mysterious phenomenon, the dead started to come back and they began randomly appearing in places and some the places where they died. It would also bring stress to the ones handling the situation and also massive angst to the people, who can't accept them back.

Stories like these are mostly in the genre of Hurt/Comfort, Awkwardness, ( Drama, and Angst, which I mostly prefer)

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
