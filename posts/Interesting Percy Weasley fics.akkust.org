I remember reading a fic a while ago about Percy being a spy for the light all along (and was a seer?) and how he was fraying from the pressure of lying to his family and preventing all these deaths and by the final battle when he revealed himself he was like thinking like a million KPH trying to save everybody while everybody else was like wtf you weren't a git? He also liked yoga if that rings any bells for anybody, I wish I could remember it's name!

It was really well written and it made me think that I would like to read more stories that involved Percy as a more fleshed out character, good or bad. So if anybody can remember that specific fic or any other fics that have a well written Percy involved I would be really interested in hearing about it.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

Percy Take the Wheel. linkffn(12157282) The Weasleys are orphaned, Percy becomes guardian to the rest of the kids.

This Could Mean Danger. linkffn(7670511) Percy and Hermione start off as friends, they become less annoying people, and Percy never becomes a Ministry shill.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. Currently back in the works after a 6-year hiatus.
