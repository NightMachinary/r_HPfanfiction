Says in title. I want longfic rewrites of the series. Preferably over 300k words. Thanks!


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) and its sequel are around 400k words total. The sequel is getting a new chapter every few months, so if a nearly abandoned story is a deal-breaker, maybe not for you.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Serpents) and sequels are a Slytherin-Harry story that's similar to PoS (first two years are eerily similar, but AFAIK they were written independently at the same time) but actually moves through the plot. Is currently in the middle of year 5. The author normally is pretty good about releasing on a schedule, but I think it may be stalled, I'm not caught up currently.

** You can see the flair, you know why I'm here. It has 600k words so far.

/run(script.MeaningOfOne)/

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.
