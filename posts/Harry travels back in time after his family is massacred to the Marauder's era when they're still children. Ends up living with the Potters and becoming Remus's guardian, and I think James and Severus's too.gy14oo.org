#+TITLE: Harry travels back in time after his family is massacred to the Marauder's era when they're still children. Ends up living with the Potters and becoming Remus's guardian, and I think James and Severus's too?

I read this story ages ago on ff.net and I'm really spotty on the details, so some of this may be wrong. As the title states, Harry's family (Ginny and the kids) are massacred - I think it might've actually been by a dark Ron, or DEs out for revenge like a decade later? Harry is traumatized. He travels back in time, I believe by accident. I think Fawkes is the one who takes him there. Once he realizes where he is he pretends to be a more distant relative of the Potters and James' parents take him in. He ends up becoming an auror, I think, and as the Potters get to know him they ask him to be James' guardian if anything happens to them. Through a series of events he also takes in Remus and at least one other boy - either Severus or Sirius, I can't really remember for sure. Possibly both?

That's about all I can remember. I know it's not much but does anyone have any idea what fic this is? I've been looking for it off and on for years! Thanks in advance.
