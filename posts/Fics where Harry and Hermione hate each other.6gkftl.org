Any fics where Harry and Hermione hate each other, or even a one sided hatred?

Asking cause I'm kinda tired of seeing fics where they become friends even when Harry is raised by Death Eaters. I'd like to see one where they don't like each other in the slightest.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

***** I can live with turncoat Weasleys. They did some pretty suspicious stuff that you can interpret that way (Molly not reporting Harry's abuse to the authorities, Arthur seeing muggles like intelligent pets and belittling them, Ron and his jealousy...)

But Hermione was the one who erased herself from her parents memory for him. The one who never deserted him. Who knew that the DoM was a trap and still went because her best friend insisted on going. The betrayal plot simply doesn't work for her.

****** Actually it make a lot of sense. Hermione DID betray Harry in the fifth book when she stopped any contact with him even if she knew that it will hurt him. Why did she do it? Because Dumbledore said so. Hermione would betray Harry without a doubt if Dumbledore asked her.

** There was one where they were really hostile to each other Harry mocked her at one point calling her a mudblood knowing she hates the word then she tried to slap him and he broke her wrist and then after she went to Dumbledore to tell him what happened he did something where Hermione in the bathroom heard a voice hissing saying she's pathetic she knows the two words then she saw a flash of green light and heard "Avada Kedavra!" when she came to she saw her wand and engraved on it was "AK" but I can't for the life of me remember what fic it was. It may have been the same one where Harry gets information from Rita Skeeter by invading her dreams as Darth Vadar. I know someone knows what fic I'm talking about so I'll just leave this here

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

*** I know right?

"Kukuku, I, Hadrian Potter, am the heir to Lord Voldemort's dark empire. My only contact with other people has been Death Eaters, and I've grown up hearing tales of Pureblood superiority and how Muggleborns are filth. But that Hermione girl is getting good grades so I guess this suddenly means that everything I've ever heard was wrong."

I fucking hate when they try to use "Oh Hermione is great at schoolwork!" as a reason for why the entire Pureblood ideology is wrong. That isn't to say I agree with the whole 'Purebloods are superior' angle. But come on people, these kids have spent their entire young lives learning that Muggles and 'Mudbloods' are inferior to Purebloods. They aren't going to magically change their entire outlook on life just because one muggleborn girl happens to be the best in class.
