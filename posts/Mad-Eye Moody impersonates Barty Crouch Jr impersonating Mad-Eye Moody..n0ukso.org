Basically, Moody was constantly vigilant and managed to capture his kidnapper-to-be. He uses legilimency to learn Barty's plans and decides to help put Harry in the tournament, so he can sabotage the ressurection, or something.

** No, we know for a fact that polyjuice has the power to make you physically larger/smaller. Moody polyjuices as Babymort and no one notices the difference because he just curses Pettigrew and Crouch every time he sees them.

*** Pretty sure that wouldn't work, on account of polyjuice only working for human transformations. Voldemort's homunculus is inhuman at best, and a purely magical construct at worst.

**** If you can't bend the rules for the sake of The Rule of Cool, when can you? There is very little that cannot be countered by the right mix of handwavium and phlebotinum. In this case, perhaps, something about how much of moody has been replaced by magical constructs. Or, hell, maybe he just shrinks himself; he's ugly, the homunculus is ugly, who could tell the difference? (Dislaimer: This is an example of the possible rationale of a character in a non-existent crack fic, I do not personally believe all tiny ugly baby-like homunculi look or are the same, nor do I support discrimination against tiny ugly baby-like homunculi. If you encounter discrimination against tiny ugly baby-like homunculi, please report it to the relevant authorities)

  His plans to insert himself within the guts of the Ministry of Magic have been highly successful, his apprentices are proving to be both talented and intuitive, and his efforts to consolidate his position within the mundane world are proceeding nicely. But as he knows all to well, all plans disintegrate on contact with reality...and what is English Heritage anyway?
