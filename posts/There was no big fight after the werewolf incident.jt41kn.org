I think its like everyone's headcanon that there was a some sort of big fight between at least one marauder and Sirius after he told Snape to go to Wolf Lupin. In most fics I've read the bullying Snape goes down after this too because its all less funny when you almost get the guy killed.

Except that in Snape's memories in book 7 you see that the werewolf thing happened before the mudblood incident with Snape and Lilly.

So they dislike him just as much and there's no real hesitation or awkwardness or guilt about fucking with Snape after the werewolf thing. Its not like a defensive thing they go out of their way and the most you get is mild exasperation from Lupin.

Which makes me think maybe that big fight didn't happen or was more minor. But more importantly they came out of the incident more irritated with Snape than Sirius. Enough that they don't hesitate to be a dick to him. So I'm curious if we assume that did happen, that they were still mad at Snape after, what do you think would have caused it?

( Also I've seen alot where they are mad at Sirius and its in alot of different Marauders fics so I figured an alternative scenario is interesting to explore üòä)


** I think there's an argument to be made that Snape wasn't wrong when he said James wasn't playing the hero, but was saving his friends' necks. And I think James would agree. They don't care about Snape, so the argument would've been 'You exposed Remus and almost made him a murderer' and I do think it happened. Remus probably didn't speak to Sirius for a good bit.

#+begin_quote
  what do you think would have caused it?
#+end_quote

Snape's reason for following them around was ‚ÄòI'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.'

This is said right before:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄòThey sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?'

  ‚ÄòHe's ill,' said Lily. ‚ÄòThey say he's ill --'

  ‚ÄòEvery month at the full moon?' said Snape.

  ‚ÄòI know your theory,' said Lily, and she sounded cold.
#+end_quote

So if the 'prank' happened 'the other night' you can make the argument Snape had guessed Remus was a werewolf beforehand and said as much to Lily. In this case, it's entirely possible Snape alluded to it to Sirius, who relayed it to the other 3, in which case they understand Snape, was, at the very least, out to expose Remus.

Or they continued to bully because he was being nosy.

*** Didnt Lily and Snape cut their communication immediatly after Lily was called a mudblood? Iirc, the Sirius-Snape werewolf incident happnened in year 6, after Lily was called a mudblood.

Even then, it's not like Snape stopped being a absolute dick to pepole that werent pureblooded after he and Lily cut ties, quite the opposite, Snape went on to become a loyal death eater that didnt care that he essentially put an entire family in line of execution by the dark lord, only when his former friend/crush/obsession were treatened did he change his ways.

Snape got worse as the years went on, as noted by Lily noting that she had made excuses, and that Snape hung around pepole that tormented other students and tried to talk it away as childish acts

*** So maybe Sirius explained his thought process as Snape indicated he found out. So Sirius says something like I thought if we got rid of him it would be safer Moony wouldn't be exposed. And the Marauders thought it was impulsive and stupid and could have gotten Lupin into alot of trouble but sympathized with wanting Snape dead if it meant Lupin wasn't exposed. Because they care about Lupin not Snape and so were more salty with Snape afterwards for trying to out Lupin in the first place than Snape almost dying.

Not to be so dark I mean if Snape had gotten killed I do see them as the type that would burry that body together.

**** If, Remus had killed or turned Severus into a Werewolf, Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save anyone.

Remus would have been sent to Azkaban or killed. Not only for the bias against Werewolves, but for killing or turning another student.

Sirius, likely would have faced expulsion.

Heck, maybe even Dumbledore would have been punished. The fact that he had willingly brought in a Werewolf, would be out in the public, and with people's fear/bias against Werewolves, that would be a big thing. I don't see Dumbledore being killed or thrown in Azkaban, but I could see him potentially lose his job as a Headmaster.

Would a teenager be able to live with the fact that another teenager had been killed?

If, it was Remus, I don't think he'd last long with the guilt. Even if he doesn't remember everything that happens when he's a Werewolf, and his friends lie to him at first, he'd be able to piece together why Severus is no longer at Hogwarts.

People like to bash on James, for the rivalry with Severus, but I also don't think James would be able to live with the guilt of what had happened. "If I had only come in sooner" Who knows, it'd probably break them, someone would likely confess.

Lucius: "Dumbledore put a dangerous beast in a place full of children! If he can do that, without caring for others safety, what else can he do?"

Werewolves have a huge fear/bias in canon, and I don't see Dumbledore losing too much power, because yes, he's what Voldemort truly fears, but at the same time, I could see him losing being a Headmaster.

Remus dead or in Azkaban, Sirius expelled, or not expelled but feeling extremely guilty of what happened to Remus, Dumbledore lost (some, not all), of his power. Dark wizards/witches gaining a bit more control of things... if I had the ability, I'd write that myself.

** I am not 100 percent sure. I actually never really thought about it...

But now I think this might seed a possible distrust / rift between Remus and Sirius. This has consequences when later on the secret keepers are switched.

IMO Sirius has always been reckless, just an impulsive gryffindor. Before this incident I don't think Remus would ever think Sirius would hurt them intentionally. He trust Sirius 100 percent. He might not always think Sirius is as smart or as light but I don't think Remus believes Sirius is a bad person. However The werewolf incident probably shows Remus that he is not as important to Sirius. Otherwise Sirius would put Remus well being above teaching Severus a lesson. Sirius knows what a burden being a werewolf is to Remus. But he did it anyway...

Do I think Sirius did it intentionally to hurt Remus. No but I do think it set a precedent for their rif. As I don't think Sirius ever really realizes what a mistake, what a betrayal he actually did to Remus. I honestly think he is stupid. Reckless and just not thinking. At the end of the day he has a dark steak. He is a black after all. And young (frontal lobes not developed etc). However the betrayal Remus felt would have shown up between them. Maybe in the little things eg. Remus having a bit more distance. Remus might not disapprove loudly or at all but there are glances. There are stares. Pregnant pauses. A laugh that is too stilted after a new prank idea was told. And Sirius would have felt the distance. In his mind Sirius probably didn't think he did anything real bad or wrong. And he would probably shift the guilt and blame on Remus. Because Remus was always a goody two shoe. Remus was always too Serious (I know the pun is too obvious. Couldn't not write it haha). And that mistrust rubbed Sirius the wrong way. As he doesn't really have a family. James and his friend are his real family. But is Remus really on his side? Or not...

And then James and lily went into hiding. Sirius became the secret keeper. Remus knows.

Sirius changes but never tells Remus. Because why would he. Remus would probably be judgmental again. He probably would have other ideas. He already doesn't really trust Sirius. But Sirius thinks switching keepers is the best idea. How they would fool voldysnorts.

Remus would never suspect (shitty) weak ass Peter. But he would believe that Sirius switches side. He know the dark Sirius has. And how he could betray Remus when they were young. How he could do it now. Again.

And thus. This might be how the werewolf would be the start of a rippling effect.

** I think it is much more likely that Snape was trying to out Lupin and kill him, thus gaining notoriety with his wannabe Death Eater friends and discrediting Dumbledore for allowing a werewolf inside a school. James ran to the Willow to save Lupin, not Snape. That's why no one was punished for the event and the Marauders were still pissed with Snape. It also explains why James and Sirius attack Snape in his "worst memory" for no reason that they can explain to Lily, at least in public, and why Lupin stays silent.

There likely would have been a row among the Marauders because Sirius did not consider the consequences of his actions, but immediately apologized for it.

*** Oh that makes sense it then also makes a little more sense why Sirius essentially was ok with sending him to die if he thought Snape was trying to actually kill Remus. Snape felt justified because he saw Remus as a monster. Snape was a death eater supporter so you could argue Sirius and perhaps even the other Marauders felt justified a bit by seeing Snape as a monster. James saves him because Lupin could get in trouble and they don't want that but they probably wouldn't be as mad at Sirius then. And be way more mad at Snape so they are still really close after and probably fuck with Snape even more after so you get Snapes worst memory after.

None of that changes anything about the reasons they all hate Snape.

** I had the same reaction. I always figured that the ‚ÄúMudblood‚Äù scene/Snape's worst memory had come before the werewolf/Shrieking Shack incident. I figured that Snape had lost his friendship with Lily beforehand, and had had to face the aftermath of the attack on his own. I saw this as the catalyst that pushed him further towards the Death Eaters (clearly he couldn't trust the school administration to protect him), and started sowing the seeds of discord amongst the Marauders (leading credence in the future that there was a spy and that Sirius was capable of murder).

Flipping the order is just bizarre. It means that the Marauders are still somewhat tight - they think nothing of tormenting the boy that they nearly killed, and who they depend on to keep Lupin's secret. It also means that Snape tries to hint at the attack to Lily and she just blows him off.

As [[/u/Ash_Lestrange][u/Ash_Lestrange]] said, it makes more sense that Snape was only sharing a theory with Lily, and the actual attack came later. Snape may have left the attack out of his memories because it was immaterial to the information that Harry needed.

***** to be fair Rowling might have not been considering this arc with the marauders when she made that timeline in book 7

but he is intense in the passage

/Snape's whole face contorted and he spluttered, ‚ÄúSaved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too! You're not going to --- I won't let you ---‚Äù/

  /‚ÄúLet me? Let me?"/

 /Lily's bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once./

  /‚ÄúI didn't mean --- I just don't want to see you made a fool of --- He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!‚Äù The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. ‚ÄúAnd he's not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch hero ---‚Äù Snape's bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent./

This is post the werewolf incident and he's still very fixated on James. I'm going to guess he was also pretty fixated on discovering their secret/outing Lupin maliciously. Plus he was at this point already friends with future death eaters who were already showing their own problematic sides.

/We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?‚Äù/

  /Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face./

  /‚ÄúThat was nothing,‚Äù said Snape. ‚ÄúIt was a laugh, that's all ---‚Äù/

  /‚ÄúIt was Dark Magic, and if you think thats funny-"/

So maybe they are just still mad at the wizard nazi supporter who is obsessed with them and trying to expose their friend and potentially ruin his life. It's kind of consistent with the memory as Lilly asks why he's so obsessed with them anyway. And he responds that he wants to show people that they aren't so perfect.

** I think the big Marauders' argument over the Incident was a really good idea of the fanfic authors. It's interesting to see them cope with such a serious (pun intended) breach of trust and how they analyse the possible consequences has the 'prank succeeded‚Äò (it's all very well justified so the reactions of the four feel real). However I don't believe it actually happened. Sirius' reaction ‚Äòserved him right!‚Äò when the prank is mentioned by Remus in POA indicates that there were no real consequences for him, that his friends didn't put him through some big fight or a silent treatment so that Sirius would think it all through and realise he could have really caused a lot of trouble for Remus. I think it all went down to them blaming Snape for following them around and maybe being more vicious towards Snape because of it.

Let's remember that there were other situations when Remus could have potentially hurt someone but they ‚Äòwere young‚Äò and ‚Äòlaughed about it afterwards' - so even though these situations surely weren't as dangerous as the Incident I still think it was kind of brushed aside as another slip that has nearly happened. Also Remus being Remus probably wouldn't really want to create a situation that could lead to their friendship group break - he already bent his morale and didn't stand up to his friends in order to help other students so with his low self-esteem it's seems dubious that he would stand up to Sirius in his own case.\\
I really like they way ‚Äòshoebox project' presented how it came about to Sirius telling Snape about the Willow - he didn't want Snape to go through the tunnel, he just wanted him to be beaten by the tree 'cos they've had an argument and Snape worked it out by himself that this is where Remus is. Later Snape takes offence that Sirius tried to get him killed but the fact Sirius only mentioned to him to "go jab your head into that big knot on the Whomping Willow" prevents Sirius from being expelled.\\
Overall I think there was no argument and they were still awful to Snape because a) they were pissed Snape discovered the secret and could have caused a lot of trouble for Remus if he got killed/turned b) some further association with Dark Magic (what about the incident with Mary MacDonal?) c) they just never ceased to treat him differently, incident or not they still had the same way of treating him.

*** Omg you so right ! I totally forgot that comment. And ya if he's reacting like that they likely had no fight. Even if Sirius hates Snape he'd reflect on that memory differently if Moony say had a huge argument with him after and he felt he hurt his friend.

And while I do think its a sort of development in fics creates tension and all that. But I do kind of crave stories where that fight doesn't happen. Just because its something I haven't seen before. Though specifically if its like still a nuanced read on the Marauders and not and they didn't fight cuz they just generic bullies who hated Snape cuz thats more boring to me.

**** I relate on a spiritual level with the need of a fanfic with no fight. Sadly, Shoebox is the only one that I've read and has no negative reaction in it at all (but it is a wolfstar fic and so the whole thing isn't exactly represented in the way I'd have imagined it after reading ootp for the first time).One of my all time favourite Marauders era fics linkao3(1110486) deals with it a bit differently - there is some silent treatment but it's definitely not overdone - James kind of decides that enough is enough and after a week he‚Äòs back to normal with Sirius and Remus, instead of having a fight with Sirius, explains to him how this affects his life and how hurt he is. Bear in mind it is also a wolfstar fic, very slow burn, so I think that the decision to deal with the aftermath of the Incident in this way is great - it fits perfectly to later establish their relationship and definitely sets the right direction to later make them suspect each other of being the traitor even though they were together (as much as I love shoebox it's difficult for me to imagine how Sirius and Remus would start to mistrust each other after the events of last chapters, they have such a great relationship), also there are many other great hints and foreshadowing to explain how they all are gonna get to the point they're in on 31st October 1981. I can‚Äòt recommend this fic enough, it's the perfect prequel I‚Äòve always needed.

However I would really like to see the fic with more arrogant side of the Marauders, the impression I've got of them after reading snape's worst memory for the very first time, and where they're less concerned about the whole Incident in general - after all most of the time authors try to work with the info from cannon in the way that makes more relatable characters so we don't exactly see the ‚Äòbullying toerags'

***** Thanks for the rec!

And ya any time I see Marauders in a bad light I see them as like cartoonish bullies or like they were dicks but recognized the error of their ways and it totally forgets that like Snape was basically wizard Nazi in training who was supportive of genociding muggleborns and the marauders would have felt pretty righteous and on the good side for fucking him over. While they may change grow and develop through life could have gone their whole lives not once regretting being a dick to Snape. And as you pointed out...they kinda pretty much did.

And people who weren't Harry didn't really see an issue with that. No one except Lilly defended Snape Dumbledore made James Headboy and all the teachers look back on them fondly minus Snape. Hell even Lilly turns her back once he calls her a mudblood confirming his mentality. So her defense of him came from thinking deep down he wasn't actually in favor of a hate group. Once she stopped believing she stopped defending.
