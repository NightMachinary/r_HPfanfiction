**** Curious, can you elaborate on how you compared the technical competency of the two? I'd definitely rank DPSW lower, but I don't feel like I have strong reason for doing so. The best I can muster is that the plot feels rushed (so much happens in the first 5 chapters) and Harry's personality feels forced and kind of grating (and it's hard to determine if that's because he's poorly written or if I just don't like that style of character)

***** When evaluating a Fanfic I tend to use the following criteria to judge it:

1. Technical competency- I separate this into two categories: narrative competency and grammatical competency. Both Prince of Slytherin and DPSW do a good job of avoiding major grammatical errors in short both are clearly readable and that sets them above at least half of all fanfics. Then narrative competency like you mentioned this is where DPSW lags a little while both have their stumbles early (although in the case of Prince of Slytherin the author has clearly gone back to update and fix his errors to improve the story) but you rightly note that the plot rushes early but even that isn't too bad and is more a reflection of Harry's own variation on Slytherin characteristics bold cunning to seize any advantage he can as swiftly as he can. This Harry is OP and is intended to be OP his only challengers are Dumbledore and Voldemort who are also OP and I don't think he is poorly written but this style of character is not for everyone.
2. Interesting premise (to me)- It does not matter if you write with the skill of the greatest literary minds of all kind if you write pairings I don't like or setups I find too grimderp I am not reading your fic.
3. Good execution- Even if a fic has a good idea if it fails to execute that idea well I am not reading it. For example, despite my enjoyment of Harry/Hermione I am refusing to read robst's newest fic because it features Harry and Hermione attempting to marry at the age of 13 and 14 and that cross a line for me.

******* No problem personally I find it funny that the Harry with less magical, social, and political power is the Harry that I see as most effective. In DPSW all Harry has been able to do is deadlock the Wizagamot, remove Dumbledore from Hogwarts, and barely keep himself financially afloat. Meanwhile in Prince of Slytherin Harry has forged a Greengrass-Patil-Longbottom-Malfoy political alliance to challenge the dominant political family the Selwins, end the Malfoy-Weasley feud, end Malfoy's support for Voldemort, become the king maker in Slytherin and gain major independence from his father without any real starting advantages.

***** If you care for a reply from someone else than the person you replied to, POS fans acknowledge that the first year is terrible (or, as some put it, "has problems") but say that everything on from year 2 is amazing.

Well, I read the first year and a bit into second year and saw none of this improvement that was promised. It was still a lot of blandly written tell-no-show, exposition on top of exposition, bashing, poor dialogue, things straining suspension of disbelief (like 12 year old Harry talking about his "legal and political advisors"), but most of all, the author chucking every idea they've had sitting on the toilet into the story, thinking they're so clever for bogging down whatever main plot they had with bloated filler. And meta jokes about IKEA and Scooby-Doo. [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] material.

I once read a fic that attempted to fix everything about canon with mounds of poorly written filler. I see POS as the fandom's heir to MOR. I can understand if people who liked MOR like POS, but anyone that doesn't like MOR, I'm baffled that they like POS.

The bashing and straining suspension of disbelief I also can see, but I feel like the author has done a good job of either explaining or teasing the explanation for most of it (James is still kinda unbelievable, even with what info we've gotten so far). I tend to think of myself as fairly sensitive to bashing, especially with Ron and Dumbledore, who both come off pretty poorly in this fic, but I'm still fine with their characterization for whatever reason :\

For the blandness, telling instead of showing, and poor dialogue, again I must just be glossing over it (or the particular type of poor quality is actually my style), because I really enjoy the writing.

TL;DR I see your points and think they're valid, but don't feel the same way and don't have a great explanation as to why that's the case XD

**** First and foremost I would like to preface whatever criticism I may have by acknowledging that the author can undoubtedly write, I am not denying their technical skill.

Patron and Divided and Entwined feels like a female fantasy to an extent. Where Harems are the Male fantasy, the author uses Hermione as the perfect SI, leading to the characterization of Hermione is rather poor without any real flaws.

Let me point out a couple things to prove my point.

In Patron it was all the girls coming to Harry's training sessions not for training but for him /and yet he chooses Hermione./ Lots of options and he chooses you? Awww.

In Divided and Entwined the author has Harry and Ron /fight over Hermione./ Isn't that wonderful? Doesn't that just make sense? 2 guys fighting over the perfect girl in the middle of a war. But I digress.

*In summary, Hermione feels awful like an SI the author wishes herself to be. This female fantasy is why I am surprised to see it recced so often.*

Aside:

Furthermore I would also point out that the plots (especially of Divided) make no sense.

The Dark Lord grew up during WW2. He would be terrified of what was going on. Surely a Dark Lord would learn all he could about a potential threat? And yet somehow he is defeated/damaged heavily through muggle means. That's ludicrous.

And even if you have a suspension of disbelief for that. How does he not respond on kind? Surely the escalation of muggle armaments demands an answer. Furthermore the Dark Lord would know much much more about muggle weapons than an extremely sheltered teenage girl much less military strategy.

I'm not going to comment on the whole romance thing, just that I believe it was poorly handled. Ok maybe I will just a bit. Trial dates? What self respecting man would let themselves be /degraded/ like that. That's honestly kind of insulting.

As to Patron? The whole dark mark is bogus. I'm not going to say anymore on that; it speaks for itself.

In Divided and Entwined, Voldemort does use a bomb to take out his enemies among the Aurors - and at the same time, blames the Resistance for it since he obviously wouldn't use muggle means, would he? And he isn't defeated through muggle means, but through the mind attack Harry was trained for by Dumbledore.

With regards to romances, I don't agree that a girl has to be perfect to be a love interest. Love isn't rational. And not all men simply pick the most attractive girl they can get. Nor do all men drop their girlfriend to sleep around.

****** First and foremost I want to reiterate I find your writing rather well done; there is no question you are a capable writer.

My issue is not with his overall defeat but the 'Resistance' as a whole. This group would not prove any real threat to Voldemort, and considering how large of a part this is of the plot, I take issue with the way Voldemort responds to it.

I agree a girl does not have to be perfect; however the way Hermione is written tends to put her in a positive light, so much so that we perceive her as perfect.

As to the preferences of men? I agree.

But the fact remains that the /reason those girls were paraded in front of Harry/ was to add weight to his decision to choose Hermione. It was to elevate her, to put her on a pedestal. It may not have been the intention, but it was the affect.

The 'trial' dates between Ron and Harry did something similar. 2 guys wanting the same girl. That isn't in and of itself damning, but the whole scenario seems set up to show Hermione as desirable and perfect. What girl wouldn't want 2 somewhat attractive men to fight over her?

I do want to take issue with your trial dates as that honestly kind of angered me. What kind of man has such low self esteem that they allow themselves to be entered into a /contest/ of sorts. It's practically saying I'm not sure if you are good enough for me but I'll find out. Hermione has known them for over 5 years; surely she does not need to do something of the sort.

I find it degrading that two Male characters, neither with overly low self esteem are put into that scenario.

******* In any fight between wizards, finding your enemy is the biggest challenge unless you're fighting the government. Voldemort couldn't do much about the Resistance if he couldn't find them. And, something you either ignored or forgot, the Resistance was working closely with Dumbledore, who provided a lot of their intel. As far as "couldn't provide a real threat" goes - in canon, six half-trained students, ambushed in a trap, even, stood up to a dozen of Voldemort's best. Double that number, with more training, should do better, in my opinion. Especially if they have the advantage to be the attackers and ambushers, and military training.

With regards to Patron, you seem stuck on the idea that if a guy sticks with his girlfriend that's putting her on a pedestal. That sounds weird to me. The whole "parading" was part of the conflict between Harry and Hermione's muggle values, and the AU's wizard traditions - mainly, the "Year of Exploration".

With regards to D&D, Hermione was caught between her two best friends, and settled on a stupid method to decide because she didn't want to hurt anyone. She didn't say "you might not be good enough for me". And they went along with it because they didn't want to hurt anyone either. Once more, you seem stuck on "this is just being done to set her up as desirable, and therefore wrong".

Quite simple, I don't get the underlying complaint. What is wrong with having a heroine who's desirable? Why is a heroine condemned for being desirable, but the hero isn't when put in the same situation, aka, has a love interest and is faithful to her despite temptation? Or has to decide between two women?

I really don't get that double standard. When I write characters, I generally don't focus on their gender outside specific circumstances - dealing with sexism, for example.

Obi-Wan: pros: literally the poster boy jedi. Patient, greatest form 3 specialist in the order, probably one of the best generals the order has ever produced. Dedicated to the order and republic. His cons are of course that he is not flexible when it comes to the jedi code and lifestyle its part of why Anakin fell the the dark side, he couldnt confide his fears to obi-wan. He can let his emotions get the better of him at points. And of course he sucks at flying.

Qui-Gon: Pros: a servant of the force not the order, willing to break the code it the force tells him to or if he thinks it will benefit the order in the long run (ala Anakin). More emotional than other jedi. Great teacher and as obi wan said if he wasnt a maverick hed be on the council. Cons: his dedication to form four got him killed. He is still a jedi and still has the flaws of the modern order even if they are down played. He alienates others because if his faith in the force.

Han: pros hes loyal to his friends, probanly the best non force sensative pilot of his era, one of the greatest shots in the galaxy behind Bobba Fett. Cons: he is a smuggler and will put his best interest above his friends and will sometimes let greed blind him, is stubborn and like all corelians prideful to a fault.

Leia: great leader on par with both her biological parents and her adoptive father in terms of charisma and ability to lead both troops and politicians. Very empathetic to others and theyre emotions. Puts the needs of the many before herself. Her cons are shes is still Anakin and Padmes daughter. Luke inherited his mothers patience and his fathers cockyness. Liea inherited her mothers pride and her fathers anger and it shows especially in legends.

This is why people took umbrige to Rey, she didnt have major character flaws and she still doesnt.

************** Indiana Jones is a horrible person. Especially if you look at Temple of Doom where he's arguably evil for a vast majority of it and his only real motivation is profit and he treats women horribly.

It's also heavily implied in Raider's Of the Lost Ark that he seduced Marion when she was underage (15 when he was 25). And that he essentially just ghosted her.

He's pretty much a jerk to everyone around him, from constantly telling people they're idiots to believing in the ark, to a terrible relationship with his father.

And then there's the comically crippling fear of snakes.

He also constantly makes mistakes and is often wrong in his stories. He miscalculates his jumps, he forgets he lost his gun, he gets his ass kicked, he's almost murdered by at least two different native tribes before Dues Ex Machina. And he pretty much fails at everything he tries to do in Raider's where the Nazis are always one step ahead of him. He pretty much loses for the entirety of the plot of Raiders until the Ghosts show up to melt the Nazis.

Then, couple it with the fact that he's mostly irrelevant for the plot of Raider's makes the world feel considerably more real and gives him more of an everyman vibe than a hero vibe. Which in turn makes him relatable. His wins often boil down to luck and action and despite being the hero there's often tension that he might not win, because he often doesn't until the end. Hell, in the heat of it he's often more of a bumbling fool than an action hero.

His series is interesting in that we don't really get it in a linear way. Had it opened with Temple of Doom I feel like people would have reacted very differently to Dr. Jones than they do. Because he is really horrible and flawed in that film. But he is given an arc that makes him develop into someone the audience is more capable of empathizing with.

All of his films have him grow through them. In Radier's he becomes less of an arrogant sod and accepts the Supernatural and acknowledges how terrible he was to Marian.

In Temple of Doom he goes from Grave Robber eying profit to the more respectable archaeologist we understand him to be.

In Last Crusade he gets the cliched family matters lessen and comes to terms with his strained relationship with his father. And in Crystal Skull we get an advance of that with him coming to terms with Marian and realizing that he is a father.

Comparing character flaws like that to: "Not being good at flying" would be like if Indiana Jones was "Not very good at piloting a submarine". It likely wouldn't matter or have any agency on the actual plot and is utterly irrelevent. And it isn't even a flaw it's just a lack of a skill that could be learned if needed.

Giving Hermione a flaw would be something like pointing out that she's likely a lonely person, struggles with making friends, is incredibly bossy when she doesn't get her way, isn't great in social situations and she's incredibly bad, to the point of flat refusal in some cases, at improvisation. Those flaws should then hinder the character in drastic ways.

********** Yeah you calling that a core theme makes me think I was right to, sorry. It's not a core theme, It's just mentioned multiple times a chapter in an almost predatory way. Like people don't talk about normal parts of life that way. In your universe that is a normal thing.

  What is wrong with having a heroine who's desirable? Why is a heroine condemned for being desirable, but the hero isn't when put in the same situation, aka, has a love interest and is faithful to her despite temptation?
#+end_quote

Also just to reference this, it's not the heroine being desirable, it's the expression of it. Having lots of people hit on them isn't a bad thing, having Harry choose her over them isn't a bad thing, lining 50 people up and having him physically point at her is just a bit..twee...ditto trial dates, formalising it makes it weird and like something out of a rom/com.

*********** Wow, fifty witches? Pointing at her? Hyperbole much?

Harry was hit upon by a few witches, tops. A few more were flirting with him. The vast majority respected that he was in a relationship, and made fun of those who didn't. There wasn't any pointing or line up - he simply acted like many men in a relationship do when someone flirts with them or asks them out.

With regards to the Year of Exploration, teenagers are likely to talk about sex, and the YoE is like Spring Break - something hyped, but usually not as "hot" as people claim. (Which Sirius and Remus even explained to Harry and Hermione at a later date, after they realised that the two didn't know much about the YoE.)

I think you are underestimating how that comes across, particularly when it's the majority of the romantic interactions we see in the fanfiction and, like you said, it's done entirely to make a point.

#+begin_quote
  the YoE is like Spring Break - something hyped, but usually not as "hot" as people claim.
#+end_quote

So it's discussed in your fic more than anything i've ever seen in real life and you've actually summed up quite well the two main issues with it. The first being teenagers talk about sex, sure, but no one talks only about Spring Break from the age of 11 through to 17. Tbh I don't think you'd even mention it until it's your turn to go. It's definitely not the focal point of social life the way it comes across in your fic.

Also year grand hyped up but not all it's claimed to be, except you're writing a story. You hyped it up. (Then didn't deliver - I assume from what you're saying, I never got close to actually reading about it). But you hyped it up endlessly, it really wasn't that interesting to hear about multiple times a chapter, particularly when you didn't elaborate on what it was, like you said.

************* Well, the YoE is one of the things you do talk about. Also, they talked about it from year 4 - that's rather close to 6. Not to mention that you see the current 6th years at school.

And as I said - it's one of the main differences between muggle and wizard culture. There's a reason the wizards think muggles are prudes in that story.

But hey - you don't like it, that's your business.

It kind of goes against cannon, and while it might make sense in some aspects the Wizarding world isn't like the English aristocracy. Also as much as I love a good political fic, the Wizengamot isn't as powerful as people make it out to be in fannon- most power comes from the Minister.

**** I don't expect anyone to worship cannon, and people are free to do as they please, it's fanfic. The question is about personal preferences. I think that all fanfic is about exploring your creativity while following some of the basic rules established by the universe you're writing in. Those rules are such: there is no Wizarding aristocracy, the Wizengamot isn't that powerful, Harry doesn't gain anything special by being Lord Potter-Black-Peverell. If you're going to disregard the basic rules of the Wizarding world then you might as well say at the beginning you're going to do so and give a reason for doing so. Otherwise it's just original fiction. That's fine too, but then it's not really fan fiction
