** I can't say that I expected it when I read HBP. But it does follow the two main paths of MC romances that I've noted.

Male MC gets with Female MC. Or Male MC gets together with first appropriate female character we're introduced to.

McGonagall, Narcissa(?), Molly, and then Ginny.

The Sword of Truth: Richard and Kahleen. First male MC and first female MC. Also the first of each gender introduced. IIRC.

The Inheritance Cycle: Arya and Eragorn. First male MC and first female MC. Also the first of each gender to be introduced.
