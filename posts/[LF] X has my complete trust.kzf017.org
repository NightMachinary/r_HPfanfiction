I'm sure most of us have seen stories where Snape has gotten away with murder (sometimes literally), because he has Dumbledore's trust and is “no more a Death Eater than Dumbledore himself”.

Has anyone written a story where Dumbledore is forced to stand by as Snape is being punished because whoever is doling out justice “has the complete trust of the person(s) in charge” ?

(Yes.. Serverus Snape gets on my tits, and I'm feeling vindictive)

Snape gets punished because he's Neville boggart. Dumbledore tries to intervene, but it doesn't work

  Just a short piece taking place in the aftermath of Lupin's boggart lesson, the identity of Neville's boggart has some ramifications.
