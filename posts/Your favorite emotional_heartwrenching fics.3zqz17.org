** Well, /Faith and Understanding/ is a sort of emotional manipulation. It's not particularly extreme in any overly sad or angsty or insanely happy way. But it feels utterly real. It follows Ginny Weasley and her friendship with Luna Lovegood. Ginny and Luna laugh and cry, argue and ponder and grow. This story is the purest example of a platonic friendship that I've ever seen.

** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). It's been a while since I last read it, but it's really good for that sort of thing. It starts out really interestingly, and then it ever-so-gradually gets your hopes up - and then 3/5 of the way through the fic, the bomb gets dropped. The rest of the fic is just trying to make the fallout livable, but it ends up not being so. Seriously, give it a try.

** linkffn(8461800) - The Twine Bracelet by CheddarTrek

657 words and a rather beautiful snapshot of a life.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] - perhaps not emotional, per say, but the sheer dread in this story is fantastic - one of the most memorable fics IMO for making you feel a certain way.

  *CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION.* /Now Updated to Ch.14:/ When Lucius Malfoy is forced to make a difficult decision, he gives his only son up to the Order of the Phoenix in hopes that they will protect him from Voldemort. With nowhere else to go, Draco is stuck living at the Burrow with the Weasley's. But when a new witch from America moves in too, things start to get... /interesting./
#+end_quote

It doesn't look like it's been updated for a minute, and it is currently being rewritten, but if you follow all the author notes and ready everything carefully, it is so worth it!!

This story focuses on the complex father-son relationship between Draco & Lucius Malfoy. It is slightly AU, as most of the events from DH are excluded. Without giving too much away, I will say that at the very beginning, a tragedy takes place that causes Lucius Malfoy to switch sides. Voldemort nearly has Draco killed, so Lucius sends him to the Burrow to live with the Weasleys. He writes Arthur this letter, pleading for The Order of the Phoenix to offer Draco their protection. But the real killer is that Draco still thinks that his father is this monster who is completely devoted to Voldemort. So when he finds out that Lucius has actually changed, it gets pretty emotional...

As someone who has a complicated relationship with my own father, growing up this story was a very emotional read for me. My father was always in and out of our lives, and was very abusive, so I definitely registered with where Draco was coming from in this... Not all of the chapters are that depressing, but the ones that are centered around Lucius are the worst. His side of the story is so heartbreaking.

I read this before she started rewriting it, so I know where it's going already. If you get to where the last update was posted (which I believe is around chapter 13-14 or so?) and wanna keep going, it's not really that hard to follow, I don't think. There is a bit of a time jump, but nothing too confusing. You will notice a shift in the quality of writing, but that is to be expected given how old the older chapter are, lol... Anyways, happy reading and let me know what you think of it. Maybe if the author starts getting more reads/reviews on it, she will come back to writing it soon! I hope so, because I really miss this story.

*** The most recent thread seems to have Playmate and Cauterize (which I've read) and another fic. Got different rec's, so the clutter is not entirely without benefits!
