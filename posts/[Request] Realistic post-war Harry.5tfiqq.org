Hi all,

I'm looking for stories that deal with Harry dealing with the effects of the war in realistic ways. I don't want 100% super angst, but I'm interested in stories that have Harry dealing with the after effects of the war either in terms of sorting out his personal life (grief, education/career, family etc.) or in terms of sorting out the wizarding world (rebuilding the Ministry/Hogwarts etc.). I hope this isn't too vague - I am mainly just looking for fics that represent what the impacts of the war have been on the characters in realistic ways.

I'm not fussy about specific ships, I'll try most of them and I like slash, so feel free. I'm not keen on character bashing though.

I think I'm going to x-post to HPSlashFic as well.

Thanks!


** I'm going with "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167), here. Every major character had tons of PTSD. Being betrayed by the Ministry again finally pushed them over the edge, and blood flowed freely.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Me and you both, been on the hunt for something similar for awhile. Iv only really read two, neither of which really did it for me but:

The Summer After the War - ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803]]) I read all of this - it doesn't have to much in the way of Angst, its almost entirely focused on Harry and Ginny, especially towards the middle. It also deals with Harry becoming an Adult and all the stuff that comes with that. Overall its OK, some of the dialogue had me scratching my head, its far to /rambling/ at times, conversations between characters were just sometimes far too long and drawn out then they could have been more clear and shorter - kinda hard to explain and maybe its just me, and there is a couple of errors here and there but that's to be expected. It also has a sequel that's gigantic!, i'm scimming through it slowly but so far its more of the same.

First day linkffn(4367121) , This had the opposite effect on me, every time it got interesting it seemed to swap to another character, sometimes it felt like mid dialogue! - again its probably just the authors writing style and me being too picky, but the writing is really good, except for those short interactions between characters. Also she sometimes prompts you to go read her other fics after a chapter to /fill in gaps/. That annoyed the hell outta me. It really has some good Angst, most characters are fairly messed up about everything and Harry in particular was written very well.

Wish i had more but like I said i'm looking for something similar.

*** I felt the exact same way about The First Day! The switching (mid scene sometimes!) was so disorienting.
