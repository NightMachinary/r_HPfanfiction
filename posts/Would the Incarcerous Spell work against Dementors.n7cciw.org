A few things to consider;

1. Dementors are not intangible, unlike ghosts. They can't simply phase through solid matter. If they could, why would the Dementor on the train in 3rd year bother opening the door to the compartment?

2. You might not be able to stop them from flying away and escaping, but would they be able to administer the Kiss when restrained with ropes or chains?


** Probably yeah. Snape said Patronuses were the most effective way to fight Dementors, right? And Hagrid can conjure up a brick wall from his damn bike, sooo...this all means you could conjure a brick wall between yourself and a Dementor to block it. Or box it in with four walls like a Sims game. xD Or animate a statue to full nelson it from behind.

There are plenty of magical ways to at least bind and escape Dementors without the Patronus, easily feasible in canon!

*** The Patronus Charm is the most effective way to combat Dementors, the same way that water is the best way to put out a fire. But that doesn't mean that other methods won't work; binding a Dementor with rope would work, just as a foam extinguisher will put out a fire.

**** Exactly. There are other ways to do it. xD I listed out a few.

***** I rather like your statue idea. A piece of carved stone wouldn't be effected by the Dementor's aura. Even if you passed out, the Dementor would be trapped, unable to perform the Kiss or escape.

** Fiendfyre burning steel box could work in containing them, cos I think a normal steel box would just y'know, freeze to cracking and then opening, the flames would keep it warm/hot enough to not freeze and thus keeping in the dementors

** That's probably how the Ministry controls them.

But the Patronus is necessary because, unless you get away from them, you would still feel their chilling aura, and the loss of happiness. The Patronus sends them away instead.
