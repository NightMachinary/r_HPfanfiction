I'm putty for fics where Harry gets thrown into a new world (either time travel, dimension travel, xovers etc) but he does ok because he's a paranoid sob after the war and carries all his earthly belongings on him. I've just finished rereading a female Harry potter, captain America xover with this in.

Can you recommend other stories with a similar pretext? I'm open minded on most pairings, slash, het or otherwise but am not a fan of Harry/Daphne or Harry/Hermione pairings. I also don't mind female Harry potter.


** When you first posted this, I started reading the fic you recommended and was so confused that I quit reading. TBH, I was questioning your sanity because honestly, this did not seem like any sort of dimension travel with a paranoid Harry at all.

But just a couple minutes ago, I resaw this post and that's when I realized you linked to chapter 11, not chapter 1. It makes a whole lot more sense now.

I don't have any recs of my own right now off the top of my head, but I'll look through my lists to see if I can find some.

** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12778977/chapters/29159019][Harry Potter and the Winchester Brothers]]?

That's my favorite crossover, Harry is sent to the Supernatural universe after he was killed on DH.

He doesn't have his every possession on him, but he travels with his mokeskin pouch.

  Dumbledore said Harry had a choice. He could go back, go back to battle, end the war. He could go on, be with his loved ones in the afterlife. Somehow, he settled for in between and landed somewhere in America in the year 2010 with two guns pointed at him. Plucked from one war in one universe, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of another. (Betas acquired!)
