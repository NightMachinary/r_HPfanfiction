*** I love you. Sword of Gryffindor has to be one of the funniest, well written fanfics I've ever had the pleasure to read.

Cheers for the rec.

***** Are you sure? That link has the same number of chapters as the version posted on Schnoogle. If so, that's great though! I'd always meant to go back and reread it once it was finished.

** Chem Prof on ff.net is real good. (With the added benefit of being written before DH so you get all that fun fandom speculation)

Muggledad is also a fantastic Harmony writer.
