It seems that a lot of political focused fics catch flak for things like Harry of the too many titles and a single character leading the wizengamot around by the nose or whatnot. But that leaves me with a question: What would one reasonably expect to see of the Wizarding government either as representative member of a family with a vote(s?) or an outsider like a young Tom Riddle or Lucius Malfoy trying to manipulate things from the outside via backroom deals?

Alternatively, can anyone recommend a fic that goes into politics without the character doing so being an overiding force of nature ala Harry of the far too many last names and thus votes?

--------------

I've occasionally asked for people's thoughts on how the Wizengamot or Ministry might reasonably operate and found some useful answers which I include below in case anyone is curious:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][It appears to be named after the Witengamot, and may share it's namesake's structure]]

[[http://pharnabazus.livejournal.com/715.html][I found an essay on how what we see of the ministry factions resembles the roman patronage system]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2kw1va/the_wizengamot_uh_gesundheit/clpfclk][And /u/Taure wrote up a working theory on how it came about]]


** I don't see the Wizengamot as functioning on the basis of inheritable seats. I used to, but then everything presented in canon and supplemented by Pottermore suggests that they at least try to run things with an eye to the practical and reasonable.

My take (2015 edition): the Wizengamot is a body of respected members of society who are nominated to join by others within the body based upon their published and proven accomplishments. A member can be ousted if they seem to have lost their marbles, but it takes a majority of votes to do so. Given that the body is populated based upon estimation of wisdom, it would not be surprising if the minimum age requirement is something like 65- well past the point where passions might get in the way of clear thinking. The exception to this minimum age rule is for the appointed positions to run the government as opposed to managing it: the Minister and Department Heads are determined by Wizengamot election, again as proposed by existing members. In this way an insular old boys (and girls) club exists, but somehow the integrity of the selection criteria has made factionalization less prevalent; much like the U.S. Supreme Court, the members are expected to demonstrate the integrity of their thinking in every action and opinion given in official matters.

Of course, this doesn't preclude the possibility of blackmail and ensorcellement affecting the voting members, but the proof of their suitability no doubt includes having the skills and force of personality to defend against a few young attackers, at least.

In the global arena, I see there being a Ministry of Magic for every sovereign nation- even if they are recently formed, a representative of the ICW will appear and set up shop, for the primary purpose of ensuring that wizards are staying out of the muggles' business. The ICW generally accepts local wizards for the job to ensure that the responsible 'Minister' is familiar with the region, language and local phenomena. There would probably also be touring ICW inspector teams to investigate any potential corruption in the execution of those duties.

*** Oh Pottermore, how I both love and hate thee.

I'm having a hard time meshing the concept of 'practical and reasonable' with what I recall seeing in the books but, in defense of the Wizarding World... Harry never showed much if any curiosity about how the government worked and their direct interactions paint everything in a bad light fairly or not... Fudge may not be good representative sample to judge a system from.

Also, there's the bit where 'respected by the other members' means less if there are people from opposing politcal parties involved since getting everyone to agree on anything may be difficult as the Democrats and Republicans repeatedly rediscover here in America.

Anyway though, I suppose that doesn't truly change my question: Regardless of how seats are filled, Lucius was still able to game the system via bribery, and a person on the Wizengamot would still vote on things. I'm specifically curious what people think the government would like from a person wandering around watching it in action perspective, rather than a 'what would this look like on paper' perspective.

Regarding the ICW... did they ever actually /do/ anything in the books? I honestly can't recall.

I'm the last person to ever defend a Malfoy, but I'm not certain that he did so in such a blatant manner. My -perhaps flawed- reasoning was that Fudge assumed Lucius couldn't possibly have espoused any dangerous beliefs because of his history of philanthropy, most notably through a donation to St. Mungo's.

If someone can correct me or shed more light on it, I'd be appreciative.

***** Book Five, Chapter Eight:

#+begin_quote
  ‘What are you doing here, anyway?' Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.\\
  ‘I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,' said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes. Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold. ‘Really, just because you are Dumbledore's favourite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us ... shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?'\\
  ‘Certainly,' said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr Weasley. ‘This way, Lucius.'\\
  They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr Weasley did not let go of Harry's shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.\\
  ‘Why wasn't he waiting outside Fudge's office if they've got business to do together?' Harry burst out furiously. ‘What was he doing down here?'\\
  ‘Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,' said Mr Weasley, looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard. ‘Trying to find out whether you'd been expelled or not. I'll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy's been talking to Fudge again.'\\
  ‘What private business have they got together, anyway?'\\
  ‘Gold, I expect,' said Mr Weasley angrily. ‘Malfoy's been giving generously to all sorts of things for years ... gets him in with the right people ... then he can ask favours ... delay laws he doesn't want passed ... oh, he's very well-connected, Lucius Malfoy.'
