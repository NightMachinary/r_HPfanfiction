Spell-Check...

There are some truly amazing fan fics out there but oh they test me so.

Harry lied there awake (this one has caught me many times and I hate it so.)

Do we not understand that it should be laid there awake? I know English is not always a first language for some and where I find it, I cut them a lot of slack but otherwise I think it is simply lazy. Surely even Grammarly would be useful and it is free to a point. That sometimes is my first comment, /"Great story recommended Grammarly and a re-edit."/

Beta's if you are letting this stuff slide then you are not doing the job correctly.

​

What is yours?

​

EDIT: FYI it does not have to be grammar related. Just a general bug bear about fics, i.e. I am not a big fan also of the fics that turn Ron into a gormless idiot or Harry into the next bloody superman. Inheritance test and Harry gets it all Unlocked. It is like the Oprah meme, "you get a free tv, and you get a free tv and you."

'*Harry* tried to get up but *he* couldn't. What's going on? *he* thought. No matter *I*'ll just get up later.'

**** If it said, 'No matter I'll just get up later + Harry thought/decided/said to himself...etc.' you would be correct. As it is, sentence starts in 3rd person POV then changes to 1st person POV.

** Many authors do not have English as a first language, but bad grammar makes me drop a story, faster than anything else.

Their/they're. Your/you're. Very important.

Watch your s's and d's!! I cannot stand it when people go back and forth between the tenses constantly, and in the same paragraph, even. I know it's often a typo, but still.

And for the love of grammar, can people please learn how to use the word 'lie'? It's not 'Harry was LAYING on the bed'!!! If he's laying on the bed, I'm going to expect some eggs. It lying, people! Context is important for many words.

And the ellypsis... Don' overdo it... please... don't... it's... annoying...

** Actually, it should be ‘lay'.

The hens laid eggs.

The boy lay on the bed.

The boy carefully lay down the eggs that the hens had laid.

We all lay down together, waiting for the birds to lay their eggs. They always laid them before dawn. We lay in silent anticipation of the clucking that would signal an egg had been laid.

**** Indeed. Perhaps it would be best if someone sets it out comprehensively.

Present participle: laying (e.g. "The hen is laying an egg right now.")

Past simple: laid (e.g. "The hen laid a big egg this morning.")

Past participle: laid (e.g. "The hen has laid many eggs before.")

*To lie (intransitive verb)*

Present: lie (e.g. "I lie down for a nap every afternoon.")

Present participle: lying (e.g. "I am lying in my bed for a nap.")

Past simple: lay (e.g. "I lay down for two naps yesterday.")

Past participle: lain (e.g. "I have lain in bed all day already.")

** "It's" being used where it should be "its." Some of it is probably typos (I've never in my life had a smartphone that didn't /aggressively/ autocorrect "its" to "it's," because I've never in my life typed "its" when I meant "it's" (I'm perfectly capable of using apostrophes, thanks) but that's its own rant), but its sheer prevalence makes me think that at least some authors genuinely don't know the difference. Which, honestly, shouldn't bother me as much as it does, but I'm a persnickety bastard, so there you are.

*** I'm fussy about spelling and punctuation too, but I've become inured to them when reading fanfiction, as long as the story grabs my interest. I've stopped having a go at authors about them.

And as for the OP's complaint, a spell-checker usually won't pick up things like that.

There are two things that jar for me. First, Americanisms, like shined instead of shone, drug/dragged, grinded/ground, step foot/set foot.

But second, and the thing that really bugs me, is when authors spell canon characters' names wrong. The most common I see is Delores instead of Dolores Umbridge. But others like Fluer, Pavrati/Pavarti, Dumbledoor, Hollows instead of Hallows, do trigger me to either correct the author or stop reading, depending on how much I'm enjoying the story. Getting something like that in the title or summary means I won't even try reading.

**** I use Grammarly, granted I pay for full version as I use it in my work environment, it picks up mistakes like I used. Also most authors reference a Beta, they should definitely be picking that up or they are not doing their job correctly.

With you on the names. How difficult is it if in doubt to reference the actual book, I am sure if you are writing a HP fic then you have a copy of the books in your home. I have three sets. One on my iTunes account, and two in various states of use on the shelves.

** Oh, and if we're talking about bug bears (not bares, that's another one), why do people and things always have to reside somewhere in fanfiction, instead of live? Who says reside these days, or is that another Americanism?

I suspect that's part of trying to using fancy language in writing, like using tome (or tomb!), instead of book.

** I can get over that. Some ridiculous spellings even crack me up.

I hate it though when I have to read through countless paragraphs describing how a character feels without anything happening... it's just them staring at something and thinking how they feel. And it's fine if you do it in one paragraph or, hell, I'll even be fine with an entire chapter because I can skim through it... but you do this every chapter for half the chapter then that story moves too slowly for my taste and I'm going to pass no matter how talented the author is.

Also long descriptions bore me. One thing I liked about JK was her description style. She could summarize a setting in one paragraph well enough that you'd get a clear mental picture of it without having to go into every little detail.
