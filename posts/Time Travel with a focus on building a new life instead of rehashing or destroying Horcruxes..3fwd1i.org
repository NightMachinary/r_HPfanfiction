  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

** Any particular characters you're looking for?

There's some Hermione centric where she wasn't allowed to change anything in the end relating to the first war (centered around other characters I won't be able to help much, but I wanted to ask before posting some!)

**** linkffn(the debt of time by shayalonnie) - [[/s][Spoiler]]

This Time Around linkffn(1762337) - [[/s][spoiler]]

Reason for Life linkffn(4258204) - [[/s][spoiler]]

Those are the only ones I know of that don't use Horcruxes or focus on ending the war differently/better/early with future!knowledge. And I'm really hoping those spoiler tags work. I think the first and second would be closest to the request.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
