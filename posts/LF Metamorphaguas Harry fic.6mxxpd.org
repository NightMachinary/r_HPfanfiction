looking for a good Metamorphagaus Harry fic where he actually uses the ability , as for the pairing anything other than Harry/Ginny and Gay Harry


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/18/The-random-craziness-file]["The Chameleon"]], Chapter 18 of Darklooshkin's "The random crazyness file". Harry uses a time-turner and his metamorphmagus ability to great effect.

** I've seen a bunch of stories where he has the ability, but I don't think I've ever seen one where he actually uses it for a non-arbitrary reason.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

  He was abandoned at a young age, the world believing him dead. They were wrong. Death Eaters believed untouchable are dying. Who is this assassin? Will he join Dumbledore or take the war into his own hands? Not typical powerful!politic!Harry.
