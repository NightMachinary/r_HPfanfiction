the idea that's been knocking around your head that you know you can't pull off, or whatever you like.


** A fic where the students more actively revolt against Umbridge and the intrusion of the Ministry in fifth year. Even though it may be realistic, I hate how they just take it every time she tells them they're stupid or won't need to learn magic. The general public might think Dumbledore and Harry are nuts and want Hogwarts and their students education more tightly controlled, but I have a hard time seeing a generation who lived through the first war not wanting their children to learn Defense. Or thinking it was practical to learn it without any, well, practical class time.

*** I agree! Umbridge was alone, isolated in Hogwarts. Nobody supported her except for Filch and a few Slytherins that made the Inquisitorial Squad. I think if the rest of the school had just laughed at her and not listened or obeyed to anything she'd said, they could have pushed her over the edge and gotten rid of her.

Of course, pushing her over the edge might have resulted in her cursing a student (crucio?), but it would have been for the greater good, right?

I'm also surprised the parents haven't reacted to the way she ran the school either. The students could and should have ratted her out to them. Then it's only a matter of time before they pressure the board of governor's / ministry into firing or replacing her. See how fast it happened when Remus was ousted as a werewolf to the parents.

** Self Insert into Delores Umbridge when she first gets her promotion as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. You have to fix things without anyone suspecting a change of loyalties or personality.

For instance: if you get Sirius Black out, you have to convince people that it is to put egg on the face of Dumbledore. Or perhaps get him as your pawn...

A sort of world where the mindset in House of Cards meets the Harry Potter universe.

I don't think she was convinced, but decided discretion is the better part of valor. Hmm... I'm getting vague memories of her cutting off her own arm, I think after (almost?) being possessed by one of the horcruxes.

** *How about a long outline for a story? Anyone is free to use it if they want. I'll never do more on this idea, I think.*

--------------

After a sixth-year Quidditch accident, Harry starts getting unusual powers, like wandless super-magic and a sort of hypnotic ability to draw attractive girls to him with the strength of his super-love. Standard PowerfulHarry and harem antics appear to ensue, hitting all the classic tropes.

Then we cut to the rest of the trio, who are desperately trying to deal with Harry Potter's behavior after his accident, where he suffered serious brain damage. If it gets out how hurt Harry really is, it might cripple the morale of the entire country and be a great setback in the fight against the Death Eaters. So for now, they're simply trying to protect their friend and do everything they can to help Harry get better.

But Harry's now constantly trying to pick fights with Malfoy using his "super magic", demanding he be called "Lord Potter-Black" by everyone because of his inheritances, and challenging anyone who refuses to duels using Ministry laws only he seems to know about. This just confuses and disgusts Draco, who is /way/ too busy this year to deal with this shit, and the teachers are only willing to play along for so long. Snape isn't at all willing to play, of course, only further enraging Harry.

Most disturbing of all is how Harry's acting unusually smooth around the ladies, who are both intrigued and put off-balance by the new attention and the way he's trying to date seven girls all at once. When he starts claiming to be able to "hear their thoughts" from across the castle, and that they are "bound together now for all time," things start getting ugly.

Then Harry says Hermione is his "soul mate," and he keeps asking her if she's "drawn up a schedule." She /really/ doesn't want to ask about what the hell /that/ means.

Ron and Hermione are surreptitiously casting spells to help him when he tries to use his "wandless magic," running interference with the teachers (who do know about his injury, just not the extent), and smoothing over things with all the girls he seems to be trying to collect using "soul bonds" for his harem.

Luna somehow both knows the truth and is the only one fully playing along with his delusions, and she really seems to be able to get through to him. But it is her OWL year and so she's too busy a lot of the time to play this interesting new game.

Drama and tragedy continue as they try to convince Harry he doesn't really have these new powers, he needs to cool it with the weird spells in the Prince's potions book, and that his absurd behavior is scaring and hurting people. He swears "on his magic" about his powers, then lights his wand. They don't get it.

Harry sees this as his friends betraying him, as he continues to avoid Madam Pomfrey and Dumbledore, and the medical treatments and psychological counseling he so desperately needs.

And then he kills Draco with a Dark cutting curse after cornering him in a bathroom, and the whole situation explodes. He has a public trial, and as his condition is exposed to the world, Voldemort's Death Eaters attack Hogwarts through some secret tunnels.

They are easily repelled. After the fight, Snape dies on the way to St. Mungo's and Dumbledore is in critical condition from a magical curse injury that was aggravated in the fight. He is not expected to make it to the next school year. Oddly, Snape's magical autopsy shows he was killed by a broken Oath, and that he had ingested a dark potion hours before.

Everything looks bleak. Though Harry is acquitted on grounds of self-defense and is sent to St. Mungo's for the treatment he so desperately needs, the Order collapses.

But then the people in the street start fighting back. Militias form, and start patrolling the Alleys. They seem to realize Harry alone can't be the one save them.

The Headmaster dies, leaving Hermione and Ron odd gifts as they return to school, shaken and worried about their world.

After the Minister for Magic is killed and replaced by a clear puppet of the Pure-blood supremacists, the new regime's plans are leaked to and publicly revealed by the Quibbler. They include plans for Muggle-born concentration camps and a plot to seize Hogwarts and rule it with violence and fear. The editor and publisher of the paper, a Mr. Lovegood, is killed by Death Eaters soon after publication. He is survived by a daughter, who is attending Hogwarts.

A civilian mob storms the Ministry and puts it to siege. Hogwarts locks down, allowing no one in or out. After a month under the combined attack of hundreds of wizards and witches, the corrupt Ministry falls. There are isolated reprisal attacks, but dozens of Death Eaters are killed in the process by angry civilians, emboldened by the Ministry fight. Wizengamot seat holders and all government employees are screened for the Dark Mark, and anyone known to be a collaborator is banned from public office. New elections are called.

School opens up for Yule holidays, and Hermione and Ron are finally able to visit Harry in St. Mungos. Though Death Eaters attempted to assassinate him several times, his nurses and several doctors, being some of the most skilled magicals in the country, were easily able to defend him with an odd mix of bio-magic traps, the Fidelius charm, and the defenses built into a hospital that had survived two magical World Wars. Harry, doing much better now and not at all crazy anymore, tells them the oddest story about horcruxes and the prophecy about him killing the Dark Lord.

They find much-needed proof by viewing his memories of the lessons on Tom's life in Headmistress McGonagall's pensive (along with the old Headmaster's final memories of the locket hunt). They also find that, for some reason, he apparently has two of the legendary Deathly Hallows (the stone from inside a piece of sports equipment and his father's cloak).

They all resolve to start searching for the horrible soul anchor objects immediately...after the school year is out, when McGonagall can also assist them directly. Voldemort isn't getting any more immortal, after all, and their education is important when going up against adult Dark wizards. Harry and Ron agree, /of course/, and Harry even manages to catch up and graduate with the rest of them.

Agreeing that being the "Master of Death" would be a very, very bad idea for Harry, especially as even Dumbledore didn't trust himself with such power, they tell Headmistress McGonagall about the Death Stick. It is secretly removed from Dumbledore's grave and placed in a seamless, permanently transfigured, security charmed, and internally Fidelius-guarded titanium box in the Headmistress's office. She is the secret keeper, and tells no one about it.

The trio all take honors in their NEWTS, then with the help of McGonagall and the new Minister for magic, Shacklebolt, they quickly find and confiscate the locket, the cup, and the hidden diadem at Hogwarts.

The objects are purged by professionals, who know more about such things than recent high school graduates and professional educators, and three historic artifacts of incalculable value are saved while still destroying the fragments of Tom's soul. They can't take care of the one in Harry's head, which is obviously a soul fragment of some kind, without killing him in the process. Though they do suggest to Harry that it might protect him from Tom's Dark death magic, even another Killing Curse, as it is literally a piece of his own soul and magic itself. The Trio plot and plan, and all agree to ways to use Harry's fame to gather forces for the inevitable final fight against the Death Eaters.

A couple of years later, Tom finally attacks Hogwarts in open battle, in an attempt to gain leverage over the children of Magical Britain. He uses dementors, giants, werewolves, vampires, and all of his local and imported blood-supremists in the battle. The civilian and Auror forces are quickly overwhelmed and it seems that the castle full of children will soon fall.

But then Harry's Hussars, a European (broom) mounted mercenary force he and Ron formed with the Delacour and Krum family's help, crashes into the Death Eater force's flanks. They use advanced, high-speed Muggle and Quidditch-inspired air-to-ground techniques to scatter the Death Eater forces. Soon, only the Dark Lord himself stands firm. Harry duels Voldemort personally, is hit by a Killing Curse (of course) and briefly plays dead.

Giving Hermione and her Unspeakables special forces team (though she is, of course, not one of them -- believing too strongly in the free exchange of information to take such an oath of silence) the time to find and lock down the final soul fragment, in a giant snake. Their curse breakers quickly crack the simple Dark defenses Tom put around it (he isn't a professional warder, after all) and they destroy the final horcrux.

The rest of the Hogworts '97 and '98 graduates stayed out of the fight, because they hadn't been specifically training since they were seventeen to fight in deadly combat situations, and (as are most people) they were not psychologically driven enough to want to be in combat in the first place. Ron, Hermione, and Harry had been under fire since they were eleven, and understood the risks. Anyone's boy or girlfriend relationships didn't matter, because this was war. Untrained and emotional people were not welcome.

Harry gets the signal and surprises +kills+ Voldemort, overpowering him in a brief but explosive Brother Wands duel. As he almost won one at age 14, he easily overpowers the Dark Lord this time, leaving him smoking and defeated on the ground.

The Ministry and ICW then take him and lock him up in Nurmengard, which not even Grindelwald was ever able to escape, while they determine if he's made any new horcruxes. They take their time.

No one's babies mattered, but it suffices to say that they all lived:

Happily Ever After.

The End.

*** ...this is amazing. It is crack as hell at the beginning but it all makes sense at the end in a very Luna-ish sort of way.

Part of me wants to combine this story with a follow up to Summer of Change and make it Harry/Tonks/Luna (with random harem at the beginning) and Harry as an unspeakable but the brain injury might have stuffed up his memories. It would explain is sudden "super magic" too since he was trained by Tonks and unspeakables during the previous summer.

But that addition would probably kill the story... its so good without it!

**** Thanks! I'm working on my outlining, as I'm planning on making a living writing novels. Glad it shows. Like your work too, by the way.

I think this story works as a modified Harry/Luna/Tonks, with Luna being the only girl he actually ends up dating in the first half. The rest is mostly just delusions in his head, with even Ginny bouncing off his crazy and deciding to simply go elsewhere.

Then Tonks could step in when he's arrested and during the siege of the Ministry. She could have been assigned to protect him, and it could have some naughty nurse/sexy bodyguard times there to, ahem, /fill the gap/. He's an adult (17) by that point, so less potential ick factor to deal with for Harry/Tonks.

Then in the second half, he can hang out with Luna as he's starting to attend classes again and over the next summer as they hunt the horcruxes (with actual professional help). This time, he'd be on the mend, and she'd have just lost her second parent only a few months ago. This would send her into a spiral of depression he'd need to pull her out of, maybe with Tonks' help. That set up has the advantage of being entirely between adults when the hot three-way stuff happens.

And for the final part, I'd just drop the romance subplots entirely. It just doesn't matter who is with whom when the final battle starts, and not even mentioning it would emphasize that counter-trope really well.

Good luck if you plan on writing this up some day; send me a line when you decide to start publishing. I'm interested to see the final result.

Ms. Figg finds out Harry's living in the cupboard when he's quite a bit younger. She talks Petunia into "renting" Harry to do chores, but really starts teaching him about the magical world.

Possible plot points:

- Goes to Gringotts a few years early to get money for new clothes, etc.
- Harry get's his letter while at Ms. Figg's house & responds using her owl
- Diagon Alley school shopping with her.\\
- She gives him a kneazle kitten to bring to Hogwarts.
- Said kitten tries to kill Wormtail and he's forced to transform in the great hall/on platform 9 3/4/some other place where Wormtail gets caught.

I really want to see a Marauders during the war fic where Pettigrew doesn't turn. I think the canon version makes little sense, since she really makes it seem as if the group has this unbreakable bond to each other, and It'd be very cool to see the rat work as a double agent for the light. And then finally Voldemort falls to the combined might of the marauders in a giant battle that sets england aflame, or something.

If you feel like he needs more motivation not to turn, just have him fall deeply in love with a OC and then kill her off, and BAM, reason to hate the dark lord just as much as snape.

I did a oneshot a while ago where the marauders actually succeed in killing Tom because of Pettigrew, but I don't know If i feel like writing the whole thing.

*** I've been interested in writing that, but it's just such a huge task to undertake.

My theory is that Grindelwald was not working with Hitler, but with Stalin, and Dumbledore waited until 1945 because that way Grindelwald would end the war for him and Dumbledore would still get all the credit while dealing a large blow to communism. I was even trying to figure out a Marxist critique of wizarding society.

They'd still be bloodthirsty monsters, but the universe is /forcing/ them to go against Voldemort. An even better idea would be if they were put in children's bodies in Harry's year. Obviously a gory comedy. They might become a little more human along the way, but they'd be a hilarious band of savages.

** Harry Potter, Game of Thrones Style

With the three main factions being the Ministry, The Order, and The Death Eaters. Inside each of these factions however are multiple stories and families. I want to see some of the Death Eaters point of view and hate myself for actually liking a Malfoy or Snape or hell...even Voldemort... Of course I'd still want Harry Potter to be the hero to root for, but I want a lot more grey in all of the fighting, including from the dark side.

*** Resurrecting an old reply to a similar question:

"... about how Harry Potter would have been different if George R.R Martin had written it."

Harry would have died in the graveyard but Voldemort would have returned to Hogwarts in his skin. Despite unearthing all the conspiracies around the tournament, Dumbledore is killed by an alliance of his heads of house, supposedly due to discovery of his manipulations. Neville joins with Fleur Delacour to begin a new anti-Voldemort underground while the Dark Lord puts Bellatrix in charge of Wizarding Britain (she makes a hash of it).

Luna begins a journey to become the reborn goddess of vengeance Kali, but she can only gain the powers if she gives up any devotion to preserving life.

Meanwhile, an untrained muggleborn named Serenity Gaunt is raised in the Louisiana Bayou, where she discovers magic, horror and a growing ability to eat (and detect) souls.

Mind you, all of this is actually planned out by the not quite dead Nicholas Flamel in cahoots with Florean Fortescue. But it's okay- it turns out Cormac Maclaggan is actually Merlin resurrected.

Whatever you do, don't ask what the Malfoys do to the Weasleys.

the idea is that somehow Voldemort changed the timeline by killing Dumbledore in a duel and covertly taking his place as Hogwarts headmaster he controls Britain and decided that instead of doing something stupid like trying to kill harry he let him live a simple muggle life by not sending him his hogwarts letter. Hermione, Ron and Ginny (from future-cannon, epilogue compilant) where in the Departament of Misteries' Time chamber when the Time Wave (the timeline chage) occured (thanks to the spells in the time chamber they where unaffected think Star Trek: First Contact) they find themselves in a distopian future where Voldemort Rules the world with an iron fist as a last recource they send their minds back to try to fix the time-line.

(as there are not House elves) Harry Potter is a muggle (no he isn't) which lives in the lands of Duke Arthur Weasley Working day after day in the farmslands.
#+end_quote

In this one Wizards control the world, and there is a class system where muggles are the lowest of class (think house elves) The weaslyes are one of the Twelve Most ancient houses that control the british isles, but arthur is still a muggle lover but he hides it better than in cannon (think Schindler and the Jews) Lily was killed by Tom Riddle because she was a muggleborn and james being the heir of potter wouldn't be allowed to marry a muggleborn, Tom was stopped by James before he killed harry too. and so harry was sent to live with her mother's family and for sparing his sons life James had to marry.... Bellatrix Black making the Black-Potter Family the most powerfull in Britain

** My own fic;currently still in the planning stage.

It's not so much I can't pull it off, more that if it has to be written the way it ought to be then it could easily break epic-length. I'm currently estimating around over 100,000 words for the first book (of five or so).

It'll take a few more years to get them all done, I'm sure, but I'm just glad I've /finally/ found the write uhm... structure to which I can add on the smaller details that make readers claim it's /well thought-out/ and /in-depth/.

Just nargling out the minor details right now - Harry's powerful - do I call him a mage? A warlock? How do I distinguish in writing what those terms mean from one another?

Bits like this are the worst.

To give a minor summary really, /really/, early for those interested in the general plot arc, here's a breakdown of it all.

Harry raised with Petunia (No Vernon or Dudley) after Lily/James killed by Bellatrix.

#+begin_quote
  Neville is the Boy-who-lived, his mother still alive.
#+end_quote

Voldemort's soul is split in the number of the most magically powerful, seven. But it's the most powerful for /ALL/ the souls, thus with Neville being the only soul aside from Nagini and Voldemort himself he can actively /claim/ them... so to speak - did I mention Neville got a powerboost with the soul he has because souls = magic, thus - more soul = ... Horcrux hunt got quite a bit more exciting and positive for the light side.

#+begin_quote
  The first book is mainly focused around 5 - 6 months of the first term, Harry befriending Quirrell (/VERY/ competent and likable) though is hurt emotionally (obviously) by the betrayal at practically being groomed through the year
#+end_quote

Or is it Quirrell making the most of his possessed state by passing on knowledge Voldemort's mind added to his? (Boom - does he forgive Quirrell for giving in to Voldemort's possession?)

#+begin_quote
  Souls are a main feature - if you kill someone - blam! your soul cracks - but heals over time - unless the shock of it kills you.
#+end_quote

Thus - horcruxes become more horrible - more in-depth analysis of the horcrux magic from book 3 onwards which develops into the horcrux hunt.

#+begin_quote
  Harry isn't BWL as mentioned before, though Malfoy Senior thinks of him as a potential pawn (knight?) to be brought to his side politically.

  Also turns into a HeirtoWhatFounder?!Harry and DuellingClubAddict!Harry and Travelling!Harry (Because with magic, what's language and distance?) and also a MagicalCreature?!Harry - not /too/ outlandish with the way I've developed it.

Then no lunches for a bit, and everyone is mad at him for some reason, so he leaves to get more lunches, then back for more Hermione again. Then some scary stuff, then more Hermione (for some reason), victory lunch, and quidditch and Hermione for the rest of his days.

Draco at least has goals and ambitions which he works towards. Even Ron's place on the quidditch team sort of fell into his lap, with Harry helping him practice and try out for it. Draco had to get up early and bribe someone with his father's money to get on the team, which at least requires some volition on his part.

Ron, bashed or not, is now more fanon than man. I say, just let his canon so-called character die. Though not literally, as that just makes people whine.

Draco has redeeming features, like an inability or unwillingness to kill a great man, even to save his own life. He plots, he feels, he occasionally skips lunch. He also works best in at least a light AU or single change fic. Because otherwise, he doesn't have much to do until years five and six, except for some possible stuff in year two that we might not have heard about.

I'll freely admit that.

I, in fact, had /very little/ problem building canon Draco up. Because he has at least a little /depth of character/, even given only the brief mentions we have of him in canon. He says what his goals and beliefs are, loud and clear for everyone to hear.

So, what are canon Ron's?

Even his /brothers/ have more goals and volition in canon than he does. Almost every act he takes on his own is a negative and short-sighted one, like mocking Hermione, stealing the family flying car, or abandoning Harry during the tournament -- or /again/ during the horcrux hunt.

So, if I'm harping too much on his negative attributes, what are Ron's hopes and dreams in canon? What does canon actually say he strives for that makes him a deep and useful character?

****** Well Ron's ambition is to get out of his brothers' shadow - at least during his Hogwarts time. It's stated in the Mirror of Erised plot when he sees himself as Head Boy and Quidditch Captain. I would say that it's more difficult to assess Malfoy's real ambitions. I mean up until the end of his fifth year he strives to be a Death Eater because that's what he is expected to do and his father might have told him all his life that that's the right thing for him. After he gets made a Death Eater, he only struggles to survive and attempts to bring his family name in Voldemort's good graces (although he is unsuccessful).

Also the fact that he didn't have to resort to his father's money to buy himself a position in the Quidditch team only proves that he was able to work hard for all that he had. Also a lot of people seem to stick around Malfoy due to the prestige of his name, while Ron manages to build true friendships.

Moreover Rowling, most of the times, shows us the characters only in situations relevant to the plot, but we hardly know how the characters behave in every day circumstances. All we know is that they were playing Quidditch or Exploding Snap or they were doing homework. However the fact that Harry is not particularly happy about being stuck only with Hermione in their fourth year (when Ron abandons Harry) might indicate that Ron is quite a fun a person to be around (most Weasleys are, except maybe for Percy).

I believe both Ron and Draco are characters deep enough to actually explore the story through their eyes. I feel like Ron is not taken too seriously because he is not as smart as Hermione, nor as popular as Harry, but I think you can write a lot from his perspective.

Good. This is never actually stated that plainly in canon, but I think it is safe to infer from the context. He actually says it would be "cool" to be an Auror once, too.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  ...proves that he was able to work hard for all that he had.
#+end_quote

Now. What does he /actually do himself/ to make it happen? And why does he get what he does?

He practices for being a Keeper, but only after he is given a broom, and only just before tryouts. He had no plans before that to tryout and hadn't been doing that sort of practice in previous years. He eventually gets the job, but it is very rocky. And he doesn't win in the end because of his effort, but because of his random and out of control moods aligning just right.

And Ron is never shown trying to help his classmates, except tangentially in DA (after he is already a prefect), and is apparently only high-average in his classes. It is clear that he doesn't become a prefect because of merit or effort, only because his roommates are all either Harry Potter (too busy) or even less responsible than he is (magic to make rum, and god only knows). And he never becomes Head Boy or Captain.

Draco Malfoy does things in the story to achieve his goals, like being a good son, excelling in school -- the whole Snape potions nepotism is pure fanon, remember, and he either already knew or learns the snake summoning spell in /seconds/ -- and saving his disgraced family from the anger of the Dark Lord all by himself.

Ron gets made prefect, even the other characters are surprised. When Draco becomes a prefect, everyone /knows/ why. There was no other choice. This is even more strong characterization. The trio railed against it, but only because it was their foe who had won more power for himself, and they knew he'd abuse it. Not because they had in mind someone else who deserved it more. Why did they know that he'd abuse his power? Because Draco is a strong character, and what he'd do was clear to them and the readers.

So what did Ron actually do to further his dreams? What did his character */do/* at Hogwarts that would make a good story by itself?

--------------

#+begin_quote
  After he gets made a Death Eater, he only struggles to survive and attempts to bring his family name in Voldemort's good graces (although he is unsuccessful).
#+end_quote

Right. He struggles. He survives. He saves his entire family. Unlike Ron, who never does any of that stuff, and fucks off the moment things get tough. Emotionally or physically. Hardly the characterization basis for a good story. Maybe it would make an interesting crackfic, but I doubt Ron fans would appreciate that much.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Also a lot of people seem to stick around Malfoy due to the prestige of his name, while Ron manages to build true friendships.
#+end_quote

Yet another attribute for Draco. He has a family name and draws people to him because of it. Another solid characterization.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  while Ron manages to build true friendships.
#+end_quote

How, exactly does he do this? Through effort? Or just falling into it, and Harry being a passive, socially-stunted little orphan?

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Moreover Rowling, most of the times, shows us the characters only in situations relevant to the plot
#+end_quote

So what plot would a Ron-centric canon story even have? You'd have to make up something or use some fanon stuff to fill it in. There isn't a clear expansion from canon that I've ever seen for Ron. As opposed to Draco, who has tons of interesting stuff written about him, some of it entirely made from canon and near-canon references.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  might indicate that Ron is quite a fun a person to be around
#+end_quote

So? Is this something Ron works at, like the Twins? Does he try to be a fun person? Do other people think he is a fun person, or just the psychologically damaged orphan?

Fair enough. I don't agree, and if I seem angry or confrontational about it, it is only because I think JKR dropped the ball on Ron's characterization, not because your ideas are without merit.

But note that you /still/ spent more time in your post on /Draco/ than on Ron. Because he has more depth, even in his unfocused plot obscurity.

Idea #1:

Taking canonical elements and plotlines from the Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, the story begins in the latter parts of the Chamber of Secrets.

--------------

Tom Riddle's Diary somehow makes contact with Scabbers, and Riddle recognizes that Scabbers is Peter Pettigrew, a servant of Voldemort. With their combined knowledge, Pettigrew fakes his death and masquerades as Ginny whilst the real Ginny is held prisoner in the Chamber of Secrets. Meanwhile, Voldemort hears rumours of the Chamber of Secrets being opened and begins to make his way closer to England, gathering strength as he does so. Bellatrix and her fellow Death Eaters start to realize that Voldemort is getting stronger, leading to Sirius breaking out of Azkaban to protect Harry from Voldemort's growing threat...

--------------

Idea #2: Set in the Deathly Hallows.

--------------

With Dumbledore's Army reforming, and the Carrows solidifying their reign of terror, Ginny, being one of the members of the First D.A. and Harry Potter's girlfriend, is under heavy suspicion, so the supporters of Voldemort gossip about those facts. This gossiping eventually reaches the ears of Voldemort, who initially ignores it but starts to obsess more and more over Ginny until the two meet in an explosive showdown.

** I know this is beyond late (but give be a break I just found this sub)

My fanfic idea goes as follows;

That last unintended Horcrux in Harry's mind/body is never found. Harry goes on to kill Voldemort and marries Ginny. Ten years later, Voldemort/Harry awakens and becomes fully aware and plans the new uprising of the darklord. Harry is unaware of this and has a few lost memories but doesn't suspect due to Voldemort being all clever and all especially since he has inside knowledge of the ministry's activities.

Hermione discovers this, tells Ron, and they go about finding a way to stop Voldemort/Harry.

** I want to see an exalted crossover where Harry exalts as an infernal and acts like a typical infernal should. Ideally it would be wildly out of context problem, canon HP world with a canon infernal exaltation *nothing else crosses over*, IE: nothing stupid like dumbledore is secretly a sidereal or something. I hate the whole if you give harry a lightsaber give voldemort a death star shit. Bonus points if theres a manipulative dumbledore and it backfires spectacularly.
