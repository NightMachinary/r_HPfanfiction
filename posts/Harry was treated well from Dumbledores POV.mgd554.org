I just watched HBP again and in the scene in the burrow Ron says Dumbledore is about 150 years old.

I then realized Dumbledores childhood was in 19th century Britain.

You know the country where whole families lived in a single room apartment, people had 12h workdays and children labored in factories.

A time where hitting your child was the norm and every mouth to feed a burden.

If you compare harry's treatment to that the Dursleys are completely reasonable, hell Harry's room under the stairs in not worse than what some live in maids had.

Dumbledore is just too old to see the treatment of the Dursleys as abuse. Harry cooking for the Dursleys may even seem like a fair deal to him.

That is largely fanon. Petunia does almost all the cooking, only enlisting Harry once to make sure the bacon doesn't burn

**** Harry only did "gardening" in CoS, as a punishment for scarring Dudley with "M - - - -". Most of the time, the Dursleys are more than happy to ignore Harry and letting him do whatever as long as he is not being freaky. Harry was also more neglected than outright abused (outside of the incidents involving magic, which were few and far between).

** No, he wasn't. In OotP Dumbledore said he knew he was "condemning" Harry to "ten dark and difficult years." In HBP he tells the Dursleys Harry "knew nothing but neglect and cruelty."

*** Yeah, for some reason people like to give Dumbledore a pass for being a complete peace of shit in regards to Harry's life even though he outright tells the readers he knows exactly what he was condemning Harry to. If Dumbeldore wanted to stop the abuse and neglect he could have but he chose not to it makes his actions in regards to Harry monstrous

Yeah because he clearly said in the same scene that, while he knew it would suck, it was still the "least bad" choice?

The protection would only activate if the Dursley "allowed" Harry to live with them, which means that it was impossible to threaten the Dursley into taking him without risking the whole protection. And he even took the pain to place a Squibb nearby to keep an eye on things and make sure Harry was not in mortal danger (which never happened in canon before the Dementors of OotP.

And where was Harry supposed to live if not with the Dursley? With some magical family who would either spoil the "Boy-Who-Lived", try to kill him for their old Master or raise him as his replacement? Maybe someone like Moody who would teach him how to defend himself (or make him totally Parano√Ød)? Or maybe some Ministry lackey who would absolutely not try to use his guardianship of the BWL to advance his career.

Harry childhood may have sucked, but he still came out from the Dursley way better adjusted than he would have been with most other guardians. A snarky but otherwise normal kid is better than a mini Moody or that arrogant prick we always his brother as in pretty much any WBWL fics.

***** He could threaten them just like he did in Half blood prince he could visit every so often and make sure he isn't being kept in a fucking cupboard under the stairs but didn't he could have of easily stopped the abuse but didn't. Keep making more fucking excuses for Dumbledore when he could of stopped the abuse but he chose not to.

If you think Harry came out a normal kid then you are quite deluded, there are way more options then just the two you made. Harry could turn out normal in another household.

******* The simple fact is Dumbledore could have easily chosen to stop the abuse and neglect but didn't and now people come out with a load of bullshit excuses and try and absolve Dumbledore of any wrong doing when he flat out tells the readers he was aware of it al.

******** What would you prefer, death or abuse? How easy would it be for any random death eater to kill him if the wards weren't there (the ministry would have his address accessible to others after he rejoined the Wizarding world or at least after his trial)

******** Dumbledore could have done many things ranging from placing the Dursleys under Imperius to basically extorting them into taking care of Harry. From a plot point of view, Harry had to suffer the hardships of the hero. From an in world point of view, Dumbledore was not the type to do that. Dursleys might have been pieces of shit but also try to put yourself in the situation that you are given a child you didn't want from a world you want nothing to do with and every so often an old weirdo shows up at your door telling you that he'll hurt you if you don't treat that kid like a prince. I think that eventually Dursleys would just move and leave Harry behind so that the crackpot can take care of him himself if he holds him so dear.

*** I actually wonder if that's even true. Dumbledore hasn't been a teacher for like half a century by the end of the books, and you don't really see him interacting with the students. He works an administrative job. He has no real reason to ever directly interact with students outside of Harry or a student being sent to his office for severe rule breaking.

** The problem with that is that Dumbledore is in education /and/ he's part of the wizengamot.

I'm going to assume that outside of Harry's direct experience (of which is the only real direct knowledge we have of the Wizarding world), Hogwarts and the Ministry are otherwise at least functionally competent.

As an Educator. Schools in general have teacher training, some of which is likely training in recognising the various forms of child abuse. Even if Dumbledore hasn't been teaching students regularly since he became Headmaster (and thus doesn't have the pulse on more modern beliefs on the subject), it's likely (again assuming competence) that even as Headmaster, he'd have received that same training. Regardless of whether Dumbledore considers Harry's childhood to be good or not, his training would tell him otherwise.

As part of the Wizengamot. The Wizengamot is a body that both sets and enforces the laws of Magical UK. Given that corporal punishment is canonically no longer allowed at Hogwarts, we can assume that, at the least, the Wizengamot must have passed at least /some/ child abuse laws that would force Hogwarts to end Corporal Punishment (and if that's not actually the case, then that would mean that that rule change was likely implemented by Dumbledore himself, which would mean he'd know that at least physical punishments of that nature were not good).

Since Dumbledore is effectively at least the Head Speaker of the Wizengamot, he'd /have to know/ about the laws that are proposed, and he'd also have to know about those laws when someone inevitably breaks them. This means that there is no functional way that Dumbledore wouldn't know that whatever abuses Harry suffers is considered to be bad, regardless of Dumbledore's feelings on the subject.
