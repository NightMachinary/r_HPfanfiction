** I don't have any links, but I know I've seen some fics with Gringott's providing lists of Harry's superpowers where there are entries like "Metamorphmagus (100% bound), Magical Core (90% bound), Elemental Mage (100% bound)." Usually these are removed as quick and easy as flipping a light switch, and Harry never uses any of these powers for the rest of the fic.

******* With the shopping trip, it's at least one and done. I understand setting the scene and all that, but /paragraphs/ of detail on how luxurious and Wealthy the robes are turns into wank after the 10th time. ^{and half your story is just violent pornography so it's kinda gratuitous at this point}

*** Oh yes, I read this entire story (to torture myself) and came here to recommend it.

For those of us who haven't read it, go through the first chapter for fun and then skim through the rest if you want to read about Harry's massive island, buddy-buddy relationship with Thor from the MCU, and his 53 girl Harem involving like 20-30 OCs/crossover characters.

10/10 would recommend again.

**** I enjoyed these stories when I first got into Harry Potter FanFiction. My taste has changed however to where I seek higher quality stories than that.

At the end of the day however people like what they like. I do me and they do them.

** 125% Dumbledore

80% Lily

75% Horcrux

(numbers +- this but I'm not sure other than 125%) and 2-3 thing/people with over 50% with his other abilities like Metamorphmagus bound.

''Wtf how it is possible'' I said when I first read it and I exit the fic as fast as possible.

** Read a evil story once. Think it was called dark repurcussions. Wouldn't re ommend unless you're over 18, deals with rape and a whole bunch of graphic shit. But Harry's power is blocked and when it gets unblocked he literally can think of something ND it happens. He gets balanced after a bit but it pretty funny

** I like some of these magic bound stories but only when Harry doesn't turn absolutely godlike. Him having metamorphic abilities locked or having a certain magic creature inheritance locked is fine, but giving him a ton of insane powers all at once is too much.

** He is obviously a non native english speaker, so he probably has a dictionary, but cant translate whole sentences properly. If his stuff was run through something like Google translate, the result is to be expected. This does not excuse the writing though. Get an English beta
