I was just reading a story that made a mention of Hermione trying to integrate Muggle medical practices in Wizarding Britain(I stopped at that point and am now writing this).

We know from Rowling that mundane illnesses are easily dealt with in the Wizarding World, the flu might be handled with a Pepper Up potion and broken bones withe Skelegro([[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability]]). But I was wondering what can Wizards gain from Muggle medicine.

The only thing that I can think of is what is shown a bit in canon Book 5, with the stitching when normal spells weren't working(or Arthur was being dumb, can't recall). It's entirely possible that Wizarding Doctors have a similar issue that a few century ago surgery was largely not done due to high fatality and the Do no Harm section of the Hippocratic oath. It's a fun fact that a lot of doctors resisted the development of surgery due to the seriousness they took the Hippocratic Oath.

But on that point, surgical knowledge and expertise would likely be very useful when dealing with cursed wounds, simply excise the afflicted region then regrow the area with magic. It's entirely likely that chopping off Dumbledore's hand could have saved his life if he or Snape had been radical enough to try it.


** This is an issue where you'll have to figure it out in your mind the limitations of magic and mundane healing - it can certainly be done either way - particularly for the cursed wounds, like you mention.

Another could be to look at/place limits on some of the internal aspects of wizarding healing. Eg, perhaps 'simple' aspects (broken bones, burns, etc) can easily be healed with it - but more complex aspects (eg, a head injury that causes brain damage) might not. In canon, it also seems that eyesight is tough or impossible to fix, lending support to that.

At the least, I could see integrating current medical /knowledge/ into what they do - and, if you so choose, to make a mix of it work better. Perhaps it turns out that for certain conditions, surgery is still needed - but now, magic can heal up afterwards far more efficiently.

*** Something that always bugged me in canon, and most of fanon is the lack of analytical magic. Magicals should have far greater means of learning things compared to muggles who in comparison have to muddle through the world half blind and deaf, unable to see the natural truths of the world that magic allows them to see.

Part of this is because I can't help but compare HP to the Spellmonger series(which isnt a childs series so its a bit unfair) where the mages actually study magic and actively understand it and create new spells and contrivances every book(and only occasionally as plot devices).

But even without that, the supposed magic people of the ancient world like the druids were less about having magic powers and more about secret understandings of the world.

** I'd argue that, barring certain extreme circumstances, magical healing is just plain better than it's non-magical counterpart. Consider the spell /Episkey/, which seems to be the go-to basic healing spell. It fixed Harry's broken nose instantly, whereas in reality such an injury would take 3 weeks to fully heal. They have pastes for bruises which remove them in an hour (instead of the fortnight it would usually take to fade) and a burn paste strong enough to work on those caused by dragon-fire.

** If only one in 10000 people is magical, then the wizarding world has way less people to specialize and research specific things, which drastically reduces the amount of breakthroughs. Magic counteracts this by making things much easier to do, but in the long run the magical world always generates less collective knowledge. It took millions of scientists over generations to create the understanding that we have of how everything works. Wizards just don't have the manpower to match that.

*** This is one of the most overlooked aspects across the board. Mostly it's brought up in context of combat ("we muggles outnumber you so we win lol" even though numerical advantage has a minuscule impact compared to technological advantage, and magic is the ultimate advantage in that area).

Even when mentioned in context of economics I've only ever seen it mentioned with the relative sizes of the economies, not the intellectual capital. One fic had a muggle threaten to purchase the entire wizarding economy outright and replace galleons with pounds. Which... is ludicrous. Muggle money has absolutely zero value for wizards because any competent schoolboy can transfigure as much of it as he wants. There are no ways to defend against counterfeiting and thus zero trust. In fact, the threat in reverse is stronger: wizards could collapse the global economies in a week by artificial inflation using perfect counterfeits en masse.

But anyway, that's a tangent. You are perfectly right that innovation in the wizarding world is orders of magnitude slower than the modern muggle world. It's closer to the rate of innovation in rural Europe during the early medieval period, methinks. They have more interconnections due to instantaneous travel but their community is still as tiny as a single city. The collaboration and specialization opportunities are simply not there.

**** Magic provides a relatively constant but huge advantage, higher numbers provide faster progress which provides a growing advantage. Eventually the muggles will be more advanced, even if around the time of the books wizards are ahead in most areas. But if they need a specialist in a narrow field, there probably isn't a single wizard one in the entire world while there's hundreds of muggles, so highly specialized topics is where they'd be best off using muggle knowledge.

***** Precisely. The muggles have hit the vertical portion of the exponential curve, and the wizards are still several hundred years away from it. Unless wizards piggy back off of muggle innovation (which, with the cultural segregation and technology not playing nice with magic, seems vanishingly unlikely) the muggles will hit the Singularity first. And then not only will technology be indistinguishable from magic, muggles will have the intellectual capital of billions in order to take advantage of it more effectively using specialization.

** I've said it before, but there's no reason why some 'Muggle' medicine can't just be Potions or such in disguise. I mean, do /you/ know how vaccines are made? I don't. Do you actually follow each individual shot from its creation to the moment it's injected? I don't think anyone does.

Muggle from 1919: "So if I swallow this, my pain will go away?"

Current Head of Wizard Health Outreach: "Yes, but it's highly addictive. It's made from... Weasley, what's that Mugg- I mean, that new thing that everyone is addicted to?"

Arthur Weasley's father: "...Opium, sir?"

Head: "Yes. It's made from the same minerals as opium."

Weasley: "Plant, sir."

Head: "Right."

My guess is nothing.

The stitches didn't work. The healer had to create or find an antidote. So, with that in mind, I don't think you can cut off or cut out a curse. The Dark magic in the wound is, I suppose, intangible. You need the counter curse, the antidote, the draft and there's nothing muggle that can help with that.

*** Even more fundamentally, I'm not even sure that Muggle understanding of biology is correct in the HP universe.

For a start, given the existence of the soul, as well as the way we see inanimate matter "given life" in various spells without necessarily any structural (physical) change occurring, I'd expect some form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism][vitalism]] to be the correct description of life.

Secondly, one only has to consider e.g. semi-transfigured mice which are half-snuffbox and therefore missing half their organs (but still alive) to realise that biology doesn't work the way Muggles think it does.

Honestly I wouldn't even be prepared to assume that cells exist.

** I don't know if simply cutting away the cursed tissue and then healing the rest would work, but based on the fact that its still a problem I wouldn't think that it does.

Some enterprising muggleborn or halfblood would have tried it already, and "Healer discovers a method to remove cursed scars" would have made the prophet regardless of blood status. Additionally, if it works, then wizard healers have no business scoffing at it or not employing the method, which makes me think that it doesn't work.

Which leads to the question of why - what even are cursed wounds?

Obviously ones caused by dark magic or dark creatures. What makes dark magic different than normal magic? It requires evil intent, and corrupts the wielder's soul.

So either the wound is infected by the caster's dark magic, which is saturated by enough hate and evil to resist any sort of constructive effort on it (which leads me to believe that dark magic doesn't require /evil/, but /absolute destruction/ as a mindset), or the magic damages the soul of the victim, which manifests as a scar on the body.

Personally, I think it's both - the wound is saturated by dark magic, and the soul is damaged, and until the dark magic is gone, the soul can't heal.

#+begin_quote
  "One thing that you will learn in my class is that, whilst wizards and witches have magic, many things that they do can be done just as well, if not better, by Muggles who utilise such mediums as electrical power. Something that I will ask of you regularly, particularly those of you who carry on with this subject during your N.E.W.T level studies, is to come up with ideas for how certain aspects of Muggle culture can be used to better the Wizarding world. Some of you may think that such a notion is preposterous, but just this summer St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries carried out its first organ transplant; something that the Muggle world has been able to do for decades, if not longer. The healer who carried this out was a Muggle-born, who had just finished healer's training six weeks prior, and the idea for organ transplants was born in this very classroom during that woman's sixth year in this school. Loath as they are to admit it, even the most pure-of-blood healers are being forced to admit that such an action is the biggest advancement in healing practices in the Wizarding world since the invention of the Wolfbane Potion by Hector Damocles in 1979, that's thirty-three years ago."

  "You're selling muggle paracetamol? To magicals?"

  "Not exactly"

  "Really? Because it looks exactly like that to me."

  "I am marketing it, yes, but it's for the sake of the children"

  "What do you mean?"

  "Harry, the magical world separated from the muggle world centuries ago. And while certain advances, such as the wireless, photography, and motor vehicles, have been picked up to some extent, the magical world is generally completely ignorant of the majority of scientific and technological advances."

  "So?"

  "Including advances in medicine. When the worlds separated, non-magical medicine was largely guesswork, superstition, and really pretty risky."

  "OK, but isn't magical medicine better anyway? I mean, just of the top of my head, the Episkey spell, blood replenishing potions, numbing charms...even Skele-Grow" he added with a shudder.

  "Well, yes, in many ways magical medicine has the edge. But there are areas where muggle medicine is just as good, if not superior."

  "Which areas?"

  "Surgery, for one. Magicals don't do surgery. And they believe the non-magical version is butchery, whereas in reality although all surgery does have risks, many surgeries are comparatively safe, routine procedures, completed under anaesthetic in sterile conditions. I can't prove it would have worked, but perhaps if Professor Dumbledore had had his hand amputated, it might have stopped the curse from spreading entirely."
