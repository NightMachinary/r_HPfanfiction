I joined this subreddit a few days ago and I have to ask, where have the het shippers been hiding? Here?? I've rarely seen canon/het shippers that were really into the fandom before this. On behalf of the rest of the fandom I'm just going to apologize and run before you chase me down with pitch forks for being an emotional teenager that's bad at writing.


** Yeah that's the sub! You can also check out [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] it's a very nice community

** apparently. this sub was my first real introduction to harry potter fanfiction and that's probably a good thing. Had I tried just from Ao3 or something I'd probably be dissillusioned from the whole thing. I get the appeal of pairing enemies together but if I have to read another Harry/Draco or Harry/Tom Riddle, I'll tear my eyes out.

*** Heh you got me there, I've definitely spent a lot of effort ignoring people arguing about wether a character I like is awful or not.
