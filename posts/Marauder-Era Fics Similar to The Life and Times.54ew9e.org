Does anyone know any marauder-era focus that are as good, or better than The Life and Times? This is one of my favorite tics but it is sadly left unfinished.


** Try Commentarius, but it's similar to TLAT in that it's absurdly long (it has 736k words while TLAT has 613k) and both hasn't been updated since 2013. linkffn(3323816)

Skimming through my old list and I remember really liking Lily Evans and the Wolfsbane Secret linkffn(3142554) and Crossroads linkffn(898884), though my tastes might have changed since then.

*** +1 for Commentarius; I've never been a fan of the style of writing that that story has, but there are always exceptions, and holy crap is Commentarius amazing! I'm still very hopeful that it will be updated eventually too, the author has a tumblr which is active and she has said that it is still a WIP, even if it's been a long while.

** Forever Alive by Mordred linkffn(1461086)

It's about the marauders years at Hogwarts. Canon compliant and brilliantly written. I highly recommend giving it a go.

  Before the boy who lived, there was another story. One of a monster inside of a man. One of a hero inside of a child. One of a traitor inside of a friend. And one of an angel inside of a demon. COMPLETED.
