** This is good. I've finished the first chapter, and go on to the second with dread, because I know it's all that's available right now.

Do you have projected updates scheduled for this, or is it update-on-the-fly?

**** I feel you. This is why I like to have long chapters of 10k words or so, as it means that updates, while less frequent, are more substantial.

** Awesome story so far - looking forward to reading more. Any news on this as to how often you'll be updating it?

I remember reading one where HP gets Dumbledore's power after he died, but that story wasn't canon. It was one where Harry learns how to manipulate the Great Hall and things like that. Any idea what story that was? I've been looking for it for a while.

** I've been following you since lords of magic, and so when I saw that you had uploaded a new story, I was very happy. As for this story, I've really enjoyed it so far. It's a really cool concept, and your flow is very nice. Just wanted to let you know that you've got a fan here who eagerly awaits the next chapters!

*** I forgot to mention in the first chapter author's note: the idea of Harry with Dumbledore's memories was originally done by Taliath with the fic "In Light of Silver Memories" which I mentioned in the title here.

When I upload chapter 3 (this weekend, if I continue writing at the current rate) I'll edit the chapter 1 author's note to say this.

*** Not so far away. The next chapter is going to have four scenes, more or less, and I'm currently about half way through writing the third scene. In terms of words I have 8000 words of the next chapter written, with a projected chapter total of around 11,000 words.

What are 'ideal charms'? Are they a fanfiction trope, or something of your own creation?

*** They're something of my own creation which have appeared in my other fics.

Most charms are literal charms: you cast them directly on the thing you want to affect. So if you want to protect a certain area, you go around that area casting spells at the border to create a "property line".

An ideal charm is cast symbolically rather than literally. You want to guard against entrance, you place a charm on an object with symbolises entrance, like the front door. It now protects the whole house against entrance. You want to protect against fire? You cast the fire-dampening charm on the oven, and now the whole house is protected against fire.

A like-for-like comparison of charms will show that ideal charms are typically stronger. However, they do possess certain weaknesses too, as shown in the fic.
