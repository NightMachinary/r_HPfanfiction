Genuinely curious. Over the months, I've noticed that there seems to be a surge of posts on this sub on Mondays, (though I suppose to people west of the International Dateline, it might appear as a surge on Tuesday). Anybody have ideas as to why?

Thanks in advance!


** Perhaps it's pent up during the previous day. No post on Sundays, after all.

Really, I have no idea. I never noticed this phenomenon.

** People are usually busy with weekend activities on Saturday and Sunday. Then they return to (largely boring) work on Mondays, and need to catch up for the past two days of inactivity.

** It's interesting because I've found that I have the most engagement on my fics on the weekends. In fact I changed my posting schedule to Fridays to catch the weekend crowd. Wonder why it doesn't translate to this sub.

*** Yeah, in my head it'd be busier on weekends because presumably more people have time then and starting Monday, people go back to doing work/school stuff during the week rather than on this sub.

*** Weekends and oddly, Thursdays have always been the good days to post for me.
