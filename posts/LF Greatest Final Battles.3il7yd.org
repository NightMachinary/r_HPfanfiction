It's always struck me as sad when Voldemort (or whoever the final enemy is) is destroyed by deus ex machina or some other sort of ending. The battle between Voldemort and Albus Dumbledore in OoTP was one of my favourite scenes of the films.

So please rec me some good final battles, although any fic with good fighting scenes is welcome.


** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) has some great battle scenes with all of its opponents, though the final battle with Voldemort in the third book of the trilogy is probably the best.

***** On second thought it was my favorite as well. Maeve was great too (I liked seeing Dumbledore take a shot at her particularly because it showed how strong he was like the two on two fight when he's not gimped for one reason or another like in book 1 when the author had no idea how strong to make him and against Voldemort in Lord for instance), but that two on two was amazing.

As a one on one fight, Tessa is still my favorite, I liked how her attitude, how she matched him blow for blow magically, and the craziness because of the Word.

** The story doesn't really hold up to rereading, but in case you haven't read it yet, linkffn(Dumbledore's army and the year of darkness) had a rather brutal and lengthy final battle. The first time I read it I had to take a break. The sequel is worse (and *extreme* AU).

Edit: I had commented twice because comments were buggy, now that they're showing up I deleted the extra.

** The final battle in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5189189/1/The-World-I-Leave-Behind][The World I Leave behind]] is excellent. This story has the most innovative use of the Ressurection Stone I've ever seen -- the scene in which Harry brought out all of Voldemort's past victims is awesome, and when he brought out Merope Gaunt to talk to Voldemort, I nearly lost my shit. Many aspects of the magical theory are non-canon, which is generally a turn off, but this fic makes it work /so/ well.

** linkffn(the Dark Lord'S Equal) has some pretty awesome scenes, and I recall the final battle against Voldemort rather fondly, as well as being very chaotic.

Alternatively, you might want to read linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black), where Harry joins the British Army as a Military Mage, and brings destruction down upon his enemies. It goes back and forth between battle, character development, and political intrigue, but I find that all three parts are done excellently.

** Two less conventional suggestions . . .

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7559031/1/Witnessed-here-in-Time-and-Blood][Witnessed here in Time and Blood]] by whistle.the.silver. White it contains only limited action scenes, it addresses the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts better than any story I've ever read. The two chapters it spends on the treatment and disposal of the corpses are brilliant in their nuance and originality. Taken as a whole, the story would benefit from losing a few of its many thousands of words of claustrophobic angst, but it's well-written and offers excellent insight into its characters.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent is an increasingly surreal apocalyptic nightmare with mythic elements and tantalizing hints of backstory. The author could have benefitted from a good editor to fix the mechanics and catch bits of flat writing, but the author's imagination is unmatched. The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort still makes me shiver.
