This is a long shot, but Harry has a magical familiar like a cat or something and he named it Laxus as a dig at Snape.

If anyone knows this I'd appreciate the title or a link.


** I remember that. Basically Harry was a giant crazy troll. The cat was called LAxus and could deflect magic with his tail. Also spent a lot of time annoying Snape.

But I think it was deleted from [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Sorry :(
