Bums me out. I have reread fics, but then I go into the fic with a mindset of doing something again rather than something new.


** I've had this happen a few times. Another one that gets annoying is when you reread a fic you absolutely loved, but the second time feels too cringy.

**** Exactly. I'm literally reading it right now. While it's still a great fix, I'm not as hooked as I once was.

**** First read-through was definitely the best on that one - actually had my heart pounding a couple of times from tension, which obviously isn't going to happen again, it's easier to notice the warts on rereads, and some of the tropes haven't aged well at all.

** What's even worse for me is accidentally re-reading a fic that you originally dropped and not remembering why it was that you dropped it.

*** That's why I started keeping a spreadsheet of the stories I read. I started out with a text file containing the title, the URL, and the last chapter I read. It just sort of grew from there.

** When entire scenes are removed and it feels like the story's soul has been scooped out and tossed side.

**** There was a scene where Hagrid needed comforting for something. Harry and Ron told stories about their past abuse (Harry's by the Dursleys and Ron's by an extended family member, maybe) as a way of showing solidarity and commiserating with him.

There's another scene where Harry is asked out by a boy from another House and he's all, “sorry pal I don't swing that way but way to have courage for asking.” Someone hears him taking about a dude asking him out and tries to pressure him into naming names so they'll “all be safe” or some bs. He tells them to gtfo.

Without those scenes the story is just run of the mill time travel do-over and alcoholism.

** I hate also when you find a fic you loved that wasn't, with a rare and interesting pairing, but when you find it again they've rewritten it for worse. I am still mad about one in particular I can't remember the name of. They rewrote it to be so contrived and cliche, absolutely ruined the ship dynamics, and even added in Evil Potioness Molly! for good effect although in this fic she potioned Remus to not love Sirius and instead date Tonks. Needless to say I stopped reading after that

** You can't accidentally reread fics if you don't read fanfics anymore (insert finger tapping head meme guy here).
