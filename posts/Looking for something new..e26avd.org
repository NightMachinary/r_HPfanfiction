I'm tired of endlessly browsing Fanfic and AOO for new interesting stories to read. Any recs? Crossovers are good too!

What I like: slight/unique canon divergence, humor/parody/tongue-in-cheek, minor characters getting some screen time, Alternate relationships (slash is fine), exploration of alternative magic/aspects of magical society, Just a really unique twist

What I don't want: Bashing of anyone, Ultra-powerful LoD!Harry, Harems, Harry's brother is the chosen one, Explicit sex/violence, An abusive childhood, Do-over fics, X adopts Harry,


** It sounds like your tastes match mine, so let me self-shill here. My own story is still rather new, but the reception so far has been rather great. linkffn(13437829)

Got so tired of reading tropey Lord Potter-Black fics, I decided to write my own fic, without any of that :)

  Veela Curse played straight. To knowingly and willingly save the life of a Veela, is to become one yourself. Harry Potter saves the life of a little girl, and in so doing, saves the world. Starts GoF, No Bashing, Eventual Fem!Harry/Daphne Femslash

** linkao3(14074770)

this is a really good au in which lily evans is a muggle and petunia is a witch. there's no bashing, the characters are their canon selves, and it's told from the perspective of a character whose point of view is rarely seen in fanfiction.

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

  The Fab Five face their greatest challenge yet: Rubeus Hagrid. He's got no closet, no bathroom, a bad recipe for rock cakes, a fifty-year-old moleskin coat, and an overgrown beard. Along the way, the Fab Five realize that Hogwarts itself seems to need their help just as much as Hagrid. YAAASSS QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!WINNER for 2018 Beyond the Nook Fanfiction Awards, Best Comedy!
