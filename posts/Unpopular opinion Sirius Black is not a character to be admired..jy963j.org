Sirius represents the excesses of Gryffindor to me. So brash, self-righteous and arrogant that he can't really admit when he was wrong.

For example: What people fail to realize when they rush to defend Sirius for his ‚Äúprank‚Äù is that Snape wasn't the only person endangered by it. Even if we give part of the blame to Snape for walking into what he must have suspected was a trap what did Remus do to deserve this? Sirius came within a hair's breadth of being responsible for one of his best friends becoming the monster they feared most. Years later he doesn't even pause to apologize for potentially putting Remus in that position in his rush to say that Snape would have deserved it. (Which I also disagree with but it's his actions towards his friend I find most abhorrent here.)

Given that, we all know who would be truly responsible for a gentleman with an axe coming to put Lupin down if things had played out differently. If James didn't have a far more developed conscience or understanding of the danger/consequences than his friend, Moony would have taken a chunk out of Snape at the very least. And I can't see Sirius shedding tears over Snape being mauled to death or infected. At least not until the Auror's come to put Remus down.

This pattern repeats itself with Sirius over and over. Regret and remorse are anathema to him unless he harmed someone close to him. Snape deserved it. Regulus was an idiot (his brothers death made very little impact on him). Even as he denounces Crouch for his treatment of Winky, Sirius is quite happy to throw Kreacher across a room for the latter being unpleasant.

But outside of those acts and those tendencies Sirius is basically a good person. When his hatred isn't in play he seems to do his best to do right by others. He's somewhat kind and thoughtful. He fought against Voldemort fairly openly at a relatively young age. And a lot of the above issues I have with Sirius are worsened by immaturity, his family issues and 12 years solid of Dementor exposure. But his self-righteousness and lack of remorse rub me the wrong way.

Overall I don't like Sirius Black much. I consider him to be the darkest of the good guys after Snape and Dumbledore. And I feel Sirius didn't really learn from his mistakes.

This is just my opinion though. And you can feel free to disagree


** Yes, he's flawed. That's the point.

But he also has redeeming qualities. Namely his loyalty to his friends. Not to mention how he treats Harry.

If people can stan certified pieces of shit like Snape and Malloy they can do the same for Sirius.

*** Sirius went from an abusive household into a war, then over a decade in hell prison and then spent 2 years on the run and another year trapped in his shitty childhood home.

Sirius is remarkably put together considering the life he has lived.

I imagine if he had survived the five book and got his freedom he might have grown allot as a person

You want to know why people are quick to forgive Sirius, because his redemption arc is quite tangible, In his own words, he and James were assholes, specially to Snape. We never got similar confession of any sorts from snape eh? Also remember, sirius also said that Snape gave back as good as he got, and considering who his friends were besides lily, i think we can all agree that he was no saint( remember, the claim that Snape knew more about the Dark Arts as a first year than many more senior pupils)

********* I disagree. I am not a big fan of Snape but what you are saying goes completely against the spirit in which the story is written, namely, love triumphs. Voldemort specifically mocks Snape's love for Lily as only lust when in fact he worked the whole time after he killed her to avenge her. If he only wanted to fuck her, he would have moved on. But the fact that he actively fought to bring down her killer and protected her son that looked like his bully, years after she was gone proves that he truly loved her.

If he ACTUALLY loved Lily AT ALL, romantically or not (ESPECIALLY if not, as you're arguing), he would have done everything in his power to help HER son. Forget James, he doesn't matter since he's dead, but by Merlin this baby boy is going to grow up to be the smartest wizard of his age while hearing countless tales of his amazing, studious, wonderful mother, because I, Snape, loved her and cherished her memory and oh wait that's a lie I MENTALLY TORTURED HER SON AND LAUGHED because for SOME reason I'm so mentally unstable that I keep seeing his father after, surprise, pushing his buttons in ways to force such a confrontation.

And without that, what did Snape actually do for the general populace? Joined the Death Eaters? Abused fifteen years worth of students?

I'm sorry, did I miss a book where it explained the 70's-80's portion of the war in any kind of detail? Snape was a muggle-raised half blood, likely he had very little information other than what other Slytherin's were giving him. Don't conflate fanon with what little canon we actually have.

What happened was the equivalent of someone signing up for any sort of lesson and Shia Lebeouf gives a half-assed explanation of what it is, shouts "JUST DO IT!" and punches you in the face. Repeatedly. Eventually he gets offended and stops the lessons altogether.

God all of this is a /reach/.

He didn't know what Voldemort would do with the Prophecy, Voldemort's actions are his own, not Snapes. We have no clue what was said about Voldemort while he was in school. Did he kill people? Probably. Point is /we don't know/ so we can only go on what we /do know/. And even if we pretend for some reason that all the things you claim he did do did happen, it doesn't change the fact that Snape still was instrumental to ending the war. People change, sometimes they don't change, doesn't really matter when Snape actively worked to make the world a better place, the reasons don't matter, the result does.

He got ppl to be quiet bc they were afraid of him, not bc they respected him, there's a gigantic difference there, mainly when it comes to children. They were afraid of being punished bc he was clearly injust with non-slytherins, therefore they tried not to get on his way or provoke him.

And treating the children that way, was part of his job being a double agent. He could've treated them as Lupin did, but it would've blown his cover.

Even because of such demeanor, Bellatrix suspected him (in book 6) that "all these years, he couldn't manage to kill the boy." Just imagine the difficulties Dumbledore and others would've faced only if Snape had been polite towards students.

Bellatrix does not make the decisions about who gets to be a Death Eater and would not attack Snape without orders to do so, so her opinion doesn't matter, but just for the record, her distrust of him had nothing to do with his behavior in the classroom.

**** Ppl tend to see that Sirius also suffered abuse at home due to his mother. There's many stories going that route that he's suffered similar abuses except Sirius was rich where Severus was poor which is a humiliation that Sirius never understood. Sirius was also never taught consequences to actions - he is a pureblood, hence he can get away with just about anything and then he meets up with another pureblood. One that befriends him. James accepted him as a brother with a second home so Sirius was given full permission to act the way he does - it's not right and him essentially getting away with attempted murder is ridiculous. Remus should have dropped him as a friend but I can see him desperate for the brotherhood he never thought he could have due to his monthly. These are plots that no one talks about later - they see Azkaban as a good enough punishment. Also it makes for an easy route to get Harry out of the Dursleys. Not as if ppl sit Harry down and tell him the backstop of his godfather. Just the good bits and his stupid 'kid mistake'. Now Severus, I love him.

Andromeda got the hell out of there and cut all ties, Sirius was the child that constantly were at odds with his parents, who were all bigoted as hell.

Snape came from an abuse household, was a bigot since he was 11, ended his "only" friendship out of numerous horrible decisions. After that he joined a terrorist group that attacked pepole like his "friend", was so loyal that the second he found out about a possible treat due to the prophecy, he sent the dark lord after little children.

but wait, one of the mothers is his "friend", you dont trust the dark lord to save her life so you go to Dumbledore, he hides them and they still die, you mistreat both orphans you are responsible for (Neville and Harry).

****** I don't know, the great thing about fanfiction is filling the blank with your own narrative. As I see it, Sirius only broke free because he had the backing of the Potters. He had a 'safety net' vs Severus who had no one, just his wits. Jealousy and having the wrong sort in your ear can mess with you, especially kids/teen. Surrounded by a grp of death eaters in the making with promises of something /more/ (The Nazi BS comes to mind) can make think/say shit like Severus calling Lily a mudblood. Pretty sure the man regretted it and that was his turning point but if you consider psychological effects of the narrative spoken to him 24/7 I'm not surprised he said what he said, especiallyafter such a horrendousand humiliating act courtesy of Sirius. Losing that friendship was from his own doing of course but if James wasn't there it's a 50/50 guess how Sirius would have turned out. Would he have left? Have stayed? Imperius curse comes to mind or blood contracts - i wouldn't put it pass the Black's, after all they had a mental illness of crazy zealots. Andromeda was smart. She said fuck it and bounced. Kudos to her. I don't think Severus knew enough of Lily and her family to know that the prophecy was of Harry aka his BFF child. While yes, severus was in slytherin and lily in Gryffindor he did hold true love for her, shown by his anigmus plus the guilt he carried. Granted his actions were assholish and he did partake in death eater activity he also became an informant and had to keep up appearances no matter how horrible he had to be. His turning point had to be when Lily died by his own hand - that has to fuck with someone. As far as I am aware he asked Voldemort to spare Lily and he did tell her to move aside but the mother 'sacrificed herself - by fanfiction notes it's blood magic. Yes, Snape was an asshole but if you go through his timeline you can understand why - not that it's an excuse - but also he chose to stay and wallow and be this persona vs finding salvation in another manner. In fanfiction you can find Severus deciding to correct his mistakes by taking in Harry as a way for Lily's spirit to forgive and to Harry in as part of his blood debt. Sirius is NOT a good person. Same as Snape is not a good person. They both have been fucked over and went in routes that made them assholes and Snape has more filler of angst simply because Sirius has been in Azkaban for over a decade. Both aren't perfect.

** I think there is the expectation that because Sirius disagreed with his family's ideology, he was able to shake off all of their other faults as well. However, I find that the best written iterations of Sirius is an individual who, despite not subscribing to the Blacks' views on blood purity, still has their quieter flaws that he did internalize during his childhood. As people have pointed out, arrogance and undeserved self-righteousness are not limited to Gryffindors alone, and are very evident in purebloods' attitudes of superiority. Canon points out the similarities between Sirius and his family members that still exist after his years of imprisonment and fighting against their beliefs, but because he's a secondary character at best, this is never really elaborated on.

Moreover, it's unlikely anyone ever outright told Sirius's he was wrong. Remus admits he pretty much let the other Marauders do whatever they wanted, and Peter is described as a follower. The only friend who might have challenged Sirius was James, who for the most part also suffered from the same flaws, though to a lesser extent. The Hogwarts disciplinary system is more focused on curbing symptoms of bad behavior than correcting their sources, as evidenced by Harry only ever getting in trouble for breaking rules and his hero complex never being addressed seriously by the staff.

In my opinion, the fanfictions that best depict Sirius are the ones that not only embrace the mentioned flaws, but connect them to his upbringing and the lack of correction of that attitude.

** I don't think J. K. Rowling wrote any perfect characters, But it's the redeeming qualities of sirius black that make him so beloved within the fandom. he loved Harry, And was the closest thing he ever had to a father.... Well a Godfather.

‚Äã

Sirius Was far from perfect but that's what made him such a great character.

Sirius Was raised by the bat shit crazy Black family, Who were vicious Bigotes, Spent a decade in prison, And almost 2 years half starved on the run.

‚Äã

It's amazing the guy isn't in the same state as Neville Longbottom's parents, He's functional and trying to be A good force in Harry's life, Trying to give him some semblance of family.

‚Äã

Like frankly it's amazing the character was as functional as sirius was... Given the circumstances.

Everything sirius black went through as a character, It just shows his determination and ability to love Unconditionally, Which is incredible, Given the whole prolonged exposure to the Dementors thing. Sirius loved Harry and that Is one of his greatest redeeming qualities as a character

But like I said, friends don't betray secrets and it doesn't matter where Remus got his info. What matters to me is that Sirius deliberately gave Snape crucial information because he wanted to, I don't know, scare him or something. Even if Snape kept asking him about this a hundred times and Sirius got sick of him, he shouldn't have done this. And this prank is hardly worthy of praise, even if Sirius only meant to scare Snape. It would look bad from anyone's point of view. Snape might enhance the severity while telling it, but the result is the same. Sirius doesn't conradict Remus when Remus says what happened. His only response is that it served Snape right for trying to find out what they were up to. He doesn't say he had noble motives or anything if your point is that the prank would be somehow different if Sirius was the one telling about it. It doesn't seem that it would be any better if told from his point of view.

As for Regulus, he does make it clear that he thought Regulus was an idiot and regretted the path he took, but to Sirius, once you make your choice, if you choose the side of evil, he will wash his hands of you.

** JK Rowling managed something very few fanfiction authors can do, create characters with depth. Most ff authors write flat characters, they're either 100% evil or 100% good. There's rarely a mixture of attributes. That's why so many fics end up as veritable bash-fests.

For instance, Ron has many not-so-impressive traits, but to turn him into a Death Eater is stretching the suspension of disbelief to breaking point. I can overlook it in time- or dimension-travel fics, because I don't really care what happens /before/ they travel. I usually just skim through the first chapter, because it's the /after/ part that's interesting. Shit happened, and now the story begins.

That's a very childish thing to say because no person, even in the real world, is perfect. Even you and I have great flaws which would make us unlikeable to certain people. Sirius is an extremely grey character which makes him tons more interesting to write than many others.

I love Sirius because despite everything he went through, he's still a primarily good person at heart.

Sirius did plenty of good things, but a few small mistakes make him unlikeable. But Snape did everything wrong and one good deed makes him some sort of saint. I don't ascribe to this notion by the fandom at all obviously.

** I think everyone around here is pretty much in agreement with Sirius having potentially endangered both Snape and Lupin and, depending on how the laws were, even Dumbledore because, while Lupin could still justify that he had no control over the situation, he was the one who made all the efforts to bring Remus to school. However I think Sirius never comprehends the extent of the consequences his actions could have had. And the bad thing is no one calls him out on that.

I think the idea is that he is darker even than Dumbledore and on par with Snape. His redeeming quality is the fact that he loves his friends, particularly James and by extension Harry, who looks like him. I think this was meant to contrast Snape's love for Lily but in her son he only got to see James. Nevertheless they both work to protect Harry. Dumbledore, despite his shady actions, I don't think he is dark. He shows genuine regret for his mistakes and does the best he can to help everyone. He is an advocate for the rights of those oppressed and usually battles his opponents through wits and power games. Voldemort was a special case since he was a violent terrorist so he needed to be put down. In the end all his actions, as convoluted as the plot may be, lead to the Scarcrux destroyed and Harry surviving.

Anyways, to summarize, I don't think Sirius is a good person and definitely not a role model. And he resembles Snape way more than Harry likes to think. We see Sirius in a sympathetic light and Snape not because of Harry's feelings towards them. But, all in all, they both seem as toxic characters.

** All the characters are flawed. It makes them fun to explore. This is also why the harry potter fandom has lived as long as it has. We are not given thst much information on Sirius Black or the black family. What we are given does not give a clear picture. What we have done as children is not a great indication of what people we are like as adults. I always thought that Sirius equily blonded and was trying to distance himself from his family. He also probably treated as a dark because of his name dispite being a grifford. I think his rebellion and anger were not always directed well. Sometimes we redirect that anger at the wrong people. Don't get me wrong this is not an excuse. But we never see a Sirius as an adult. What we get is an angree Child or the broken man forced back into his family's home. Yes he is not a great role model and I dont think he was ment to be. He was only family left for Harry. Looking back this makes me very sad. The only person that Harry had that was family was a man so broken and angry. Remus never seemed to build the same connection with Harry as Sirius did.

Now, about Regulus, it's hard to talk about how he didn't feel his brother's death, when they weren't close at all even at school. Regulus was, at home, everything Sirius failed to be and when he became a death eater, it could have been the last straw for him. And Kreacher, who would do everything for Walburga and didn't lose a single opportunity to bad mouth Sirius for his choices, and the others as well, people who Sirius loved. Who knows what atrocities Kreacher was part of during Sirius's childhood. Also, there's the fact that no one, namely Dumbledore, being Chief Supreme of Wizengamot, raised a finger to help clear his name. Dumbledore KNEW Sirius didn't get a trial, there was no way he didn't and yet, did nothing to stop Snape's ratting him and almost killing an innocent man, instead of really help him. All of this, after 12 (years of waiting!) In Azkaban. He was, most probably traumatized. He went from a kid at school to a kid at a war. He lost his closest friends, he couldn't take care of Harry.

***** Yeah, because Sirius rebelled from family values and was abused until he ran away at 16 to the Potters. Didn't McGonnogal say during Harry's first year that the House would be their family? Stories knew about Lupin's fury little problem and Pettigrew was iffy. He really only trusted James as their friendship and meeting was somewhat similar to Ron and Harry.

** I actually find it super interesting when the negative sides of traits are explored. It makes for so much more depth and nuance. Yes Gryffindors tend be rather passionate about their vision of justice and that passion can lead them to be impulsive, stubborn or even self righteous or tunnel visioned. There are times where this makes heroes out of them as they rush head first to defend the weak, but other times not so much. So yes I think we may see this at times with Gryffindors.

However 1. I'm not sure anyone views any of the characters as perfect idols rather they admire certain things about them or find them very compelling (as books and movies are entertainment). I love Klaus Mikaelson from TVD and the Originals. I weep that we only got 5 seasons. I empathize with him often and think he's a great character but I also recognize that he's a paranoid narcissist and mass murderer. I simp for his character but I don't wish to ever date a man like that in real life obviously. I like Bellatrix as a character cause she's interesting but do not think she's a good person at all.

1. Personal bias I just hate Snape. Like not cause he's ~flawed~ but because I just don't find him at all compelling. To me he's a whiny crybaby incel. I haven't read the books in years but if I recall Snape was trying to get Lupin into serious trouble. Not like suspended, not a significant other to break up with him, not spill an embarrassing but relatively harmless secret, not jumped by a gang of students, not expose his nudes... If his secret got out he would be shunned not just by Hogwarts but the entire country, expelled, prob killed by the state. Sirius is the type to defend his friends against an injustice and prob thought the ends justified the means (like hoping Snape died or was bitten). He prob thought Snape was out of line because Lupin experiences true horror in his life that Snape can't imagine but if he is hellbent on poking around then let him get a taste. Not saying this was best tactic.

2. Do we know that Sirius didn't apologize to Lupin later? I honestly don't recall if it said he didn't, I'm sure it is something he would do privately. I mean Snape did become a Death Eater like, he can still think Snape deserved it while being sympathetic to possibly harming Lupin.

3. Sirius values people he believes to be just or on the just side. And he thinks the ends justify the means to defend justice. He views Regulus and Kreacher to not be on that side so that explains his behavior towards them. He does not value just treating everyone the same to keep the peace/status quo. He does not value family just for family sake. He's decisive. He feels in battle against anything that threatens his deeply held convictions (something that makes a lot of sense for someone who has spent their entire life in battle). Not saying this is ~the best~. I'm just explaining.

4. War does things to people. It makes enemies out of friends and family. It breeds suspicion, hysteria, panic, terror. Sirius has had a really hard life even in comparison to many of the characters. I'm surprised he isn't more violent, deranged, hellbent on revenge, doesn't want to just burn the whole wizarding community. As a child he was the outcast of the dysfunctional Black family, as an adolescent he was living through a war that lead to his chosen family betraying him and being killed and him going to hell for 12 years and made out to be an enemy of the state. I'm sure it killed him as someone who valued loyalty to his chosen family so much to be then viewed as having betrayed them. Then gets out to a world unrecognizable where everyone else including people he sees as undeserving like Snape got to live their lives and do and see things. Then he can't even do that he has to be a sub human fugitive and on the run and onto a second war. Tom Riddle experienced much less turmoil in his youth and still became Lord Voldemort.

But I get that this is a discussion so I'm just saying my opinion not reprimanding u or anything.

** Yes and you are a person who believes Snape is a God. What is wrong with gryffindor. What was brave and noble in the beginning you haters turn into brash and arrogant. You all like to point out the flaws in the characters of the light side and hide their good deeds. You then hide the many flaws in characters like Snape and Draco Malfoy and highlight their good deeds. Hypocrisy at is's best.

** One thing about Sirius bothers me the most, especially in regards to his relationship with Harry, is the scene in OotP when they're checking out the Black family tapestry. Sirius mentions that when he left home as a teen that he moved in with James and his parents. Instead of saying ‚ÄúYou know, Harry, I realize that you probably know literally nothing about your family. Why don't I tell you about them?‚Äù Sirius instead gives a rundown of the Black family and all of their issues that really serves no purpose to the plot.

*** He probably either suspected that Harry knew, or waited for him to bring it up. One of the things that bothers me is how Harry don't search for info about his heritage in the world, he completly ignores his grandparents on his fathers side.

Sirius was also really mentally ran down at that point in time, he was back in his childhood home, with a photo of his mother that won't shut up.

  He is obsessed with killing, maiming or otherwise harming dark wizards. It doesnt even matter if they are actually dark or not. As long as they meet his criteria for dark they are dark.
#+end_quote

What? What's the evidence for this? The only times we see Sirius attack anyone is the Snape incident (which was stupid and dangerous and the behaviour of a dickhead sure, but he was also what, fifteen? Everyone's a twat when they're a teenager); and when he fights Death Eaters at the Ministry to protect Harry.

I can't think of anyone he arbitrarily decides is dark - maybe there's a question mark over Snape, but let's be honest at the time Sirius went to prison, he knew Snape only as someone who joined the DEs. Then when he meets Snape again for the first time in twelve years, Snape speaks with relish about handing him over to the Dementors and having him kissed /and/ threatens Remus with the same. What evidence does Sirius really have that Snape is on their side? Why should he believe it? That's not about "as long as they meet his criteria for dark they are dark," it's Sirius making a judgement based on what he knows of Snape's character and actions.

**** I was talking about the fact that he started bullying 1/4 of the student population because Slytherin = dark. What falls under harming someone you assume is dark.

Killing and maiming is something I got from him showing no regret after setting Snape up to die. What made me think that he joined the aurors to clean up the trash. But well thats my interpretation of it.

***** I don't think there's actually any canon evidence that Sirius or James joined the Aurors. That's purely fanon.

I also get the impression that the majority of people they hexed were dark - look at what Lily says to Snape about Avery and Mulciber using dark magic on Mary McDonald. I don't think when the Marauders were in fifth year they were attacking Slytherin first and second years, but people like Snape and Mulciber who had quite clearly stated their intention to join Voldemort and were using dark magic on Muggle born students.

The werewolf incident is absolutely unforgivable. Even if he didn't care about Snape, he should have cared about Remus. But you can't extrapolate that he wanted to kill and maim people /in general/ from that. The thing between the Marauders and Snape was very specific and very personal.

I think Sirius had boundary issues, didn't always think things through and was incredibly impulsive. But I don't think he spent his life sitting around wanting to kill and maim those he considered bad. If that had been the case, he'd have escaped Azkaban earlier as his motivation would have been to track down and kill people like Lucius Malfoy. But he doesn't, he's only motivated to do anything when he realises Harry is in danger. His main motivation isn't bloodshed, it's loyalty to James and by default Harry.

Is he flawed? Yeah massively and the fandom overlooks that so badly. He's not a playboy or a big kid, he's a deeply damaged man who hasn't been given the help he needs. But your characterisation of him as basically a serial killer in waiting isn't accurate either.

  Its a miricle that he actually likes Remus. But even then he doesnt treat anyone other than James with respect, so thats debatable.

I feel as if James was the one who held the Marauders together. Without James, Remus, Sirius and Peter wouldn't probably be friends. Sirius seems to admire James more than Remus or Peter. That's why when James and Lily went into hiding, the Marauders started to fracture.
