** I think, none actually. One thing that Rowling does rather well is descriptions, for example, in the introduction to one book of the summer, its dryness, etc., and you rarely see that kind of thing in fanfiction. Fanfiction is usually more plot-focused.

*** One of my editing tasks is to grab an old fic that's worth the effort, and read the novels, compare fanfic, and improve the description to her fresh style. The description of the garden in the Burrow when he first goes there, for example.

That's when I realise, writing like JK is hard.

** linkffn(13009982) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13009982/1/The-Boys-of-Crowhill]["The Boys of Crowhill"]] has an old-fashioned storybook feel that reminds me of mid-century children's books, like /Half Magic/, /Ginger Pye/, or /Where the Red Fern Grows/. It's the friendship-adventure theme, and the writing style that avoids most or all of the typical fanfiction tells, ie, "emerald orbs", "said the raven-haired teen", and chapters constructed around walls of dialogue. This fic has structured paragraphs with a good balance of dialogue to prose, and thorough descriptions of place and setting, which fanfic tends to skip out on.

The aesthetics and style bear a lot of resemblance to the first Harry Potter book, but the setting itself is slightly different and explores magical theory in an AU way. It's one of those stories where I can relish the writing instead of trying to skip forward for the plot.

  Yes. It was a very special letter, this, and all Harry's. Mr Harry James Potter, that was his name written on the envelope, and the hard red sticker sealing it was wax, Professor Lupin said, and pressed into the wax was a picture Lupin called a seal, the seal of Hogwarts, a little too smooshy and blurred to make out entirely, but special nonetheless. Professor Lupin had showed him how to use the flat edge of a knife to pop the seal whole from the parchment, to preserve it if he wanted, and then there had been the letter. Oh, the letter- Harry had the entirety of it memorised already, but he read it again for the sheer delight of it.

*** I have a problem with that and with /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/, namely the way the children's dialogue is written.

I know that I spoke Swedish approximately as I speak Swedish now when I was five years old, and I did not at that time perceive the speech of those my own age as containing grammatical errors. Meanwhile, /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/ has children using wrong pronouns and misconjugating verbs at like six years old and /The Boys of Crowhill/ is pretty out there in this regard as well.

Edit: Also, in /The Boys of Crowhill/ it's Harry who makes grammatical errors, and either at an age of eleven or close to it, ages we can be sure that he wouldn't do so at in canon.

Edit2: It goes even further. People can learn languages that are incredibly grammatically complicated, like Finnish and German and speak them correctly as small children, and in these stories you see them unable to conjugate English verbs.

Most importantly, it reads like an expansion, yet separate part of the same world and is written not like a fanfiction but as a fiction book.

Or atleast, I'd love to see them as movies...

Good Luck with the copyrights for #2, though...

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

Well since nobody else has done it yet, I'ma put down HPMOR.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

[[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1]]

Say what you will about whether or not you /like/ HPMOR's Harry, the simultaneous amount of both world building and whimsy were rather spectacular in that work.
