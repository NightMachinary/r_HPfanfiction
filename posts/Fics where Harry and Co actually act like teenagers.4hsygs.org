Voldie optional, ofc.


** This would be nice. Almost all the fics I read, every Hogwarts student, at age 11, understands how emotions work, can read into minute detail the inner thoughts of their fellow students based on how they diverted their eyes one time, are fully versed in how adult politics work, and have a complete knowledge of magical history for the past 1000 years, including how dark magic isn't actually dark.

Edit: Except Ron of course.

*** Oh lord yes. Some little firsty wanders into Harry's train compartment and goes "I believe in you, Harry! You protect us, while the supposed Light side and their incompetent tactics just let murderers run free!"

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

** I've often thought about writing more realistic teenagers in my stories, but I just hate teenagers so much. I get so annoyed by my own writing of them in the editing process, I just restart.

It's much easier to make a slightly more aware teenager that does stupid things from time to time, than a realistic one. Let's be honest. If I were to make a teenager story, it would be awkward, self-centered, and incredibly whiny. Not trying to be a dick here, but when I was a teenager, I didn't know what I was feeling, let alone pay enough attention to look how anyone else was feeling.

*** Yeah but not all teenagers are like that. There's shades of grey just like how not all adults are boring/mature/intelligent/mean-spirited.

You can write teenagers realistically and still have a good story. You just need to ensure that the main character is still someone the reader wants to see succeed. They should still be able to understand his decisions and empathize with him.

I don't know about you, but when I was a teenager I didn't just do illogical things for no apparent reasons. I did things, sometimes the wrong thing, but I had reasons which made perfect sense with the information I had at the time.

The biggest thing that differentiates teen me and me now is the information and experience I have now.

**** I just think if we are all honest, teenage drama and inward nature wouldn't be the most interesting story. I'm not trying to say all teenagers are the same or irrational. Obviously there is grey in everything. True teenage writing in my opinion, creates an extremely unreliable narrator. In the hands of a great writer, that's fine. However, in the hands of most fan fictions writers, including myself, it creates a messy story that doesn't make much sense.

Yes. Definitely this. I would like to see more people try though. It gives them a new kind of challenge.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** I can't say that linkffn(harry potter and the final straw) actually has them acting like teenagers, but I always liked this little acknowledgement speech by an adult OC (a teacher):

""So what do you suggest then Albus? If the kid has the goods on you the way you say he does, I don't see how there's anything you can do. He can always just refuse to cooperate when the time comes, and you can't afford that. Plus, and correct me if I'm wrong.....what has he done that's so wrong? He got his freedom from relatives who hated him, is that bad? Snape was fired, after he attacked him, how was that Harry's fault? He wants total control of his Defense group, a group he never should have had to start in the first place, but did so on his own initiative, with very positive results. What has he done that's so wrong? If the kid was plotting to become the next Dark Lord I could see what all this fuss is about, but all I see is a young man who is quite justifiably paranoid...a paranoia that you have fostered Albus. Add to that his behaving like....I don't know....a teenager? Who would have thought that could happen?""
