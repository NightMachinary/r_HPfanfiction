Harry thinks what happened to him wasn't a big deal, which is a form of that mindset of it happened to me no one made it into a big deal.

But, it most definitely is. The amount of arguments from oh it's not abuse because he wasn't hit, is startling.

*Abuse can come in all forms. Sexual, Mental, Verbal. Neglect*

Harry lived in a nice house hold. There were two spare bedrooms he could have slept in, instead the Dursley's kept him under the cupboard of the stairs until he got his Hogwarts letter.

That is child neglect (at worst), and that's still a form of abuse.

And, I understand that child abuse was a different thing in the 1980's, but even then, I doubt it was normal to cram a child in that small of a place where you wouldn't even call it a room.

He wasn't starved like fanfiction likes to say he was, but at the same time he wasn't given what he liked to eat. Heck, the Weasley's gave Harry food during the Summer, especially when the Dursley's tried to put Dudley on a diet.

He wasn't forced to dumb down his school work like fanfiction likes to say he was, but he was also told not to ask questions, and that's bound to not interest him in school and other things.

While wearing hand me downs isn't bad (I love the feeling of hand me down clothes) the fact that Harry had to wear his cousins' overweight clothes, is another form of at most child neglect, which is still a form of abuse.

I can see why Molly didn't make a big deal when Ron, told her what had happened. She likely thought that they were exaggerating, plus it's the books and Rowling wanted the adults not to be involved as much.

But the amount of rape in fanfiction, the amount of starvation and other forms of abuse, and then Harry turns out perfectly fine, is just overwhelming. I like reading messed up stuff (that includes abused Harry stories) But, with the amount of extreme versions of abused Harry, plus he turns out perfectly fine, there are just felt the need to say something.

I understand it's fanfiction people are more then welcome to write what they wanted, just wanted to express my thoughts. What's your thoughts on it? How far are you willing to read a story with abused Harry in it?


** yeah. They basically gave Dudley twice as much of everything a child could ever want or need just to spite Harry.

then there is the staggeringly age inappropriate housework, and the lack of any form of agency or possessions, lying about his parent (denying him family), isolating him in every level of community; making sure he never got good grades and the frying pan comment...

And even worse they started off with an already horrifically traumatised his who saw his own mother get murdered, and only added to the damage.

There really is no real reason to make it even worse than Rowling's already horrible treatment unless it's relevant to the plot in some way

***** yeah but it can be hard to realise just how extremely not ok that shit is when you're in it, and all of the subtle ways that it can affect your sense of self and identity. He realised that being kept in a cupboard or being sent a few pence for Christmas are really shitty, but he still had a really dangerous habit for not valuing himself or his life the way a healthy kid should. He knew he wasn't a freak but he still didn't really know how to try hard on his school work after years of stifling his intelligence, and with people like Snape often repeating some of the same things his relatives did he was constantly being given the message that he was unworthy and asking for help or for anything at all was wrong because he didn't deserve it

And that's what I feel often gets lost when writers choose to level up the abuse, because psychological abuse is pervasive and lingering info adulthood, and having to get used to a whole new world with its own rules would be fucked up

****** On that note, Snape's behavior as a professor was abusive and completely unacceptable, especially in light of his compounding of verbal abuse on top of what Harry already experienced. That we're supposed to have a sudden change of heart once it's revealed he was in love with Lily is absolutely ridiculous, in my eyes. Imo, that's even less justification for his behavior. If a good friend of mine verbally abused my kid bc he couldn't get over not being picked as a romantic partner, I'd lose all respect for him.

I know this post isn't about Snape's verbal and emotional abuse in the series, but rather the fanfiction. However, Rowling's characterization of Severus is problematic and perpetuates the same issues with her dealing of the emotional fallout of Harry's abuse by his aunt and uncle. Except, Harry and us as readers are expected to forgive and forget - to the point of Harry naming his son after his verbally abusive professor. It's ludicrous, and perhaps worse than the issue of Petunia and Vernon. The audience and Harry are not ever expected to like them - even Dudley just gets a quiet tolerance after his feeble apology in the end of the series.

I can't help but think that if Rowling had written the abuse and Harry's response to it in her stories better, there'd be less fanfiction taking it even further into nonsense land.

******** Exactly. He's totally unempathetic and spends his entire life projecting his own bullshit onto his peers and then his students. That McGonagall and Dumbledore didn't remove him for his behavior is just another example of how backwards Rowling's world is upon further reflection.

I grew up on the Harry Potter series - movies and books. I love the magic of the world and some of the characters are still dear to me. But looking back, the story Rowling told was riddled with issues that are actually pretty damaging to read in a child's story, especially when they're presented as perfectly okay within the book.

Like I do have one fic where Vernon gets rapey, but that's because it's a) fem!Harry, which means a slightly different dynamic in the first place, and b) it's there because it gets petunia to wake the fuck up and lay down the law/change the way they handle Harry's character. But some people really do it just to add angst or brutalise Harry.

Like I'd also understand if someone wrote it to process their own abuse. But I do feel like you can generally pick those people, because the way they communicate it and the tone is quite different

********* For some reason I'm now thinking of possibly the only sort of next-gen fanfic I'd ever want to read - where Albus, with his traumatized parents' genes and +possibly Petunia's neglect by the Evanses+, manifests magical trauma symptoms. [EDIT: It's late and I'm getting a little jumbled; the genetic component wouldn't apply here since Albus is not a direct descendant of Petunia - but my curiosity about the Evans parents remains valid, I think.]

Because let's be real, abuse is often learned and passed on, it rarely springs out of nowhere. Vernon's violent temper is one thing, but Petunia's resentful neglect of Harry might be based in her own parents ignoring her once Lily became this special witch who got to escape to a faraway school.

Fandom tends to assume that Lily's parents were loving, doting, decent parents, but now I'm wondering how realistic that is given Petunia's inability (refusal?) to feel empathy for her sister's child.

** I agree with everything you said except for the starving thing. Given that it's often noted that Harry was small for his age, I don't think it's a stretch to see that as evidence he lacked sufficient nutrition. Maybe not to the point that he was constantly starving with ribs sticking out the way fanfiction often makes it seem, but definitely not enough to fuel his body's growth.

And honestly it doesn't take much food deprivation for food security issues to come up. Especially if you can visibly observe a child in the same household getting /more/ than their fair share of the food.

That's not enough in any normal circumstances, and definitely not for a child that's still actively growing and doing manual labor. Later on in the same book, he had a can of soup or two a day, and I'm fairly certain that he pushed any of the more substantial stuff - possible meat, vegetable pieces - to Hedwig so that she wouldn't starve, too.

It's not a lot of examples, certainly things could have changed overtime canonically, but it's definitely a bit of an indicator about how he ate earlier on just from that book alone.

Meaning that the Dursleys would need to give Harry on average about 16 cans of soup for the recommended 2000 kcal. He got two.

Another good indicator is that, even after having been systematically malnutritioned to the point where he was much smaller than the average 11yo in PS, he was never as hungry as during that "punishment".

So, not starvation, but like I said, not quite enough to fully thrive nutritionally. And then when Dudley had to go on that diet, everyone in the family had to do the same, and Harry got half rations - like half a grapefruit instead of the full one Dudley got, and Harry didn't have the excess fat to burn as fuel the way Dudley did.

There was also the birthday cake that Molly sent him one year, and IIRC he stretched that out for a month. Harry never struck me as particularly having a sweet tooth, so I always assumed that the cake was food-replacement.

However, if Dudley didn't like something, or didn't want it anymore, Harry got to eat it. (Because even the Dursley wouldn't waster perfectly edible food).

They also used "go to your cupboard without dinner" as a form of punishment. To be fair, while abusive, especially since it was for stupid things, this was common form of punishment for a long long time in history. So it's more a society issues than a Dursley issue.

When Dudley started his diet, Harry noticed a difference. Meaning he was fed beforehand. But now, he had half of what Dudley had, to apaise Dudley. (And so, asked his friends for food).

Basically, the Dursley was stingy with food, and they became worse, BUT they weren't starving Harry like fanfictions seems to believe.

It's also only 26 calories.

As someone pointed out elsewhere, the cans of soup he was getting as punishment rations in CoS are between 80 and 200 calories per can. Even if his normal morning meal was a slice of bread and a 1oz chunk of cheese, that's still close to 200 calories for breakfast. As someone that's been dieting on and off for the last two years, you really notice that dramatic a drop in amount of food until you get used to it, and there's no reason anyone should ever eat that few calories in a meal.

** I very much agree with your sentiment. It was really important for me to read about another kid who was in that sort of middle place: he was clearly being abused, but either nobody cared enough or nobody knew enough to help. (In hindsight the canon answer is clear, but at the time, Harry's guess was as good as mine as to why I had to stay in my home.) Anyway, seeing Harry grow up and succeed despite the odds was absolutely critical to my own resiliency, and no matter how awful JKR is, I will always credit her with giving me hope that I too could be loved and make a difference.

So yeah: I agree that stakes don't really need to be raised, because to anyone who's lived through it, you know just how high they already were. That being said, I don't mind people exaggerating it.

Canon Harry was definitely abused and neglected - the things they said to him are verbal and emotional abuse, and they neglected him by not giving him enough food (a can of cold soup is not enough food, esp when food is plentiful in the house) and keeping him in a closet.

I write abused Harry. Some of the stuff I write is stuff I took from my own childhood (some is not, and it just fit the situation I was writing). I generally don't write graphically and I don't often write the scenes of abuse taking place.

I follow about the same criteria for reading abuse. I don't like to read very graphically detailed experiences of it, and I don't like when it's just endless scenes of abuse.

and also! the people who say that harry in cannon was not abused/neglected sicken me- i hope they never have kids for the sake of everyone. the dursleys put freaking BARS on his windows AND locked him in a cupboard for 10 years of his life! he was isolated by his peers and at home! he had no one to turn to- no friends, family, parental figures....the way that in deathly hallows, the dursleys knew that the child that they had been raising for 16 years would go to fight in a war and that they would never see him again- the lack of compassion and love and farwells should be enough alone to go on.

** I think that it's because people don't realise the long term consequences of these seemingly minor things. Imagine if the cupboard was used as the naughty step, it would still be bad, but it wouldn't provoke the problems that canon Harry has.\\
In many ways, neglect is the worst sort of abuse a child can undergo, as it's a denial of love and care, and this is something that is so very damaging. Especially when there is another child that isn't neglected in the house. But it's an invisible type of abuse, because in snapshots it doesn't seem that bad.

** Let me preface by stating I am an Adult who spent the first 16 years being abused physically, mentally and emotionally. I've spent years adjusting and overcoming said experience. I can't use my own experience as a litmus test for what abuse is so, I have to rely on others. I need to rely on the courts, child psychologists, Child Protective Services and other professionals to help me understand different levels of abuse. When Harry Potter came out I avoided it because it was a kids book. Then my counselor suggested that I read it. When I read it I was overcome, it is a pretty damn good story and I loved that this poor child who was so neglected and disliked found a way to escape. I spoke with my counselor about it and they asked my opinion of what Harry went through. I could only compare it to stuff I went through, being locked in closets and denied regular meals. Having to wear crappy clothing while those around me looked neat and presentable. Being called horrid names by those that are supposed to care for you. Not being told that you are loved. My counselor informed me that these are abuse as well and not to minimize the story because it is fictional or that it doesn't really go into detail. My counselor also informed me that based on the descriptions in the book Harry would be a likely candidate for PTSD, Anxiety disorders, Agoraphobia, compulsive lying. So, do a favor to the people out there who have dealt with abuse and are recovering. Don't downplay this, don't crack on those who write the Fanfic that "Overreaches" the abuse setting because the fact is that if most people went through what Harry did during his first 10 year they would be a mess emotionally, mentally and likely physically.

That scenario makes no sense. But humans being homosexual is normal and there's nothing in cannon that makes it unlikely.

IRL, 1/20 people are gay is a reasonable estimate. It's not exactly unlikely that Dumbledore (or anyone whose dating/sexual/etc history isn't discussed) is gay.

I know we don't know what sexuality Dumbledore is, and that's why I wrote that he's sexually ambiguous in canon (meaning we don't know) despite what Rowling said in an interview or a tweet after the series ended. In canon, Hermione is white. The reason for this is that there have been multiple instances that have made it clear, the most prominent being that Harry noticed her tan at the beginning of PoA and Rowling had a habit of pointing out those that had a different skin color (Dean Thomas, Angelina Johnson, I think the Patil twins, and even Cho Cahng).

I don't think JKR gave us the best representation either, and while I don't exactly expect her to delve deep into the effects of trauma in what was essentially a children's book, the epilogue in particular sold that story of "but in the end there were no problems and everything was fine :)"

I can't say I mind fics where Harry's abuse has been made worse than canon. As long as it's not too over the top in its portrayal, I'm just happy to read a fic that acknowledges that Harry was abused... even moreso if he's forced to confront that fact, opening the door to healing from it.

I really think this is it. Those of us either with direct or educational experience in trauma and abuse have pointed things out in the fandom. This in turn informs those without the knowledge that Harry was abused - but they can't comprehend that abuse has a broad /spectrum/, so they think they have to fill in the 'missing' gaps that the books didn't make explicit and show that Harry Was Definitively Abused.

Society excuses a LOT from parents and guardians under the guise of 'different parenting styles', and so I really think a lot of people just don't see canon!Dursleys as being /truly/ abusive - unpleasant, sure, but not what they think of as 'truly' abusive - the heavy beatings, starvation etc.

This does ring a bell; I remember being a little weirded out by how casually it happened and then was never responded to or discussed again.

Which I get, since Harry is our main narrator, there's the whole 'unreliable narrator' thing, especially when children who are abused longterm normalize the abuse as something that just.../happens/. To everyone.

In retrospect, I find myself wondering about the Weasleys - Molly's temper and her badass duel with Bellatrix tell me she's not unfamiliar with hexes, especially given Ginny's ability and rapid use of the same.

Of course Harry's not going to question Molly Weasley as a parent - by being at least decent and loving when she isn't publicly humiliating the kids with Howlers she probably seems like a massive improvement over the Dursleys.

-Percy's achievement of getting head boy was barely celebrated because Bill already had done it, and same thing when he got 12 Newts (even Hermoine only managed to get 10 Newts becaused it stressed her out so much)

-She literally couldn't keep Fred and George apart and made them do everything together. That's REALLY unhealthy.

-Ron's celebrations were even less celebrated than Percy's, and he got so many hand me downs that he never got anything new.

-She literally forced her ADULT son to cut his hair.

-She was incredibly toxic to her daughter-in-law Fleur, and she didn't treat Hermoine that much better either because she believed her sons should do better.

-She literally forgot Fred and George's existence when she said "That's all my children" about getting prefects (Also, Ginny wasn't yet prefect either at that point)

** I used to read a lot of abused Harry ffs and honestly the stuff I read became to much for me. I've never purposely searched for an abused Harry ff but when I first started reading fanfiction it was hard to not read it. The abuse in those stories was basically torture and constant suffering, the Dursleys (mostly Vernon) we're way worse than Voldemort and Harry never changed. HARRY NEVER CHANGED, and I still don't understand why authors put him through very intense torture and rape and them make him seem as if those things don't matter him. I eventually had to stop reading those ffs because they were putting me in really bad moods and kind of taking my enjoyment out of reading. I've never experienced physical abused but I will say that neglect has been kinda common for me and I've been put into situations where I've been incredibly uncomfortable and scared. I think that overly abused harry is not for me but I do enjoy when Harry is abusing others which is probably hypocritical of me lol

** I think the reason why 'abused Harry' is a thing simply because JKR never really touches upon the depths of the abuse Harry went through (or more to the point, exactly how badly it affected him). What we see in canon is an overview of a decade of abuse (the films are just as bad) - but as soon as he's exposed to the Wizarding World, we see him still take crap from his relatives... but they hold back because they KNOW something might happen. During his formative years... how horrid must that have been?

(P.S. - This, right here, is why Dumbledore can effing boil in Tartarus under Kronos' left testicle, as far as I'm concerned. He knowingly allowed hateful people free access to torment and mindscrew a helpless child at the worst possible time in its life, 24/7/365 for ten years... and everything Dumbledore did was to essentially create a child soldier to detonate against an enemy he and the Ministry didn't have the balls to bum-rush and bury the bastard up to his neck in death years earlier.)

I agree that some people take it WAAAY too far, and there could be fewer such stories (for me, I just don't read them, like I don't read Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape and Romione fics) - but if we'd gotten a bit more on just how deeply horrible the Dursleys were earlier (but to be fair, there is that more-than-slightly-hypocritical scene in HBP where Dumbledore scolds them and rightly points out that the only thing they DID do right was not damage Harry as much as they did Dudley)... perhaps there would be fewer of these stories out there.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

** I don't mind different interpretations of what's seen in canon in most stories. If it's changed a lot in either direction though, I want this to have an effect, too. If someone wants to change Harry's home life, but not Harry's character, imo they'd be better off writing two separate stories.

What I do mind are fic in which Harry gets tortured by the Dursleys only for some other character to find and help him and never mention the situation again. I'm a sucker for stories including working through all kinds of trauma, but those usually don't start out with Harry being almost murdered by his family.

From what I've seen, the more extreme the abuse is, the more likely it's there purely to be edgy.

** I like when the abuse are justified by the story.

I have read Harry with badly healed broken bones from the abuse (this never happened in canon), but it was for Mrs Pomfrey to notice it the first time Harry ended in her care, and thus can signal it, and they can do something about it.

I have read Harry badly beaten with a whip, to the point of missing school often, which raise suspisions at the muggle school, and the child protection services get involved.

The thing is, that Harry abuses in canon is too subtle, at least for the 80s, to raise an eyebrow in the community. They don't know that he lives in a cupboard. They likely don't know about the chores, aside from gardening. But Dursleys had been good at making the neighbor believed that Harry was a bad kid, so it could have been seen as a good form of punishment/keeping the kid out of trouble.

The clothes who doesn't fit could have been a sign, but then again I'm not sure that in the late 80s it would be enough to ring the bell of abuse. It also can be explained away easily by the Dursley with a "the kid is so careless, and destroy new clothes out of anger/bad temperament that we decided to not get him new things as long as he doesn't show we can trust him with them".

Abusers are easily very good at explaining away the sign of abuse, and lie throught their teeth. Especially when the abuse aren't as obvious than beating, rape, and being humiliated in public.

** As regards Harry's living situation, I think the correct analysis is to compare his circumstances to the financial means of his guardians.

We should not be defining child abuse in a way that results in all poor families abusing their children by definition, just because they cannot afford a better living situation. Poverty is not abuse.

If the Dursleys had been dirt poor, then the same circumstances - having a small, cramped room with no natural light, eating enough food to meet your nutritional needs but not so much that you ever feel properly full, only having ill-fitting hand-me-down clothes, having to do lots of chores - would not be considered abuse. It would just be being poor. What makes it abuse is the fact that the Dursleys have a ton of money and nonetheless choose to subject Harry to living circumstances which replicate living in poverty, while Dudley lives in luxury.

The result of this analysis is that when a fanfic wants to focus on Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys, instead of engaging in trauma porn where everyone gasps and cries over the concept of having your bedroom in a cupboard, the true focus should be the emotional impact of continually being told that you're a second class citizen within your own family, and that message being reinforced by your material circumstances.

I think that's a wrong way to go about it. While being poor is an idea to bring about, being poor does not excuse anyone from being terrible parents.

Cupboard under the stairs is not a true bedroom, its in the name, it's simply a cupboard.

Hand me downs themselves are not bad (I even stated in my original statement how I enjoy the feeling of them), but even poor families can buy hand me downs that will fit said child, while the Dursley's gave Harry, Dudley's overweight ones.

**** Here's the key question, though:

Let's say the Dursleys were dirt poor. Let's say they could only afford a tiny house. Let's say in that tiny house, the cupboard was literally the only place where Harry could sleep - there was nowhere else they could fit a bed.

In those circumstances, is sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs abuse?

I would say no - as above, being poor is not itself abuse.

If you're with me on that point, then it follows that sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs is not objectively, innately, abusive. Rather, whether it counts as abuse is relative to the context.

In the canon context, it is abusive because it is entirely optional - the Dursleys choose to put Harry there when there's an empty spare bedroom upstairs.

But this means that the true nature of their abuse is not "They made Harry sleep in a cupboard" but rather "They deliberately chose to subject Harry to living standards below the level they could afford to give him".

In modern day we consider forcing children to work abuse.

but several hundreds years ago, most families could not afford to not have the kid working in someway to provide

****** Well, call it boxroom then. We're back with what I said about labels, not issues. Harry is not literally stuck in a wardrobe. It's the room/space/area/however-you-call-it that is below a flight of stairs, if you put a wall around it. People put all sorts of rooms there, I know one where it's a perfectly useful bathroom. In theory, it can be arbitrarily large, it obviously depends on the kind of staircase. Random impression: [[http://hupehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Glass-walls-turn-the-space-under-the-stairs-into-a-lovely-wine-storage-area.jpg][Click.]]

So the problem is not that he is in something called a "cupboard", it's that this space is small and un-comfortable (in the sense of, lacking comforts other rooms have) compared to the rest of the house. If they put Harry in the attic, and it was as large as the entire house floor, but cold and draughty, how would that improve his situation? It wouldn't improve it at all, even though he wasn't in a 'cupboard'. In fact, I'd argue it'd be worse, because at least that room is heated/insulated.

I think, in the end, very few people are downplaying what Harry went through. He had a shitty childhood, but was one of those plucky kids that came out alright. Conversely, I think a lot of people are overstating what he went through, to say nothing of the absurd Dursley renditions that plague FF. YMMV.

******* That version you showed me probably isn't from an older house or if it is it's clearly updated to be a proper bedroom. The one that Harry was put in was from an older outdated cupboard.

I don't know, if cupboards in Britain are bigger then cupboards in America. But in America, cupboards are tiny places, you place shelves (or take them out) and put cleaning supplies or shoes or towels or hang up coats, or other type of things like that.

And, the Dursley's weren't even poor. The Dursley's, had two extra bedrooms! The room that was used for Dudley's broken things, and the room that they used for a guest room whenever Marge stopped by.

Vernon had a good paying job, he had a two story house, which are rather expensive. They gave Dudley everything, and rarely if ever gave Harry anything at all.

They let Dudley get away with bullying kids on the street, as well as bullying Harry himself.

Even the way that they raised Dudley, is a form of abuse. Dudley was overweight (not good, can cause numerous health issues in the future) he was spoiled (not good, emotionally stunted, not used to being told no, prone to tantrums to get his way). Which isn't a way to handle things maturely.

And, when Dudley went on a diet, they all did. And if it was one thing Harry did NOT need it was a diet, if anything Harry needed more food.

Quick edit.

********* ^ This, tbh.

I never realised that all these absurd ideas about Harry-abuse in FF ultimately might result from the simple fact that people might not know /what a cupboard under the stairs is/. But if those just aren't a thing (in America?), it makes sense.

And now I imagine all those people imagining Harry cramped into a piece of furniture somewhere between cups and plates XD

.

So nah, not that. @OP: Imagine your average flight of stairs, straight -- that gives you a space below of, what, 40 sqft? Less if the staircase is steeper and more narrow, more if the ceiling is higher etc.

Ultimately, large enough so that a bed fits inside, because Harry has one (not a mattress, that is the movies).

.

All this detracts from the original point though. It's a relatively small, windowless room, when there is a perfectly reasonable room available Harry is not getting out of spite. That's a shitty attitude towards any child.

***** I like how this thread became a reverse trainwreck and got better the longer it went on.

You know, of course, that I have my doubts about looking at things like abuse on a relative scale -- I feel it introduces more uncertainty than necessary. Or, conversely, we need to qualify the effects and our reaction, too, to say that there is one set of abuse that warrants a clear response, and another one that is not as bad, and warrants less response, or maybe does depending on where it happens, which seems like an unnecessary complication.

Giving Harry the boxroom under the stairs, or giving him second-hand clothes or never giving him sweets does combine to treating him like shit, given the circumstances, but what is the factual result of calling it abuse? Would any sort of law prevent being treated worse relative to the baseline of how you /could/ treat a child?

The whole debate (not necessarily your entry only) kinda feels like it's about labels, not issues, and we're having this post-truth framing-argument where what matters is who manages to add their context first.

Ultimately, that is why I retreat to absolute lines; they aren't as susceptible to framing -- a beating is a beating, regardless of where you live and what kind of means you have.

I'm not disagreeing with you on the face of it. But can you not argue that having children while not being able to provide for them is not abuse in and of itself? Yes, a lot of the blame for that rests on the poor sexual education that many people receive.

But having children you can't afford should be abuse. And it's a shame that the child suffers.

There's certainly a moral argument that bringing a child into the world to face a miserable experience is immoral. This would extend not just to poverty but to various circumstances. I'm not sure that I agree with that argument - it seems to be somewhat paternalistic, deciding on someone's behalf what should bring them happiness - but it's certainly an argument which can be made.

However, I think you're on much shakier ground if you take the additional step of saying that this is not only immoral, but also abuse - in the sense that it is something that should be prohibited by society and transgressors should be punished. I think essentially making poverty illegal is a very dangerous route for a society to go down.

** Agree with you. However we need to keep in mind that lot of fanfiction is written by teenagers, who usually (thankfully!) have no experience with abuse nor do they consider the consequences/implications of situations they describe.

Lot of it is /lets make it sound really horrible, so Dursleys will look really bad, and Harry will be super cool edge lord because suffering a lot is cool, and I am very angry cause my Mum told be to go clean up my room and now I am super rebellious because the whole world hates me!/

** Yeah, I agree totally. It just seems to me that fanfic writers try to one-up each other in some sort of a morbid contest. So the abuse gets worse and worse until it comes full circle and right into parody territory.

The two best/ worst examples I remember were a drunk Vernon using scissors to cut Harry's voice box. Without Harry bleeding out or getting an infected wound. I don't think I made it further than chapter two of this particular fic. The other one I remember had the Dursleys outright torture Harry with chains, barbed wire, acid, etc. This stuff would have killed a grown man. It was so bad it just turned into a parody of itself. Thankfully, I don't remember the names of fics I didn't like.

Neville got dropped out a window as a toddler, for God's sake. Quidditch is played over a field that doesn't have any cushioning charms, and nobody wears a fucking /helmet/. No one got in real trouble for casting a hex that could've made you choke to death on slugs.

Safety is a distant, distant concern, it seems, when you have magic, and as readers/writers we don't necessarily have a good sense of what is the equivalent of a skinned knee or what is actually dangerous.

***** Like, in my head I compare Quidditch to American football. There's all that violence in both sports, but at the youth levels there's more emphasis on safety rather than raw, /vicious/ brutality at the pro level. So I would imagine, in a /sane/ world, that a high school Quidditch pitch would have far more security measures, maybe a built in cushion to the field so they don't DIE if they get knocked off a broom. Pro Quidditch, I can imagine, would remove most safety measures since they're adults and can sign safety waivers.

Maybe Hogwarts does things differently and is the black sheep with regards to student safety in the Wizarding World.

Even as a teen, though, when Lockhart vanished Harry's bones I was appalled that he didn't get sued, didn't get fired, didn't have any legal consequences for /unlicensed/ /medical/ /malpractice/. Sure, Pomfrey was pissed off, and fixed it - but that goes back to my earlier point of us as readers never knowing how serious an injury /really/ is unless it's a Dark Curse.
