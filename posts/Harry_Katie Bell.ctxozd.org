Is there any good Harry and Katie bell fanfic??


** This seems to be there most popular nonexistent pairing. It's kinda weird, you'd think the two of them would be more relatable than say, Harry and Susan Bones, or Harry and Daphne Greengrass, and yet...

*** Eh, not really, especially with Susan. All three are blank slates, but Katie is a little more defined and others can play the role she can. Hot, older Quidditch girl? Cho. Hot, Gryffindor chaser? Ginny.

Daphne has a really great name, is a Slytherin (which is built-in conflict), potentially rich, and Greengrass is a 28. Susan has a canon, high-ranking Ministry connection, who put up a good fight against Voldemort. She also has a few dead family members from the war.

Factor in the type of stories this fandom enjoys and I can see why we don't get too many Katie, Alicia, or Angelina parings.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

** Fuck, I saw "recommendation" and got excited thinking you were going to recommend us a nice new H/K fic. Shame on you for disappointing me like that, man. Use the "request" tag next time.

That said, there are a few where H/K is the early relationship like linkffn(a cadmean victory), but there are very few fics where H/K is the endgame pairing. Off the top of my head, linkffn(harry potter and the muggleborn chaser) is the only one that comes to mind.

Oh, there are also lots of harem/multi fics featuring Katie, but you asked for "good" so I guess they're all excluded.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.
