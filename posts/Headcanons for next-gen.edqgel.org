I noticed in my post regarding fanon that people have come to believe is canon that several people mentioned the next-gen kids. What are your headcanons/fanons about James, Albus, Lily, Rose, and Hugo?

In my own headcanon, I see James as being obsessed with living up to his father. He's grown up in a world that likely worships Harry for having killed Voldemort, so he always feels like he has a really high bar to reach. So I see James as not really following his own interests and hobbies, but instead trying to be like his father. He makes the hat put him in Gryffindor, forces himself to play quidditch (despite not particularly caring for it) simply because his father was on the Gryffindor team, etc. In a way, he's exactly like Harry, since Harry had always wanted to live up to his own parents' example.

Albus on the other hand, I see as incredibly meticulous and nearly ocd with his schoolwork, but not particularly bookish. He's less social than his brother, but actually loves quidditch for the sport. He's also absolutely terrible at it. Unlike James, he isn't obsessed with being like their father, but rather wants to make a name for himself. As a result, he ends up in Slytherin and befriends Scorpius Malfoy, who is essentially the magical equivalent of a stoner (much to Draco's dismay and Astoria's delight. Headcanon Greengrass family grows magic pot).

I see Lily as being more like "Auntie Luna" with a love for magical creatures and plants. At Hogwarts she spends her free time helping Neville in the greenhouses or visiting Hagrid to discuss animals. She's not very interested in schoolwork despite being in Ravenclaw, and usually only gets passing marks in any subjects but Herbology and later Care of Magical Creatures. She also occasionally hangs out with Scorpius when he's too high for Albus to deal with.

Rose I see being as different from her parents as possible. She grew up between two extreme personalities on the opposite sides of the spectrum. Hermione is obsessed with books and is an aggressive activist for any cause she cares to adopt, and Ron is a rabid sports fan who is otherwise laid back and content to let the world be. Rose, as a result, despises reading *and* sports, having been tugged towards both at different points. She prefers to sit out in the garden drawing flowers, or walking in the woods and listening to the birds sing. A Hufflepuff in Hogwarts, she's particularly gifted in potions, but like her cousin Lily, only gets passing marks in most other subjects. She ends up dating Scorpius and joining him in being a magical stoner.

Hugo is the exact opposite of Rose. He's not a particularly strong willed person, so he allowed himself to be pulled along by his parents in everything. He is constantly stressed out between books and brooms, and he rarely has time for anything else. He reads everything and anything he can, and is obsessed with quidditch beyond even Ron. As a result, he is prone to chronic depression, poor sleep, and other mental health issues. He gets excellent marks at Hogwarts, plays on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and hates himself and everyone else with a burning passion, unbeknownst to his parents.

I could get into my headcanons about Ron and Hermione's marriage as well, but then this might be longer than some fics.

tldr; James wants to be Harry's clone, Albus wants to be known for himself, Lily is a nature girl, Scorpius and Rose are stoners, and Hugo is the worst aspect of his parents rolled up into one stressball of depression.


** I'm also going to delve into what they look like.

James looks similar to Harry (but has auburn hair), and has Ginny's brown eyes and has freckles - he is not a carbon copy of either of them. James emulates Harry and the stories of the Marauders, combine that with all his Uncles and James is a handful. He goes into Gryffindor naturally, but he is more like Ginny in school. He is intelligent, but not near perfect, and he likes DADA, Transfiguration, and Charms (all of which are very physical classes). He plays Quidditch as a Chaser or Beater starting in 3rd year.

Albus looks identical to Harry expect his hair which is not as wild, it's more Ginny's texture, and he likes to keep it long. Albus goes to Slytherin partially because he grew up under his parents limelight and wants to be independent of them. He likes Quidditch and plays as Seeker from 4th to 7th year, but he isn't captain --- his best friend Scorpius is and there is a huge but friendly rivalry between Scorpius and James. He is more studious than James and makes near perfect grades, but that is not his sole defining quality (he is up to mischief if the need arises).

Lily has Ginny's hair (but it is slightly Auburn like James') with Harry's wild texture and an inability to tame it, but has hazel eyes. She hates that she has hazel eyes and not completely “Weasley-red” hair because she feels left out from her cousins. As she grows up she learns to love herself. She is sorted into Gryffindor, but just barely avoids Slytherin. Lily is like her mother and loves Quidditch, she makes it on the team in second year (before both her brothers) and becomes Captain in 5th year. She loves the physical subject like James but also greatly enjoys astronomy and potions like Albus. Her quidditch and grades struggle to take priority so she makes mostly O's but some E's.

Rose is very similar to Hermione in her need for perfection, but she struggles because she also had Ron's laid back nature. She has Hermione's wild mane, but has freckles, blue eyes, and Weasley hair. She is sorted into Ravenclaw because she asks for it and values being like her mom even if she feels inferior. She later regrets making the hat put her there and ends up spending most of her time with her cousins. She still maintains her loves and pride for Ravenclaw, though, and she is a Keeper during 5th year and up when she finally admits to herself that it's okay to be like her dad. She aces all her subject expect potions and care of magical creatures and she even takes divination, she thinks her dad may have had some diviner skills and wants to see if she does as well.

Hugo looks very similar to Rose. He has wild red hair and freckles, but one of his eyes is blue and the other is brown. He is smart like Hermione as well, but did the opposite of Rose. He avoided is for years in an attempt to be like Ron and it was only though talking to Uncle Percy that he realized it is okay to be different. He was sorted into Gryffindor, but he finds it really loud. A lot of people think him and Rose should be in each other's house. He hates Quidditch, but loves to fly around on a broomstick, go super high up, and watch the world from above. He favors potions and arithmacy, likes DADA for the theory, but doesn't like Transfiguration very much.

All in all, they are good kids who were raised in a better world than their parents. They have some of their best qualities because their parents were so terrified of fucking them up and they wanted them to have amazing childhoods. But, even though they are protected from the spotlight, they all feel like they are hidden in their parents shadow. This causes big issues for James, Rose, and Hugo until they can grow up and learn to talk through these problems and worries.

** It was Ginny's decision to name a child after Snape. We know from the books how bad she is at naming(see Pigwidgeon) and she had much less reason to hate Snape. Harry agreed because he got to name their first child, and it was better than her other horrible suggestions, though Harry managed to convince her to make the first name Albus.

** The Cursed Child does *not* exist.

- Teddy Lupin: Hufflepuff, Prefect.

Teddy Lupin, son of Remus and Nymphadora, was raised by his grandmother Andromeda. He has a close connection with his godfather Harry. He is very cordial, especially with students who lost family members to the War. Has an /extremely/ strong sense of justice that drove him to be an iron fist of defense against bullies. He joins the Aurors, but this is due to a desire to be a part of the /cause,/ rather than actively seeking battle.

- James Sirius Potter, Gryffindor

Delighted to be the son of heroes, James Potter is more than a little obsessed with glory. He is talented, but also lazy, riding in part of his family name to get ahead. Popular with classmates, but distant from many of his cousins. While never straying anywhere near blood purism, James fancies himself better than others--but this comes to a head when Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. This becomes transformative when he watches Dudley's eldest son break up a fight despite being out-numbered four-to-one.

- Albus Severus Potter. Hufflepuff

Unlike his brother who delights in their family name, Albus is terrified of not measuring up to the past. Not just the name "Potter," but also the names "Albus" and "Severus." It takes him a long time to find his niche. Amusingly, he is dreadful at Potions, but he becomes very skilled at Ancient Runes.

- Rose Weasley, Hufflepuff.

Joined Huffepuff /by choice,/ out of fidelity to her favorite cousin. Rose is markedly different from her parents. She's distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry. Rose, by contrast, despises government and bureaucracy in general. Her very favorite subject is Herbolgoy and she has a special bond with Neville because of it. She loves reading for its own sake--often falling asleep in the library, though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. Rose goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries at least one textbook and one storybook constantly.

- Hugo Weasley, Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He has a passion for revolutionaries and carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized, though rather than direct this to schoolwork, his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six, and he never misses a chance to tease her. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose squeal and scream, Hugo and Rose are frequently seen in each other's company, reading books.

- Fred Weasley II, Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think Fred's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot. He finally manages to pull the absolute perfect prank--jinxing every single student and staff member at Hogwarts simultaneously the day he graduates from Hogwarts and thus immune from detention.

** Teddy Remus Lupin Hufflepuff Head Boy Chaser Loves his Metamorphis' ability, and enjoys turning into people like Harry or Ron to scare the living daylights out of his cousins, into making them think that they're in trouble. Is raised by his grandmother Andromeda, but Harry and the Weasley's have a large part in his life. Eventually Marries Victoire and becomes an Auror

Victoire Gabrielle Weasley Gryffindor Head Girl Prefect Fiery attitude, best to stay away when she's pissed! Her aunt Ginny tought her the Bat Boogey Hex, and she's not afraid to use it! While she may be Head Girl and eventually Prefect, isn't afraid to get back anyone who bullies her or her family. She is often getting into disagreements with her mother, and is a total daddy's girl (Though she would deny it!). And the only people who are allowed to call her Vicky, are her father and Teddy; thank you very much! She once even cuts her hair, in defiance to her mother's ideals. Gets many different jobs, before eventually deciding to go and join her uncle Charlie into training dragons.

Dominique Brielle Weasley Gryffindor Beater Is a Tomboy, loves to play Quidditch because it makes her feel free. Eventually becomes a Beater for the HolyHead Harpies. Secretly likes romance novels, (though she'll deny it if anyone asks). Is always willing to try a new dare or be a test subject to her uncle George's Joke Shop.

Louis William Weasley Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect Gets very annoyed at all of the loud noises that come from his sister Victoire, and his mother. Is often seen locked up in his room or underneath a tree, reading or painting. He loves to paint; it's a past time that eventually turns into a job for him, later in life. But he knows that for most artist you don't get rich or famous until after you're dead, so he ends up working as a Curse Breaker like his father.

Rose Katherine Weasley Ravenclaw Head Girl Prefect: Is very competitive, hardly backs down, can sometimes be insensitive but doesn't mean it. Loves Chess and reading, but often rolls her eyes at Quidditch. (Though she will play occasionally). Often gets into fights and dares/competitions with James and Fred (Much to the annoyance of Hermione, Albus and Scorpius (And much to the amusement of Ron, Harry, and Hugo).

Hugo Xander Weasley Hufflepuff: A quiet and softly spoken boy. He's probably the most "well behaved" Weasley in the family. But is often dragged into whatever his much bolder cousin and friend; Lily Luna has on her mind. Without Lily by his side, he'd likely be a loner, often by himself, holed up in his bedroom or a library. But because of Lily, (as well as several other annoying cousins); he's often out causing mischief; even when he doesn't want too. Is most fond of Herbology, Potions and History, and is seen with Professor Longbottom in the Greenhouses, more often than not.

Frederick Robert Weasley II Gryffindor Social butterfly; loves to be the center of attention, and is always showing off. Can come off as arrogant or even rude; but is pretty caring and considerate deep down. Found a fondness for building things, and likes to build things in his spare time, even eventually going into the construction business in the Muggle world; and builds houses there.

Roxanne Olivia Weasley Slytherin: Was a surprise for everyone when she was sorted into Slytherin, Is more of a quiet sort, but has a thirst to prove herself and plenty of ambition. Will do what she can to go far in life. Is a quick thinker, thanks to being around her dad and her uncle Ron's joke shop, and often thinks outside of the box to get things done. Ends up becoming a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.

Molly Christine Weasley II Weasley Ravenclaw: She loves her family and would do anything for them; so when she found out that her father had left the family, because of his disagreement with him, she had been furious with him! She holds grudges easily, and is difficult to get to forgive you. Ends up being fascinated by Runes Magic

Lucy Ginevra Weasley Hufflepuff A shy and quiet girl, she's a great listener more than she is a talker; often getting tongue-tied and blushes easily. She also gives out great advice to people and is very empathetic towards people in general. She ends up being interested in magical and non magical creatures, and decides to go around the world looking for them.

James Sirius Potter Gryffindor Seeker, Smart, Charming, Competitive, is often seen making bets or dares with everyone and anyone. Isn't afraid to say no (Though that has cost him more than once). Is very loud and adventurous; everyone thought he'd join Harry and Teddy and become an Auror, but were rather surprised when he decided to become a Professional Quidditch Player.

Albus Severus Potter Gryffindor Head Boy Prefect Is often annoyed by James (and to be quite frank; many of his other crazy family as well). Gets along quite well with Louis (despite the age difference), Teddy is his favorite family member (not that he'd admit that aloud!). Is often the voice of reason between his cousin Rose and best friend Scorpius (though they often don't listen to him, anyway). Becomes a Charms Master

Lily Luna Potter Slytherin Seeker Everyone was the most surprise (Except for Ginny perhaps) when Lily Luna was sorted into Slytherin. James wouldn't talk to her for weeks, Albus would look over at the Slytherin table worriedly, as though she were some sort of next Dark lord? Or she supposed it'd be Dark Lady? But honestly with so many family members, and with her and Hugo being the youngest in the bunch; she had a thirst to prove herself, as well as the ambition. She's very bold and daring, isn't afraid of breaking the rules, but figures out when a "right" time for rule breaking is. Often gets Hugo, and Roxanne in plenty of trouble along with her. (Despite Roxanne being a year older than them). She surprises everyone even more later on, by becoming a Healer. (Always do the unexpected) is her moto.

Lorcan Harold Scamander Gryffindor Chaser Is very Adventurous and loves when his parents take him to a bunch of places. Would love to travel around the world forever, if he could. But his parents eventually settle down in Britain, right before he and Lysander are to go to Hogwarts. Ends up becoming a explorer.

Lysander Neville Scamander Ravenclaw Prefect He loves seeing new places and learning new things, he would much rather stay in one place. He is often seen trying to combine Muggle objects with magical, to see how they'd work. Ends up being an Unspeakable.

Scorpius Abraxias Malfoy Ravenclaw Head Boy Prefect He's sarcastic he ends up developing a love for pranking people, thanks to Albus' relatives. (Much to Draco, and Albus' horror). He's one of the smartest boys in his year, and is often very competitive against Rose and Albus when it comes to grades. He doesn't agree with how his family acted during the war, and later on in life he donates money to St. Mungo's regularly. Ends up becoming a Healer.

** I write them mainly in young adulthood, so my headcanons about them are mainly focused on their personalities as developed by their 20's (except Molly and Lucy, whom I have also written in their teens):

*James Potter II* affects kind of a bro demeanor but can be really introspective and sensitive. He became a professional Quidditch player but suffered a career-ending injury. He's best pals with his cousin Fred, who is a few years older than him and whom he looked up to like a big brother. James is also a huge football fan.

*Albus Potter* is an old soul, studious, introverted, and can be pretty tightly wound. Becomes a Healer.

*Lily Potter II* is a bit mischievous and as the baby of the family definitely has a manipulative streak. Becomes a journalist and will rabidly pursue leads.

*Fred Weasley II* is quite studious and type-A, but also gregarious, witty, and a goofball at times. He's a great chess player and sucks at Quidditch and flying in general. When Hermione published a revised version of /Hogwarts: A History/, Fred couldn't stop raving about it. Fred was the announcer for Quidditch matches at Hogwarts. Becomes a radio host on the wizarding wireless network. Under no circumstances does he want to go into the family business, much to his dad's chagrin.

*Roxanne Weasley* works in an apothecary. Has a sibling rivalry with Fred that has lasted into their 20's and is generally sick and tired of his shit. Great Quidditch player (Chaser).

*Rose Weasley* is smart and studious, social justice- minded; also has wanderlust and is a bit of a free spirit. Spends a good portion of her 20's traveling the world, working different odd jobs and for various causes.

*Hugo Weasley* much to everyone's utter confusion, is something of a lady's man. His cousins can't get over this. Has a beautiful singing voice. Becomes an Obliviator.

*Molly Weasley* seems a perfect child at first but in her teens develops a stubbornness and a willingness to go toe-to-toe with her dad. Rebels a bit in her teens but really does care about her achievements. Ravenclaw. Great Quidditch player. Thick as thieves with her cousin Rose.

*Lucy Weasley* is quiet, gentle, compliant, and conflict-averse. Hufflepuff.

*Dominique Weasley* is a dude who is really annoyed that people always assume he's a girl due to his gender neutral French name. Becomes a journalist and works for /Witch Weekly/ and will thank you not to make smart comments about it.

I haven't actually developed significant headcanons about Victoire and Louis.

Also I headcanon that Teddy Lupin loves video games and is a really skilled gamer.

** i used to write a lot of next gen fics. the details varied but some of my constants were:

- neither albus or rose were sorted into gryfffindor. i'd switch between hufflepuff and ravenclaw for rose, but albus was always a slytherin

- this is hugely rooted in the fact that albus does want to carve out an identity for himself that's separated from being a potter. i headcanon that since he's harry's spitting image, he feels the burden of being a potter a lot more than the others which both leads him to being pretty reserved about who he hangs out with as well as encourages him to make a name for himself. despite this, he is still really close to his dad and loves him a lot

- aaaand this leads to his passion for quidditch. he loves it and works really hard at it because he genuinely wants to go pro. i imagine him aiming for the montrose magpies since they're the most prolific team in the british & irish quidditch league

- james is always a charmer for me. i imagine that he's a bit cheeky, the sort that endears him to teachers despite the fact that he pushes the rules. he's also much more social than most of his cousins. i remember a lot of next gen fics would paint him as someone who gets around, but i never felt strongly for that

- i also really like the thought of him being best friends with freddie weasley. meanwhile, albus is closest to rose in the family, though his best friend is fellow slytherin scorpius malfoy

- scorpius is pretty well put-together and i imagine he's very conscious of how he comes across due to his family's reputation. he tries to juggle the ill name with his family's innate stiff upper lip so can come across as reserved but is a genuine friend

- teddy lupin was 100% a hufflepuff and head boy. everyone loved him

- i don't include CC as canon whatsoever and i know that jkr really queerbaited with that one, but i have firmly shipped scorose since 2012 so that's another one of my headcanons

- dominique looks completely like a delacour while louis follows his father and victoire is a happy middle

** Hmm. Lemme see:

James Sirius Potter: Oldest son of Harry Potter, grew up loving the attention. Very, very extroverted, somewhat boorish at times. Quidditch player, of course. Red hair like Ginny, brown eyes. He can be domineering but he goes out of his way to stand up for his buddies and tries to keep a straight moral compass, although strong emotions can lead him to behave irrationally. Skilled in DADA and is (weirdly) into divination as well. More passionate than skeptical. Gryffindor, of course.

Albuz Severus Potter: Looks just like Harry and James always slightly resented the attention that Al got, and picks on him a lot. Al resents it, too. He's very insecure about his place in the world. He makes friends with some Hufflepuff kids on the train and ends up getting sorted into Hufflepuff with them. The tabloids were completely abuzz, but Al just tries to lay low and focus on his studies. His grades are alright, he ultimately likes potions the best. He ultimately turns out to have inherited his parents' skills in Quidditch, though, and goes on to go head-to-head with James during the matches. He ultimately enjoys the loyalty and patience of Hufflepuff and being with his more humble and friendly classmates.

Lily Luna Potter: Tenacious to the point of petulance, the most academically gifted of her siblings (and she knows it) Lily feels the burden of being her father's only daughter and youngest child. She wants to prove that she's just as capable as her dad and brothers, but she's also more proactive about her desire for independence from her dad's shadow than Al. Al just wants to live a good life. Lily's determined to be someone in her own right. She's perceived as annoying by her siblings and cousins, who mock her that she's going to be the first Slytherin in their family. Harry encourages her to go to whatever house suits her, even Slytherin, and that's just where she ends up. She's especially skilled in potions and arithmancy, although she earns high marks in all her subjects. She also inherited myopia on her dad's side, which led to her needing glasses. She's not thrilled with the idea at first, but eventually takes to them if they make her look smarter. She struggles socially due to many finding her rather insufferable, although meeting a few other students who are just as talented as she is knocks her down a peg and she falls in with their group. Unfortunately, she is not skilled in Quidditch but is supportive of her jock brothers.

** So I'm sorry to do this, actually you know what? I'm not sorry at all. It is my firm opinion that no epilogue should have been written. It tied down the characters too hard. It made for a worse.... I don't know the word. It just made it bad.

In my headcanon, Harry never married Ginny, or maybe he did? I don't know. I prefer it to be a mystery.
