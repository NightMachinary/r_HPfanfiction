** linkao3(Charred Paws and Heavy Coils)

I'm not a fan of Voldemort - and even to some extent /Tom/ from the diary, even if there's an argument to be made that he's a large portion of Voldemort's soul and is years younger without having fully (though not entirely) acted on his genocidal tendencies - being redeemed or seen as anything but what he really, in the blunt truth, is: a nazi snake wizard. Like his characterization tends to be pretty cut and dry when it comes down to "is this character doing things that are or aren't okay, and what grey area might exist" because he's literally a nazi snake wizard, full stop.

Yet I still tried it out and enjoyed the story - and got sad when I saw the date it was last updated - a lot. It worked for me, but then again I have a habit of leaning towards stories about angst and past abuse - easier to relate to? I guess - though nevertheless I still /really/ didn't expect to enjoy it because, well, nazi snake wizard.

My shock is also probably in part due to the fact that my other exposure to similar themes and topics and handwaving of the whole being a nazi snake wizard thing haven't been dealt with well. There's some which made decent-/ish/ attempts, including the particularly common excuse of justifying pureblood bigotry with "they don't participate in ancient religious rites and are ill-suited to respond and react in the way that wizarding society demands those born into it do" which doesn't really work when you consider that while muggles may be more common than wizards, /muggleborns/ are a distinct minority in wizarding society and they have no actual foothold to exert power over purebloods and as a consequence it's /kiiiinda/ out of their control that they may not understand the society around them, considering it makes literally no attempt to help integrate them to begin with and either expects they get rid of their own habits and culture (which isn't something someone should have to do to begin with, honestly) to fully integrate or be regarded as inferior and somehow of lesser importance.

But that's kinda off-topic.

Either way, really enjoyed the above.

Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

It's honestly up there for the best among them with (in my /extremely/ unwanted opinion): linkao3(woes of a dying girl by nightravensmagic) - a short one shot that made me cry, and linkao3(the fire that swallowed the world by RowlettLesbian) - a not-one shot about a fem!harry with what I can only describe as a somewhat unhealthy connection with fire.

Both are great, but Paws /absolutely/ trumps the both of them if only because it gets emotional reactions into word so goddamn /well/.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

***** The first chapter, and then the beginning of the first back-in-time arc always catch me. The second and third chapters are actually pretty good.

It should be noted that Ebenbild's writing is kind of like reading old English plays and whatnot. At first you're like 'Why am I reading this?' but as you get farther in you figure out what is intended by the (admittedly strange) language structure.

Despite the odd way the sentences are constructed they do make sense, and most importantly they're consistent. You can get used to reading it without too much trouble.

The actual narrative laid out makes up for the grammar and structure problems. I think Ebenbild does some of his writing using speech-to-text software, as many similar words end up confused. As English is not his native language, an accent would explain many of the swapped words present.

The world building in the story is also frankly absurd in scale. That alone is almost worth it.

I will admit that Ebenbild needs an actual /English/ beta desperately though.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I was skeptical about Harry/Bellatrix, but Delenda Est did a decent job of it by going back in time to before she was crazy. First half was great, second half was meh (which was a disappointment).

** I'm mentioning this fic a LOT lately, but... Hogwarts Houses Divided. I don''t like next gen fics, they're usually horribly dull. Lots of bland kid OCs with canon names going to Hogwarts and having less interesting adventures and dull romances.

Hogwarts Houses Divided isn't like that at all. I don't even remember why I decided to give it a chance, but I'm glad I did... because it's probably the best HP fic I've read!

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
