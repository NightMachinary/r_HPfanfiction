I'd kill for this. The only halfway good one i've ever read is the Firebird Trilogy and it's not worth the fics that randomly turn into harem fics halfway through.

**** It's a pain in the ass to search for fics by any female character too. You search for, say, Luna and you end up with like 75% harem fics.

Rating: All

Sort by: Follows

That usually gives me a broad spectrum of what's being worked on, reasonably long, and reasonably popular. I can quickly scroll through the first few pages, which are usually ones I'm already familiar with, and then pick out a handful to try.

Sorting by follows isn't ideal, but you need some kind of populist filter because otherwise the volume and dross/gems ratio will kill you.

I really, really wish there was a way to sort by rate - either follows, faves, reviews, or pageviews per day/week/whatever.

** I almost never do filters. It's all about what authors I love have as their favourites or if they recommend anything in their author's notes. I think its been almost a year before I actually searched for something. Life's too short to read any book or work outside of recommendations.

** I don't much use filters, preferring instead to sift through favorites lists and C2s of authors whose work I enjoy.

I suspect this would change, however, if ff.net were to ever introduce a het/slash/gen field.

**** True, but adding additional characters (e.g., Daphne) late in the game seemed to work fine. I think that most authors would be inclined to go back and re-tag stories, if only to take advantage of the additional search features.

** Mostly I find stories from this sub, or from the favorites of stories I just finished reading. I did use the Communities (C2s) on fanfiction.net for a while. When I did, usually set the rating to all, language English, words > 10,000 and status completed.
