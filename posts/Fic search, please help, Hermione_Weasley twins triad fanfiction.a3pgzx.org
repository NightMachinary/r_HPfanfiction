Is it that? I know it has the three Bonding, but I don't think it involves Fred and George getting involved THAT way with each other.

#+begin_quote
  After the Unbreakable Vow incident which forever altered the state of Fred's left buttock George decides that maybe a slightly less dangerous vow might be just as much fun. Things don't quite turn out exactly as planned. FredxHermionexGeorge, but not twincest. Please remember, YKINMK. Ratings for language, mature content, some violence, and Umbridge.
