I love audiobooks and I know there was a trend to make some great fanfics into audiobooks but I haven't been able to find much of HP. Mainly bc of the sheer vastness of the HP fanfiction world.

So I'm looking for any fic you guys recommend that you know has a podfic.

The longer the better

I don't mind incomplete stories

I especially love slytherin!harry but with little to no bashing

I like Fanon!snape over canon!snape and like him mentoring Harry

No harem or smut please. And no snarry.

Thanks so much!

** I also like listening to stories, it helps past the time at work. If you use ffn's app you can click the headphones icon at the top of a chapter and a text-to-speach reader will read it to you. Its not perfect but its pretty good. Likewise, if you download pdfs of stories from ao3 you can use a free app called @Voice to do the same
