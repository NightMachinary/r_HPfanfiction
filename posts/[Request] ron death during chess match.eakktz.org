Or hermione died during troll incident. Ghostly harry doesn't make sense though. I'm looking for trio fic with one of their member being a ghost. Ron being dead may perhaps prevent ron bashing, which I am being tired of (if the author still keep bashing him... well, I'll just stop). While for hermione being dead, honestly at that point in the story where harry is reminded of this girl's death, mother and father death seem to be a nice tragedy to set up the tone of the story? I wonder if the emotional impact is enough though if she is killed at that moment. This is also the same with ron. If Ron is killed during that chess match, what is harry's decision? Will he grieve? Will he continued forward? What if ron's ghost asked him?

Honestly, with people bashing dumbledore, ron, ginny, hermione (this is rare, but sometimes happen), why don't the author just off them? A nice tragedy to shape the development of Harry.

if the fic is completed and has bittersweet ending, please really recommend me that? Neither of those is a requirement though.

Then Harry approached the grave of his former best friend.\\
"Serves you right, I knew you were always jealous of me," Harry muttered as he spit on the red-headed weasel's grave.

JK, JK, I couldn't resist it.

Honestly, the ghost idea is pretty cool and I wanna see it done too.

** This just made me think of the event in Crusader Kings 2 where you play chess against death and almost always die.
