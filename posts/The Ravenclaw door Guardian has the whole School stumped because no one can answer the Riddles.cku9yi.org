The Door Guardian gets bored, or whatever, and comes up with increasingly obnoxious riddles that no one in the entire house, and then not even Dumbledore, Flamel, or anyone can get into the Ravenclaw dorms, because the Riddles just get too difficult to solve.

The Riddle just becomes so much that they end up having to move the Ravenclaw Dorms, but then the Guardian ends up moving too: To the Main Doors of Hogwarts, so the entire School is stuck outside.

Everyone looks at him shocked.

"It worked on the Goblet of Fire!"

This is pretty much what you described, except Snape is the headmaster and it's SSHG.
