I'm talking about stuff like Hermione Granger and The Boy Who Lived and Harry Potter, Pokemon Master series etc. It should not just be person from one world into another, or single/multiple point of departure AU(unless it is a massive difference like Voldemort or Dumbledore never existing).

Romance is optional, any slash, r63 etc are fine, just not harry/death eater.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][*Child of the Storm*]] linkffn(8897431) is finished and has an updating sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12046648/1/Ghosts-of-the-Past][*Ghosts of the Past*]] linkffn(12046648) - both of which are outstanding and a deep, deep fusion of worlds.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][*The Next Lord of Kobol*]] linkffn(8712160) is probably the best cross over with the rebooted Battlestar Galactica. While on the surface it seems like a simple "Harry is deposited into BSG" the fusion of the two worlds slowly bleeds over. It has been reliably updating again, but beware that it may stop for a year or so with little warning. Still an entertaining read.

You also have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/Illusions-of-Grandeur][*Illusions of Grandeur*]] linkffn(8957424) where Harry is...something (this is a minor plot point) that goes on adventures (against his will at times) with the Winchesters in the Supernatural universe. He's basically on the same level as the Angels and they actively fear/hate him. It seems like it's just Harry dropped into this universe but it's a lot more complex than that. It's quite good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][*The Shadow of Angmar*]] is outstanding, and regularly updated. It's a lot closer to "Harry gets dropped into Middle Earth" than what you're looking for but I immediately thought of it when I saw this thread. It's not for everybody, but it's updated regularly enough that you can leave it and come back to it a bunch.

Then we have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7404056/1/Mutant-Storm][*Mutant Storm*]] linkffn(7404056), a crossover with the X-Men that fuses X-Men pretty well. It's not the best, but it's still a fun, completed, read. There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12000096/1/Duelling-with-a-Glass-Sword][*Dueling with a Glass Sword*]] linkffn(12000096) which is a female!Harry interacting with a reborn Rhaegar Targaryen in the Harry Potter world who is looking to fix where he went wrong. It has a sequel where they do go back to Westeros, but it more of "single character moves over" than world fusion.

Finally, [[https://media.tenor.co/images/d0d548db13df7bb5856aeaca5cf48ef6/raw][like any good pimp]], I have my own story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][*The Rezidentura*]] linkffn(12334664) which fuses the Marvel Universe with the Harry Potter universe, and lets the two reflect upon each other.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land. But all the obstacles he has faced pale in comparison to the Cylon menace. Starts in the middle of Harry's fifth year and roughly eleven years before the fall of the Twelve Colonies.
