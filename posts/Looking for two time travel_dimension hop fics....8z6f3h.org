1. Adult Harry arrives at Hogwarts at the beginning of the fourth year. He outs Crouch, traumatizes both Snape and kid Harry by mentioning Albus Severus Potter, becomes the DADA Professor, and wins at the graveyard (I think).

2. Adult/late teenage Harry somehow briefly runs into Harry, Hermione, and Ron. Harry gives the boys advice, but doesn't have anything in particular for Hermione. When she specifically asks him, he says something sorta vague that ends up smoothing over the fight she would've had with the boys over the Firebolt that Sirius sends as a Christmas gift.

Anyone recognize these?

Thanks.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
