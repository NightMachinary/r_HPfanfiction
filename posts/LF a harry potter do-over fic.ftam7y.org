ok so I'm looking for a fic where Harry travels back in time to his younger body (somewhere before 11 preferably) and when he goes to Hogwarts he tries to be friends with the people he was friends with but he just can't either because they aren't the people he left when going back in time or because of the gap in maturity


** *Reunion* - linkffn(4655545)

A group of people go back. They stick together and don't make friends with their old friends because of the reasons you listed.

Rorschach does that. He knows the perfect way to mix crack and serous.
