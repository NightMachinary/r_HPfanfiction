What are the most obnoxious/cringy/funny/awesome nicknames for Albus Dumbldore you've ever heard


** God, I hate just about every 'clever' nickname given to characters. To be honest, the only nickname I can stand is 'Enigmatic Bastard' in reference to Tom Riddle. Everything else comes off as far to juvenile (Dumblebore, Dumbledork, Dumbles, 'Order of the Flaming Cocks' and any of its derivatives) for characters over the age of 7, or simply doesn't flow ('Mione, for example).

Hope that made sense.

*** I swear Ron says mione like one time in canon, probably while eating, but for some reason everyone uses it in ffn

**** Indeed, very much while eating, which means he didn't really say “Mione” but rather we just heard it, because, you know, distortions to voice due to having his mouth full.

As for why people use it, I guess it's for the same reason why so many fanfic authors are incapable of distinguishing between so many homophones or realising that “should of” is really Hagrid-speak for “should have” (“should 'av”). In other words, not reading enough stuff that doesn't mutilate orthography, and thinking oneself too good for a beta or even a dictionary.

*** I really don't understand the hate for 'Mione. In some pretty close to received pronunciation accents, Hermione and 'Mione are basically identical. For instance, in a gentle guttural-stop Ipswich accent (which isn't far from a relaxed Cambridge accent, tbh), they are nearly indistinguishable.

***** I had a feature on my fanfic-to-ebook scraper for a while that would, among other things, turn 'Mione' into 'Hermione'. (I originally added it to get rid of the phrase 'so mote it be'.) I need to get that working again.

**** Basically, it's because “Mione” is distorted speech, Hagrid-speak really. And distorted speech should not happen unless either the character has an accent that distorts it (not possible if everyone calls some character this way), or the person speaking is doing it with their mouth full (which they can't all be doing constantly). In the absence of those two things, it's basically a nonsense piece of fanon, and some people don't really like unnecessary nonsense because ... well, it's nonsense, and it's unnecessary, and combined with the fact that Hermione does not seem like the kind of person who would not raise an issue about this being done all the time the act of it happening is tiresome for some.

Or, to put it another way: if “Mione” is legit then so is “Arry” and “Agrid” and “Umbedore” and many other nonsense forms that shouldn't really be used. And as those aren't, keeping on using it for one person because some author deemed it a great nickname and is so inexperienced with romance that in their eyes it being used is a sign and requirement of true love or some other rubbish, well ... yeah.

So basically, let us please not use distorted speech constantly.

** I can't remember any because this post riled me up too much! I just remembered a fic that seemed okay and I was getting into it. Until Harry started "cleverly" insulting the Order of the Phoenix. Called it Order of the Fried Chicken, etc.

It makes me teeth curl up and wanna die

Why do people do this? Do authors really think Harry calling him Dumbles or old man is clever and independent? And that smirk he does afterwards is actually just HARRY BEING A LITTLE DUMBASS SHITFACE

***** If it's PoS - trust me, he gets to eat his own words later on, in book two. Overall, PoS is bad example --- it started out as a fic that would use all these cringy elements and make them make sense. So while the beginning seems cringy, it all makes much more sense when Harry pulls his head out of his ass in book two.

******* How far did you read? Book Two (The Secret Enemy) is a real gamechanger. Ginny arguably becomes the best character, while Ron gets a gigantic opportunity to grow at the end too (in addition to the ton of development end of the Year One brings). Yeah, he is a piece of shit at times, but trust me, he has reasons. And watching him manipulate clueless Weasely twins, Jim and Harry into an all-out war is really fun.

As for Dumbledore - he acknowledges that he fucked up and he had his reasons. He is not evil and neither are Potters, though once again it's revealed only in book two. They just had incomplete data and thus made a horrible mistake. Even James's reaction to Harry's sorting makes sense in book two.

******** I read it all four or five days ago. The cliches aren't done too badly, except for the Slytherin Prince and his parents (to me). The Slytherin Prince stuff is juust a bit too much. If it was dialed down a hair, I think it'd hit a sweet spot. The whole fiasco that is his relationship with his parents doesn't work for me. If it was just the issue with sending him to the Dursleys because he appeared to be a Squib and so on, that would have been fine. But once you add in another prophecy and the Slytherin hate, that gets to be too much.

****** Welcome to ff.net, the place where morals go to die'

I've given up on finding which fic it was since I read it years ago, but there was one generic evil Dumbledore fic I was reading where about halfway through it abruptly turned into Dumbledore raping and impregnating like every female member of the Order.

I have no idea what fic it was, but every time someone brings up cringe Dumbledore content, it comes to mind. Bleeeeccchhhhh.

** The moment I see 'Dumbledork' I cringe and x outta the story. I don't mind shortening names ('Mione, etc) but it's ridiculous when people make Dumbledore the bad guy and then Harry stands up in the great Hall, shouting 'Dumbledork' it just... it just... fuck it.

'Moldyshorts' is even worse. It's like the author is trying to channel their inner twelvie persona. It's not edgy, I mean, it's laughable.

*** In Prince of Slytherin, Harry chooses "Moldy Shorts" as a joke for a temporal password for a secret room. Except it sticks, due to some plot related events. So when he has to lead Lucius Malfoy to the same room, it's a really embarrassing scene.
