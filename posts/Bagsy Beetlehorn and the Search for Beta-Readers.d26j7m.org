I'm writing a Harry Potter spin-off series set in Hogwarts but with an all original cast and story line. I've currently written the first two books and am hoping for some kind beta-readers to give me some helpful criticisms on my writing. If you're interested comment to let me know :)

The stories are similar to Harry Potter in tone and length with the first one around 70,000 words and the second one around 80,00. I plan on writing all seven years of the story.


** Sure why not. Do you have a link to the stories? I need to read at least some of it before commiting to anything.
