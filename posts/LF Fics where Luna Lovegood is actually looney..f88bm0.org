I have seen many versions of fanon Luna Lovegood from seers to somebody exceptionally observant, but canon Luna reminds me of a Wizarding flat-earther. What if Luna actually was schizophrenic?


** And not just schizophrenic like “ha, ha, she is loony”, but did anybody write a good realistic and sympathetic portrait of a schizophrenic wizard or witch? You know, like somebody who is able to function despite their disability?

** In /The Granger Principle/, Xenophilius is an Alex Jones type and has a conspiracy radio show with more ludicrous theories than in canon. Luna follows in his footsteps completely.

** Luna Lovegood is actually looney in /Friends/ by the psychotic house-elf. It's super dark.
