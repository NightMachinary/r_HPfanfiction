What i had in mind would be a Fic, that also contains erotic/teasing scenes with her being the initiative one. Sexual content is also welcome.

So an AU fic that introduce her different, than in Canon and so possible show a different Persona. It can involve something with Voldemort or happen after his defeat. After their possibly first meeting or some event that follows after it, she gets fascinated by him. His possible immunity vor her allure might magnify this effect on her or he isnt immune (maybe having a bit more resistance), but she doesnt mind it on Harry and actually things, that his "falling" is cute (no evil intentions here).

However, i thought that their meeting would be around or rather before Year 6, because when Fleur enters Harrys Bedroom to bring him Breakfast, i can (under the right condition) really imagine some sexual content that follows, or atleast heavily erotic. Of course Harry would be alone for this. It doesnt have to be the exact same scene (Harry at burrow before the Year or school at all begins), but the conditions would be same. Its a Kinda Harry/Fleur fic, but without strict pair rules....means: Fleur is attracted by him, but doesnt mind that he has other Women. So, they are Friends with benefits.

Fleur would be the flirting/teasing or rather naughty one, while Harry keeping his Canon or rather a reluctant personality (because his inexperience or insecurity or because he is general shy/reluctant in such things). However, this might change in the "heat of the battle".

Not every scene with them alone doesnt have to end in a sexual intercourse, but those and teasings would still be plenty.

I think it would be good, if the Fic is from Fleurs PoV (for the thoughts), but i dont mind from Harrys either.

Fleur might also like her independency, so she and Bill might meet, but dont marry.


** Tl;dr but based onnthe title you might try linkffn(in spite of obstinate men) and the as yet uncompleted sequel linkffn(in spite of appearances) harry and fleur meet before third year and begin writing letters learning about each other. Ita a slow burn romance nutb the romance doesnt really begin until the very end of obstinate men/beginning of appearances. Very well written and avoids most of the usual harry/fleur tropes

  Last year, a chance encounter brought together Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour, while her father exonerated Sirius Black. Now, events at Hogwarts will test friendships old and new, as Voldemort conspires to make Harry the Fourth Champion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's a race against time as Harry's allies work to hunt down Voldemort's darkest secrets...but will it be enough?
