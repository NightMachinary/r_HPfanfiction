I got tired of all the "Harry's twin was his best friend ever. That all changed when Voldemort attacked and James and Lily and Dumbledore conspired to make his twin, the apparent boy who lived hate him so as not to slow him down" and other such nonsense. Of course there's also an excellent great parents!James and Lily, so I went middleground. James and Lily WOULD be terrible parents, except Harry (who may or may not be the boy who lived) doesn't let them be. Harry here being the one they favor because he deserves the loving half sometimes.

Anyway. My issue is, after the attack, I can't figure out why Dumbledore doesn't want to spread news of the children's brush with Voldemort Past he's probably not dead yet and I doubly can't figure out why James and Lily DO want to spread the news other than getting attention and that's too bashy for that early in the story I think.

Side note: In this story, Dumbledore is NOT the bad guy. So he can't want to keep it a secret so he can take credit or have an easier time molding the children into his own personal warriors.

Thank you very much! And please no saying James and Lily shouldn't be bashed. I rarely write bashing fics and I'm having fun with this one.


** Why Dumbledore doesn't want it spread around, he himself defeated a Dark Lord, he knows the pressure that comes with that. The crippling expectation of greatness. Its why he wanted Harry kept away from the wizarding world in canon. He wants them to have a childhood, to grow up normally.

Why James and Lily would share, well either you're bashing hard and James is still an attention seeking brat and you're ignoring the fact he grew up or you can say that they wanted to give people hope. The war has lasted a decade, hundreds are probably dead. Wouldn't you want to take away the gloom?

*** Yeah, they gradually get worse over time despite Harry's best efforts (and Dumbledore's). The fame gets to their heads (as it has the chance to do with a lot of people) Thanks for these. I really like Dumbledore's reasonings. And the Potter's is good enough that their jumping to the assumption that Harry tanked a killing curse isn't as overshadowing. Again, thank you!

***** That'll probably come later, at the earliest around 1989, though it'll probably only be touched upon later. The years between Voldemort and school are glossed over, just snippets highlighting the change in their attitudes

*** It could start out small, James or Lily quietly asking a friend for advice or just stating how messed up it is that their babies were targeted and maybe that friend tells someone else and it telephones from there. James and Lily could start out good intentioned and get more and more jaded and fame hungry over time.

**** Simpler might be that people saw them as heroes. Lily was kind and compassionate and tried to use that to push their own agenda. Kinda like Hermione in linkffn(6257522) although one of my pet peeves is people who basically give Lily Hermione's character. Either way if the media then starts to call you clever, compassionate and a hero etc how long before you believe your own hype. What began as a trying to help people became something else, something far worse.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** If James and Lily survived, why would everyone assume Harry was still the boy-who-lived? Between two top Students/Order of The Phoenix Members, and a baby, why would they think Harry was the more likely one to have defeated the Dark Lord? In canon, that is because Harry is the only one who actually survived.

**** So they left their child alone for an extended period of time to attend a meeting? What were the contents of this meeting? Was it important enough, that they had to leave the safety of their Fidelius'd home? Also, how would they be able to get a babysitter if their home was under the Fidelius charm?

***** Honestly? Not 100% sure yet. It's up in the air if this is the final reason they didn't get killed. Stunning is also an option. If they did need to get a sitter, it's not like a sitter could tell the secret to anyone, not in my stories. The fidelius is a much stronger spell in my stories.

That being said, still working on the why. Of course, they could have only been gone ten minutes. With no Potters to fight through, getting to the nursery would take a lot less time.

Also, children, not child. Harry has a twin in this

** In canon people knew about Harry because of Hagrid and Dumbledore I assume. Plus, when the Sirius Pettigrew incident happened, Dumbledore would have needed to have provided context. This combined with the speed at which magicals can communicate would ensure the knowledge.

Maybe you can make it so it wasn't James and Lily or Dumbledore Who spread it? When snape told Voldemort the prophecy, he was sure to have asked someone about it. Unless he has an encyclopedic knowledge about child births and family history, he had to have done some research to come to the Harry/Neville conclusion and then decide on Harry. In canon, Bellatrix and the others captured the longbottoms trying to find a way to know for sure what happened to him or something. In the torture and subsequent arrest and trial, you can make it so that they give away the fact that Voldemort is gone/missing and that according to their last knowledge, he was going to pay a visit to the potters.

The best way to write a bashing fic is to start out with things that just happen to the characters in question, and then when they start dealing with events in a negative way and things snowball from there.

*** Hm, I may write that up and see how it goes. It's certainly a good idea. Better than them bragging to the world like I'd originally planned, but I do like the other suggestion of it starting out more selfless. Hm. I'll have to kick the two ideas around with my writin partner. Thank you!
