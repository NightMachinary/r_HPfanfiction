Basically, there is this series of one-shots on Sufficent Velocity that is called There is nothing to Fear, which shows an AU Riddle that gets sorted into Gryffindor. After finishing Hogwarts, Riddle becomes a radical and tries to push societal changes, yet also learning the dark arts and having sociopath tendencies. Is their any other fics similar to this, where Riddle fights for good ideals, yet retaining his fascination with the dark arts?
