Basically stories where Voldemort's death is only a part of the story, but not the end goal. Maybe it's a time-travel story, or a crossover with Stargate. Maybe it focuses more on the political side, or maybe Harry is just that darn powerful. The point being Voldemorts death does not equal only one chapter left, or something like that.

Heck, it could be a story that focuses on what happens after. It can follow canon, or go completely off the rails. It could be a crossover, or not. As long as Voldemort is at least in it in the beginning, or as a mention, and that he either dies, or get's taken care of well before the end.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind might count. Voldemort only appears in a flashback, but it's the final battle against him that kicks off the plot.

The Battle of Hogwarts doesn't happen in this AU; instead Harry, Ron and Hermione fight and defeat Voldemort outside Hogwarts... but somehow, defeating Voldemort ends up giving them all amnesia and they forget everything related to magic and the wizarding world. Harry and Hermione only remember their Muggle lives, and Ron vaguely recalls that his name is Ron, nothing else.

The plot is not only about the three coping with their weird amnesia, it's also about the Order of the Phoenix trying to find Harry and Ron, who have vanished since Harry can't go back to the Dursleys and Ron has no idea who he is... and of course, it also becomes a question of finding out exactly what happened to make them lose their memories and how to undo it.
