  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** One thing I hated about canon. Dumbledore knew there was a basilisk roaming around. What if that thing had slithered into the Great Hall? Hundreds, dead.

*** /Did/ he know? It's a reasonable assumption (if Hermione could figure it out, maybe he could too) but I don't remember if there was any evidence for it in the text.

**** The one scene that makes me certain is when Colin is brought into the Infirmary. Dumbledore says that the Chamber had indeed been opened after Colin's camera blows up or whatever. I just don't know why he'd be so certain only after that fact.

And if not that, there's just no way he wouldn't have figured it out. The dude is 100+ years old. If he didn't figure it out, he's incredibly incompetent. I mean, really. Slytherins monster (first thing most think when they think of Slytherin is a snake), petrified people, able to live 1000 years. There's just no way someone as intelligent as him didn't figure it out.

Plus, did no portraits see the thing? There had to be at least one that could have told him a big ass snake was roaming the place.

There's no evidence saying 100% he knew, but it all points to the fact that he either did was ridiculously stupid for his age.

***** Does it say that it can live a thousand years in actual canon? I know that Fantastic Beasts does mention them living for a long time. Also, petrification isn't an ability normally attributed to basilisks, but given Dumbledore's powers of insight, he should be able to extrapolate. For portraits, there aren't portraits everywhere, and we only know of two things related to how the basilisk moves around: first, that it moves around in the pipes, and second, it has been known to exit from Myrtle's bathroom, where the Chamber is located. Nothing suggests that there aren't other locations that the basilisk can exit out of.

****** Well, the exact words are "many hundreds of years" but that's close enough.

And the basilisk petrified 5 different people at 4 different locations. I doubt it exited a pipe in those very corridors, petrified, then retreated immediately. It likely wandered the corridors a little bit. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought plenty of corridors had portraits.

**** I would say consider the following:

- Tom Riddle has gathered his Death Eaters who await him in the Hog's Head after his meeting with Dumbledore in ~1957. Riddle says he wanted the DADA job, but he was really using the interview as a cover to hide his horcrux in the Room of Requirement. Dumbledore knew about the Death Eaters and (IIRC) knew that Riddle had adopted his new moniker "Lord Voldemort".

- Dumbledore surely knew that Voldemort was an enemy and Voldemort's reign of terror began in the early 60s. Knowing his history, and suspecting that he was involved in Myrtle's death, he had 35 years (~30 years for "early 60s") between 1957 and 1992 to investigate how Myrtle died and how Riddle carried it out.

He should have known. He had the time to carry out a terribly thorough investigation--even if he didn't get to start that investigation until 1982, it was still 10 years to look through records and cross-reference available methods of killing Myrtle.

** From a Book 5-7 standpoint, especially with how accomplished Dumbledore is, his actions in books 1 & 2 are illogical. Books 1-2 were directed towards pre-teens; the kids are supposed to have adventures without the adults. The darker aspect of Harry Potter materialized around Book 4. Preteens want to read about Harry and his brave fight with the basilisk. I know I did.

  Sirius, though impetuous and often immature, is actually an adult and an Auror, not a lunatic. Dumbledore hasn't been Headmaster since the war got truly started; he is full time Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump, besides running the Order. Also the Ministry is a functional government. (Despite the title there are currently no plans for any relationships of any kind.)
