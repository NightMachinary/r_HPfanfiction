It was a marauder fic set during the first war, I believe the writer was Jewell 95 or something similar - it was very well known on the site at the time, I just can't for the life of me remember the fic name, something like 'the days and times, or the times of our lives' maybe?

It was a very long multific, I'm not sure that it was ever finished, but it was beautifully written taking a long, hard look at the tragedies and little triumphs of that generation during war time.

â€‹

Any help is appreciated!


** I'm assuming it's not The Life and Times by Jewels5? The Jily fic with the war and the protest and Carlotta and it's very angsty and sad and you just want to give them all hugs?..

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
