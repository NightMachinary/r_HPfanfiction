I'm at the point in iso where I'm reading OP grey-Harry powerwank fics and enjoying them so I'd like some recommendations!

I'm a fan of Dramione/Regmione/Sirmione/Harmony and time travel fics. My faves are fics by olivieblake, A.Lovely.Villain, msmerlin13 and smallesttabbycat

Any recommendations for long fics and why you like them would be great.


** I've been on a bit of a HP kick in the last few months, here's most of the longfics I enjoyed enough to finish:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369512/1/The-Peace-Not-Promised][The Peace Not Promised]] linkffn(12369512)

Timetravel, DH Snape sent back to his teenage years. We see Snape learning a few new skills here (Alchemy), as well as taking a bit of a backseat in the first wizarding war. Focus is on Snape as a leader/mentor of the Slytherin students, his relationships with the Marauders, Lily, and Dumbledore. Gets a touch too domestic for my tastes at some points, but I enjoyed it enough to stick with it despite the relative lack of action.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]] linkffn(13052940)

Timetravel, DH Remus sent back to PoA. We see a lot of Sirius and Tonks in this one. Focus on Remus as a Teacher, and Sirius' recovery from Azkaban. Not slash. Very enjoyable. Harry's relationship with Sirius is at times a fairly significant part of the story.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] linkffn(8096183)

Crack played straight. Technically a D&D crossover, but you only really need a genaral idea of how D&D works to enjoy it. Big focus on OCs, but I felt they were done fairly well.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12386916/1/They-Didn-t-Know-We-Were-Seeds][They Didn't Know We Were Seeds]] linkffn(12386916)

Another DH Snape timetravel - this time to pre-hogwarts child. Multiple other people also come back. Takes a focus on Snape's family situation for a time, before shifting towards a consipiracy to fell Voldemort. Romance is used as a plot point a few times, but thankfully does not consume the plot of the story. I won't spoil it, but the ships aren't what you expect going into it - at least, not at the time of writing this.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343505/1/Second-Chance-a-new-choice][Second Chance, a new choice]] linkffn(6343505)

Don't know how it used to be, but it's undergone a rewrite and is now very good. DH Snape to teenage Snape timetravel. Once things get rolling, we get to see hints of Snape's experience with tradecraft shining. Drama with Lily & Marauders is a frequent occurence, but I didn't find it to detract from the story. (Justifiably) Swaps the main perspective over to Lily a number of arcs in.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/1/A-Wand-for-Skitter][A Wand for Skitter]] linkffn(13220537)

If you like powerwank, this'll do it for you. It also happens to be a crossover with a webserial, Worm, and is absolutely dependant on you knowing about it. This fic was very polarizing in the Worm fandom. Mostly because of the violence and the characterization of the main character. Despite the issues it has, there's some very genuine moments of suspense that convinced me to look past the flaws.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/Come-Once-Again-and-Love-Me][Come Once Again and Love Me]] linkffn(7670834)

DH Snape timetravels into teenager Snape. Very much focused on the Snape/Lily romance. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't absolutely amazing either.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11625127/1/Darkness-Visible][Darkness Visible]] linkffn(11625127)

I had problems with this one. It's angsty, it's wanky, and it's a little contrived at times. Features a Snape proported to be on the same power level as Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald. Despite that, I stuck with it to the end. The final few chapters were a rollercoaster, but ultimately I didn't think the author quite landed where they were aiming for with it all.

 

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613][Percy Take the Wheel]] linkao3(14033613)

Interesting take on Percy, interesting take on a branch of magic. Too domestic for my tastes at times, but I'm interested enough to keep up with it. I don't have much else to say about it - it's fairly average.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12598437/1/][Love and Old Black Shoes]] linkffn(12598437)

Super depressing. Honestly made me cry a few times - that's a first for fic. Percy is by no means perfect in this one, but the author makes you feel for him regardless. Satisfying ending - it's worth sticking with this one. It's probably not for everybody, but looking back on it now, I think it was definitely worth reading.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU. Nominated for Best James Potter and Best Peter Pettigrew in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
