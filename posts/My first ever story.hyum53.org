I've been an avid reader for a decade now, and for the longest time, I've always thought to myself; “wouldn't it be fun to actually write one. I could probably make a decent enough story”. Well, after 10 years of thinking up ideas and whole arcs, I was motivated by a Choose Your Own Adventure post to finally published my first ever story!!

No idea if it's seen as any good, but just the act of starting one was a cathartic experience.

  I was always overly focused on sports, rather than "what I should be prioritizing". Now that I'm in a world of magic, why change that now? You guys fight your war. I'll be in the air making bets on the winner. Bad jokes and excessive referencing ahead. Heavily based on [[/u/EternallyLostAuthor][u/EternallyLostAuthor]]'s Harry Potter CYOA.
