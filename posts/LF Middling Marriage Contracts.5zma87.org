** In the legacy Harry enters a marriage contract with Daphne Greengrass. They do so because they both benefit from from it. They do start a relationship quite late in the story, however it takes many months of being married before they even start to see each other as friend and even more for them to become romantically involved. linkffn(9774121)

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
