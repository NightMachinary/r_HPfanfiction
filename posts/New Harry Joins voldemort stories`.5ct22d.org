  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be woth it...because he'd never be alone again.

I'm also looking for a few of them to waste time, what have you read so far? Also, an older but equally good fic on the same topic: linkffn(hit the ground running), there's also a sequel of that, but I have yet to read it.

*** Exactly! I wish they could just keep romance out of it and some of those slash stories would be 10/10 reads. I'm not a fan of reading those in general but I've read one or two that had slash that were good you just had to overlook the m/m sex scenes and the fluff :(

**** I guess the slash drew on me over time and I did not mind it so much, as long as it did not draw into over fluffyness. It's strange, very very dubious, but I can kind of tolerate a good H/LV, but fluff? Fucking hell, it's a murdering dark lord, how much further from fluffy can you get?

*** Jeez. Lmao.

The reason for this is because authors want Harry to fix Voldemort. It's the gay version of a girl trying to fix a man. I can see why people do it and I can see why it's popular.

I always feel somewhat pitying of people who x out of a story because of a few small things. I understand that many of you dislike slash, but that doesn't mean that the slash is the primary focus. You also need to remember that not all slash is smut.

***** Yeah, but Harry joining/helping the guy who murdered his parents isn't really that much better. So why not go all the way in crazytown. If I can buy Harry feeling in any way sympathetic towards Voldemort (who is pretty much the worst kind of mustache twirling villain with no redeeming qualities) then I assume I can buy anything.

I haven't actually read any Harry/Voldemort stories, because I don't like slash and the idea sounds stupid to me, but how do the authors do it? Like, it's all some big conspiracy and Voldie dindu nuffin? I guess time-travel could also work, with Harry taking little Tommy out of the orphanage and raising him like his son... makes the mandatory Slash even weirder though.

****** The best one I've seen yet are those who completely rewrite the story. Makes the slash much more plausible considering that Voldemort never actually killed Harry's parent and is actually a relatively sane person.\\
The added good look they also gift Voldemort with helps.
