I'd settle for just the first one I guess. I'm looking for something like Seventh Horcux, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/how-i-learned-to-stop-hating-and-love-the-bomb-that-is-nero-worm-au-historical-insert.342737/][How I Learned to Stop Hating and Love the Bomb That is Nero]] (that one's from the worm fandom), or a main character with Gilgamesh's beautiful personality.


** May be linkffn(The Denarian Renegade by Shezza)? Or linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter by nonjon) (damn i recommend this way too frequently.).

** Harry Potter and the year of discovery has always been an "over powered" Harry that has an interesting story line. A nice long read if your interested. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1683936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Year-of-Discovery]]
