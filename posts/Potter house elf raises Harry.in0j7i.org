:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
/Edit/ Found: Battle Cry, link in comments!

Okay I know this is a long shot. But I'm trying to find a fic where theres just this one scene that I remember.

It was alive james/lily. They were bad/abusive. Pretty sure it was a wrong boy who lived. They lived in this huge potter manor. The house elves were not allowed to take care of harry. And would be punished if they did so.

The one scene I remember is this really graphic torture that james and sirius carries out on a house elf, in front of Harry and the other elves, that treated Harry like her kid. She had looked after him and even stole potions for him when he was sick.

James was all like if you tell harry that you hate him or something like that then the 'punishment' would end. She refused and even told harry that she loved him before she died.

Not sure what else happens in the fic as I had stopped reading and I guess I forgot to bookmark it to finish. If anyone recognizes this, I would love to know the title! Thank you!


** Oh, I wish I knew because now I want to read this. Do you remember where you read it?
