:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I heard that this community /might/ be able to help with remembering a Long Oneshot I remember reading. It was A creature fic that wasn't Harry becoming a creature, he just was, It wasn't ever really explained what he was or how he became that way. He was seen some by Hagrid some and Hagrid went to Dumbledore about it. I remember that he met Luna at some point within the story and that he was compared to a Balrog. If I remember correctly, he was mainly around the Forbidden Forest and was thus capable of helping with the Unicorn situation. It's been nagging at my mind and I cannot remember the Name nor can I find it anywhere. I was hoping that I could get some help, but if not, that's fine.

*** It's fine that you're late. I'm just happy that people were kind enough to help me. I was afraid I was going insane for a second time and the fic didn't exist.
