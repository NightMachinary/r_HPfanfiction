Can't remember the title or the author.

Now before y'all yell at me for asking about a Twilight fanfic in the HPFanfic thread, please note that there is a very high chance that the fic I am looking for was written by a HP fanfic writer since I would never dream of touching Twilight with a 10 foot pole. I must have liked the HP fanfic I read, which lead me to read stuff the author wrote for other fandoms.

In this fic, Bella has her own kind of "immortality." She's part of a family that has a vendetta against the vampires and all of them get reincarnated through the years. Each member of the family gets born into different families but they usually meet up when they're all of age. Bella seems to want to escape this life and takes advantage of those times when she's born earlier than the rest of her family so that she can get away from them. She meets Edward during one of her lives but trouble brews when she meets the Volturi. One of them knows who she originally was all those years ago, and the trouble her family brings to the vampires.

Bella was originally some Egyptian lady with two brothers. This is where things get murky. I believe she was betrothed to the "stronger" brother and the other brother became a vampire who eventually became part of the Volturi leadership. I don't remember if it was Aro, Caius or Marcus

The ending was about Bella confronting that Volturi member who knew her and dying again. I think Edward vows to find where she is when she gets reincarnated.

Those are the things I remember now. I hope someone here knows what this fic is. Thanks.
