I read a story(ies) a while back that had Harry gaining some life debt slaves. One had him get Severus as a slave. Amongst the standout plot points that happened was that Harry took Snape to a beautician where he figured out the werewolf cure and also ended up hooking Snape up with a Yoko from a trip they took to Japan. Now I can't remember if it's the same story or not but Harry ended up getting some life debts from a few others including one of the Patil sisters where during the enslavement Patil tricks Harry into doing a full enslavement rather then the basic enslavement he wanted to do, and if I recall correctly the ritual takes place in the Express. And the last was one were Harry somehow gets the Flamels to befriend/watch over him which leads to Albus getting put into a mundane nursing home with his magic bound. I read this/these stories on either fanfiction.net or on archiveofourown.org. I just can't remember which or what it/they were called. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** Several of these, including snape finding the cure after visiting a barber, can be found in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/37]])
