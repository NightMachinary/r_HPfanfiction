Like the title said, please give me recommendations for all your best fics where Harry learns rare magic. I'm tired of fight scenes with just stunning spells and disarming charms. I would especially love fics where Harry is learning ancient magic. Like he learns elemental magic or ancient Egyptian or something. Thnx!

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the dangerous choice)

Revolves around harry learning elemental magic. Think specifically when dumbledore encases Voldermort in water during their battle at the end of OoTP, that's where the author got the idea for it, so water, wind, earth and fire. It's after OoTP and has a sequel, linkffn(Harry potter and the elements of Valor)

The story follows canon upto OoTP and shipping is all canon. Also has a great original character.

Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I remember looking at A Second Chance at Life a while ago and was reading the comments but I had thought someone had said it was slash but I couldn't find that marked anywhere so I wasn't sure if it was just that random commenter shipping two characters from the story or if it really was. Since your recommending it, I'm assuming you've read it and could you tell me if it is slash. I don't care if it's characters in the background I just don't want to read it when it's the main pairing with Harry. Let me know. Thanks for all your recs.

**** There's no slash with Harry in that, or it's sequels. There is a little bit offscreen from some of the side characters, but even then it isn't /slash/ so much as strange vampire dominance rituals. Sex with those of lesser power, regardless of gender, based on the vampire hierarchy, and not based on romance or relationships. But it is also a very non-romance fic(s), it's action and adventure the whole way through.

****** Yes. But then again, the whole premise of the first one that Harry leaves England, and realizes that the entire magical world is so much bigger and more magical than the petty pureblood political mumbo-jumbo and Voldemort that canon HP was dealing with. At some point in the first fic, it becomes very clear that Voldemort is no significant threat outside of Britain, and is just a Villain with an over-inflated ego and delusions of grandeur. It still has Horcruxes, and he is not an insignificant challenge to destroy, but he is nowhere near the world-ending catalyst of untold DOOM that he was in canon.

Also with necromancy, vampires, demons, and bloodmagic, though at least with the latter I have read a few wonderful, political fics about.

******** Ha! Understandable, and combined with the fact that Harry changes his name to escape from his past and Britain, there are quite a few tropes that are very disparaging to the casual "this could be interesting, I'll give it a shot" reader. That said, I read the fic years ago before the 3rd had been started (and then abandoned), and then once again recently, and despite it's unfinished/abandoned status, I thought it was quite entertaining, and a good story. If you've got nothing pressing on your to-be-started list, I'd give it a shot, but hey, I certainly ain't you, so you just do what you do.
