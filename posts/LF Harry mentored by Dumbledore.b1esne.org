** I mixed two fanfics up. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ioci/HPATROTP02.html]] which isHarry Potter and the Rise of the Phoenix by Ioci is the 2nd and final book of a series that has a distraught Harry in it that makes a decision to end it all. The series is amazing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2389811/1/]] which is Reign o'er Me. It's the story with the Flamels in it with Dumbledore as a mentor. It's also a great one.

Saved both to my bookmarks so I don't forget again. I hope y'all enjoy!

** It's probably the Unlocking Harry Potter series. Lemme find a link. It's no longer on ffn, the link includes the links to the sequels also.
