Yeah, yeah, I know, canonically they are pretty much all irredeemable and unquestionably evil, racists and murderers. But, it's fanfiction, so...

I would prefer if the story didn't go the "we where the good guys all along" or "Light Side is just as bad" route, because that's just lazy.

** First this requires Voldemort to actually be the intelligent manipulative person he waa claimed to be rather than the psychopath whose only negotiation tactics seem to be torture and intimidation.

Then you have to figure out what the Death Eaters are fighting for? Are they a pure personality cult built around Voldemort? Or are they a group of aligned interests and what are they concerned abou?

The first one is canon and frankly boring while the second, you can do a lot with. One of the common themes there is the loss of old perogatives and the illegalization of 'dark' magic, a term that has never been defined in Canon. That combined with rational fears of muggles spawned from WW2(London bombing then the Bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima) makes blaming new muggleborn influence in the Wizarding World easy, with fears that every muggleborn is a potential threat to the Statute of Secrecy.

In short tone down the random rape murder and pillaging for lulz that seems to be Death Eater norm in canon and make them rational beings making rational decisions. Think about what their values are and how they would act to protect them.

** There is one about Dolohov, how he turned from a man with dreams and goals into a Death Eater, a really nice one shot showing how one's life can turn for worse in a single instant.\\
Its from Silens Cursor; "Speak softly, Love."

Huge rec, loved it
