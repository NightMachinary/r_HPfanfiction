Looking for stories where a character, one or more then one is either mentally or physically (or perhaps both) is disabled in some way. The ups and down of being disabled ect extra.

Any rating is fine. Would rather have it be completed, but as long as the story has a lot of chapters I'm fine with it not being completed I suppose.


** Here is a collection of stories where Harry has a physical handicap [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Handicapped-Harry/32134/]]

I also recommend Blindness but I can't remember the author.

**** Just a heads up, the Harry in this fic is the definition of OP. Really interesting dissection of magic though, but yeah, less of a disability and more of a 'trade of senses.'

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
