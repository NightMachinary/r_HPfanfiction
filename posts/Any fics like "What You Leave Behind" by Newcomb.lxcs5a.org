I really like this fic but since it hasn't updated in like 6 years I'm not particularly hopeful that it'll update again. I specifically think the way Dumbledore and Harry approach magic is really cool. Does anyone know of any other fics like it?


** I agree this is an amazing story that just sucks to be left unfinished, let's hope that one day changes haha. Anyhow I'm not really sure there is anything as similar as you want to this story as I don't know what part of it interests you the most besides interesting magic.. but I liked this one very much and ran across it searching for something to replace "What you leave behind". linkffn(7469856) Heads up though, this story is also unfinished :/

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
