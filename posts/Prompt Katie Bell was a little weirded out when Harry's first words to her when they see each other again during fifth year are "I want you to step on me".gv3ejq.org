*** There is a serious lack of harry/katie fics of any type. she is one year older than him and they are on the same sports team starting in the same year, in the same house. we know a bit about katie but not much so there is huge room for the fandom to develop her character.

Its my number 1 desired pairing for people to write but it just never happens.

**** It isn't the easiest pairing to set up. You can write Hermione or Ginny pairings with little effort. Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Susan and Daphne have established fanon lore. It is perhaps a bit lazy to just recycle that, but it gives you a base to draw inspiration from, even if your inspiration is "that's bullshit, I'll write the polar opposite".

But Katie is very blank, both in canon and in fanon. You have to invent her basically from scrap in a manner which is interesting, which has chemistry with Harry yet didn't impact the stations of canon before your fic (if you make Katie obsessively protective, she'd follow them to confront Quirrel or Sirius). And not only that, she must not be too similar to an existing character, canon or fanon, otherwise people will see her as a reskin of that character.

I made a few attempts, but either it did not go beyond an outline or I turned her into a best friend for Harry because the dynamic felt better for a friendship (in /No Longer Alone/).

***** I dont feel the sports teammate angle has been explored by any other character pairing really. I picture her as rather different from any of the other common female pairing options. Just another half-blood who is mostly uninvolved in the politics of hogwarts and the war but doesnt stand for any of the blood purity. I picture her as someone who wants to get through school, play her sport and doesnt have many good friends choosing to mostly hang leanne who i imagine as a childhood friend.

I like katie in no longer alone and im super glad you have her in there but being only a year older than harry doesn't necessarily put her in protector role.

I've tried writing several stories but im just a shitty writer when it comes down to it. That being said the best attempt i made on it was not changing cannon up much, writing some talks and situations they went through over the years that i could show in flashbacks or conversations between them in the current time of the story. Then having them spend a lot more time together in their 6th/7th year after spending a bunch of time together as co-captains.

Much of the reasoning for waiting till then is i dislike writing and reading about younger children and think pairings between older teenagers can skip /some/ of the awkwardness. you can also skip most of the early shit in the books so you don't need to write a hundred thousand words that change nothing, such as having katie get involved in harry's early adventures.

I also like exploring the muggle side of a half-blood pairing and katie could be used for that where most other common pairings can't (some hermione stories being the exception).

I know, in my first 3 drafts she was the love interest, but that simply felt weird for some reason.

I tried something similar and scrapped it after some planning and ~1000 words. I made another attempt with a fic set during HBP so that it mostly deals with Harry sneaking out to visit her at St Mungo's, but I am not particularly happy with that one either.

** What feels like I really long time ago, I read a story where Harry and Katie got together, but I don't remember the name. There wasn't much emphasis on the height difference that I can recall though.

What I do remember, if someone wants to try to find it: Katie's dad is a sea wizard and she has a small talent to be a sea witch. She loves potions, possibly wants to achieve a mastery in the art, and studies extensively under Snape. Snape is Harry's dad or in some way becomes Harry's guardian. Harry has a little crush on Katie that grows in part from both hanging out with Snape. That's all I can remember right now without giving away some of the fun and adventure.

Perhaps try looking for it on the Potions and Snitches website. That's where I read all of my Fanfic the first time round, then I stopped reading fanfiction altogether for a few years, and now I'm back; HUZZAH! P&S doesn't have an app (like FFN) or app equivalent (like ao3) so I don't really use it anymore.

Hope that helps someone.

**** I mean, canonically, Harry is malnutritioned at the start of the series. And while he later has growth spurts, IMO his nutrition is too inconsistent (summers at the Dursleys, the hunt) to completely remove the effects of 10+ years of malnutrition.
