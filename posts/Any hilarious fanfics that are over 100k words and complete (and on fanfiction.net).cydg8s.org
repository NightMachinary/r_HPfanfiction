** /complete/. damn, there goes linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby)

alternatively, linkffn(12350003) - Weeb, Harry grows up with Anime. Funnier if you get most of the jokes.

Or, linkffn(4536005) - Oh god not again, you've probably read it already.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** *Gryffindors Never Die*. It's not 100k words (around 74k) but really really funny. Harry and Ron go from their 50s to their 4th year in Hogwarts and are snarky sarcastic old men trapped in teenage bodies. What could go wrong?

linkffn(6452481)

Here's one of my favorite parts from that story:

--------------

Harry and Ron made it to the Great Hall in one piece. When they got there, however, Hermione Granger was waiting. She wanted answers.

"What is the matter with you two?" she asked. "Last week you were perfectly normal, now you're acting all strange. And speaking Spanish? What is this?" she demanded.

"Spanish?" Harry asked. "I still don't know what you're talking about." He shoved some sausage and egg in his mouth and continued to look at her with concern.

"Harry, you've never been good with attention before, and now all the sudden you're Mr. Spotlight!" she snapped. "And you, Ron, have not made one comment about Harry's name coming out of the Goblet. I would have expected you to be angry!"

"Angry?" Ron asked. He also looked at her in concern. "Are you alright, Hermione? You're acting awful funny."

"Me?" she snarled. "You two are being downright crazy!"

Harry and Ron looked at each other, and then back to Hermione. They slowly lowered their silverware to their plates and pushed back from the table slightly. "Listen, Hermione, if you need to see someone about this, we won't think any less of you. There's no shame in seeing a psychologist," Harry said soothingly.

"A psychologist?" Hermione screeched. A few heads turned in their direction in confusion. "I should see a psychologist? I'm perfectly fine! You two are nutters!"

"Listen, Hermione, I've read about this," Ron said, in all seriousness. "Have you had any big gaps in memory lately? Woken up and not knowing where you are?"

"What are you implying, Ronald Weasley? Because I'm fed up with your nonsense."

"I think you're being possessed!" Ron yelled, drawing most people's attention. "By the Devil."

Hermione's face became eerily calm. "You think I am being possessed by the Devil," she repeated. "And what makes you think this?"

"You're hearing things in strange languages. You look like you haven't slept in weeks. You've got a twitch in your right eye. And you study magic, which we all know is of the Devil."

Hermione's face then burned with rage. "We're at a SCHOOL of MAGIC, idiot!" Hermione then let out a frustrated, strangled growl. It was a loud, frightening sound, like that of an angry boar being eaten by an angrier bear that's been sodomized by a dying duck.

"SATAN!" Harry and Ron screamed as they dove over the Hufflepuff table, and under the Ravenclaw table.

"I want my mommy!" Ron yelled.

"I want your sister!"

There was several seconds of silence from under the table.

Then Ron said, "Not cool, man... Oooh! Black panties! Girls only wear black panties when they want-"

"Ow!" Harry yelled. Several feet were suddenly kicking him, and he and Ron found that their hiding place was no longer safe. "Ow, what the... He said it! Kick him!"

The two scrambled from under the table and found that several people were glaring at them. They shook hands. "People hate us, and breakfast isn't even over," Ron said proudly.

"Mission accomplished."

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  COMPLETE. OneShot. Either Fred and George played a prank on Harry, Harry played a prank on Fred and George, or they're all playing pranks on everybody. Although to be honest, it really doesn't matter how it happened. WARNING: crude, immature, ADULT humor.

  No one missed Riddle's pale fist tightening around the useless wand in his lap. "I am Tom," he ground out. "I am here for the sole reason that the alternative was community service." / Hermione moderates a post-Avada Kedavra support group. Chaos ensues.
