** I'm laughing- was this coincidence or did you post this after seeing my post?

The first few chapters are a bit cringe, but it does pick up speed. By the time of the sorting you will have a good understanding of stylistic choices and flow, however it does shift depending on the arc (there are 3 distinct arcs). The story is very sad, so a lot of readers do lose heart or find it uncomfortable. I can't say that it is good or not, but it is complete and does tie up all ends, so take what you will, and hear re advice from others as well!

*** Nope. I saw a recommendation in another thread for it. I just finished it a few minutes ago. It was very good.

I tried to find the thread and I believe it was [[/u/shadowclonier]] that I got the rec from.

** Like all wbwl stories, the logic behind his parents favouring his brother is not completely sound, but if you can ignore that and treat lily and james as ooc, then it is a very well written story.

** To be fair, it may be worth looking at linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw) if the genre is even for you. Can confirm they at least possess quality story-telling, though they can be a bit meandering too so be prepared.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** As a reader, I can say that Antithesis is absolutely incredible, and I highly recommend trying it. Reading at least till the sorting is definitely a good idea. It's a really great take on a darker Harry. The characterization and development is spot on, and the “bashing” is a pretty important part of the plot in relation to Harry. You should note that it does deal with some difficult topics and I'm pretty sure some trigger warnings are listed in the authors notes on ff.net and AO3. It may be painful to read sometimes, but it's honestly so worth it. It's an amazing story and my go-to fanfic recommendation :)

** I got about 45 chapters in and then stopped because it was getting depressing and kind of triggering some of my trauma, but up until that point it was actually pretty good once it got going.
