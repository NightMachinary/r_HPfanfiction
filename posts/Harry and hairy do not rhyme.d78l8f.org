Rhyming isn't about the first syllable. It's about the last.

Still not seeing how it doesn't rhyme with hair*y.* You're still ending on the same phonetic sound.

What definition of rhyme are you and the OP using, and how does it not work?

***** In English at least, a perfect rhyme requires that:

1. The final stressed syllable in both words have the same vowel and same consonant coda, or lack there-of.

2. All unstressed syllables following the final stressed syllable must be identical.

So "Australia" and "Amelia" don't rhyme even though the last two syllables are the same or both words, because those syllables are unstressed and thus don't count. The last stressed syllables, i.e. the "STRAY" in "o-STRAY-lee-uh" and the "ME" in "uh-ME-li-uh" would need to have the same vowel for these words to rhyme.

Same thing with "Harry" and "hairy": the "-y" syllable is unstressed, thus it doesn't count towards the rhyme. The first, and only stressed, syllable in both words must have the same vowel and coda for the rhyme to be perfect. In American English, the first syllable is the same for both words, hence they rhyme. In British English, the first syllables are different, hence they do not.

Okay, I get where y'all are coming from now, if that's the definition you're using.

I don't think that second detail is broadly taught, especially when most peoples exposure to rhyme is pop/rap songwriting. But checking some dictionaries, google and wiki(Which seems a decent article), that 2nd point is not included.

I'm definitely going to have to listen to some youtube or audiobook clips or something, because I'm not comprehending the difference at /all/.

******** I don't agree.

Harry's hair is the defining part as part of the narration. Other characters that are part of the world probably won't give it a second look. It's just hair. I mean, in non-romanticised canon, Harry's a pretty average kid with messy hair and green eyes, who's a bit on the scrawny side. That's really all we've got -- not counting his scar, that many people are absurdly fascinated with. In that sense, scarhead makes a lot more sense than this feeble, forced wordplay.

I'd agree that children might make the joke -- maybe. Children make terrible jokes all the time. Still, I'd agree with OP that it feels forced. Not only are the vowels not the same in BE, but the stress and length of the first syllable is different, too.

Mind, I'm not an expert, but it really is a terrible joke. Yes, children might make terrible, crude jokes, but does an author have to bore us with petty inanities just because children might do them? I don't think so. I mean, just because kids might pick their nose, sniffle constantly, or talk about ponies for hours, doesn't mean we have to put that in writing, does it?

** Worth noting that this joke is made in canon at least once, when Seamus says he couldn't identify his patronus but "it was definitely really hairy, Harry!"

** Oof, how'd they all manage to pronounce it in American English in the movies then? Brits played those roles.

** In official English the difference in pronunciation is quite slight, it's very difficult for any non native RP speaker to spot. One is a diphthong and the other is a longer vowel. In casual speech they are almost indistinguishable, although easily noticed in refined speech.

But they can be noticed by a practiced ear. It's similar to the difference between man and men, but Harry/Hairy is a bit different, since it's very similar and sometimes quite difficult to spot.

Consider Harry/Hairy and Cart/Cat. On the surface the difference is exactly the same, a diphthong vs a long vowel, but nobody would ever consider a cart as a rhyme or a homophone for cat. Whereas Harry/Hairy is not out of the realm of possibility, especially for Americans and foreigners who learned RP.

** For what it's worth, this disagrees with you: [[https://www.rhymezone.com/r/rhyme.cgi?typeofrhyme=perfect&Word=harry]]

A very hairy Harry can carry sherry to any culinary dignitary.

That is all.
