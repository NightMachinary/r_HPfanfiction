I already [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l18ph9/what_are_you_reading_weekly_post/gjya82e/?context=3][commented]] on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][Battle of Wills]] but wanted to expand on it, and *I'll try not to give too much away*. It's not the best fanfic I've read but it is gripping, and it's an example of what I like about fanfiction: expanding where canon couldn't and sharpening the focus on things/feelings that we may not have registered. Technically the heart of it is a Harry/mentor Snape fic with Mind Arts but it's a nice Hogwarts ensemble piece. The battle at the DoM has just happened, and Harry has heard the prophecy.

Snape is a little watered-down and less nasty than he is in canon but that's the point, I guess. We also see his relationship with Draco and see what provokes someone to move away from Voldemort, and Snape has a good answer to the question of why Voldemort wants to kill Muggles /beyond/ just Voldemort's Muggle father and thinking Muggles are inferior.

Harry is quite canon-like. Throughout the fic I often found myself thinking ‘Harry *would* totally think/say/do that.' He dwells on Sirius's death a lot more than he does in canon. In ‘Wills' he says he misses Sirius “so much he wants to scream to the sky” which I thought was perfectly fitting. People also point out to him that he has plenty of people who care about him and would die for him, but Harry thinks about how jealous he is of Ron/Hermione having families and how some people just can't be replaced with friends. There's a poignant scene where he disappoints someone, and he thinks that he would rather be facing Death Eaters a thousand times over than enduring this disappointment-totally something Harry would think.

*Other things I liked:*

-A lot of action, exciting battle scenes.

-The Fortress of Shadows as a concept: basically a stronghold of Dark Magic where Voldemort and the Death Eaters live.

-The paternal relationship Remus has with Harry. Remus is quite good in this fic.

-Some of the humor, just the kids being kids.

-This is one of the better representations of Ron I've seen in fanfic. Yeah, he's still funny and hot-headed but he also takes on more prominent roles.

*What I didn't like:*

-The almost-deaths. There are definitely deaths. But sometimes I think ‘just make the character die already.'

-Tendencies to lapse into patterns: People tell Harry not to do something dumb/he does anyway/gets in trouble, rinse, repeat.

-He goes with a couple of others to America for a couple of chapters. I mostly skipped that part-just wasn't all that interesting to me.

-Much of the ending, but not everything is wrapped up in a bow.

It's a drama adventure story. Link here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills]]


** Thanks for this. I generally agree with your review. I was thinking about this story the other day, since it belongs to that wonderful but now often forgotten generation of completed fics that came out before the series concluded. Horcruxes really stymied a lot of fanfic creativity.

*** Oh duh, I forgot this came out before horcruxes...I think I wondered why they weren't in this fic. Think horcruxes are cool but often corny in fanfic.
