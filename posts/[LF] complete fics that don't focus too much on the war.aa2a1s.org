It can involve the conflict vs Voldi, but I enjoy reading more about relationships (and not only pairings), Harry's growth, learning about magic, etc.

I don't enjoy fight scenes, and when there's so much effort put into planning the downfall of Voldi.

No slash or crack please. As mentioned complete fics are preferred.


** This one is a non Voldemort au, which normaly I wouldn't read, but it was really fantastic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12240216/1/Rogue-s-Bet]]

This one is similar, non Voldie au, but with two characters 'switching' so to speak. Unfortunately it is incomplete, but it was only updated a few months ago, and is very close to the end. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12889172/1/But-I-Won-t-Do-That]]

Another au, with Voldemort, but the war is in the background, as the main characters spend their seventh year in the death eater controlled Hogwarts. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287138/1/To-Be-By-Your-Side]]

#+begin_quote
  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

#+begin_quote
  What if Ron was the know-it-all bookworm while Hermione was the lovable prat? In a world without Voldemort, seventh year Ron Weasley is on a mission to enjoy his last year at Hogwarts while trying to ask his crush out. Hermione Granger wants to do well for her NEWTs and ask her crush out. Can they help one another? Non-canon obviously, with some characters being OOC. Chapter 19 up.

  AU. Ron Weasley was never meant to be a Slytherin, so why did he end up in it? He's going to find out with the help of a bushy haired muggleborn, but considering she's the girlfriend of one of his brothers it's not going to be very easy. Full summ inside.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Hold on to your hats, folks, Harry has an idea. Why is Quidditch so much more than a simple game? And why would Harry not take the chance to test himself against the world's best seeker?
