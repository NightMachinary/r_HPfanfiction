** Send him to dementors for asking a question? That's pretty absurd even if Slughorn felt uncomfortable with the conversation. You also seem to be misunderstanding Tom Riddle's character and forgetting that you know more about him than the adults at the time did.

#+begin_quote
  He's indirectly responsible for the prophecy, for the deaths of Harry's parents for the ten difficult years Harry experienced
#+end_quote

On the list of people responsible for Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, who saw Tom Riddle without the mask, is much higher than Slughorn. Of the people responsible for the prophecy and Harry's dark and difficult life, Snape and Dumbledore are much higher on that list.

** I have asked my physics teacher about nukes when I was 16 or so, just out of academic interest and a morbid fascination.

My chemistry teacher made dynamite with a friend of mine, when we were like 17.

A third friend synthesized a highly poisonous substance at school, and got taught how to handle it.

Another friend of mine was really into Mercury and what you can do with it, including poisons (but mostly electronics and other chemistry)

Should we be in prison, or tortured for that?

If you're academically interested, you ask these questions - and you get answers. That's 100% realistic

*** to be fair, you won't build a nuke. Not because you don't want to, but because you won't be able to. You won't get fissile material or precise manufacturing plants or testing grounds. Nukes are big machines that make big waves even when never used.

The horcrux method, conversely, has precisely one effect on the outside world. Some random person disappearing. All it needs is murder and an object, which doesn't even have to be all that important. Like, Tom built one when he was around 16, and nobody was the wiser. If you tried to build a nuke when you were 16, you'd get picked up during the attempt to steal weapons grade uranium from a highly guarded facility.

And TNT doesn't compare, like, at all. Nukes would, but only if you could build one out of stuff in your garage as well as the tooth of a homeless man. (magic means there is no real way to find bodies, which equates the outside impact of the component to a tooth. Nobody would notice either way.)

**** The general point was just that talking about knowledge, even "dark" knowledge happens all the time -- even in the real world. And in the real world, I've seen teachers go out of their way to not only acquire knowledge, but also dangerous chemicals for curious students. Just because they asked, and it looks like they have a nice project in mind.

So that Slughorn talks about a theoretical concept once is probably neither far-fetched nor uncommon.

(Sidenode: The amount of times I've gotten an explanation like "Here you are, this is what you can do with it, and this is where it starts to become illegal" can't be counted on one hand. And I assume it's similar with dark magic in the canon universe.)

**** Ah yes, old sluggy should have thought that when Tom was discussing an odd piece of magic he discovered in the library. Which was a vial thing, he should have known he would try it. And that the boy would have the mental capabilities and resources able to. It isn't just murder and an object. If it was a lot more bad guys would have them. It is a magic which tears apart a soul, not far apart from what a dementors does. He had no reason to assume from the conversation that tom would try it, other them a bad feeling which could be attributed to discussing the gross thing.

Only years later when he knew what Voldemort became, most likely after he came back, did slughorn try to hide his mistake from even himself, what good was remembering. When people are ashamed they hide, its what they do.

Slughorn never is a chess master he is only a piece. He is never a member of the order and stays behind to protect HIS school anyway. On the other hand Dumbledore constantly PUTS the school in danger, and that is the difference.

** We realize the tom was serious when he asks slughorn that. But remember baby Voldie was a charming student and gave the appearance of being beyond reproach. Slughorn thought it was just an academic discussion at the time and this was before the books on it were removed from the shelves. He didn't alter his memories until much later. And I think the fact that he did it so poorly means he wanted it to be found later otherwise jed have done a better job

** Hindsight bias. We know Tom later becomes Voldemort when we see that conversation. If you were Slughorn, and didn't know anything about Voldemort, and your star student asks an academic question about obscure dark magic (which you were also familiar with), there's no way your reaction would be 'send him straight to the dementors'. That would be an insane overreaction given what Slughorn knew at the time, and only seems reasonable in retrospect.

** I asked a lot of questions that, under your reasoning, would've sent me to jail or to a psych ward. I was fascinated (still am to tell the truth) about the mindset of sociopaths and serial killers. I spent a lot of time reading true crime and abnormal psych books to try to make sense of it. I asked questions of science teachers and psychology teachers once we that was an available class. Humans are curious. Asking a question isn't illegal. And we don't know when Slughorn modified his memory. My reading of it was always that it was modified after he came back to Hogwarts in Harry's 6th year. So yes, by that point he knew he had been duped.

** By that logic, shouldn't Slughorn himself have been thrown in jail/the psych ward when he was young? After all, he had to learn about horcruxes from someone at some point. But then whoever told /him/ about it should also have been locked up when they were younger because /they/ asked about it....

You can see where that line of thinking leads. Also, Slughorn himself knew about horcruxes for decades and still never made one or became a genocidal dark lord. Clearly just wanting to know about them doesn't mean one is a psychopath.

** Bruh...

I asked a lot of question when I was at school. Some for academic interest, some for my morbid side and some just to create controversy and get into a fight.

Should I be put in prison, or tortured big man?

** Slughorn: answered a single, albeit disturbing, question.

Dumbledore: allowed Snape to sabotage an entire generation of students with his petty vindictiveness, which also sabotaged the wizarding world's ability to defend itself and heal its sick and injured due to a shortage of viable candidates for Aurors and Healers (Potions being a required subject for both). And why? Because he was obsessed with recreating Lily Potter's sacrificial magic which, I feel the need to point out, would only protect people from VOLDEMORT, but not his equally sadistic followers.

Dumbledore is most definitely the one who earns more criticism in my book.

**** At that point, he had let it grow stale by never using it to do anything. He was also much more powerful immediately after the end of Voldemort's first war, as evidenced by getting snape pardoned on a word. He could have used that clout to actually make positive change, but he did not
