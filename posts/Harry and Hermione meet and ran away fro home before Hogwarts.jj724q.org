I read this fic a long time ago. Harry and Hermione meet when Grangers move to Private Drive. Grangers treat Hermione as bad as Dursleys treat Harry so two ran away. Harry teaches Hermione parseltongue. They dont go to Hogwarts because They dont allow Muggleborns anymore and Dumbledore does not send an acceptance letter to Harry for some reason.


** I know RobSt gets bashed on this subreddit but they have a story Fate's Gambit linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5210983/1/Fate-s-Gambit]]) that is pre-Hogwarts, includes Luna also, that you might enjoy if you liked the fic you are describing. It has an in-Hogwarts sequel. I hope someone finds the story you are looking for - I'd like to read it.

  Fate looked on as the boy who's destined to lead the fight against the darkness was slowly being broken down until she's compelled to take action that will change his life forever. Pre-Hogwarts, friendship H/Hr/L rating is for Dursleys treatment of Harry
