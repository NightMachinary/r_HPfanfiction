We're all guilty of having that one "go to" phrase? Our 'expelliarmus' if you will.

My characters are always 'glaring'. At eachother, at the floor, at closed doors, they're always glaring at something... I'm forever editting them to be less fecking intense and starey...

(Yeah I know I used the wrong 'you're', I'M SORRY! I can't edit it...)


** Characters "gaping" at things. If anyone actually pictured the amount of gaping I include, they'd all look so dumb. I'm careful about the really common ones like "smirk" (especially) and "sneer" (to a lesser extent), but there are a handful of words that I need to make sure that I don't use more than just once a chapter (approx 9-10k words).

**** Symbolism, too. I noticed it years ago with Harry's Polyjuice Potion color being gold, but she has a post on WW on how she used alchemical color symbolism in relation to Dumbledore and Hagrid.

It's associated with perfection, purity, divinity, and fire. Gold and golden (often in combination with red) are used in relation to her heroes a lot, Harry and Dumbledore in particular. Harry tries to buy a bunch of golden things. Dumbledore had a lot of golden possessions. Everytime Harry and Voldemort dueled something gold appeared: the golden thread and the web in GoF, the burst of golden flames at the beginning of DH, and fiery gold or red gold sunlight appeared right before they dueled for the last time and golden flames when the spells connected.

Yes, my English teachers bullied us into noticing these things. How can you tell?

*** Fun fact --- it's actually a required punctuation in Russian (and other Cyrillic languages). Used mainly to indicate direct speech and separate direct from indirect in the same paragraph, but also to skip words when meaning can be derived from context (not a proper definition, sorry not a linguist). Quotation marks for direct speech were really confusing when I started reading proper books in English for the first time.

So it's like

#+begin_quote
  --- Albus, is this true?! --- asked a angry voice from the desk. --- Did you really hide my stone behind a maze three eleven-year-olds managed to solve?
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  I brought food to this picnic, you --- your appetite.

  This year will be different: not quiet, like many, --- tumultuous.
#+end_quote

I don't know why I wrote all this, hope you found it at least somewhat interesting.

** Apparently commas.

On my native language we use them a lot, for it gives the speech a more natural pace, specially in narrative.

As you can see, I don't know hot to moderate those, so what I do is to write in my main language and then use google to translate to finally correct any mistake or whatever that may sound/seem weird or out of place.

** English is not my native language, and I constantly find myself in situations where I wonder if what I've written feels natural or clumsy. Sometimes I realise that I'm translating my thoughts that are in my native language, and it results in sentence structures that I think feel strange to a native English speaker.

These are some phrases/words I find myself using very much: "then again", "of course", "however". Recently I realised that two that I don't use as much as I should are "used to [verb]", because my native language has nothing like it, and "ought to", because "should" is (I think) the exact same thing.

**** No, no, you're on the right tracks! ‚ÄòOught to' is definitely considered a much more formal construction and not one I see used very commonly.

Whilst both ‚Äòought to' and ‚Äòshould' can be used to describe an obligation or duty, ‚Äòshould' is (apparently) used to express subjective opinion. So you ‚Äòshould' treat Harry Potter better.

On the other hand, ‚Äòought to' is used when you want to express an objective truth, so what cannot be avoided.

‚ÄòHarry ought to obey the rules or he'll be expelled.'

This is why ‚Äòought to' feels stricter and more intense than should, because it's ‚Äòproper use' is one reserved for when the obligation is necessary, and the consequences therefore unavoidable. Whilst if you're telling somebody they ‚Äòshould' do something, there's that implicit sense of it being more like a suggestion than a command.

Hope that helps, even I found this a bit confusing and I'm a native speaker!

** I'm just imagining the films, business as usual, but everyone looks pissed all the time no matter the situation. But about your post, I guess mine would be doing narration (or telling) instead of writing dialogue and conversations (or showing). So I tell instead of showing. Have been updating a chapter where I could actually write conversations (because the earlier chapters were really just there to set the tone and world and cast and the main character was too young for me to write loads about him talking) and while I haven't finished doing so I already got the chapter's word count up by 400 words or so.

So I guess my move is to tell vs show when I could show if I took just a bit more time.
