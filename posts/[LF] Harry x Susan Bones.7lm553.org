  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

#+begin_quote
  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** It was already recommended, but I do suggest giving [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night][Whispers in the Night]] a shot. It's multi, but it was done in a more believable fashion than your typical wishful-thinking Harry/Harem. I liked the way Susan and Daphne were portrayed. Even though they could sensibly be interchanged at times, they had very distinct personalities. The relationship expands through a lot of semi-realistic emotional struggle. It's not exclusively based on Harry, and considers everybody involved.
