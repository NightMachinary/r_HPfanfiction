Has to at least be 75k+ words and I don't care what species the dragon is so long as he has a strong connection to it. It also has to have light fluff as a her pairing.

**** Are you sure you don't want crossovers? Because I saw some dragon-related stuff recently that had Harry run into Falkor the Luckdragon.

And I believe 'Enter the Dragon' is a really, really long unfinished idea that has Harry actually being a dragon...a goofy, silly dragon.

Caution, the second one has 130k words or so packed into one/two pages, so it might mess with mobile viewers a bit.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.
