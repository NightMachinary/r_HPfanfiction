** This isn't the fic you're looking for, but maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts][Stunning Shifts]] would be your thing?

Also, try doing a [[https://www.google.com/search?q=cho+chang+time+travel&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb#channel=sb&q=cho+chang+time+travel+site:www.fanfiction.net&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official][google search]] like this one.

** Possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers][Far Too Many Time Travelers]]? Probably abandoned but it certainly meets the requirement of a lot of people going back.
