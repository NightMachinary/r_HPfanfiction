Bonus points if it's Malfoy


** You could argue that's what happened in the third year match against Hufflepuff. Sure, Harry fainted because of the Dementors, but he was miles away from Diggory who caught the snitch even before he became aware of them. That tells me Cedric would've caught the snitch before Harry even without Dementors.

By the way, I can't see the 4 comments here for some reason, and it's only on this thread. Did you do something or is something wrong on my end?

*** Yeah, but that game ended up with Harry passed out, and when he woke up, he was focused on finding a way to keep the dementors from affecting him.

I'm more curious about getting into Harry's head for the few hours right after he loses. I'd like to see how he handles defeat when the stakes aren't life and death. He knows how to march grimly on, but Quidditch isn't the moral equivalent of fighting Voldemort, which counterintuitively means losing at Quidditch might actually throw Harry for a bigger loop.

** The Quidditch match in linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk) has this. It wasn't exactly a fair match though, which is the only way I can see this scenario happening.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
