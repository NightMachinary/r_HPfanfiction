Can't remember much of the fic. One part I remember is that Harry is high council of the alterans, when they move to Atlantis to reclaim the city, SGA allrdy started. One of the military there shoot Harry in the head, but his tech shield blocks it. This pisses the alterans off and took all alterans tech from Earth except the gate( I think?).


** Story: Avalon, Secret of the Stars [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11918161/1/Avalon-Secret-of-the-Stars]]

It's badly written, but sg fans this days have to read anything or starve to death.. With a more realistic reactions and dialogues, plus grammar and maybe sticking to the initial (and reasonable) sgc bashing it could be one of the best xovers, if only because it tries not to leave anything unsolved.

Naruto's troll emperor is and will always be the best sg crossover of any kind though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
