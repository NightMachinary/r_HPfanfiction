Just finished the 19 chapters of Deprived by The Crimson Lord and LOVED it I've seen people recommend it before but hadn't ever gone for it until now I'm going to start The French Connection by Shadow of Darkness X but I'm wondering is there are others inspired by Deprived or similar I remember one where Sirus and Remus raise Harry as a body guard for hire but didn't like that one to much. If you know any please let me know thanks!


** linkffn(Triton) is kinda similar. There are a lot of overlapping story elements at least.

  Mercenary, bounty hunter, assassin, and now apparently a bodyguard. That means having to go back to a place and deal with things I don't want to. WBWL story. Pairings as of yet are undecided. It's kind of a slow burn.
