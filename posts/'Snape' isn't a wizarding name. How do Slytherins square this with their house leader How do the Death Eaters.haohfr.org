Is Severus actually held in high regard by his peers in canon, or is he simply Voldemort's pet project who the others are warned off? Is this all a case of Rowling trying to be too clever and breaking her established worldbuilding for a parallel, or is there a canon-viable explanation? Discuss (relaxedly!)

** Reminder that Riddle also wasn't a wizarding name yet Tom did quite well for himself in Slytherin. I suppose there is a certain attitude that helps, as well as knowing your heritage. Snape knew he was halfblood so his Slytherin friends probably knew as well. Couple that with the fact that he went along with them (being okay with the bad stuff they were doing and agreeing that Muggles and Muggleborns were inferior etc.), would put Snape in a good place with them.

Also, since Snape was well-acquainted with Lucius Malfoy, that certainly helped his standing among the prejudiced Purebloods. That's at least my take on it :)

** Snape may not be a fancy noble name, but he's still a Death Eater. And all his pureblooded students must know that.

Half-bloods are an interesting case in that, really, they can go either way in the scheme of things. Harry is considered a half-blood despite having two magical parents because his mother is Muggleborn, but I'd venture to say some would consider him a "less tainted" form of half-blood. Snape, however, has a Muggle parent, but from what we know about his father he's probably Not A Great Guy™, and so Snape likely denounced him early on.

I believe canonically, Lucius is welcoming to Snape in his school years, so he may have facilitated a transition of respect between other Slytherins. I expect his extreme talent for Potions and spellcraft also recommended him as someone who was useful.

That says, I don't really think Snape was a man who was "respected" so to speak... I'd say, among his peers, he was more a man to be feared.

** In canon, half-bloods appear to be treated very differently depending on whether or not they are willing to pay lip-service to pure-blood ideology. So you have Snape playing up his Prince heritage in order to fit in.

In fanfiction (and specifically, Victoria Potter), I have it so that there are different schools of thought on what it means to be pure-blood. This is primarily addressed in Victoria's conversation with Dumbledore in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13795605/chapters/46935919][chapter 19]] but I also made this handy cheat sheet:

** Slytherin is the house of the resourceful, cunning and ambitious.

The pureblood thing is practically irrelevant except when it serves their ambitions.

A clever, mean kid such as Snape would be considered a valuable resource, so people like Lucius Malfoy, or Narcissa Black, would overlook his blood status to get him as a resource of their own.

The Slytherin table cheers for its new students at the Sorting in the same way the other houses do - I suspect the Slytherins watch the new intake closely to see who's going to be valuable, then they'll make sure those who do turn out to be clever, powerful, etc. are in their debt.

** At the risk of being downvoted for mentioning the Story-that-must-not-be-named, I'll raise the theory that Professor Dumbledore deliberately installed a Head of Slytherin House who would not have their respect, as part of a long-term strategy to weaken and remove the house.

#+begin_quote
  "Look at it from Dumbledore's perspective, and remember that he has no native understanding of Slytherin's ways. Think of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts House that seems the source of so much ill-doing. And then behold, Dumbledore puts in as Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape! Severus Snape! A man who would teach his House neither cunning nor ambition, a man who would impose lax discipline and make its children weak! A man who would offend students of other Houses, who would ruin Slytherin's name among them! A man whose surname was unknown in magical Britain and certainly not noble, who went about half in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence? When Dumbledore was the one who brought it about, and had motive to bring it about? I expect Dumbledore told himself that more lives would be saved during the next Wizarding War if Voldemort's future Death Eaters were weakened. Continue the process long enough, and no child would want to go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat kept calling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among children who would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses. From that day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of courage and scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children added to the mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had been wise enough in the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their company. That, I expect, was Dumbledore's intended end-game; a short-term sacrifice for the greater good."

********* Copy-pasting an old comment of mine, posted to another fanfic subredddit:

From an objective standpoint, it's well-written for a fanfic. However, in many ways it comes off as rather disrespectful to the series. For easy readability, I'll put this in bulletpoints too.

- Many of the themes of Harry Potter has been thrown out the window, and instead replaced with the author's personal viewpoints.

- The author has said that he based Harry's knowledge (and thus, to a certain extent, his personality) off of himself as an 18-year old. This means that his Harry /doesn't feel like Harry at all/. Of the fanfic fandoms I read, Worm is the only one where SIs are "accepted", and while Harry is often interpreted in many, /many/ different ways in HP fics, LessWrong doesn't even seem to bother trying to emulate Harry, instead, as said before, just shaping "Harry" in his own image. I've seen the term TINO (Taylor in name only) mentioned with regard to Worm fics, and HPMOR is certainly a case of Harry in name only.

- The author uses some tricks, if that's the right word, to make it seem as if his viewpoints are the "correct" ones. I'll reference something that happens somewhat around midway in the story here, so if you plan on reading it, you might want to skip this. [[#s][spoiler]]

- Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. That's Harry's full name in the fic. It's a knee-jerk reaction, sure, but the HP fanfic fandom has... issues with Harry's name being made overly fancy. Part of this is that a great, great amount of Harry Potter fics are utterly terrible, and one of the stock "badfics" is that Harry finds out that he's the heir to numerous families, typically those of the founders, as well as a few ones the author thought would be neat. Oh, and let's make him Merlin's descendant too, while we're at it! Due to this, most of the well-read, if that word can be applied to fanfics, readers will be very, very leery of Harry having a hyphenated last name.

- HPMOR treats magic as some enigma that can be solved through scientific methods. Trying to delve deeper into magic is something I love seeing done well. Black Pawn (currently found over on SB), and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (found at darklordpotter) are shining examples of this, in my opinion. Magic is treated with respect, with the characters spending much of their time researching or experimenting with magic, trying to gain a deeper understanding of the mysteries of magic. HPMOR, while it has some interesting thoughts, does not do this well. LessWrong brings in scientific principles, and makes the utilization of them lead to discoveries of magic.

- HJPEV is often made seem smart by making other characters appear dumb. An example is Harry meeting Hermione in the train. It's in chapter 8, and since it's their first interaction, I don't feel the need to put it in a spoiler, so go ahead and skip the rest of this paragraph. "... With your encyclopedic memory added to my intelligence and rationality, ..." This implies that Hermione is less intelligent than HJPEV. What happens after that is that Hermione does what HJPEV himself calls a textbook scientific analysis, but fails to test for negatives. Keep in mind, this Hermione isn't canon Hermione, but rather one that's been made smarter as well. I have seen a Harry that's smarter than Hermione pulled off well, but it's very, very hard to do properly, as it will often just look like an intellectual version of the Worf Effect.

- The characters are all wildly OOC. I don't think that there's a single authentic 11-year old in the story, and the adults should not take the main cast remotely as seriously as they do. As I remarked in my original post, the first HP books were written for children, which meant that the staff stepping in and solving the problems would hardly have sold much. However, for a writer who prides himself on "rationality", such a thing should not have happened. Age the main cast up to 16, or better yet, 18, instead of having 11- and 12-year old children behaving way older than they are, and being taken seriously by the staff.

There are other things as well. I'm sure that many [[/r/HPfanfiction/]] would love the opportunity to rant about it (with myself falling into that category), so if you'd like more, a quick post over there would likely get you even more.

********** Some of those points are debatable, but I'll instead just point out some of the objective good writing you mentioned :).

- It's long, about equivalent to the first five books of canon. Of course, sometimes people want to read something quickly, but in general, if you're enjoying something, then more of it is a positive thing.
- It's complete. So many excellent stories are not finished and may never be (I live in hope of the continuation of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), but this one is done. It even has fan sequels that are also complete.
- It has /very/ few spelling and grammar errors. Not none, but as someone who has spent a lot of time proofreading long stories, I can attest that it reads like it's already had multiple editing passes (perhaps it has).
- It's funny. Everyone's sense of humour is different, of course, so it's possible that someone might not enjoy this style, but making readers laugh is still a strength of the story.
- All characters have both strengths and flaws. No one is always right nor always wrong. On a related note, the story doesn't bash any character; probably the closest is that Harry doesn't initially have any respect for Ron - who later goes on to show him up, playing a key role in Harry's defeat in the first mock battle.
- It's challenging for the protagonist. His plans run into difficulties and either outright fail or require substantial revision. His successes turn out to be foolhardy or otherwise two-edged. His failures have serious implications, and when he looks back at the end of the year, he realises that he came within a hair's breadth of literally destroying the planet by publishing too much information to the world, which would have resulted in /someone/ making the magical equivalent of a nuclear weapon in their garage.

The fact is it seems that being a half-blood only matters if you're on the wrong side, perhaps being from an otherwise pure line helps, but I suspect it's really just that a taste for the dark arts and willingness to curse muggleborns is enough to overlook any minor details.
