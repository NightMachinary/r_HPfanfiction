:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello everyone, first post here. I was reading a fic a few months ago and I can't seem to find it again. So I'm asking for a bit of help here.

It was Hermione centric. She was captured (I don't remember if it was after the ministry/malfoy manor/if it's a voldemort wins kind of stuff). However she was kept at the Lestrange, mostly Rodolphus/Rabastan.

I don't really remember anything, there was a few interactions with Voldemort, one where she mocked his muggle father and then was sent to Malfoy manor as a punishment. She was kind of a hostage I believe. Honnestly this is driving me crazy. And I think it was on AO3.

Thanks for your help!
