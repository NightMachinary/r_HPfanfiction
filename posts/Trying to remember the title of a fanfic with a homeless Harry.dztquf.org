:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry was living on the streets, found by Mr Weasley while he was staying in an abandoned building, him and Ron were grabbed by Pettigrew from the Burrow. Pretty sure it was completed probably years ago now.

Been trying the search tools on fanfiction.net to try and find it, but at this point, I'm wondering if I suck at search or if it has been removed from the site.

*Edit* - So found out why I never found it. The story was never finished. Whoops.\\

*** Yeah. Never fun when that happens. Found many I've enjoyed over the years that just stop getting updated.
