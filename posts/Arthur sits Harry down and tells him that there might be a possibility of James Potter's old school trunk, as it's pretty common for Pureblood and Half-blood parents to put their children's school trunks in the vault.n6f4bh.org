*** And given that it's James, his Death Eater Disposal Kit (DEDKIT) shares more in common with Kevin McAllister's arsenal from Home Alone than, say, anyone else in the Wizarding World.

"Item 1: toy truck."

"Right. Enchanted?"

"Yeah, to explode on sensing a Dark Mark."

"Wow, go Dad. What's next?"

"Item number 2-a length of rope. It's electric."

"Okay. Why?"

"Probably easier to strangle people if they're too busy being electrocuted to fight back. Which brings us to item 3: a fire breathing porcelain doll."

"A what?"

"I know, right? Item 4: a train set."

"Well that sounds normal-"

"Includes 3 200 milimetre railway artillery guns whose shot expands to full size after firing."

"... What the hell dad?"

"And finally, items 5 through to 10: five faithful replications of a B52 strategic bomber, right down to payload. Items 11 to 16 are a flight of English Electric Lightnings, again extremely lifelike."

"..."

"I'll be honest mate, I want to take all these toys for a spin."

**** If you don't mind me expanding on this, then here's my entries:

Items 17 to 20 are extremely faithful recreations of the US Navy battleships /Iowa/, /New Jersey/, /Missouri/, and /Wisconsin/, who's guns (yes, /all of them/) have the same effect as the railway gun. And the best thing? They're controlled via your thoughts, and as long as the ship(s) are in range of the target, all you have to do is think of them shelling it and they will.

Item 21 is a special one; a model of Ohio-class Ballistic Missile Submarine /Wyoming/, with the same controls as the battleships, except it fires /real nukes/, and you choose between miniature nukes (which are about the size of a .50 caliber bullet) or a full sized nuke.

Item 22 is a model of Thomas the Tank Engine; which, through the power of magic, has been given sentience. The thing is, so long as it is given permission (as to prevent accidents), it will act as a mini-commander for the railway gun, the planes, and the ships, giving you an easy way to kill behind enemy lines that most will never suspect. (and it can tow the railway gun, so assassinations are super duper easy)

** The trunk is there and inside Harry finds some rotten sweets, some good photos and a pair of old unwashed knickers from his mother.

** Harry opens it up to find indy!James inside a massive 500 room castle-chateau, radiating with so much power that lasers are constantly shooting out of his eyes and he is passively levitating at all times. He is training endlessly in dueling stances with sixteen time turners swinging from his neck, while magical clones of Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix Black put on a triplet strip-tease in the background, moaning erotically and swinging their legs around like Bayonetta during a cut scene.

He slowly closes the trunk and re-locks it. He maintains, until his dying day, that his father died on the same night his mother did, valiantly trying to defend him from Lord Voldemort.

Some things are better left under lock and key.

** Has a ton of books that weren't in the curriculum, most on the Transfiguration and Defense, a few stolen Auror training manuals, his fathers Journal from ages 14-20 and a List of students James suspects of being or being connected to Death Eaters
