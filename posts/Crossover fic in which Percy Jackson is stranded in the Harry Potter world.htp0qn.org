I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13560384][Of Magic and of Might by chocolateowl]] and loved it!

Then found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221534][Percy Jackson and the world of magic by I'mjusttryingtofindmyway]] which follows a similar premise but wasn't really for me (the writing style kinda threw me off).

Any other suggestions are very much appreciated! Thank you!

  There's a crazy sword-slinging person who had just killed a dementor, and all Harry wanted to do was to prepare for Voldemort's rise to power, not argue with the stranger that it was a wand in his hand, not a stick. Of course, Sword kid had to be an exchange student at Hogwarts... but something had felt off this year. Something had changed... and it had to do with the new student.

  In the battle against Kronos Percy the thrown back in time to 1994. Unable to even step foot in America as not risk damaging time itself he is exiled to UK, but all is not lost as he finds a world to hide away in, a world to live in. A world of magic. The wizarding world won't know what hit it.
