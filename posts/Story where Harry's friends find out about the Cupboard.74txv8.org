So I've been craving a fic that looks more deeply into the abuse Harry suffered and how it affects him, personally.

I wish his time at the Dursley's wasn't dismissed in favour of other sub plots. It's touched on sometimes but not enough in my opinion.

Also, Ron and Hermione with other characters (Sirius and Remus are an option) I expect end up finding out Harry slept in a cupboard etc.

Are there good, preferably completed versions of this kind of plot? Any suggestions/links are much appreciated.

I do read on fanfiction but I prefer A03 for the 'entire story' button. :)

Well... it's not touched on, because it's very tricky.

The "orphan raised by mistreating relatives" is an old British literary tradition. At its core, the trope was used to generate sympathy for the protagonist and provide context for why they are interesting - adversity breeds character and so on.

If a story should utilise Harry's abusive childhood more, how much further should it go? Through the books he continuously demonstrates a casual disregard to his safety, a lack of social skills, a willingness to leap into danger, a sarcastic and defensive outlook.

If you fully deconstruct his upbringing, where do you go?

My personal opinion is, you go to a very dark place. The cupboard, horrifying as it is, isn't the worst part - if Harry had been raised in an orphanage, facing that sort of behavior along with other children, he would at least have a sense of camaraderie to fall back on - the worst part is that, as all that horrible shit was happening to him, another child in his home was being raised as a prince. That fact alone, with day after day of unjust punishment coupled with unworthy reward for his cousin, would lead to extreme feelings of unworthiness and loneliness and later on, bitterness and hatred.

I'm not an abuse victim or a child psychiatrist. I do think it's logical, that after this sort of treatment for ten years the consequences to Harry's mind would have been far graver than what was showcased in canon. Sociopathic tendencies, self-harming, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts are only some of the probable consequences.

JK sidestepped the problem by making the consequences as mild as possible. She added a comic element, that was even more visible in the movies.

So, in essence, using this thing in a story is kinda self-defeating - unless you're making the story exclusively about child abuse. Few people like reading about it. Few people (fortunately) know enough about it to write fiction featuring it competently.

*** That comment is true, my main problem was no one doing enough to take Harry away from the Dursleys. I didn't very much like the side stepping, and yes it definitely screams the 'sympathetic backstory' trope so I was rather hoping for the consequences to be explored further.

I don't particularly LIKE reading such a topic, I'm not sure how to explain my preference for stories that don't sugar coat things in published work and fanfiction alike. I guess that's why I prefer, for example Jessica Jones to the Avengers (I still like it, but feel like their messages especially in age of ultron feel a bit ham fisted).

Well, the obvious answer is, no one gave a shit. McGonagall allowed her objection ("the worst sort of muggles!") to be curbed with one sentence from Dumbledore. Lupin cheerfully ignored his obligations until he was forced to come back. The Order only intervened with the Dursleys after the Voldemort situation became critical. So, yeah, except for Sirius, no one else really gave a fuck.

The only fic I've read that dealt with Harry's abuse competently is linkffn(Catechism by Dreamfall). It is maddeningly well written and disturbing beyond rational thought. I never could read more than one chapter at a time. It remains the only story I seriously considered reporting to the admins.

***** Lupin was in his early 20s, lost the 3 people closest to him in one night, pretty much didn't have anyone else, and was dealing with a dangerous condition that still scared him when Teddy was born over a decade later. I doubt he was in any position to take good care of himself, let alone a baby.

But back to what I hate about the Lupin stuff. Let's stop a sec and pretend that he was /willing/ to take care of Harry. Now we've got someone who has to leave baby Harry unattended for an entire night once a month and if Lupin fucks up whatever precautions he takes /even once/ then Harry's dead.

*** I agree with what you've said, except for the end. Considering how many stories have been rec'ed here, there is an audience for stories about child abuse. I've only read one of them, but I'm going to assume the rest have been rec'ed because they deal with that tough issue.

It is hard to take a story to that dark place and do it well, but it doesn't have to be as horrible as you're suggesting. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/747438/SensiblyTainted][SensiblyTainted]] writes abused Harry fics that deal with the darker aspects of Harry's child abuse. They are one of the only authors I've seen who has actually made the abuse worse than in canon without descending into an insensitive portrayal where he miraculously overcomes even worse odds in no time at all. In one, Harry develops multiple personality disorder. In another, he has a barely held together shattered mind (as visualized through legilimency), resulting in extremely submissive behavior with non-existent self-esteem. The stories are dark and tragic, but also hopeful, with moments of fluff and humor to balance them out. And given the number of followers the author has on FFN and AO3, it's something a fair amount of people seek out, despite the depressing topic.

I would say that child abuse is perhaps more common than you think. There are many degrees of it, and most people just don't go about telling everyone they meet that they've been abused. For those people (although not only just they can enjoy the stories), reading about abuse can be therapeutic.

** This isn't exactly what you've asked for, but it is the absolute best fic I've seen when it comes to tackling Harry's abuse. Severitus with a believable redemption, not some instant makeover into a kind or misunderstood man. Dumbledore meddling a little in a non-bashing way, where he's shown to want the best for everyone, but makes mistakes along the way and owns up to them. Canon bending at its best instead of the same old rehashing.

Best of all is the very realistic way Harry's abuse is dealt with. He doesn't instantly get better as soon as he gets a caring guardian. He works to move past his issues and like in real life, meets with difficulty along the way.

So while I don't believe Harry's friends find out about his abuse like you requested, it does fit the desire for a story that deals with abuse. And in lieu of his friends finding out, his teachers and the Weasley parents find out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/Harry-s-First-Detention][Harry's First Detention]] by kbinnz is the short story prequel.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/Harry-s-New-Home][Harry's New Home]] is the long sequel.

Both are gen!fics.

** linkffn(A Hero by Celebony) and linkffn (Claustrophobia by Celebony) Both are all over this, though relatively short. linkao3(Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd) is one of my favorite stories ever.

linkao3(Blood Magic by Gateway Girl) is really brilliant, but the abuse bit is more in the beginning then gets to other (equally good) subplots

linkao3(Snape's Memories by Paganaidd) and linkao3(Dudley's Memories) has some great interactions between Harry and Dudley as adults

linkao3(Far Beyond a Promise Kept by oliversnape) is a gem, and a shade more upbeat than the others I've listed.

linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) is an old favorite of mine as well, strongly recommend anything by the author

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** My interpretation has always been that Lily's sacrifice, potent enough to subsist in Harry's blood, must have also gifted him with emotional balance to survive the Dursleys. Early on, it's remarked that Harry always knew that his parents loved him. This seems to me more than simple intuition - a part of his mother's love is literally within him.

After all, why is it that Tom Riddle turned to cruelty and evil as as a young child, while Harry never did? Well, we could go with some kind of genetic determinism, but that's hardly a message I think Rowling would have suggested. The likeliest answer is, Harry was gifted with the magic of love and sacrifice. Being morally evil is, by all accounts, completely inconceivable to him - he doesn't even hate his relatives.

*** While I don't believe that Lily's sacrifice forced Harry to be a good person, I also always thought it's what kept him relatively mentally healthy while growing up with the Dursley's. In fact for a long time I thought it was mentioned explicitly in canon, but on a re-read I discovered Dumbledore merely gives the barest hint at it. So while it's up for interpretation, I think it's highly likely that his mother's love being what kept him relatively happy and healthy at the Dursley's was intended by Rowling. (hope that makes sense, the last sentence gave me trouble lmao)

  Well, we could go with some kind of genetic determinism, but that's hardly a message I think Rowling would have suggested. The likeliest answer is, Harry was gifted with the magic of love and sacrifice. Being morally evil is, by all accounts, completely inconceivable to him - he doesn't even hate his relatives.
#+end_quote

Wait, you don't like the message that Harry might be an inherently good person who doesn't fall for evil no matter his upbringing, but the idea that some kind of magical gift (moral enslavement?) by his mother basically forces him to be good no matter what happens to him, is somehow better? Excuse me?

I'd rather take the "genetic determinism" please.. a person who can conceive of evil, but decides against it seems a bit more uplifting than some kind of puppet who has no choice than to be good.

**** But don't you think that could make a good story. A story that takes this moral enslavement and builds upon how it interacts with his life and such would be an interesting and fresh story to read.

I completely agree about the genetic determinism. I prefer being predisposed towards one thing and being able to change myself rather than being bound to think morally. The magical gift might as well be Harry getting killed and being taken over a happy and naive (no hate) gift or whatever.

At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
