** Er, I don't think The Boy Who Lived should even be in the conversation for "best written". However, saying that has nothing to do with how good or bad it is (which I am refraining from). There's plenty of grammar mistakes in it, a few typos which somehow made it past 5 betas, and some general sloppiness at times, all stuff that relates to raw quality.

*** I won't try and speak for other readers, I'll just explain why I enjoyed it so much.

First, my ideal fanfic includes a dark/gray and powerful Harry who is shipped with another dark/gray character. Second, I can't stand fics where Harry and his ship instantly bond and have feelings for one another, I usually can't make it passed the first few chapters of those stories. Third I enjoy any story that can introduce OC's or a new world. BWL does all three of these well imo.

Lastly, and this is specific to BWL, I feel that Santi did an amazing job of keeping the reader on their toes trying to guess the character's true motives. With most fanfiction authors I can usually guess what the characters are going to do and what is going to happen in the story. While reading BWL I enjoyed the second guessing that I would do every time something new was revealed about Calypso.

While I admit this was one of the first fanfics that I read and have since read dozens, I find it very hard to recapture the feeling I had while reading the BWL. I distinctly remember not wanting to put my iPad down at night because Santi left me wanting to know what was going to happen in the next chapter.

*** I forgot about Stages of Hope. It was extremely well written and the author did an amazing job of making the reader become emotionally attached to his versions of Harry and Hermione.

I absolutely loved The Sum of Their Parts up until the last chapter, the ending felt so rushed to me, I feel like it needed somewhere between 3-6 chapters to properly close out the story. My guess was always that something came up in the authors real life and they didn't want to abandon the story, which is some consolation.

As for the other two, I never read incomplete or abandoned stories, I have the Changeling marked as one to read once it's finished and the third part of BWP is abandoned so I won't be reading the first two.

*** I don't really think bwp is particularly well writtn. It's GREAT to see ron/ginny in a timetravel fic, but i gave up halfway through. I don't want or need "harry kills voldemort in a week " fics - which is how the author defends it - but he made everyone involved into real idiots. Their halfbaked plans keep backfiring and harry, for reasons I can t get into, forgets his invisibility cloak at one point. Just leaves it on the ground. I can deal with the weird treatment of the weasleys since their timetravel affected things. It's the agonising stupidity of the characters that gets me. I dunno, I couldn't take it anymore after a while. It's a shame, therr's some cool hints at future conflict with umbridge and stuff, but ymmv, definitely.

Second: The non traditional "Emperor" by Marquis Black. This is super AU HPFF. So AU it could honestly be its own story separate from any HP connection. But its worth a look. linkffn(5904185)

Also cant forget about Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Not the best writing per say, but the quality level of the story itself and background is very high. [[http://hpmor.com/]]

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

**** What makes you say that Emperor is well-written? You could take a butcher's knife to it and make it better. And it's inconsistent. There's a fair number of infodumps throughout and a ridiculous number of characters, which kills the pacing sometimes. Granted, I wouldn't say it's outright badly written, but imo it's certainly not in the running for highest quality.

***** Seconding this. Emperor is so bad. It's indescribable, really. The author somehow found a way to make magical war boring. I checked out about 3/8ths of the way through when I realized I was just skimming the cliche boring bits to get to the action, then skimming the action to get back to the plot.

Also I'm really not a fan of the Edgy Assassin Femme Fatale trope, which iirc features pretty heavily after a while.

**** I tried getting into I'm Still Here, but after the chapter long description of Iris (Think that was her name, the Fem!Harry) and Hermione's friendship at Hogwarts, where it was basically just a rehash of canon Harry's adventures and which we were already told about a chapter before, I couldn't get into it. Especially not when the author randomly threw in Ron bashing and decided to call that long chapter a 'brief' description of events.

Emperor is amazing, though.

** My favourite now is Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) and not because of grammar (English is not my first language so not sure how well it is written) but because the plot is very interesting and it also includes grey Harry. The plot may seem cliché but I promise, it's so much better! It's totally worth reading. I consider it a high quality fic because there is no bashing, it is logical, it doesn't follow canon at every turn, and, although the main plot idea with the wrong BWL is overused, all the other things are really original and well-written.

** I'm an unapologetic Snape fan, but I have to say that the writing in this story is powerful and in character enough for anyone to enjoy. It's the kind of story that made me Feel deeply. I hope it does the same for you.

** I'll nominate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20).

It dives into humor enough to be called a humor fic, but it's also pretty serious. It is one of the few fics I've read that gives agency to a wide range of characters -- Draco, Lucius, Bellatrix, Snape, the main OC, Voldemort, the Muggle OCs, they all have their own plans that they try to advance, piling up on each other.

The writing quality is good enough not to distract me, which is what I mainly seek.

The main character doesn't crowd out their supporting allies too much. Harry's pushed to the background, which I personally appreciate, while Hermione is the straight person and the voice of common sense.

The production quality is pretty good -- low on misspellings, malapropisms, missing punctuation, etc.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
