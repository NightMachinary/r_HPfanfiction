:END:
hey! i read a sirius black fanfiction a while ago. a girl gets sucked into the harry potter books (into the marauders era) and ends up falling in love with sirius black. she's read the books but can't tell anyone that she knows what's going to happen (because she's under a curse) but she ends up breaking the curse to save sirius from bellatrix because she loves him. does anyone know this fic?
