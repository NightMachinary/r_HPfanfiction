** A nice variation on a theme by limiting it to uncommon tropes, ruling out all the usual Goblin-Lordships-manip!Dumbledore stuff.

- Wizards using guns. You don't see it all that often - even in most Mugglewank fics, it's all talk no action. But it's an instant red-X whenever I come across it.

- "I love being a Veela" Fleur. The most common annoying Fleur trope is that she's all very "woe is me, being a Veela is tough because of all the unwanted attention and jealousy". However, more rare but equally annoying is the "Woe is everyone else, I love being a Veela and everyone else just needs to deal with how fabulous I am" Fleur. The problem is that it's still reducing Fleur's characterisation to "I'm a Veela" when in fact in canon all indications are that she doesn't consider herself a Veela at all, but as a witch who just so happens to have some Veela blood. The only good Fleur characterisation is a Fleur who considers herself a /person/, not a walking racial stereotype.

- RPG Trio. That is, Harry, Ron, and Hermione each having their own specialisations like they're job classes from an RPG system. Inevitably Hermione being the "great with theory, bad at practical" scholar type and Harry being the "great at casting spells but dumb as a brick" type. Which just completely goes against everything we know about the HP magic system where ability with magic is closely tied with your magical education.

** Some of those are rare tropes, others I just don't often encounter bc those are not the fics I read.

1. Harry having multiple Animagus forms. It just really irks me.

2. Also time turners working the way they do in Cursed Child.

3. Playing up the abuse Harry suffered from the Dursleys, especially Vernon sexually abusing Harry. I get it if you want to make a point and exaggerate some things, which I don't mind if it serves a purpose, but what happened in canon was bad enough. And even if you write a fic in which Harry joins the "dark side" and you want him to hate Muggles, you don't have to go down that rabbit hole. I've read excellent fics, in which the reasoning for Harry hating/disliking Muggles was based on a much more rational/more thought out explanation than a scene about him almost dying in his locked up room after being raped by Vernon.

4. Bashing to the extreme is just not my thing. If it's well done and the characterizations make sense I don't mind it

5. (Elaboration on point 4) Dumbledore evilly popped a lemon drop into his mouth, while he thought about his evil plans to use Harry

6. Supersmart Harry, which at age 11 has him act like an adult (without timetravel which would explain it)

7. Overall Lord!Harry tropes are my guilty pleasure but Lord Harry Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin is a tad too much

*** omg yes. I think bashing is fine if its needed for the story, I do like some drama, but it gets more annoying when it's something that a character would never do in canon, because it's just unrealistic. Some authors, instead of perhaps enhancing their character's flaws, magnify them to the 1000th power where it is no longer even a little believable.

** Snape and Malfoy and other nasty pieces of work are just misunderstood, actually, though I wouldn't say it's an uncommon trope. I do enjoy a good redemption arc, especially for Snape, but not if all misdeeds are just waved away or rationalized. No, Snape wasn't cruel to students because he had to keep his cover; he was just an abusive asshole who never grew up. No, he didn't bully Neville because he was the other child of prophecy and if he'd been targeted Lily would have lived. Even if that were true it wouldn't justify abusing a defenseless child. And don't get me started on fics that have Harry apologize to Snape for their disastrous Occlumency lessons. Harry was pretty much set up to fail, and the blame lies on Snape for violating him time and again and teaching him exactly nothing, and Dumbledore for being withholding and leaving Harry to flounder.
