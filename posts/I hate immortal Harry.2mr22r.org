I read an immortal Harry fic months ago that was a cross over with Buffy and the ending broke my heart and still keeps me up at night. (Don't know the name off the top of my head) and I just finished another one.

I don't want Harry to be truly immortal (vampire, etc ones where if enough damage like a chopped off head would result in death are ok) but to know that he could never ever find that release of death whether it is to the afterlife or nothing makes my heart hurt. Literally my chest hurts for this fictitious character that has now found himself seeing all of his loved ones dying over and over again. I would hate that. The stories are really well done but I can't read them. Which sucks cuz there are a lot of great stories out there where he is immortal.

Just thought you ought to know


** A lot of people romanticize this notion that immortality is actually a curse, in which you have to see your loved ones die over and over again, unable to help yourself.

This is stupid. Immortality is awesome (given relative health and youth is maintained). Anyone who thinks otherwise is too influenced by religious literature that spawned the notion that death is a blessing.

*** I dunno, I would not want to live forever, and I don't believe in an afterlife. One of my siblings thinks that immortality would be awesome, to keep learning and seeing what humanity does etc, but i just couldn't imagine lol. Different strokes I guess!

At what point would you say your desire to die would outstrip your desire to live?

******* For me I imagine it would be around the point when I looked up and noticed that the Sun had turned Red and I was the only human being left that was even vaguely human looking.

Once I sobered up I'd probably wonder how I'd forgotten about leaving Earth.

But seriously... heat death of the universe is not something I'd want to experience personally as an otherwise vanilla mortal human that just can't seem to manage to kick it.

******* Probably when I am unable to take care of myself. I have no desire to die of course lol, not right now. But at some point in my life I will be so old or sick that I need someone to change my diapers and feed me and roll me over. When I am in so much pain that cannot be cured via medicine or surgery (think incurable cancer etc) I would like to die.

******** That is not immortality.

You are young. You are healthy. Your mind and sanity maintains its regular course for all eternity.

When do you choose to die?

It seems to me that you never considered what it truly means to live forever, before declaring that it is not something up your alley. Take the time to really consider what it might mean to be immortal, and then reconsider your position.

*** This is the Buffy one. This is the one that every time I read the ending I tear up!

This is a Bones crossover. It is quite silly though. But still an immortal Harry.

** While I do admit that this kind of story is not always good (mostly because there is only so much story), the good immortal Harry is when we take a story set in the future and have Harry live to the story time. Times loops are also cool (ie. Harry is thrown waaaay in the past and has to catch up).

*** I don't think I have read one where he has to live to catch up! Except for one where he is turned into a vampire. But then he can die in the end (and plans on it)

Why do people insist on seeing immortality this way? How about "found himself finding more and more loved ones for all eternity"... and that's not even counting ability to eventually partake and experience an endless iteration and evolution of creativity of other sentient beings.

*** There is that...but I have lost many loved ones over the years and it makes me sad. They have mostly been older with two exceptions where they were young and that is hard. While I don't have children, I have nieces and nephews that, if i were to see them die, would probably ruin me for a long time (I am very very close with my family). From my understanding a parent never gets over the pain of loosing a child. No matter how many they have. But I am also a very empathetic person, hence the reason I feel so much when I read some of these stories! :)
