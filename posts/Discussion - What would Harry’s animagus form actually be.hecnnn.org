I've seen a fair few animals for Harry during my time reading fanfictions, from the fairly normal ones like dog, bird, cat, etc. To the over the top (and not possible in canon I think) magical creatures like dragon, unicorn, phoenix, basilisk, thestral, etc.

Some are more plausible than others when they're explained. Bird because Harry likes to fly. Dog (or wolf if you want to be more edgy) because Harry is super loyal to his friends and family. Stag because of James and patronus.

My question for you is, what is the best explanation for Harry's animagus form you have read, and if it's not the same, what is your favourite or head canon for his animal?


** I like a Mongoose animagus form for Harry, since it fits his inherently antagonism against Slytherins/Voldemort.

** I remember one fanfic which took an interesting take on him being a phoenix animagus. He acquires the form of a phoenix, but none of the abilities of one, beyond the flight that any bird can accomplish.

Personally, I'm fond of the idea of him having a bird animagus form generally, so much so that I tend to find it a little off when he doesn't have one. I personally lean towards him being a Rook, a clever bird from Scandinavia with black feathers.

** I, too, am fond of the idea of a bird animagus form. As alternatives a flying insect or maybe even a bat could work as well. The former has the bonus that he can spy on people while he's unnoticeable while the latter have poor eye sight just like Harry with the added bonus that he can spread the corona virus and become the boy-who-caused-a-pandemic.

** I've always viewed the Patronus as representing what you define yourself by, and the animagus form as representing your core traits. Hence why a Patronus can change and an animagus form cannot.

So it could be a stag, but it's just as likely not.

I would like to think he would be some kind of bird of prey though, it fits flying and being a Seeker, along with his combative abilities and aggressiveness.
