So the basic premise is that the SI turns up in January of '82 and for the next 7 years publishes the harry potter books in either the muggle or magical world. what do you think the consequences would be.


** after the submission of the first book to a muggle publishing house the SI and all others involved are swiftly detained and obliviated by ministry watchdogs. the book contains many sensitive statute-violating details. if he is legellimized (what is the proper verb for this?) and they believe that SI is not simply mad then they suck SI's brain for all the knowledge SI has and then obliviate them.

conversely, the submission to magical publishing houses are rejected outright due to the books spending too much time on the (to the wizarding world) dull and prosaic details of harry's magical life. itd be like writing a muggle book about harry's trip to the DMV

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
