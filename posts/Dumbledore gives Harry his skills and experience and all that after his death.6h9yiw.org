** I feel like I should also mention linkffn(In Light of Silver Memories by Taliath) whose general idea prompted Taure's brilliant /The One He Feared/.

**** It had to be. In an alternate universe that fic was finished and the community collectively decided it was so good that nothing else was ever posted again.

***** Come on. Let's not exaggerate. Especially when the reason Taure abandoned it was because...too many people told him to continue it.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
