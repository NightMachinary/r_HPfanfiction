Not looking for something where they end up shipped together /per se/, although I certainly wouldn't object to it. Mainly, though, what's crossed my mind the last few days is how satisfying a resolution it would have been for a scene in HBP where Harry sits down with Cho and tells her that he now knows what her grief must have felt like the previous year. If the scene takes place later on than HBP, that will work very nicely too - I just want to see Harry offering her the apology she deserved but never got.

Admittedly, such a scene may be unrealistic in depicting both how quickly Harry matures during series canon and how much he opens up to other people. That said, a scene like this would also be a nice way to tie back in after Sirius's death to his earlier statement that "a lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen", and would allow Harry a chance to reflect on how he himself could have been better at that very same age.


** Since this is a prompt as well...

As sympathetic as I am to Cho, deserved is a very strong word to use and it's not like she was anymore understanding of Harry.

Harry's delivery was terrible when it came to telling her he had to meet Hermione, but not only did Cho try to use a previous date at Madam Puddifoot's with Cedric to make Harry jealous she tried to have a discussion about his death. When he refused she made a scene.

They were both insufferable, grief-stricken teenagers and neither is really (more) deserving of an apology from the other.

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

**** To be fair, Cho /does/ try offering up an apology / explanation in OotP, but Harry's not of a mind to listen to it - and her attempt at good will pretty much gets derailed once he snaps "Don't start crying again!"

Cho isn't responsible for Marietta's actions, and she's a loyal enough friend to stand by someone even when they've made a dire mistake. I would hope in time that Harry would come to realize this about her. After all, Cho also proved her loyalty to Harry in the end by coming back for the Battle of Hogwarts along with the other DA members.

She was who dragged Marietta along in the first place. And more importantly, she stood with Marietta after she had sold out their only chance at learning stuff to survive Voldemort to the woman who tortured children (which would have been widely known unless Harry wore gloves 24/7).

****** I don't believe Cho knew Marietta would do that. For better or for worse, though, she wasn't going to abandon a friend - especially not the closest friend she had at the time - no matter what they did.

I do still agree with you, however, that it does warrant an apology to Harry, if he's actually willing to listen to one.

Of course she did not know beforehand, however sticking with a traitor is a different matter. There are single moments which can end any friendship, and selling your boyfriend out to Madam Torture certainly counts as one.

******** Cannon wise Harry forgave Ron. The fans bash Ron but cannon Harry forgave Ron after he abandoned him in fourth year after saving his sister's life not even 2 years before. He didn't even directly warn Harry I think. The argument could be maid Cho owes Harry less then Ron does. Let alone another argument could be made she could be using the date to get closer on what happened to Cedric. We aren't given a length on how long Cedric and Cho were dating (was it that year or longer)

Why shouldn't she back her friend? If I'm not mistaken the only people who knew about the torture other than Harry and Umbridge was Harrys friends. (I could be wrong)

They're probably the only ones he talks about it with, but as Hellstrike pointed out, it is going to be pretty noticeable to everyone that Harry has "I must not tell lies" carved into his hand - especially to Cho when Harry makes a motion to hold her hand on Valentine's Day.

But I do agree it makes sense (and is right) for him to extend her some forgiveness, especially once Umbridge is gone and the DA disbands. By that point, it's all water under the bridge anyway (except for the /Sneak/ word still imprinted on Marietta's face - but that's more of a conversation for Cho to have with Hermione, not Harry).

********* Harry had scars on his hand, unless he wore gloves 24/7, people would notice (and the scars aren't just random lines either). Especially during the DA, where he was in close contact with a lot of others. On top of that, even if Harry kept shut, Lee does not strike me as someone who would. So Lee + mystery scars, well it is pretty obvious, at least for DA members.

  How long they were dating

6 months tops. Mid December to early June.

  canon forgiveness of Ron

Which is one of the worst scenes of GoF in my opinion.
