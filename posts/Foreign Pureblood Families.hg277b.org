Is there any sort of confirmed list of foreign (non-British) pureblooded families? Zabini and Dolohov's listings on HPwiki only list pureblood as a possibility. Is there another source for foreign purebloods?


** I believe the Patil twins are purebloods? I don't think there's a list, though, other than what's mentioned in their wikis.

*** The Patils are British and it's not confirmed whether they're pureblood or not. They were just allowed to go to Hogwarts in DH.

**** Early in the first book, there's a line where Pansy Parkinson is taunting Parvati for sticking up for Neville and says, "Never thought /you'd/ like fat little crybabies, Parvati", which to me kind of suggests that they knew each other before Hogwarts. It's not much of a leap to conclude that the Patils are purebloods themselves, given how snobbish Pansy seems to be. Fanon has been built on less, at least.

**** Ah, must be all of the fanfiction I've been reading, then.

** The only foreign family we know for sure is pure-blood in canon, is Kama(the mother of Leta Lestrange).

All the other suspects we dont know the exact blood status of. Even with foregin blood purists you cant be sure if their family name is pure, because many of those are just half-bloods pretending.
