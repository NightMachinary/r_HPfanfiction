** Honestly? Boring. I read it all (I read up to 1000 wpm naturally) within a few days, and it just...dragged on. There's a few interesting bits, but it just was...a bore.

I mostly finished it because the only thing I was curious about was Ron's reaction when they got back. After that, I felt like I had to finish it, because well, I was already half done with it.

The dreams were vaguely interesting, to be fair, but all in all, boring, bland, interesting idea but not executed that well.

It IS one of the best Hermione/Ginny fics I've read, but I haven't read much of that pairing. I'd like to read more though.

Then get ready for the wonder that is Spectrum24.

Linkffn(So Close Yet So Far by Spectrum24) and its sequel Linkffn(Illusions by Spectrum24) are both well written bodies of work, although the first fic is a little rough at times.

Linkffn(In The Long Run by Spectrum24) is much better written and engaging from the start, a must read for Hermione/Ginny fans.

Linkffn(At Sunrise by Spectrum24). If you're looking for a tear-jerker, this fic is it. You know what they say, it's the journey and not the destination that matters. Shed a tear and I'm almost a psycopath.

Linkffn(Written In The Body by Poetheather1) Linkffn(Learning to Love by The Forgotten Lover) Linkffn(If You Can Meet With Triumph And Disaster) Linkffn(To know, to feel, to love)

The above are all good fics as well, and probably some of the longest and well written Hermione/Ginny fics out there.

**** Nope, not at all. Like I said, I read fast. Really fast. I much prefer longer stories. I've read probably most of the (so-so to very well written) long fics in the fandom. I don't know. It just was....boring.

For example of long fics I like, I absolutely loved the Dangerverse Series. Although I don't remember where I left off, I really liked Prince of The Dark Kingdom. Alexandria Quick had some really good ideas. I both loved and hated Harry Crow (I know how...OOC it is, I just couldn't help myself, it's one of those guilty pleasures.) I absolutely hated HPMOR.

  The war in Europe and a trainload of muggle children, sent as evacuees to the safety of Hogsmeade, receive more attention in the village than events in the wizards' school. Familiar names wear younger faces. Acts of kindness bring their own punishment.
