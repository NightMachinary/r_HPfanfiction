Okay folks! I posted about this once before when it was in its infancy, and I'm posting again now because the audiobook of Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle is now complete! This is the first book in a series of five (ongoing) by author Inverarity, a tale of a hugely diverse and massively corrupt Magical America, set after the canon novels.

The first book was written well before the Fantastic Beasts arm of continuity was developed at all. Ilvermorny does not exist in this series, but what does exist is the most imaginative and interesting sprawl of world building that I've ever seen in a Harry Potter fanfiction. There are magical cultures based on Roanoke, New York, Chicago, the Ozarks, New Amsterdam, Acadia, San Francisco, New Orleans, Dinétah, and much, much more. The all-OC cast is brilliantly written. The themes at play are brilliantly woven into the story. Rather than use magical societal issues as an allegory for real-world conflicts of race and class, the author unflinchingly explores how real-world conflicts of race and class are made much more complicated, and at times much WORSE, by the addition of myriad cultures and traditions of magic.

I didn't write it, by the way. I'm just doing the audiobooks with permission and input from the author.

Alexandra Quick is a story that deeply affected me the first time I read through it, and I am thrilled to be able to bring it to life in this way. Please give it a listen, and please feel very free to tell me what's bad about it! I am using this project as a way to hone my skills in the hopes of making a career out of this kind of thing, and all feedback, especially negative feedback, is very helpful and appreciated. Already noted by this subreddit and others is that the tone of the narration is at first overly forceful and “announcery.” That is something that I believe I've managed to fix over time, but I wouldn't have known to do that if people hadn't pointed it out.

I've rambled enough I think. This podcast is available on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, and basically whatever else you want. Thank you for listening!


** Yay! Thanks for sharing, I look forward to listening! :D

*** I gotta talk to you. Your comments on the first thread I posted helped me immensely. Many people had brought the tone problem to me, but it wasn't until I read your post that something clicked on my head. Its around chapter 3 or 4 of Book Two that a new attitude begins to set in, I think. Not that it all changes immediately and is great forever, but that's when it begins to get good I think. Thanks again.

**** I think you're confusing me with someone else. I'm the one who requested a complete file of each book, but I hadn't listened to any of it and didn't say anything about the narration style. :3 I'm glad you got good feedback and improved throughout the creation process, but I can't take the credit for it.
