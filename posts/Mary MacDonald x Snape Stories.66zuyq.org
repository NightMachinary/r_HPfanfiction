I discovered this ship in 2 fanfics. As an alternative in a parallel life seen by Canon Lily in "What if the purgatory of Lily?" linkff (4936966). And as an uncomfortable situatio that arised after Lily travelled back in time and tries to keep Severus's friendship and James' love both in her life in "The Law of unintented consequences linkff (4797089).

Do you know another fanfic where this ship appears?

*** A secondary character in the maraunders era, a Gryffindor in the same year as them. Perhaps that explains why the are no almost none fics with her, and in those where she appears is a secondary character
