Bonus if Hermione and Ron had a mutual break up and decided to be friends.

But they don't have to have dated at all.

I love Ron, he's one of my favorite characters for how real he is, and it just saddens me how many people bash on him.

I know he's insecure, but being insecure especially with such a huge family is very realistic. I know he was jealous of Viktor Krum, but I think a lot of that had to do with Viktor being an outsider. Depending on the age rage with Ron, he might get jealous, but a little upset if Hermione ended up with someone other then him, but I can definitely see him eventually coming around and accepting it.

He can be jealous in the story, if need be, but before the end of it I definitely want Ron supporting whoever it is Hermione ends with.

Would be extra neat if he went above expectations and was rooting for whoever Hermione and the person was from the beginning.

It can be anyone with Hermione, I'm not that picky really.

It can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine too.

It can be connected oneshots, drabbles or multichapters.


** In [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]] Ron is a bit jealous during the beginning but after that is pretty supportive and quite similar to canon Ron

*** That sounds pretty realistic - Ron's prone to jealosy, but he gets over it soon enough.

  Honestly, the real gems out there are Harry/Hermione with supportive Ron and Ginny stories, in my opinion.

Do you know of any good ones?

** Unrelated but would you be interested in a Ron Centric fic? Because my favourite fic is Ron centric (Even though Ron isn't my faveourite character), and I love the story for the plot, but many people are put off of it because of the fact its ron centric and I just want to spread love for the fic.

It is a very underrated fic, and all because people don't like Ron.

Even better, there is NO bashing. There's also a lot of Character development

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** My personal favourite of these is a Hermione-Luna (that's well developed to the point it actually works pretty darn well) fic called Crazy Little Things where Ron's big moment is done really well in a way where they remain good friends afterwards.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990]]

Fic really needs a Britpic, but it's quite fun.

  It's four years after the Trio has graduated from Hogwarts, and they're about to live together again for the first time. But will old friends remain old friends... or will they become something more?

  Caught in the Potions classroom when Snape returns from a dangerous Death Eater meeting, Hermione is terrified until she sees he's wounded and in need of her help. Knowing she should leave before he realises her crush, but unable when he needs her, Hermione patches him up and is only too happy to show him how grateful she is for all he sacrifices.
