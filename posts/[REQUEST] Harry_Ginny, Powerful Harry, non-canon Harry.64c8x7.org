Harry/Ginny. Powerful Harry/Ginny, non-canon Ginny(meaning she isn't just shy stalker). After war story would be fine too. I've read all Brennus stories though.


** linkffn(5856625) The Return of the Marauders. I can't actually decided if I like this story or not but I have read it a couple of times.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

*** Same here, I've read it multiple times and each time I'm wondering if I like it or not. Credit to the author for making it entertaining I guess.

** How about non-shy stalker? Lol, not really a stalker though, depends on how you view her in the Dark Prince Trilogy from Kurinoone. They're pretty high up on the fav list though, so you may have read them already.
