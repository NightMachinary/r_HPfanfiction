** I know this fic is somewhat of a sore subject on this subreddit but LinkAo3(A Second Chance by Breanie) updates weekly.

LinkAo3(When Hermione Fights) is also updated fairly regularly and so is LinkAo3(Prince of Slytherin).

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

  They say you always have a choice and I had chosen. I would fight! I was ready to face life with all its ups and downs. I would follow the path of a warrior, not popular but necessary, as I had been part of the war for years. Every year without fail Harry, Ron and I would fight for our lives. Was I, Hermione Granger, a good person and would I still be good after everything was done and finished? This is my story beginning at the end of the holidays after Year Four (GoF), and in the end you'll have to decide if my actions and my decisions were the right ones! HG with SB, DM, SS and LM; HP will play a bigger role as the story progresses!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
