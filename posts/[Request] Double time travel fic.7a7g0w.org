I made an attempt to search for one but honestly i'm not sure what terms to use in a search. To clarify I just had a thought(an admittedly half-baked one) that I have never seen a double time travel plot, one where the standard harry potter time travel occurs and then for some reason happens again. I'd be willing to bet if it does exist is as a crack or parody fic(which I'm not totally against) but the thought wont leave me so does anyone know of one.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

*** (another spoiler warning)

IIRC, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][/Harry Dursley and The Chronicles of the King/]] also had multi- time-travel, but more of that twisted, [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064/][/Triangle/]]-like variety. If I'm not confusing the story titles, than the time-fuckery starts happening closer to the later chapters.

The story has many poor aspects to criticise, but it can also be an entertaining read; and it should contain some original ideas as well.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** I agree with Delenda Est.

PSA: it has an unfinished semi-sequel that is NOT worth your time. Don't be tempted.

Linkffn(The Debt of Time) also has two time travels. It is canon compliant until the beginning of HBP.

  Everything went horribly, massively wrong. So Hermione went through time to fix it, although that went arguably worse. So there was nothing left but to try again, and that time ran into errors nobody expected.
