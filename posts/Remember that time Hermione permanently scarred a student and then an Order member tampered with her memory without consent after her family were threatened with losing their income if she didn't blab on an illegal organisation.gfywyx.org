Not too much of a point but just remembered the curious case of Marietta Edgecombe, who after the war should've sued Granger and Shacklebolt so much they didn't have careers after.

Anyone else remember rather sinister turns by the "heroes" that are never talked about ever again in the books/films?


** There's no indication that the wizarding world has laws against either of those things, nor would 'suing someone so much they didn't have careers after' even make sense for a real-world tort. In the real world, children can't sign contracts or have to face consequences for signing them, but in the magical world, the rule could just be 'whatever the terms of a magical contract are is fine, it's not the government's problem, so be careful what you sign'. It seems unlikely that a society of ~10,000 people would have a well-developed system of contract law like the one that evolved in muggle societies of millions of people over hundreds of years.

Nor is there any indication that what Shacklebolt did would be considered worthy of punishment in the wizarding world. Wizards use obliviation very casually in canon, and he's an Auror.

Sure, this seems very callous and unfair by real-world standards, but a lot of stuff in the magical world is like that.

*** Indeed. In another example take 4th year when Hermione gets sent the letter covered in bubotuber pus. That ought to have been an easy case of clear libel with real tangible harm that Skeeter/the Prophet would have easily lost

 

More importantly though, some random witch or wizard sent was effectively a biological weapon /to a child/. Not only does Hogwarts security and/or owl wards not catch this, but no one seems to give one iota of a fuck about it. Blood prejudice or not, you would think parents would want to protect their kids from a moderately clever witch or wizard realizing they could send something easily spread into the one room guaranteed to have basically the whole school in it.

That is, if the champion is willing and able to flee Europe, they could avoid participating.

*** I agree. There's a lot of interesting fanfic opportunities in exploring the discrepancies between muggle ethics and law and wizard ethics and law. From what we see from Harry's perspective, wizards have very loose standards in comparison to muggles when it comes to child welfare, journalism, due process, human rights, and so on. It would be really interesting to dig into that and how a muggleborn could potentially decide to stick to muggle life when they grow up.

********** He /didn't/ survive the chops - he died. It's also explicitly because of a blunt axe.

Off the top of my head, it took 11 swings of an axe to kill a 68 year old Margaret Pole. It's a fairly common trope to have botched executions with blunt weapons - particularly with novice executioners.

JKR made an exaggerated version of it for a kid's book, of course - but the description of Nearly Headless Nick's story tells us much more about /who/ was doing the botched execution than about a wizard.

From the series, we also know that both Helena Ravenclaw and the Bloody Baron committed suicide using a knife (stabbint themselves), and it's said that two of the three Peverell brothers died of normal means (Antioch Peverell had his throat slit, Cadmus Peverell hanged himself). Broderick Brode is strangled to death by Devil's Snare, just like Pettigrew strangled himself to death too - neither of which appeared more durable than a muggle would have.

*Absolute* fanon. The axe is explicitly blunt from the start - even in the one sentence description in the books ("getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?") or in the longer/not initially published poem:

So no, the axe was not blunted by his magic. It was blunt from the start. If you want to have it be his magic that blunts it, that's fanon - which is fine, but you shouldn't be making a definitive statement on it.

/Or/, and hear me out here - wizards can get killed by regular knives, because they're not immune to them. Magic isn't a passive field around you that deflects you from any harm even without you knowing/thinking about it.

That was in the movies--the fifth film states that one of Cho's stressors was her mother being in the Ministry and Umbridge pressuring her.

The books are less clear. Cho explicitly states that Marietta's mother is in the Ministry, but she never elaborates on her own parents. The most we get is them cautioning her not to get on Umbridge's bad side, but Cho was resolute to fight after what happened to Cedric.

Cho is upset with Hermione about it at the end of OotP. That's what ultimately kills Cho and Harry as a couple. He gets pissed at her for defending Marietta and she's upset that he sides with Hermione.

To me the "some scaring" in 6th year meant it's taking a long time but it will eventually heal. Basically a "don't worry she'll be fine" to the reader.

And yes Cho is upset when it happens but not ever again. Which again to me says that Marietta will heal completely fine eventually.

It could go either way. We're never told either but in my headcanon Maritta is a little snitch who wanted to gain favor with Umbridge and she was temporarily scared are this - both are not nice things to do and pretty much equal out when you realize what the consequences Umbridge did and would have given out.

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione, they used Veritaserum on her. And they only managed that because she'd gone to the Hospital Wing after Neville tried to use magic again," I said. His stubbornness would be the death of us all.

  Hermione stuttered, "Sh-she what? I mean, I didn't realize that the contract would have that effect unless the betrayal was willing. I just wanted --"

  "Vengeance," I finished gravely. "You wanted vengeance for an act that hadn't even been committed yet."

  "I didn't want people to betray us," Hermione said.

  I shook my head, sighing, "See, that would have made sense if you'd actually told people about the betrayal clause. Then, it would serve as a deterrent. But you didn't tell anyone. I know; I checked with Ginevra."

  Hermione began sniffling. She always does this, hoping to distract from her misdeeds.

  I said, "I think that you didn't tell anyone because you wanted someone to betray us /just/ so you could hurt them without consequence."

  "You're wrong. I'll fix Edgecomb," Hermione said. "It shouldn't be too hard to reverse-engineer..."

  "No, see, this is the problem. You're trying to convince everyone that you're a good person, but you're just innately malicious. Rather than fight your inner evil, you're ignoring it. That isn't healthy."

  Hermione ran away crying, still clinging to her denial.

***** Indeed. There's two responses i would make to that.

Legally (and assuming English law):

1. It's still not a contract. It's unlikely that the sign-up sheet to an informal school club would be considered to have the necessary shared intention to create binding legal relations. People can reach all sorts of agreements and make all sorts of promises to each other without those constituting contracts - not every broken promise gives rise to a legal recourse.

2. Even if it were a contract, it's likely unenforceable for uncertainty of terms.

3. Even if it were a contract, since it would be a contract between children, it would be a voidable contract: the underage party can cancel the contract at any time for any reason, without consequences.

Magically:

1. The effect on Marietta was still expressed to be the result of the jinx, not the result of breaking a magical contract in the Goblet of Fire sense of binding magical contracts.

****** I don't think that modern Muggle English law---which describes which contracts /the state/ will and won't enforce and how---has much bearing on a self-enforcing magical contract.

Since we don't see anyone breach the Goblet of Fire magical contract, we don't actually know what its results are. Now that I think about it, if the breach of the goblet's contract, say, triggers a curse that was cast at the time of the goblet's enchanting, then there would be exact parallels:

1. The artefact (goblet/parchment) is created, and the penalty clause (unknown/pimple jinx) is cast.
2. The conditions of the contract are announced (Dumbledore's announcement/Hermione's announcement) to the potential signatories.
3. The signatories consent to be bound by the contract by providing their names (papers in the goblet/names on the parchment).
4. Upon breach, the penalty clause activates for the violator (did not occur/Marietta).

Of course, Steps 1 and 4 could be completely different, and they could be completely unrelated magics, but there is a certain elegance to making the two be special cases of the same type of procedure. The corollary that Hermione might have gotten the idea about the parchment jinx from studying the goblet could also be a neat way to tie things together.

******* 1. As a matter of worldbuilding, I think it likely that wizarding law is common-law based, because the common law far predates the statute of secrecy, and the basics of English contract law were largely settled by the 1700s. While I have no doubt that the Wizemgamot has produced all sorts of legal innovations designed to deal with uniquely magical situations, I would imagine the law around things like contracts to be similar.

2. However, I recognise that there is no obligation to assume any similarity to Muggle English law in magical law. But if you do this, you've pretty much made the statement "Marietta broke a contract" meaningless. The meaning of the word "contract" is defined by what the law says it is; in the absence of any real knowledge about magical law, the ideas of a "contract" and what it means to break one are without any content, and any statement about them is similarly contentless.

3. What we are told is that Hermione jinxed a piece of parchment such that the jinx would activate upon a certain event. You can call this a contract if you like, but doing so doesn't change anything about the facts of what has occurred. Calling it a contract, where the word "contract" means nothing, is a purely semantic point and does not carry the moral force that the argument is intended to have (there is a sense that people should not break contracts they have willingly entered into; whereas breaking an informal promise is more acceptable).

******** Clearly, wizards have an expression "magical contract" that they use to refer to something that's binding. However, blindly borrowing concepts from Muggle contract law is almost a category error, given the fundamental nature of what those contracts are and how they are enforced. In fact, it is quite plausible that there would be no wizarding contract law in the first place, because enforcement is by the magic of the contract and not by a lawsuit brought before and adjudicated in a court of law.

Observe that every single legal objection you have raised to the parchment as a magical contract is either irrelevant for magical contracts or applies to an equal or a greater extent to the Goblet of Fire. Referencing the great-grandparent post,

1. Harry didn't knowingly put his name into the Goblet, and he didn't intend to enter the Triwizard. Marietta, at least, actually heard the conditions and signed her name immediately after.
2. There is no need for a third party such as a court of law to interpret the wording of the contract, so vagueness is irrelevant.
3. The Goblet's contract with respect to Harry was, in all evidence, not voidable, since Harry had to participate. (And, again, voidable by whom?)

Lastly, I think that we can safely assume that the jinx could only trigger on those who have signed the parchment. For example, if someone who is not Draco were to write Draco's name on the parchment, and Draco subsequently learned about DA and told Umbridge, I would assume that he would /not/ be jinxed.

At this point, if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, etc., then we should call it a duck.

Now, are the mechanics of magical contracts unfair, particularly by our Western Muggle standards? In my opinion, they are. In both cases here, we have three of the four components of a Muggle contract (offer, acceptance, and consideration), but the fourth one---intent to be legally bound---magical contracts certainly play fast and loose with.

********** No worries. Thanks for addressing it.

Briefly, I don't buy the claim that "magical contract" is just a contract under magical law as opposed to a contract under the muggle law. It's just not how people use language. If this were the case, a "magical contract" for them would be just "contract", and it is the muggle contract that they would qualify.

Unless, that is, wizards have both kinds of contracts. I may have overstated the case a bit in suggesting that wizards don't have contract law: in commercial transactions in particular, curse-based penalty clauses don't make sense, because the aggrieved party would want compensation rather than revenge or deterrence. They would therefore want some non-magical form of judgement or arbitration mechanism for those. Then, there would be "contracts", indistinguishable from muggle contracts for all practical purposes except for being enforced by wizard courts and wizard law rather than muggle; and there would be "magical contracts", adjudicated and enforced by the magic in the contract.

More generally, since when have wizards cared to do anything according to muggle law? They have a parallel government with parallel institutions. A contract between two wizards ending up in a muggle court except as a prank would be a once-in-a-century event, if that. (There's a comedy fic in this...)

Now, since the Triwizard contract is referred to explicitly as a "magical contract", I think that it's more plausible that it's enforced by magic, with rules set at the time of the Goblet's creation, likely unalterable. Any rules document that the characters might refer to is merely describing the Goblet's rules and does not have magical or legal power of its own. This is backed by several observations:

1. Dumbledore had to use an Age Line to keep the underage candidates out. If the rules could be amended or were up to the wizards to enforce, they could have just changed the tournament rules to exclude the underaged.
2. The Triwizard contact was in force even though Harry claimed to have never entered his name into the Goblet. If the contract were enforced by a court rather than by magic, then Harry could have gotten out of it if preponderance of evidence couldn't be established that he did, in fact, put his name in, as opposed to someone else doing it. Yet nobody, including Dumbledore, brings up that option.
3. To repeat my grandparent point, the Triwizard contract was clearly not voidable for age.
4. With respect to Harry, the contract was unconscionable---which is a defence in court but not if the contract is enforced by magic.

And, yes, that means that magical contracts play fast and loose with consent, and it does appear to be possible to bind someone without their informed consent. However, we have quite a lot of mythology about cursing someone remotely, using their name, image, property, or discarded body parts, with voodoo is probably the most prominent example. IIRC, it doesn't make much of an appearance in the Potterverse, but we are told that hags may have similar powers.

Now, the exact rules that govern who can be bound by a contract are not clear, but as with a lot of magic, they do make some sort of sense when viewed in context. Marietta heard the conditions and signed her name without asking about the penalty clause, and that was good enough for Hermione's jinx. Harry didn't put his name into the Goblet, but perhaps it was written by his hand and submitted by his teacher (/in loco parentis/), which, by the Goblet's archaic standards, was good enough. There are other explanations, of course, but, now that I think about it, this one /would/ explain why you can't jinx Voldemort in this way: nobody has guardianship over him. (It also meshes nicely with how the Trace disappears at 17.)

Also, I do like the arkkitehti's (from DLP) headcanon, though I first saw it in [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics: that one can go to a curse breaker to get out of a magical contract. It may also explain why Hermione wasn't forthright about the parchment jinx: if Marietta had known about it, she could have gotten the jinx removed before breaching the contract. (This was not an option with the Goblet, perhaps because it was too powerful to break.)

I think this point is fundamentally contradicted by canon. Wizards constantly qualify things as being magical: the Department of Magical Transportation, the DMLE etc. And to take the cake, we know wizard-made law is referred to as "magical law":

#+begin_quote
  “Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.

  “No, I'm not,” retorted Hermione. “I'm hoping to do some good in the world!”
#+end_quote

So for all that you think it unlikely that wizards would qualify things as magical, I'm afraid that it simply is the case.

In a similar way you consider it unlikely that Harry would be permitted to participate in the tournament if his involvement was simply the matter of contract binding at magical law. But again, likely or not, this is what we are explicitly told happens: the quotes in my post are pretty explicit that it is the Triwizard rules which compel Harry to participate. Presumably the organisers have some strong reason why they do not want to vary the rules - the fact that they took years to negotiate, perhaps, or an attachment to the tradition of using the Goblet of Fire to select champions.

************ Have you noticed that all your examples are proper names, and even "Magical Law" is capitalised? "Magical Law", "Department of Magical Transportation", and "Department of Magical Law Enforcement" are all official, legal designations, some of which may well predate the Statute of Secrecy. Prior to the Statute, they would have existed in some form side by side with their Muggle counterparts, and both wizards and Muggles might have had to deal with both at various times. It makes sense that once the Statute was imposed and the Ministry of Magic became sovereign, the tradition was retained, just as the title "Minister for Magic" was never changed to just "Prime Minister", "Premier", or "President".

In contrast, the Goblet's "magical contract" is invariably lowercase, an adjective modifying a noun. So, it seems to me that your examples only strengthen my case.

Dumbledore had known from the beginning that he wanted to keep underage participants out. Unless the negotiations around organising the Triwizard somehow happened without the involvement of the hosting school's headmaster, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, he could have written it into the rules, unless /something/ made them immutable.

He could have (or at least, he could have tried, subject to any resistance from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang) but he didn't. I think your best case outcome with this line of argument is to say that there is a plothole created by Dumbledore's behaviour, but my view is that day to day life is full of "could have but didn't" moments.

The situation is easily explained by the other parties to the negotiation not wanting to include an age restriction in the rules themselves, or by none of the parties even thinking of an age restriction until after the negotiation was concluded, at which point no one wanted to re-open the negotiation on the rules and they simply adopted the work-around of an age-line.

************** I am basing my position on what is a proper name and what is not, which represents how the characters---who know their world better than you or I ever could---view the concepts they are referring to. As far as I can tell, the convention is perfectly consistent with how people in general use language and with the history of the wizarding world. If anything, capitalisation is overused in the books (e.g., "Magical Law" in Scrimegour's quote), which makes lowercased "magical contract" stronger evidence, not weaker. Notably, the two times the Triwizard contract is referred to as a "contract", it's always qualified as "binding magical contract".

If you want to dismiss this evidence, at least provide some other examples of spurious uses of "magical" that are not in a proper name.

Regarding the "plothole", Beauxbatons and Durmstrang didn't appear to resist Dumbledore imposing the age line. Now, given that the Triwizard was originally stopped /because it was too dangerous/, those organising its resumption would have student safety (as wizards understand it) first and foremost in their minds, so them conveniently forgetting to include the age in the rules is---how you say it?---clutching at straws?

P.S. I grepped through canon for "contract" to see what its other usages there were, and I found this line in OotP, shortly after Hermione states the terms:

#+begin_quote
  Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person -- Zacharias -- had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. *It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.*

Looks like the intent/understanding is there as well, to some extent. I am surprised you had missed it in your analysis.

** Note that we do not know if it was 'permanent scarring' - Marietta drops out of the story after a single mention at the start of the 6th year, at which point she still had blemishes - but thick makeup was basically enough to cover it. [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][According to JKR]], they would mostly fade in time (light scarring).

As for suing, I think it's fairly unlikely - it'd be very easy to describe it as something necessary for wartime, and to stop Voldemort and his cronies - and it is nowhere near severe enough to be a warcrime, IMO, particularly since her family /wasn't/ threatened until after the jinx went off (I'd recommend looking back at OOTP Ch. 27, where Umbridge explains how Marietta came to inform on her own).

Was it a bit overly harsh for a young woman making a mistake? Perhaps. But it's not clearcut like you're saying, and you're exaggerating the severity of it on multiple fronts.

Even if we headcannoned, let's imagine that Marietta told her mom that Harry and her best friend Cho were almost an item. Her mom then talked about it at work. Umbridge got wind of it and pressured Madam Edgecombe to pressure her daughter to dig up any dirt that could be used to incriminate a FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY, a minor even in the Wizarding World. The MoM threatening to sack people for getting their children to act as spies would have been in no way commendable. It would be regarded as a clear violation of privacy. Marietta's unfortunate accident is her own fault for not keeping her head down and not backing out of the DA in the first place. Headcannoning a bit more, if she were so afraid, she could have gone to Harry or Hermione and told them that her mom was asking her to spy on them. They'd have protected her. Instead she chose to rat them out and got jinxed.

There are casualties in every conflict. Even innocent people get caught in the crossfire. Voldemort and his followers were nothing short of terrorists. Marietta got caught in the crossfire and she wasn't really innocent.

I think she genuinely saw Harry as troubled and unstable, and her best friend was grieving and falling into the rhetoric that this dead dark lord was back and had killed her boyfriend. Of course, Dumbledore was using him to try overthrow the government, which would affect her mother's job, so I guess the right thing to do is turn him in.

From an outsider's point of view, especially with all the bad press around him, Harry and his little group were becoming a danger. But I don't think she saw it as a "two sides, pick one" issue. She saw it as a "holy fuck this kid is crazy and getting dangerous, I needa tell someone."

I doubt this is how Marietta and most of the DA saw themselves in book 5. It was primarily a study group being a bit rebellious against school officials, especially to the Ravenclaws.

Umbridge insluts, degrades and attacks them. The Cenaurs then take Umbridge and decide to not kill Harry and Hermione because they are still children. I don't think it would be likely in canon for the trio to be able to defeat a Herd of Centaurs who were is an especially bad mood.

Soo it's more accurate to say that Hermione lacked empathy at Umbridge being dragged off by Centaurs after she escaped death by the Centaurs because she is under age.

Even if they had wanted to save her (which maybe they should have), I don't see any way for them to succeed. If they had made more trouble the Centaurs probably would have decided they were close enough to adults and killed them too.
