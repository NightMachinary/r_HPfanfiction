I've read the good Luna/Hermione story (I think it's Crazy Little Things) and a few fem!Harry/Hermione stories. What fics can y'all recommend? +1 for lesbian magic or interesting societal repercussions.


** I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][A Butterfly Effect]]. Do you have links to the fem!Harry/Hermione stories you mentioned?

** Somewhere someone said that it's poor form to link to your own stuff... but I'm going to do it anyway. And then I'll link to other people's stuff, which will make it OK in the end. :)

The first two are the first two of a three part set of fics. The third will start publishing in a couple of weeks. There's lots of societal repercussions and female-centered magic involved, though it takes a while to build.

linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by philosophize) linkffn(The Power of Love by philosophize)

The next two are the first two parts of a HP/Avengers crossover series. The third will appear in an month or so.

linkffn(The Death of Natasha Romanoff by philosophize) linkffn(Iris Potter Agent of Shield by philosophize)

These two by wordhammer are good, though with some very dark elements.

linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path by wordhammer) linkffn(Holly Polter by wordhammer)

Nemesis13 has several femslash stories involving a female Harry. They are unusual in that they combine both dark elements with a major dash of whimsy. His latest involves a dark female Harry accidentally transported to another galaxy where she's taken as an apprentice by Darth Vader. OK, OK, I realize that that might sound stupid, but... honestly, it's funny. I enjoy how she keeps pushing him to get rid of Palpatine because he's a creepy old man who's in the way. And has to work to avoid jumping Mara Jade's bones because she's trying to stay faithful to Hermione.

What can I say, it makes me smile.
