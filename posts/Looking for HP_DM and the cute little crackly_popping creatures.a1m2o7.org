Hey all, There was a super cute Drarry fanfic I read at some point in which (I think) Draco was setting up a cafe or something similar and Harry came to visit as an auror (again, I think) and the building was infested with little round creatures that made a crackling or popping noise. I think Luna came to identify said creatures.

Sorry, I know this is super vague! Just hoping I can read it again :)
