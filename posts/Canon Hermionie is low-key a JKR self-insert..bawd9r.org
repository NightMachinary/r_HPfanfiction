Change my mind.

OK, it's a bit tenuous, but still.


** Why change your mind? [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2014/02/01/j-k-rowling-hermioneron-relationship-was-wish-fulfillment/][JKR said that the Ron/Hermione relationship was "a form of wish fulfillment"]] and that Hermione carries [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm][several autobiographical influences]].

** It's pretty obvious. That's why you don't see much Hermione bashing here (or really anywhere, for that matter). You spelled her name wrong too.

** It's not tenous, JK Rowling has long admitted that Hermione is a more extreme version of herself ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc.html][cleverer and more annoying]]). She's also said in the past she has a lot of Harry however too, so not just Hermione ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm][and also other characters as well]], but emphatically not Umbridge)

To some extent authors will always have a bit of themselves in a story after all.

*** With all the new Canon changes. I wouldn't be surprised if she began identifying as something else.
