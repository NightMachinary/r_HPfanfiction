** When a Lioness Fights by Kayly Silverstorm

It takes a few chapters to warm up, but the plotline is incredible, the writing style is excellent, and the romance is the best example I've ever read of a real-life, slowly developing, solid-foundation relationship where your partner is your best friend and isn't focused on sex/hormones.

*** Thank you! I've been reading my way through the top SS/HG fics on both ffn and ao3 these past days, and always skipped that one because the summary turned me off. Now I know to give it a second chance.

And since we're already there, have my recommendation: linkao3(12953922)

Days in the Sun

It's pretty light on the Harry Potter universe aspect and heavy on the romance aspect.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted & experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' their powers were enough to make Harry outright murderous.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/]])

It's a relatively new fic that immediately became my favourite fic of all time. I find myself re-reading it every few months and hoping a sequel happens.

Edit: Summary - It's about a little boy who lost his parents but then he gets a new set of parents who love him as he should have been loved. The writing is wonderfully emotive, and children are very well portrayed as children without it becoming boring. It basically covers Harry's life from when he was left on the doorstep to the end of his first year at Hogwarts. The point of divergence is the Dursleys deciding not to take Harry in, with rapid bad consequences for them but wonderful consequences for Harry.

** Of a Linear Circle by flamethrower is easily the best founder's era time-travel fic I have ever read that takes time to explore the potential history of the founders. However the main story of the series takes place within canon and is one of a small handful of Snape-centric fics that I can bear to read. The world building of this series is some of the best I've read and it never feels like it is treading on the toes of what canon established.

At 10 individual works and on going it's a great way to spend time.

** Alexandra Quick is one of my favorite series. If you're interested in reading about an entirely original setting (magical US) with original characters (no Harry Potter to be found here) that's still technically in the Harry Potter universe, this is the best there is.

I think my favorite part of these stories is how the author manages to recreate the same "big reveal of the mysterious problem" build-up/tension/resolution like JK Rowling does in canon.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

**** Well, here is an example of what you can expect from it:

"Alright, you've all seen some of that voodoo that I do up to now, but now you get introduced to one of the more fun aspects of it. I'm going to say to you all now the four words that terrorized me all through primary school," Harry smiled widely, "Wanna feel something weird?"

With the wand he had been concealing behind his back, Harry mass transfigured each squad member into a sealed tin of potted meat. A swish and flick saw the squad rise into the air and file neatly into their improvised atmospheric re-entry vehicle. It stood just under a meter tall, was a forbidding black, and-

It was a trash can. A heavily charmed trashcan, but nonetheless a trashcan.

Harry picked it up and held it under and arm as he made his way through the ship to the airlock, whistling the tune to 'If I Only Had a Brain'. He got a few strange looks as he went through the CIC, but the command crew had all been briefed extensively by former-captain Anderson to just ignore anything they saw Harry doing that did not immediately endanger the structural integrity of the ship. They chose to let it go.

** I'm scared I'm going to recommend something you've already read since I'm new to fics in general but I would recommend "Blindness" by AngelaStarCat, It was a very great idea and well executed although it is a little long winded I didn't really mind it's also trope heavy. A blind Harry Potter MOD is a great idea though!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Series by Shezza]]

An HP/Dresden Files crossover that is among my favorite HP stories of all time. Knowing anything whatsoever about the Dresden Files series is entirely unnecessary, the fic explains stuff in context. I don't remember if it is rated M or T, but it contains no smut, and a vast amount of violence. It has an engaging and well written story that is paced well and all the characters are both interesting and believable.

** There are two time-travel WIPs that I completely adore, but since you asked for just one, I'll go with The Second String. It's well-written and it made me cry and I always get so excited when it updates.

(This also reminds me that I should reread one of the fics that got me into HP fic... It's amazing but I've read so much since then that I don't know where it'd fall. But you only asked for one rec, anyway.)

** I won't give you my favourite. from your request, it looks like you will most likely. Definitely, have read it already.

So try this linkffn(13250447)

An adult, OP!Harry (think Wind Shear). Is blasted into an AU 5th year universe. Where a bunch of cliches exist. i.e Parents alive, Harry is a girl. The usual. What really sets it apart, is that. He doesn't really care. He just picks up where he left off. Killing bad guys. Taking names. And being a genuinely, morally grey character.

It could use a beta and some touch-ups. Still, I had fun with it. Enjoy!

** This one is not a favorite but I was looking for OC fanfics, and it was certaining engaging. This fanfic has a male SI OC that's reincarnated into the HP world as a pureblood and is in Slytherin. It also has a fem-harry and starts during the Triwizard tournament. It is *very* smutty which is why it's rated M. It's still a WIP and honestly, it's more smutty than storyline based till now but it's entertaining nonetheless.

** Linkffn(The Divide by Beedle)

I wouldn't call it my all-time favorite, but it's honestly top 6, and I'm choosing this one because I don't think it's well-known. It's about two inseperable twin girls, Jennifer and Juliet, who are Hugo Weasley's age. Juliet is a witch, Jen is not, and they are desparate to stay together, so they go on a quest to find a way to give Jen magic.

It's really sweet and charming and does some interesting world building. If the characters seem flat, trust me - they don't stay that way. I'm not sure how far into the story we are right now, but it's currently the end of second year, and it's consistently updated. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

It starts pretty ordinary for this type of fics and descends into heavy smut at 4 year I think.
