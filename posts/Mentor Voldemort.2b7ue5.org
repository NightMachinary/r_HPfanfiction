I have recently taken quite fondly to the notion of a Dark-But-Not-Evil-Harry kind of fic, taking particular interest in fics that have Voldemort as a mentor of sorts.

Either as Voldemort or Tom, doesnt matter either way really, but I've been liking the character shown in

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

and

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8873552/1/Twins-A-Different-Life]]

Voldemort is clearly dark, and evil, but he has a fondness for Harry of sorts. If anyone knows of any more similar fics, I'd love to know. Similarly, the second fic, Twins. If there are any more out there like that I'd be extra excited. Almost cried when I got to the end of the WIP-ness of it :D

Thankies for reading :)

*** Usually not open to it but could go for it. I'm more looking for the concept of love/hate and seconds from murder rather than head over heels "I could never hurt you Harry" - But I like the dynamic and idea of Harry and Vol, so any suggestions would be appreciated :)

** Gah, must you link it to most recent chapter???

Anyway, as I have been rec'ing for a while, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] is such a story though it's a lot more obvious in the second [unfinished] part. Harry mind, during fourth year, splits and he realizes how far Dumbledore's manipulations go.

Another is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running][Hit The Ground Running]] in which the Horcrux wakes up long before Harry gets his Hogwarts letter. It's being actively updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10170838/1/The-Counterfeit-Cousin][The Counterfeit Cousin]] [which may or may not end up Tomarry] is basically DiaryHorcrux!Tom gets a body early on and all but kidnaps Harry from the Dursleys and basically raises him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][Enveloped in Darkness]] and it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10191404/1/Embraced-by-the-Darkness][actively updated sequel]] is Harry being raised in the orphanage instead of the Dursleys and he becomes a dark wizard. Voldemort takes notice and mentors him. Nooooot sure where the romance may go in this fict but it's still a good read either way.

Hope this helps. :)

**** It's my own fault for not paying attention. I got through like the first few sentences of Twin thinking 'huh this is a fresh way to start a story' then I saw the chapter. DX

And no problem. :)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1992755/1/Forsaken][Forsaken]] is the only Voldemort mentor fic I've read, and was the first dark!Harry I read. It's been awhile, but I remember I liked it despite my initial misgivings - normally evil!Dumbledore is not my cup of tea - but I got hooked. If you don't mind slash, check it out.

** The Black Heir and its sequel Vindico Atrum were amazing. VA is still a WIP, it's already up to over 700 000 words and the author has no plans to abandon. They're both on ff.net, but I can't link right now.
