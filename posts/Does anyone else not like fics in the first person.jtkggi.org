It can be the greatest thing I have ever read, a creation of god itself, but if it's in the first person, it really is not as good (in MY opinion) as it would be in the third person. I think it's just a preference, but, anyone else stop reading something that's in the first person because you can't stand all the "I"'s?


** Yes. At least in fanfiction. 1st person is REALLY hard to pull off as a writer and so far I have not found a single fanfiction that manages it. And I have been reading fanfiction for over 18 years.

But in normal literature I don't really have a problem with it since the writer usually knows what they are doing.

** I once hated the first person point of view, but nowadays I actually like it very much if it's written well. It opens interesting possibilities for the unreliable narrator, for example. I find it funny when the narrator's voice has a distinct tone. It can be sarcastic, condescending, biased etc., making it clear that it is the main character's person seeping into the narration. It can make the story more immersive than the third person point of view, because a distinct narrator's voice just doesn't fit the third person.

I'm currently writing a story in first person, but I'm planning of making a third person version and publishing it on another site once the story is finished. It's quite sad that readers don't give a story a chance for reasons like this.

Most stories that would /require/ tons of POVs wouldn't be written in 1st Person, anyway. In my story, I keep only use Harry's POV, so I don't have to worry about all that.
