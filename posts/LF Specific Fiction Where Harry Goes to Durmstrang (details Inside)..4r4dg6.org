This is a fiction I read about 8 months ago and at the time was incomplete. I'm hoping to find it again as I rather enjoyed the combat scenes in it.

- Gender of harry unknown.
- Durmstrang held the triwizard cup, hogwarts traveled to it.
- Hogwarts sent a delegation of champions to durmstrang.
- Durmstrang was made of many levels buried underground which each level having a different purpose. For example the library was it's own level, the cafateria was it's own level and so on. The visitors level was a long walk from the top.
