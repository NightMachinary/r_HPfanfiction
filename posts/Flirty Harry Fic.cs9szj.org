Humor/Romance/Adventure: Where Harry flirts with literally everyone he meets. Doesn't have to be the main point, but part of it.

Just a nice fic to un-depress after reading a verrrrrry dark fic.

An example is linkffn(Harry Potter, Rise From Dust)

If you can get past the cringy beginning cliched tropes, there are 7-8 chapters in the middle where the story is actually hilarious and cute. And then it gets cringy again but not nearly as bad as the start. (WARNING: It's a WBWL fic, but Harry's brother isn't a complete dick. Don't get me wrong, it's far from being a good, but it's a relaxing fic that doesn't need much attention.)

Do you really mean literally here or would you accept 75% of people?

*** Nah, not literally everyone. Just a Harry that is outgoing, charming, and clearly a warm-blooded male going through his teenage years. Doesn't have to be sexual flirting, but just fun and humorous.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

*** I quite literally love all of Darth Marrs other fics, but have avoided this one because "Worm" is reportedly a very complicated and often extremely dark fandom. Is it worth reading if you have never dabbled into Worm?

**** In general, you don't need a ton of Worm knowledge to enjoy worm fic. The original work is a very dark take on the superhero genre.

Worm in general is a masterpiece. If you can stand the very real possibility of your favorite character dying gruesomely, and you like really interesting characters, deep, thoughtful worldbuilding, and layered plots with satisfying payoff, you should probably read it. I can't emphasize enough how good it is.

Oh, good comparison:

Worm : Marvel

ASOIAF : Wheel of Time

Except since Worm is finished I can guarantee you that Worm has a satisfying ending.

****** That's a troll account. No point in responding to it.

To answer your question, this fic plops the reader down in a situation where the backstory of the characters and the overarching plot would probably just be confusing if you haven't read Worm.

******* So nothing is explained? That would be a big difference to all his other crossovers, wouldn't it? Because he always took pretty good care that everybody could understand what was going on, even if they have no idea about the fandom.

Well, maybe I will just give the first chapters a try sometime and see how it goes from there. But I don't really see reading Worm in my future. 1.7m words and a theme that does not have me interested from reading the summary, even though I love the genre. Also hear the protagonist is very unlikeable. Dunno if true, just something I have heard a few times.

******** That's odd. I've never seen someone describe Taylor as unlikable. Most of the discussion I've seen indicates she's an easy character to relate to. However, she is a character who winds up making difficult moral choices in situations where the 'good' option wouldn't save the day.

Regarding this fic, the author does include some backstory and explanation of the world in the course of the story, but there are other bits of context that get left unsaid. I think you have the right idea about giving the fic a try to see if you enjoy it.

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?
