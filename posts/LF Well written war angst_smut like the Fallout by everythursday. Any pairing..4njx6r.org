Haven't found anything comparable.


** My initial thought is probably Isolation by Bex-Chan linkffn(6291747)

There's a Dramione Tumblr page that has links to fics similar to The Fallout. Maybe you will find something there you'd like. -> [[http://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/post/49048836909/best-dramione-fics-you-read-similar-to-the][Link]]

Also in The Fallout tag on the above site, someone recommended The Risk-Reward Ratio as a similar fic to The Fallout as well. I haven't read this one but here it is anyway: linkffn(8806802)

#+begin_quote
  Set during TDH; a maimed, disillusioned Draco surrenders himself to the Order after he earns Voldemort's displeasure. Hermione's pity for him blooms into something more and he stops seeing her as just a mudblood, as they both discover there's far more to each other than they ever thought possible. Angst, smut, FEELS. Facebook: /theriskrewardratio

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.
