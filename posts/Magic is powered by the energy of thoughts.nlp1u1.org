From time to time I thought about alternates to the much loved magical cores and so I wanted to open this idea I recently had for discussion:

A witch or wizzard is more powerful if more magical and/or non-magical folk have thoughts about them.

It doesn't matter if people are inspired, terrified or just generally think wtf is even going on with that person. You could nicely explain weird behaviour by Dumbledore, as he just wants to meme the shit out of everyday life so that more people think about him, or even the revelation of Harry as the boy-who-lived, as more witches and wizzards would therefore think about him and make him a more powerful wizzard. Also the fear inducing behaviour by dear Tom may be explained (if you need another reaseon than Horcrux madness), as all the thoughts about him and the death eaters, as well as the taboo on his name, would only serve to strengthen them in return. Any thoughts on this?


** Hermione's the most powerful because whenever Draco says "Mudblood" everybody knows he means his silly crush.
