During one of his missions he captures a dark witch who seems more fascinating than the people his wife and friends have turned into and falls in love with her. She seduces him with promises that if he helps her escape, they'll run together on an adventure, but when he releases her, she disappears without him. Rita Skeeter discovers about Harry's regular visits to his former prisoner and publishes an article in which she spins the whole thing as Harry cheating on his wife, prompting his family and friends to shun him. Also he is suspended from his position for allowing a dangerous convict to escape and his name falls into this disgrace.

Now Harry has to go on an adventure and clear his name, as well as right his wrongs.

*** Funny... that's actually the name I had in mind for the story as well.

** That's sad... but it's a more believable breakdown on Harry's part as compared to his OOC freak out on Al in Cursed Child.

*** Well there's no story if there's no conflict. And I think Harry would likely grow bored with a quiet life (as portrayed by JK) considering that by seventeen he had more adventures than most wizards in their entire lives.

** Plot Twist: Harry picked up quite a few things from Dumbledore. He knows that the witch is planning to escape without fulfilling her promise, but capturing her will prove to be enough of a adventure. Harry 'accidentally' releases her, and when she is released focuses more on saving his subordinates from being killed by a dangerous witch with Wandless magic and thus allows her to escape.

After that his Head of Department wants to give him a slap on the wrist, but Harry begs her to suspend him and give him the mission of solo capturing the witch so that he can 'right his wrongs'.

*** I was more thinking of Harry's internal turmoil as he sees everything that he worked for falling apart because of a moment of vulnerability and a short lapse in judgment when I came up with the prompt. The witch herself I was thinking she wouldn't be overpowered like Voldemort, instead she'd be pretty crafty, but nothing that dangerous in a fair duel.

**** Yeah, this plotline with a smarter Harry will have some repercussions as well. The witch was using wandless Light and Colorchanging Charms but Harry's 'lapse of judgement' had him protecting his colleague from harmless spells. Also Rita Skeeter still publishes her article with lots of hearsay about a romance between Harry and the Dark witch.

If you wanted a story where Harry has an actual moment of vulnerability, have Harry sleep with the witch - she escapes after that. Either she seduces Harry into it, or Harry uses his power over her to get laid. It would give Harry lots of internal turmoil.
