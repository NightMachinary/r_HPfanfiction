  A slightly different encounter with Quirrell at the end of first year leads to new problems, new abilities, and a gateway to the extraordinary. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. Now in Year 3. Enjoy!

*** Just finished the first chapter, pretty good so far. I take it the philosophers stone is an infinity stone?

I wonder which one. Realty would probably fit best, with turning led into gold and extending youth.

**** I can neither confirm nor deny your guess. The question is revisited in a later chapter, but it won't be answered completely until much later.

That being said, it's a really good guess.

Not exactly but close. Quite interesting read with Harry and various Marvel characters. Strange was at least mentioned multiple times and the Scarlet Witch was somewhat important iirc.
