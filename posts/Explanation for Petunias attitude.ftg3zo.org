:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember much about the fanfic but it explained that the reason that Petunia was so hostile towards Harry is because he was a reminder of the world that took away her sister. Basically she hated magic and the wizarding world because if it never existed she would not have lost Lily. Does this sound familiar to anyone?


** That's basically the only viable explanation of her behaviour. When you start to work on description of real human being Petunia (instead of the fairy-tale exaggeration seen through the eyes of the abused rebellious teenager, which is what we have in the books), it is really hard to describe such real person well. So, I really like Petunia paranoid with the cause in linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality) (“magic destroys everything it touches”) or thoroughly sceptical Petunia in linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee). I have tried to explain it myself in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html#the-story-of-petunia][this chapter of my very Alpha, not even Beta story]] (I will soon move it to linkao3(23443483)).

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.

  Petunia's family is already perfect. She does not want to raise the child she found on her doorstep. So Petunia, self-described anti-adventurer, takes little Harry on a long drive in order to find Albus Dumbledore. But what good is a Volvo against the course of fate?

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
