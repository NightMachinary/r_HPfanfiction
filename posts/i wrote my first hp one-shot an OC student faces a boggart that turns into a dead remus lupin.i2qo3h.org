yes this is shameless self-promo. yes it is satirical and plays on some of the things cringy fanfics do the most often. yes its very short (<2k words) so it doesn't waste much time. i think its funny, i hope you do too. sorry its on wattpad, i know shes not very popular here (for very good reasons).
