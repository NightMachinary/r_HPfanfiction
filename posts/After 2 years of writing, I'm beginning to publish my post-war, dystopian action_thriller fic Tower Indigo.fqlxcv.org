This is my first fic and it has been over two years in the making.

/Tower Indigo/ tells the story of a revolutionist, alias Indigo 9733, who has been imprisoned for fifty years. Before his imminent execution, he chooses to break his silence and tell his story: who he was, the choices he made, and how he came to be a prisoner for the Ministry of Magic.

The protagonists of the story are Indigo 9733 (an OC), and Hermione Granger.

The story is roughly 150k words. I chose to write it all before beginning publishing because I really needed to maintain certain consistencies between many of the chapters. The entire fic is written, but I'm working on touching up the last few chapters. I've published chapter 1 on both FFN and AO3; expect there to be 16 chapters, with a new one being uploaded roughly every few days. (If final editing of the last few chapters goes quicker than anticipated, I may publish quicker.)

P.S. Inevitably there's going to be questions about bashing. There's no bashing, but Ron does go through some ups and downs in terms of character progression. He'll have quite a tough time in the first half of the story.

** My first impressions are that this is a well-written and seemingly though-out story. The main issues that I see so far are the potential for Ron bashing, the usage of tropes and the OC. With the introduction of any OC, there's always the pitfall of it being unnecessary, wish fulfilment, poorly thought out. There is no evidence as of the first chapter to point at any of these issues, a promising sign for the fic.

​

Ron bashing is certainly something I have concerns about. You say the Ron goes through some "ups and downs" which is fair but is also the lie many people will give at the start of their fics when they do Ron bashing. Many authors often go down the route of obvious Ron bashing while pretending that it's about Ron's character development. My concern is that Ron seems to be OOC, and not for the better. It seems like you've started the beginnings of a bash to create reason for your OC and Hermione to get together.

​

My biggest concern is the Hogwarts Charter and sovereignty. This is certainly a concept that has been used many times before. It's an obvious change from canon where Hogwarts was not sovereign and the government held power over Wizarding Britain. It seems to be used as a convenient way for Dumbledore to defeat Aurors and frankly seems lazy and brings up more issues than resolves them. You can strip magic? Do purebloods have a right to be worried about their magic being stolen? Dumbledore can't even effortlessly handle 8 aurors? Then how on earth is Voldemort an issue? It also implies that other unoriginal tropes might have been used which is a concern (ex: Ron bashing)

It's a great fic and the fact that it's been written before release is a good sign. I hope this was slightly more constructive (even if you disagree completely) than another "Great fic, update soon" type of response. I look forward to further releases. 3.5/5 and I anticipate the rating will rise.

*** Thank you! I really appreciate your candid feedback.

(Spoilers for chapter 1 below, as one might imagine.)

I empathise with your concern for the Ron bashing. To be perfectly frank, you may be right -- it's entirely possible that I'm misgauging Ron's arc in this fic. I know in earlier drafts, /both/ of my betas expressed their overt concerns about Ron bashing, and in fact, Ron went through several re-writes to get to where he is now! If you are sensitive to this concern, then you probably aren't going to like the next several chapters. I will stand by the claim that he is treated appropriately by the end of the fic, but we really aren't going to see that until the last few chapters of the story. If it helps, Ron really isn't a major part of the story altogether. The other thing I will say that is that everything that happens will make a *lot* more sense as the story gets into its final chapters, but I recognise that

- at best, that's not immediately satisfying, and
- at worst, it sounds like a cop-out.

Regarding the Charter and sovereignty: my personal take on it is that within the confines of Hogwarts, Dumbledore has immense power (both magical and "political"), but on the other hand, he's also... human. I debated for awhile on what the scene with the 8 Aurors vs Dumbledore would look like, and my fear was that making it too /easy/ for him to rebuff the 8 Aurors would diminish the Ministry's apparent power and authority; this is a particularly important concern as the story unravels. In a similar vein to my previous paragraph -- a lot of this will start making more sense (I hope) in later chapters. Again, that's not necessarily a satisfying or even /good/ answer, but that's how it panned out in this fic.

At any rate, I genuinely am appreciative of this feedback, and it's really great to keep these things in mind as I'm writing my future fics (I've already started on the next fic!). Finally, I just thought I'd mention, I don't want to come off as "my writing is best and you just don't get it", nor as "I'm super defencive and here's all the reasons I'm right". That said, I recognise there are some flaws in this fic; some minor, others perhaps not-so-minor. (I can give more details when the full fic is released!)

I hope you continue reading to see how your impression of the fic changes -- whether for better or for worse. But if you say, "I don't think I can read this fic any longer based on X and Y and Z", I can respect that too!
