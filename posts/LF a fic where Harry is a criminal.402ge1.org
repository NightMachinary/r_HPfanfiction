He can sell drugs, run weapons anything. It would also be cool if the muggle police were after him in some way. Thanks a bunch!


** I've never finished it, but hopefully linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood) would fit the bill.

  JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different? And how much different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it?
