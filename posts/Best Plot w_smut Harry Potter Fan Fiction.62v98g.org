  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Well... Can think of a few on the top of my head, but I have to insist that these stories generally can't be as good as those without smut.

linkffn(5790760) Seaching For The Power. For the first 20 chapters or so it's quite plotless though. Still have something going on there, but it's overshadowed by smut. Got better later on if you still haven't got bored of all the constant "action".

linkffn(11035814) Harem War, Vance McGill version, much better than the original. Too bad the update is slow and it stopped at a rather interesting point so...

linkao3(386831) That Need, from ao3. This is smut with slight plot of the trio + ginny discovering...well, that need. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for since it's rather light hearted, and the plot is not that noticeable, still, the story flows quite nicely...Oops, forgot that you don't like male slash. There will be some here so you can skip it if you want. Still a nice story that I want to recommend though.

Too bad I've never been able to find another similar story. The theme is rather unpopular despite its potential. Heck, even finding a smut story where the characters take time to explore their sexuality instead of jumping in like a cat in heat is already hard enough

** If you're up for slash, I have to recommend Danse Russe by Frayach linkao3(454721). Drarry. This is one of the most literary, gorgeous explorations of love that I've come across in HP fanfiction. It's dark, erotic and heart-breaking. This is /not/ a magical bond fic; "Bond" in the summary is just that - an emotional bond. Danse Russe is actually a sequel to calanthe's Mudhoney Trilogy, though you don't have to have read the Trilogy to follow Danse Russe. The MH Trilogy, FWIW, is a series of three /extreme/ BDSM Drarry short stories. It's definitely not for everyone.

Frayach has written a number of stories in the HP world, and she "specializes" (for want of a better term) in bringing dignity and beauty to sexuality, including some of the most extreme kinks. She only writes male slash, though, so maybe not your thing. However, if you're looking for top-quality, literary-style erotica, I can't recommend Frayach highly enough.

Edit to add: For a classic recommendation of high-quality writing/plotting + smut, Isolation by Bex-chan is a great choice. Dramione. linkffn(6291747)

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

  True Love. Soul Mates. They're just words until put to the test. Harry and Draco have a bond that was forged in the hell of the post-war years and pulled them both back from an abyss of nihilism and self-destruction. Nothing can break it, or so they believed. But True Love can demand sacrifices too great to bear and deeds too terrible to justify.
