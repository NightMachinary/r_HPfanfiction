I was just reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/dusx3g/if_you_ever_feel_like_an_underachiever_just/f780ok0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][This comment on this thread]] and, well, working with customer service can definitely make you want to murder people. So here goes an idea:

Tom Riddle was a genius, overachiever, hard-working child who, while not a complete saint, had a genuine desire to help people (those who helped him, at least) and make the world a better place (in his own terms), but never through violent means. That is, until he got a job at Borgin & Burkes. Riddle left as soon as he amassed enough galleons to kickstart his goals, but by then... it felt like the job had taken a piece of his soul.


** isn't this kind of canon? dealing with customers led him to commit at least one murder

** There is a one shot like that. It's Harry time travelling back to Tom's time at Borgins' (by mistake, because, well, it's Harry). And basically he decides to stay because he can stop Tom from becoming Voldemort just by taking him away from retail which is obviously what makes him lose his sanity (and then they just travel the world and live the good life or something).

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080]] It's called “don't fuck with florists” I think and it has tones of HarryXTom by the by if that's not your tea, Harry also can speak with death (or at least an emissary of) regularly
