*** So now his fans are getting annoyed even at requests? Sure Snape was a victim... in fact he never did a wrong thing in his entire life. So unfair

** The only fanfics with this are the ones where he isn't redeemable and that kind of plot is usually under independent!Harry and fanfics where Harry is sorted differently.

**** I think when it comes to Snape in fanfics unfortunately, he is either over exaggerated with his behaviors and therefore ultimately killed in a story, under exaggerated with his behaviors and therefore deemed in his right by the plot, or just completely grey like not mentioned much in a story or his character is completely different from JK's canon.

***** Yeah I agree. He's the type of character that you either love or hate.
