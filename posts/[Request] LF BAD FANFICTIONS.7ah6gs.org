Hooo boy. Let's see here.

- Harry Potter was hyper abused by Dursleys

- Emotionally dead and/or psychopathic Harry

- Karasuba instantly falls in love with Harry (which isn't so strange if you know anything about Seikirei, but still is pretty bad considering who it is)

- Karasuba is constantly grinning like a bloodthirsty idiot (despite even a simple google image search of the character in question having exactly zero 'maniacal grins')

- Harry calls a goblin 'sir', instantly garnering him the respect and admiration of the goblin nation---they are willing to bend over backwards to help him out for that simple act of courtesy that wizards are never able to do

- Harry's magic core was locked down because it was SOOOO POWERFUL, which the goblins remove said block

- Harry gets his horcrux removed by the goblins in one of the first chapters and ends up getting all of Tom's memories, giving him a massive boost in power

- Harry's wand has two cores of super ultra rare materials

- Harry's wand, upon first using it, produces two images of the creatures his core is from which (as stated in the narration) is totally not super rare but also means that Harry is super special and the best wizard ever to exist

Not that it matters anyway because

- Harry tries to single handedly defend against a military strike team at age (I think it was ten but it also might have been seven?) and gets shot; as punishment for his hubris in thinking he was so special, he gets his body reconstructed into being SUPER MAN who doesn't need a wand and also can bend steel bars with his bare hands

- Before even getting the above upgrade, he can fist-fight spar with Karasuba (a literal super human alien) for several minutes at a time

- The above upgrade also gives him grey hair with a violet streak through it because messy black hair just isn't special snowflake enough

- Winds up with SUPER SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE heterochromia violet and green eyes after a time skip and is mildly angsty about it because apparently it came from a time he got cocky and lost an eye but wanted to remember his mistake after having his body reconstructed again

- He gets like 5 other power ups that I'm sure I'm forgetting about. Author repeatedly insists in Author's Notes that Harry totally isn't overpowered every single time he gives a power up.

- He bonds with everybody's waifu seikirei, Akitsu

- Harry gets his NEWTs, top scores in every subject, at age 11

- While getting his NEWTs, he punches out the bodyguard of the daughter to the most powerful man in Japan because she was mildly irritating him. Gets a job tutoring her which is hardly mentioned ever again

- Lord Harry Potter-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Peverell confirmed by goblin blood test

- 'B-But muh greater good' Dumbledore

- Ronald 'I sure hope I can ride on Harry's coattails to hot babes and fortune' Weasley

- Writing that is riddled with typos. Probably at least one every other sentence.

- Writing that winds up extremely redundant. Especially when talking about how super special awesome Harry is or how much his Seikirei love him

Despite all that, I read the entire thing and am kind of looking forward to the next chapter. As ashamed as I am to admit it.

  When the Dursleys go to Japan, Dudley accidentally activates a security in MBI's locals that kill them. Now, what will MBI and Karasuba do with the child they found when they checked the Dursleys' car? Rated M for mention of torture and child abuse, and future language and gore. There will be some Dumbledore, Potters, and some Weasley bashing. You are warned. Alive!Potters

I know that many love this fic, but just as many hate it. Harry turns into the most annoying, pretentious little shit imaginable. I can never get past chapter 6.

**** A lot of the reasons people love or hate it don't even depend on the fic itself, the author had/has somewhat of a following based on rationality and logical thinking, and this fic is praised as showcasing those ideals. Which... it doesn't always do that well. So a lot of people hate it because of how he and his fans acted like this fic was the be-all and end-all of fanfiction and logical thinking, and a lot of people love it because they like the concept, which is admirable imo, but not implemented as well as it could be.

Fic itself is amusing especially in the first couple of chapters, drags in places, and is riveting in fewer places, but hell, at least the writing is halfway decent and it has an ending, which is more than you can say for 95% of fanfiction. I also give it props for no pairing.
