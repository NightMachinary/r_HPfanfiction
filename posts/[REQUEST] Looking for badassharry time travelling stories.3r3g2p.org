Basically I'm looking for a story sort of like Oops by michaelsuave, where harry travels back to the Grindelwald wars and ends up getting stuck there. I don't mind whether they're comedic or gritty i'm just looking for something good to read.


** I'm surprised linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991) hasn't been mentioned, it's a pretty great story, although it gives you a sense as you read it that you might be on some sort of weird hallucinogenic drug. It's certainly among some of the most unique fanfictions you can read.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** linkffn(Eternal Return by Silver Pard)

Not quite what you're looking for, but it's definitely worth the read.

linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord)

This one's exactly what you're looking for. Abeforth sends Harry back in time to kill Tom. Harry gets stuck there and ends up fighting Grimdelwald. Don't read the sequel though. It's pretty bad.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.
