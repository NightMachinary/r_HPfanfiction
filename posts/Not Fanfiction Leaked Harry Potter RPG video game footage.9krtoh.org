Why this is relevant to HPFF: according to [[https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/2/17927386/harry-potter-rpg-trailer-leak-open-world][this article]]

#+begin_quote
  Set in the 19th Century (1800's) Wizarding World, this 3rd person open-world action RPG game centers around your character with unique abilities who has eared a late acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You are a newly arrived 5th year student to Hogwarts that demonstrates a latent gift for magic with a unique ability to track and identify remnants of a potent ancient power.
#+end_quote

Lots of potential universe building can come with something like this. Plus, anytime new Harry Potter content comes out it's accompanied by an upswing in inspired writers and new fics.


** That gfycat is the first chance I've had to actually watch it, Youtube took it down for copyright.

Honestly, while I'm normally skeptical of all leaks until proven true, this looks like too much effort for someone to bother faking. I'm intrigued, although the summary raises a few eyebrows. (New student in 5th year? Really?)

Amusingly, someone on the [[/r/gaming]] subreddit was going on about how some of the spells would be absurdly complex to code...like the Summoning or Patronus Charm, which is kind of lolwut?

*** Perhaps more of a transfer student situation? Home-schooled to Hogwarts? Maybe Durmstrang or somewhere else. It was technically canon that some magical students don't have "enough" magic to be accepted at Hogwarts. Neville says at one point that his family was worried he didn't have enough. So perhaps for some witches and wizards they don't have enough to attend Hogwarts and are given a more menial education at home with parents. So you're now attending Hogwarts with "enough" magical power to be accepted to the school. Honestly we know so, so little about how Hogwarts actually works (and the magical community) considering the books are set in a post-war/pre-war time period that makes it clear how screwed up Voldemort's rise made things.

** It better be on PC. That's all I care about. Missing out on games like Spiderman and the upcoming Red Dead 2 is painful to a PC only gamer.

That being said the gameplay looks incredible, I wonder how many spells we will be able to learn, whether or not they will be all combat spells like Reducto and Expelliarmus or if we could learn fun stuff like transfigurations and charms? Also I wonder if there will be a "dark side" option, using the Unforgivables would be awesome.

The story and setting is meh for me, I don't care either way when it is set but the fact that you're a latent 5th year is weird to me and doesn't make sense lore-wise, as soon as a Muggleborn is born they are put on the register, at least the Hogwarts charter, though there is probably a huge book in the Department of Mysteries too. So you either get your letter and a visit from a teacher at 11 or you don't. Is Rowling a part of this? I guess we'll find out.

**** It's one of my favorites. And I read it months before I knew there was a prequel. Read the prequel and then figured out that Inter Arma was its sequel. I preferred Inter Arma's plot and I really love the idea that Dudley's daughter is a witch (which is how the story begins and how I found the story to begin with). It was a very satisfying story even though I'd never read the prequel, so you don't have to to understand what happened in the first story. To me it was a really realistic "next bad guy" that the Wizarding World would have to deal with. I hate the trumped up next Dark Lords and crazy beasts coming out of nowhere post-DH stories. But as we (somewhat vaguely) know, wizards and goblins have very strenuous bonds and have been on and off at war for centuries. So it tied in quite nicely.

For those interested the prequel is linkffn(7374621) and linkffn(7961051).

Maybe you mean that women during that period kept their hair pinned up?

Victorian era women typically kept their hair /extremely/ long but hidden (braided, pinned up, in bunns, etc. for propriety). Short hair wasn't fashionable until the "Roaring Twenties".

I'm always surprised at myself that I care so little about Harry Potter outside of fanfiction: I'm not super into the movies (haven't even seen Fantastic Beasts yet...) and don't give a shit about Pottermore and such. I'm super OCD about Fanfiction though. I don't get it. Part of it is - I think - that I'm worried stuff like that will ruin Harry Potter for me because it's "canon". There's a lot of shit from Pottermore or Cursed Child I'd rather forget.

*** Honestly, I think setting it at the turn of the century is a fun idea. It will be an iconic HP story as long as it is set as Hogwarts, regardless of the time period.

Personally, I think it would have been more exciting to have the fic set during the witch hunts so we could see what the muggle vs. wizard tension was like, but maybe the creators didn't want the game to seem like just another medieval fantasy rpg, or maybe they wanted to focus on more lighthearted ideas.

**** the witch hunts are more of an American historical thing (the Inquisition excluded). I like the idea of an 1800s setting, because it's something that is fresh in a familiar setting. I don't want to compare whatever the story of this game is to the fanfiction or canon i've read.

***** I was thinking more of the 14th-18th century witch burnings in Europe.

I've read fanfic that touched on the idea (characters reflecting on how that time shaped anti-muggleborn prejudice, etc), but I've never read one set during that period. I suppose that's why I'm interested in experiencing that.

*** Eh, really? I think it's an interesting premise. The massive time difference from canon means it's impossible for the developers to just phone it in with a rehash of canon events.

They'll have to put some actual thought into worldbuilding and characters if they don't want it to be garbage.

That's exactly the opposite of what I thought: they can make up whatever garbage they want and nobody will have ground for complaints since it's so far from proper canon. Afterall the sales are gonna come from the franchise, not the game's quality (that would only be a factor for eventual sequels).

***** I'd compare this scenario to the /Knights of the Old Republic/ games set in the Star Wars universe. KoTOR takes place thousands of years before the original trilogy, which means that it has all original characters and mostly original settings. However, the game is so well-made and iconically "Star Wars" that many fans are more attached to it than they are to the movies. It's still one of the most popular CRPGs ever made, even 15 years later.

So, there are cases where distancing the timeline has been done extremely well and was loved by fans. It all depends on execution.

***** I mean, yeah, it has the potential to end up as a flaming dumpster fire, but at least it'll still be vaguely interesting! Compare that to canon rehash number infinity, which is about as far from interesting as you can imagine.

Really, it'll heavily depend on the storytelling ability of whoever's making this.
