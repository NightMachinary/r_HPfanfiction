** *IT ALL STARTED WITH WRAKSPURTS- A oneshot by 888AthenaBlack888*

â€‹

"Your mind is so /clearly/ infested with /Wrakspurts/." Harry Potter said nodding to himself.

"... What?" Draco Malfoy gapped, face so utterly confused.

"Well Luna seems to think that the /Wrakspruts/ have teamed up with the notorious /Crumple-Horned Snorkack/, but she is so obviously wrong! Everybody knows the /Crumple-Horned Snorkack/ and /Wrakspruts/ are sworn enemies!" Harry exclaimed passionately.

"...What?" Draco Malfoy repeated, eyebrows scrunched up.

Harry seemed to remember Draco's existence at that moment. "Anyway, like I was saying, your head is filled with /Wrakspruts/. Get them out of your head, and then I'll be your friend." Harry said cheerfully as he /skipped/ out of the train compartment.

Draco Malfoy still kept staring at where his figure had once been. "...What?!?!"

_______________________________

Draco watched as Harry Potter was sorted into /Ravenclaw/ and skipped happily to the table of blue and bronze.

_______________________________

Later, when Harry told him (during an unfortunate Charms class where they had been chosen to be partners) that although /Wrakspruts/ and /Crumple-Horned Snorkack/ have always been sworn enemies, there /is/ a possibility that the /Crumple-Horned Snorkack/ has teamed up with the mischievous /Nargles/.

His reason for this theory?

Apparently Professor Quirrell's body is being controlled by the /Crumple-Horned Snorkack,/ under the influence of /Nargles./

Draco finds himself nodding along to Potter, even though he has no idea if any of those terms even exist.

_______________________________

He finds himself writing a letter to his father that afternoon,

/Dear father,/

/Hogwarts is going alright. Slytherin is without a doubt going to win not only the Quidditch Cup but also the House Cup. I will try out for a position of the Quidditch team next year. No doubt I will get in. I am a Malfoy, after all./

/My classes are going well. My studies are wonderful as well. I have been receiving all O's in my essays, other than Binn 's, where I received an E./

/Anyway father, I was wondering if you would look up some terms for me such as, Crumple-Horned Snorkack, Nargles and Wrakspruts?/

/I hope you and mother are in good health. Do send her my regards./

/Thanking you,/

/Yours truly,/

/Draco Lucius Malfoy./

/Heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy./

__________________________________

The letter he got back from his father /politely/ and /indirectly/ questioned his sanity claiming that such terms did not exist. His father had ordered the Elves to search the Malfoy library and had also asked various librarians about these terms, but had landed up with absolutely /nothing/.

/___/_______________________________

On the day of their last Charm's class of the year, Harry Potter gifts him a ring made with cork claiming that it will keep the '/Nargles/' away.

Draco still doesn't ask Potter what exactly /are/ Nargles or the other weird creatures he regularly mentions. His pride forbids him from doing that, but he keeps the necklace anyway. (Deep in his trunk where no body can find it. He would later keep it in the first drawer of the side table beside his bed as soon as he returned to the Malfoy Manor)

__________________________________

Draco Malfoy is left horrified, however, after first year just before stepping out of the Hogwarts Express to the Platform to greet his parents when Potter happily says that he looks forward to introducing him to his 'sister', the brilliant Luna Lovegood next year.

He further says that he has told Luna all about him, and even Luna agreed that Draco had a mild case of /Wrakspruts/ and would be delighted in telling him how to get rid of them completely when they meet next year. Potter also says that he would like to recruit Draco in his joint mission with Luna to stop the /Nargles/ once and for all, wishes him a happy summer and cheerfully skips away before getting lost in the crowd.

And that is how Lucius Malfoy finds his son on the platform- eyes slightly twitching and cursing /Wrakspurts/ under his breath.

*** If you're going to start off with this large font bold-faced title and use the word a dozen times, it might be worth actually spelling "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wrackspurt][Wrackspurt]]" correctly.
