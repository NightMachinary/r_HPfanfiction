Preferably Hermione-centric or at least ones where she has an important role

It can be a post-war or an AU where the war continues after Trio has graduated. I'm just sick and tired of reading about Hogwarts again and again, I want new locations and characters who are not teenagers anymore and have other worries and problems other than classes, homework and curfews.

Only requirement is no Ron/Hermione end game.


** If you like AUs, I've written "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", where the trio are Curse-Breakers searching for Atlantis as they travel the world. Harry/Hermione.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  Several years after the war, Hermione Granger moves 'across the pond' for a fresh start - and gets more than she expected when she finds herself in the middle of the Battle of New York!
