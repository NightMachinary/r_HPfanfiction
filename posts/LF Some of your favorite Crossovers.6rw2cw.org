I like AU, I like a confident competent Harry who knows how to get shit done. I especially like when that Harry is dropped into another Universe. Some of my favorite fics have ended up being crossovers of this type or similar.

The Havoc Side of the Force, The Katarn Side, Harry Potter and the Ascension of Ra, The Difference One man Can Make and of course Browncoat, Green Eyes are a few. linkffn(8501689; 11576387; 4828132; 2857962; 11132113).

I feel a bit like I'm getting to the end of the quality stories since I've read so many. But then again I hadn't read Havoc Side of the Force until just recently and how such a great fic eluded me all these years is just baffling so what do I know.

What are your favorites? What do you like to see in crossovers and /most importantly/ do you have any suggestions?


** They're both crack and Naruto crossovers.

  Luna Lovegood awakens during the Uchiha Massacre to find her brother has murdered the entire family; no one believes her when she says the Wrackspurts made him do it. Or how Naruto would turn out if Luna was an SI who lived life in Uchiha Sasuke's shoes.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

*** This fic has far too much Harry-wank. End game CSR is so absurd that it's difficult to think Harry can be of any use at all. His magic would be useful for stuff like "wards" such as the Fidelis charm, but there are people in CSR who can do bs reality warping shit far better than Harry can. He would only be useful in the beginning of the series. However, the author of that fic somehow goes on to make Harry some uber god-level character who can wreck everyone with ease. It's stupid. It would have been better to take Harry out of a combat role. Perhaps he could have helped out the alchemists or something. That would be far more realistic.
