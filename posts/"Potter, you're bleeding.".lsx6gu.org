Her first thought on seeing the droplets of falling blood was "this was going to contaminate the potion!"

But then reality caught up to her, and she suddenly realized that Potter was bleeding and /that was not normal/.

She slowly turned to her partner, and found a trifecta of trickling blood winding its way down his chin from his eyes and right nostril.

"Potter, you're bleeding," she said, giving him an uncertain look.

He paused his chopping, calmly placed down his silver knife, and ran the back of his hand over his eyes and nose.

"Buggering shite," he muttered, his foul language taking her aback. "Every fucking Monday. Goddamn Astarte, I told her I didn't want her fucking gift."

She glanced down: the droplets on the bench were shrinking, and a small plethora of particularly small yet venomous appearing flowers had begun to bloom from the wood, the blood shrinking into non-existence beneath the petals.

"I wouldn't touch those," Potter said with disinterest. "They'll either send you into tripping balls for a week, make you lovey-dovey for a day, or remove your inhibitions to the point where stabbing Pansy with your potions knife eighty-eight times feel like a perfectly normal idea."

She swallowed and edged away from the bench with heavy deliberacy. She felt something puncture her neck, and she reached up to pull away a thorn from her skin.

/What--/

"Ah shit, they're sprouting thorns."

Wow, she felt good! So warm! Was the potions classroom always this hot?

She blinked, an odd blue haze colouring her vision.

Man, she never noticed it before, but Potter looked cute! Such beautiful green eyes! Oh Merlin's ass cheeks, her hands could touch anything but themselves! The Daily Prophet needed to know about this!

She heard a sigh; a soft, heavenly sound that made her heart swoon.

"Professor, it's happened again. I'm gonna need to drag Greengrass to the Hospital Wing for an antidote."

An antidote? No, she didn't want this to end! I bet it was Pansy who put that idea into his head, the bloody bitch!

"Shit, grab her wand!"

She giggled and tried to hurl a piercing hex at Pansy's pug-like face, while her other hand grasped for Harry's discarded potion's knife...

​

tl;dr: since a young age, Harry ends up having "blessings" heaped on him by old gods because he unknowingly does them solids. He's gotten so used to these things that he just rolls with them, astounding/horrifying people around him.

In fact, in Mycanean Greece, she was actually a goddess of the underworld and that carried over to regular Greece as the wife of Hades.

********* Historically speaking, Persephone was an underworld goddess long before Hades came into the picture. It's actually a bit questionable just how associated Persephone was with More (the spring goddess version).

Even if you just go by the 'classic' myths generally accepted as canon today, you'll notice that she's the only godly wife to be a monarch of equal standing to her husband in their realm. The original works also have her most common epithet as "Dread Persephone," recognizing her position as a goddess of the underworld.

***** Alternatively this has as a problem the fact that anyone he speaks to will believe /anything/ he says, even if it is joking or if he is wrong and the other person should know it. On the one hand now Voldemort believes he is actually Quirrel and Snape knows with unrelenting certain that he absolutely /must/ ask Hermione any and all questions he ever has (from class work for all years and experimental potion theory to relationship and war-strategy advice) and that no matter what, she will definitely have the right answer (even when she /definitely/ doesn't and is in fact extremely weirded out).

But on the other Hagrid is now sure beyond any doubt that Snape is trying to steal the philosopher stone; Sirius is absolutely and unquestioning certain that he was the one to sell James and Lily to Voldemort despite not even being the secret-keeper (on the flip-side though Pettigrew is also absolutely certain that he is in fact just a normal rat) and the whole school -including Draco and Ginny- are sure that Draco Malfoy is the true heir of Slytherin, even when he is sent to Azkaban and eventually executed in an attempt to stop the attacks culminating in Tom regaining a body much earlier since Ginny is physically incapable of growing suspicious of her blackouts having anything to do with the chamber.

*** Genuine question: why is Merlin the one that gifts him incubus powers? Keep in mind that the only conception I have of Merlin is the BBC Colin Morgan adaption, where his special power is probably luck more than anything else.

*** Astarte is the goddess of fertility, sex, love and war. Coincidentally, her name also bears similarity to the genus of flowers called the “Aster”, hence the flower motif. It also symbolizes love and wisdom.

Edit: And since Lily's family has a habit of naming their children after flowers, you could say that this is the goddess's amused way of continuing that tradition by gifting these powers to Harry.

***** An anime. Summing it up the gods have this weird rule that instead of solving someone's problems they instead have to pick someone from other world and send them there to do it. Story follows a guy who while OP is pathologically, obsessively, compulsively and maniacally intent on stacking all cards he can get his hands on in his favor before even thinking about going into a fight and then mercilessly throwing everything he got into the enemy from the get-go before throwing his thump-cards into making sure that even the ashes are properly destroyed, every ep got me ROTFL, the guy petty much turns being paranoid into an art-form to such an extent that even Mad-eye would think it was going too far.

Oh yeah, the name of the goddess is actually Histart, but they are both phonetically alike enough that I immediately thought of her.

**** I don't usually watch anime -- I've watched an occasional movie or three late at night on the old Sci-Fi Channel years ago, but the closest I've come to following one was RWBY (which was more like a Western mutant of the genre, I suppose?). Even then, I lost interest as time went on due to Rooster Teeth's inconsistency in the seasons following Oum's unfortunate passing.

I mostly look at the actual, real-life deities and such than media adaptations of them, unless it's a direct crossover idea/prompt (such as HP/Riordanverse).
