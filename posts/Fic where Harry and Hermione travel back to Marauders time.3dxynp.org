  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

One of my favourites that I don't see recommended here at all. Not set at Hogwarts, however, but after James and Lily have graduated.
