Between muggleborns, their friends/families in the know, government officials, reckless wizards, muggleborns that return to the nonmagical world but who still use magic and modern technology the wizarding world becomes the worst kept secret. Just an idea that popped into my head. Any fics along this line. I'd love to see a crack fic where Purebloods are the only ones that don't know that everyone knows about the wizarding world and everyone just lets them keep on thinking that.


** I could see something even a step farther where English purebloods are the only ones who don't know. Have an encounter with a Pureblood American, starts talking about how his grocery store banned the locomotor charm on the carts because wizards don't pay enough attention to them when they put the charm on.

"You mean muggles know about magic?" "Yeah dude, we had to tell them like 20 years ago once the Internet and satellites happened." "They didn't try to imprison you to make you use magic?" "Uhhh we have wands bro. They have nukes, we have wands. Decided to just call it even-stevens."

**** I mean it's a huge generality, but they have a lot more than "nukes". They have smart technology that can pinpoint missile drops on a particular block like Diagon Alley. They have snipers capable of taking out a target from 1/4-mile away.

Meanwhile, it only takes one wizard to cast an Imperius on the president and they have control of the entire U.S. government. It just takes one well-trained Legilimens spy and they can know the enemy's every move. Oh, and they can literally disappear through apparition.

I'm just thinking that in the general scheme wizards and Muggles could reach a truce similar to the Cold War standoff and realize that absolutely no good would come from starting a war between the two.

******* I have thought about it a lot, and while I can kind of see them being able to hide in the 90s. The internet is simply too prevalent for it to be viable nowadays. Unless you have global mind/reality manipulation active all the time (which they clearly don't have), you need to be geographically isolated to be able to realistically hide from all of human kind. The Percy Jackson series literally do have global reality/mind altering powers ensuring their secrecy, and they can do that because they're /gods/, but the HP world doesn't, and I can't really see anything less than that working.

Another way hiding /might/ plausibly be done would be having spells that are as good as advanced AI living on the internet to erase all information of their presence. But you still have intranets, and direct line-to-line communications that can be set up fairly easily. It might hold for a while, but it would inevitably fail in a rational world.

So I have decided to simply give all HP works the benefit of the doubt for the entire thing. It's not that hard a thing to ignore. It helps that so little of the HP world is actually set in a time where computers and the internet have become omnipresent.

So even if the Internet picks something up about Diagon Alley, anyone who reads the data will be affected by the charm. Yeah if magic had some sort of power/range constraint, then this wouldn't be likely, but HP magic is very weird and handwave-y.

Now I would be interested to see a story where an AI /does/ notice magicals, but can't tell people because of observation-prevention charms affecting biologicals.

******* I remember reading one speculation/explanation that intrigued me. By all rights, a place like Diagon Alley should be impossible to truly hide from the air, especially in the modern era. Either the spells used to conceal it from view fail to work on cameras and the like, or they leave an obvious hole in London where there should be something but isn't.

The proposed explanation is that space sort of wraps around it in such a way that from the outside, it all appears contiguous, while the Alley itself is in a sort of pocket.

There are probably holes in it that I'm not seeing, but it was an interesting take that I hadn't seen before.

​

also, i remember reading something similar about the hogwarts express. like the train track has to run across a lot of land. so basically muggles will step onto one side of the track and come out on the other (not realising there's actually land in between). i feel like it would be really easy for wizards to fool muggles into thinking there isn't anything there.

******* A version of my head canon is that muggle-repelling charms are really more dark and insidious than most realize. They don't necessarily prevent muggles from discovering the wizarding world, but consistent exposure eventually just breaks their brain.

You have the classic "oh I forgot to pay rent!" thing area charms do, mostly harmless in small amounts, but if you run into it a lot it can cause all sorts of psychological damage.

I'd like to think part of Hermione Granger's decision to keep her parents mostly out of the loop about all the details at Hogwarts is that she realizes they they can never really be a part of the same world in an intimate capacity and wants to spare them. Simply walking through Diagon Alley would probably be terrible for most muggles.

CCTV, Internet, and Satellites are Confunded from the top down -- not to the objects themselves (magic and technology don't play well) -- but to the people at the the top. The ISPs, the government officials, etc.

The International Confederation of Wizards oversees the Statute across various nations and its main function is keeping the wizarding world a secret. They have plenty of muggle-borns that understand computers and engineering well enough to hit the people they need to in order to make any magical conspiracy theories seem like total nonsense.

****** I'd always imagined that the Statute of Secrecy, which just kinda gets accepted as "how the world works" by Harry and his friends, is actually this massive, planet-wide ritual and maintaining it consumes a huge portion of the magical world's resources.

The SoS isn't a law, or a spell that was cast once, it's an ongoing effort that is constantly interfering with the muggle world, preventing magic from being discovered. Obliviators and such exist because every time a magical accidentally breaks the SoS, the ritual gets harder to maintain, and intentionally breaking the SoS merits an Azkaban sentence because intentional violations require the ritual-maintainers to do something like sacrifice a unicorn or whatever.

All of this is completely out of sight to Harry in the same way that, say, the intricacies of international diplomacy and multi-lateral trade treaties are completely out of sight to any normal teenager. Even the adults - you've gotta figure that 99% of the citizens in any first-world country are mostly ignorant of complex, global systems and structures in the real world (stop a random person on the street and ask them "what is the petro-dollar" or "where does money come from" or "what were the Nuremberg trials"), so we could expect it would be the same in HP-verse.

Sure, but how do they get to that point? First they have to know what target they want to kill and why, then they have to find out when or if that target will be outside a magical location, then they have to get set up --- and all for one wizard.

It's likely their Imperiused boss will tell them to pack it up and go home before they get even past the first step. Same for pretty much everything else. Muggles might be able to get in a few attacks, but then, like you said, Imperius. We already know the wizards have no problem infiltrating the muggle government (Ch 1, Half-Blood Prince).

The war wouldn't ever lift off in the first place, but if it hypothetically did, it would only be a truce from the perspective of muggles. Their mind-controlled leaders will tell them they're not going to war anymore, the public will accept it because they generally don't give a shit for things that don't personally affect them, and wizards will go back to doing their own little thing.

...As opposed to muggles who don't even know wizards /exist/?

I greatly dislike this idea that wizards don't know shit about the muggle world. Most wizards have some connection to the muggle world, whether it be a muggle-born friend or relative, being a muggle-born themselves, or simply living in both worlds.

Just because Arthur Weasley doesn't know much, or the Daily Prophet had to explain guns, doesn't mean your average wizard knows nothing about the muggle world. Kingsley Shacklebolt managed to work under the Prime Minister without rousing any suspicion whatsoever, and the Prime Minister knew about magic.

They might not know every little detail, but if you're going on the assumption that muggles will learn whatever wizards can do then you have to do the same thing for wizards. From what we know of canon, there's nothing stopping wizards from Imperiusing or replacing world leaders. They waltz right into secure offices whenever they want. The British magical government can arrange for the leaders of other muggle governments to have their mind manipulated.

This kind of war wouldn't be fought like we've fought our wars. It would be nothing of the sort. The large population of muggles doesn't matter, their weapons can be used against them, and they're not going to be bypassing magic without the help of other wizards.

********** mindcontrol - cycle people out, compartmentalize important information, never even come into physical contact with the people on top. HP wizards have to know where they're going before they can get there.

Reaching a little into the high tech, force people to use computers often, and have programs on those computers to measure and study those people akin to adsense. If one day someone is detected acting counter to how they usually do, they are marked as suspicious. They are investigated, and if worst comes to worst, neutralized. This would also work against Polyjuice. After doing this enough, they would hopefully stop trying. Additionally, I wonder if the Imperious Curse has a visible effect on the brain? If so, CAT scans could help detect it. The Curse has to be vocalized, so powerful microphone devices set up to detect that and "phone home" a message or alarm could help. Ideally they would also go off if removed or destroyed, and be implanted. /If/ the Imperio has a detectable effect on activity in the brain, some form of implant that reads brain activity maybe? Set it to fry you if you get Imperio'd?\

When it comes to polyjuice, it would be even easier to detect, especially using things like pattern learning software, or even simple code words. Additionally, magic itself seems as though it would be easy to detect, as it is claimed to have an affect on electronics. If you have a way to measure fluctuations in the electronics, then a constant or sudden change could be a sign of magic. This could be used to detect wizards /and/ their hiding spots. Given time, and equipment, you could presumably use this to map out their locations.

High technology would be our only chance of combating hp style wizards, along with, hopefully, muggleborn sympathizers. Assuming muggleborn sympathizers, they could be used to ward rooms against apparition. Failing that, there are other ways it could be combated, such as changing rooms using partitions and such so that even if they did get a picture or somesuch they'd splinch themselves, and be relatively easy to combat. Or even better, drug them and stick a bomb in them, so that when they get back home they explode.

I am just saying, too many bombs and simply not enough wizards. Plus, between codewords, routine and experience they would figure out that someone is being mind controlled. Especially if they know that is possible and aren't caught by surprise.

****** No, bunkers are designed for long term survival. The wizard's government building isn't, unless they repurpose it. How many people can they keep there? For how long?

I am not saying that wizards are helpless, but the argument of "they can't use nukes, so it is even steven" doesn't really fly. There is plenty of tech for small and targeted attacks. And that is assuming bio/chem weapons don't start being used if things get out of control.

And we are talking about a war scenario. At that point, I don't think wizards are going to be considered "their own civilians". Literally every wizard is a potential combatant because of the fact that they all have magic and wands.

This trope makes me cringe. It just shows that the author is lazy, and goes for what's possibly the least imaginative trope ever.

** I'd love to see this. I have a few things vaguely related though. first the +4+ 5 I wholeheartedly recommend:

[[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Muggle_Summer_Wizards_Fall/index/][Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall]] Harry has the support of the Queen of England. Mixed muggle and magical squadrons, a lot of the characters are "c-mugs" or card carrying muggles, muggles with a card from the ministry saying they know of magic from a family member.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen]]) With his trial coming up harry decides to go to the highest authority in the land for help. The military has magical squadrons made out of disillusioned muggleborn.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7258617/1/Escalation]]) cracky fic about Dumbledore vs a single computer in the tax office.

Chapter 3 of Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/3/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]) describes the future harry come back from, A world where the muggles wiped out the wizarding world due to voldemort's muggle hunts. Good examples of how it might be possible to defeat notice me not charms using computers.

Edit: I forgot one Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536445/1/The-Lily-Potter-Foundation]]) Harry makes a foundation dedicated to orphans, education, and equality. To help with education he decides to make a magical primary school and it gets put under a new squib run division of the Department of Education. More talk of how many muggleborn leave the magical world.

Then the other 3

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406279/if-wishes-were-ponies][If Wishes Were Ponies]] A My Little Pony: Friendship is magic crossover by the same author as Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly. Diplomatic channels are opened between the Ponies world and Muggle Brittan, the ponies decide that because they weren't one of the signers of the Statute of Secrecy, that it's fine if they show magic to Muggle Britain. The UK military start picking up on the magical world using some of the same techniques as in Amalgum.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549]]) Harry's flight at the beginning of the fifth movie gets recorded in a Superbowl commercial. A bit dry though.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/371039/magic-school-days][Magic School Days]] Cracky crossover with MLP:FIM, one subplot that was just starting before I stopped reading because of super excessive literal dumbledore bashing (random characters start hitting him with baseball bats) was of muggles figuring out about the magic world because wizards didn't understand computers well enough to wipe evidence from them.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** I've never really seen a fic like that, sadly, because I had almost this /exact/ idea a couple of years ago, and it made me giggle myself silly. I jotted it down in my prompts doc but never posted it anywhere because I'm super shy about things like that. ...But since it's on topic, I might as well paste it here:

The existence of magic is an open secret. Literally everybody in the world knows it exists--but the wizards don't know that. They try desperately to uphold their Statute of Secrecy, Muggleborn students pretend to be new to the concept of magic, and Muggles pretend not to know anything, all while snickering to themselves behind the wizards' backs. It's not even a malicious thing, at least in general; it's just a kind of worldwide prank, like, "Look at these silly wizards trying to hide their magic, aren't they cute?" Kind of the way some wizards (coughArthurcough) regard Muggles, actually.

Maybe Muggles treat magical villages/areas like tourist destinations, sneaking in and pretending to be foreigners so they're not outed as nonmagical. The wizards don't know why there are always so many visitors from other countries, but that's the way it's always been, so they just think it's normal.

Maybe Obliviations are a cause for bragging rights ("I'm missing an hour on Friday." "Well I'm missing three on Tuesday!" "Wow, that must have been something huge!") or maybe they don't even work on Muggles and they just play along with the wizards until they leave.

I mean, HP wizards are /so very bad/ at being discreet-- running around in robes and nightdresses and hilariously mismatched clothes? Chatting loudly in public about Platform 9 3/4? I'm honestly kind of amazed this wasn't actual canon, at least to a degree.
