So a long time ago I read this fanfiction where harry had an uncle. This uncle was in the military because he was thought to be a squib when he was a really late bloomer. Uncle was then trained by native Americans and then came back to the UK to train harry. It was a good fix but I forgot the title.

  This is a what if story. Canon will be followed when it fits my story. Harry is powerful but not a superhero, Harry and Hermione the main pairing, rating may change down the road.
