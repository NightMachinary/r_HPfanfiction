Looking for a fic where Harry just kinda hangs out. Not sure how to phrase it, but rather than getting confrontational or saying an incredibly "witty" comeback when insulted, he just is fine with it. The less edgyness the better.

***** The ironic thing being he is more active than in canon, but every second sentence someone mentions how lazy he is.

****** Yeah honestly I agree. Also I think working harder in order to not work as hard would be more of a Slytherin trait than a Hufflepuff one. It's a cute fix anyway, but a bit misguided.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Your looking for apathetic style Harry stories. If I remember when I get home, I think I have a few. Although there is Harry the Hufflepuff series on fanfiction. I think it's in 4th, or 5th year last I checked.

In this, Harry is a dragon and nearly invulnerable, so he ends up being super chill about a lot of things. Extremely non-edgy. He doesn't even mind the Dursleys acting like their canon selves.

** Not 100% sure what you're looking for but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12085137/1/Seven-Normal-years-of-Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff]] by: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5676693/TheLemonsWillSeeYou][TheLemonsWillSeeYou]] was a really good fic. It's also really chill.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU
