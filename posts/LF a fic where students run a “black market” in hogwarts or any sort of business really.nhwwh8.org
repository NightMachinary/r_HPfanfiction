  Excuse me- do you know which platform has the train to Hogwarts?” Leon stopped and turned to the voice- messy (like serious bedhead messy) black hair, round glasses and white owl.Even as he started towards them the guard was asking, “Know what part of the country it's in?”"Er.” the boy,Harry Potter as in the Main Character, said.Just when the guard started to lean towards annoyance, Leon reached them, wrapping an arm around Harry's shoulder (ignoring the flinch). “Sorry, mate. Me and my cousin got separated, he knew the train would be heading towards our boarding school- he'll be joining me at Hogwarts this year!- but not much else, we'll be heading over to Platform 9b now.”

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
