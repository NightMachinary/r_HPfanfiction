** Two points:

1) Many people have emotional attachments to this Series.

2) Commercially sold books aren't necessarily better. In fact, I'm going to claim that the best HP fanfictions are actually better than most commercially sold fictions.

Of course, being free and lacking quality control means that a larger percentage of fanfictions is crap as compared to commercial products. But because of the shear volume of fanfictions, even a tiny fraction of them means you have thousands of great stories to read.

**** My estimate is 98% of fanfics are crap, 1.5% mediocre (including that CC), and 0.5% good to great. Considering there are about 1 million HP fanfics, 0.5% means you have about 5000 stories to read.

**** Considering that something like Twilight got published with its massive grammatical errors and awkward writing style, let alone how bad the plotline was (though the editors may have thought that the target audience wouldn't care), quality control in the published world is sadly often times not much better. Or for a better example, something like Adventurers Wanted, which is a series that starts off very mediocre, and very clearly massive wish fulfillment. The new books are far better though.

*** In addition to the ones [[/u/SilverCookieDust][u/SilverCookieDust]] wrote, as many of them are great reads, I will point you towards “The Kingkiller Chronicle” by P.Rothfuss and “The Witcher” saga by A.Sapkowski. In addition there's U.K.Le Guin's books, in particular the “Earthsea” series, but I will be the first to admit that the last books in the series can get a bit ... preachy, yes, on certain topics, and depending on how much that annoys you in fantasy stories they may or may not be a worthy read for you.

Then there is stuff like “Metro 2033” and its sequels by D.Glukhovsky, but that's science-fiction rather than fantasy so it may not be your cup of tea. But it's a great read if you enjoy post-apocalyptic stuff.

** Personally, I became involved (like many people) with the HP series at a very young age. As I got older, became an adult, etc, and got more interested in literature, I realize that a lot of the situations portrayed in HP, as far as character decisions, whatever, probably would have turned out a lot differently in a book geared towards mature adults.

Fanfiction is my way of making those two things meet, given, that I prefer Fanfiction that is serious in nature and deals with primarily adult characters.

...and maybe sometimes I think Harry and Draco had a lot of sexual tension, and it has gotta' get resolved sometime, right?
