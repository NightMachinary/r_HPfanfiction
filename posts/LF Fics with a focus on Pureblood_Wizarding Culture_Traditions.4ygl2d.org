Lately, I've been interested in seeing more of people's ideas on what Wizarding (or 'pureblood') Culture and Traditions is/are. The canon view of magical society being basically the muggle one with some magical stuff swapped for the mundane, while interesting, is something I'm a little bored of seeing.

We know that the International Statute of Secrecy was put into effect in 1692, while /Quidditch Through the Ages/ implies that secrecy was almost the de facto magical policy for some time before that. This means that at the start of Harry's first year at Hogwarts, there has been /at least/ 299 years for magical culture to have either diverged from muggle culture or continued it's evolution along different paths. So let's see some fics that have a different wizarding culture beyond the "different yet still kinda similar" thing we see in canon.

I'm not interested in fics that have that *God Awful*â„¢ "the Queen is actually in charge of the British Magical World" shit, or fics that hold the view that wizards are 'stuck' in the Victorian (or older) era and have yet to 'advance' to the Age of Enlightenment, let alone modern times. Nor am I interested in 'Family Magic' which I think is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubw5N8iVDHI][an 'eh' idea usually done poorly.]]

I'd prefer fics that are great/good, but I'm also open to "so bad it is good" fics. As long as they aren't incredibly stupid, and have good spelling and grammar I'm willing to give it a try.

I have already read the following:

** This is secretly my favorite genre of fics (as evidenced by my own story on your list, and the constant recommendation of "on the wings of a phoenix"). Sadly, I'll probably never get around to finishing year two of Bonfires since I started writing a festival scene and got stuck on writing an original song for it, and got burnt out by trying to make it good.

I would recommend a story called "Out of the Night" by raining ink. I'd place id above all the stories on your list (except perhaps on the way to greatness, but the stories do different things). The author took it down from FFN as she wanted to get published and removed any association to fanfiction from her life, but copies of the story are readily available with a quick google search.

I have to agree with you there. There are so many possibilities, yet we always get this faux-Victorian stuff that is almost never well done.

It's a self-insert as Draco's sister. So you can kinda see it from the purebloods' point of view. Not sure if it's what you're looking for but I really enjoyed it. Just a shame it's abandoned, probably one of my top fics that I would love to see an update for. Might just be me though since I love Self-Inserts and it's something I miss out on after coming from the Naruto fandom which has plenty of SI fics.

** This linkffn(11656250) moves slowly, but Harry has a Slytherin cousin who teaches him a Druidic/Victorian wizarding culture. The prequel linkffn(11591125) takes place before Hogwarts if you want Harry's backstory.

This author writes a ton of Pureblood culture romance fics, most with female Harry/Tom riddle. [[https://fanfiction.net/u/1614796/Ell-Roche]]

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
