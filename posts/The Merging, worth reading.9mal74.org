I'm looking at The Merging and wondering if it is worth reading. It's nice and long and still ongoing which is good. So I am just wondering what the communities thoughts on it are. I would prefer if this were to be free of any major spoilers.


** It's viewed as pretty good. Some of the later chapters introduced something that made me stop reading, but your opinion may differ.

*** May I ask what it was that made you stop reading? I would like to know what I am getting into before I get 400k words in.

**** Harry develops some magical illness that's meant to kill him. I doubt it will, but it seemed so pointless and contrived that I didn't really care anymore. Mind you, this development came after months and months of no updates. If you binge read it, it may come across differently. But as I waited months for an update, I was disappointed and didn't feel like paying attention to any new ones. I'm pretty sure it's one of the last 5 chapters that it happens.

***** Personally I find it a good idea to at least have a consequence to his OP was of dealing with Tom's little trinket. Often it's just easy deal but here at least there is a bad side to it.

***** Ok well I will give it a try. Hardly the first time I've read a massive story only to quit or for it to stop updating.

But yeah more than once I've read what's clearly meant to be a dramatic, tense situation in a fic that loses all its power the moment you realize the character(s) involved are too pivotal to the plot to be killed off, and you're only halfway through to boot.

** I'm reading it right now and so far it seems great, Harry isn't instantly OP and it seems like he's actually going to earn his strength which is my favorite type of fic. I'm only on chapter 6 though so I don't know if it plummets or not

** I'm still not sure about this one. I started reading it and got to about chapter 12 then stopped for some reason. I happened to see it in the Library of my mobile app and realised I couldn't remember anything about the story or why I'd stopped reading.

So I've restarted it. I'm up to chapter 7 again now and I still can't decide whether or not to keep going. The writing is decent, although it sometimes come over as a bit mechanical, and sometimes totally cringeworthy. Mainly when the Founders are speaking: for instance "Welcome to the Room Where Some Seriously Awesome Shit Happens, or as Rowena likes to call it, the Room of Requirement" is apparently something Godric Gryffindor would say.

But the reason I think I forgot about it before is that so far, essentially nothing has happened. It's just... stuff. Nothing has really stood out.

I'll keep reading for now but I'm far from convinced that it deserves the hype it gets on here.

Maybe I have low standards but I think that's actually kind of funny.

**** I find it destroys the immersiveness of the story. The word awesome didn't come in to existence until about 1600 and didn't achieve its modern sense until the 1960s. Shit was totally taboo for much of its existence. There's no way that a respected wizard like Gryffindor would be using language like that.

There's no need to try to write period appropriate dialogue - A Long Journey Home is a good example - but don't use wildly /inappropriate/ dialogue.

** I enjoy it, far from the the most sophisticated story and its not exactly new ground but it is very well written. I do agree that the last few chapters have been shaky but the author has surprised me a couple of times before so I still hold out hope.

I think what I enjoy the most about it is that the romance side of things are actually handled almost believably, there is a lot more getting to know each other and companionship and actual character traits while none of that god awful love at first sight garbage that seems to clog up 99% of all fanfiction stories. It is by no means a romance story, far more time is spent on the action and the friendships he has with other characters, but it all ties together very well.

Ongoing might be a generous term too, I think it has updated a few times in the last 12 months but maybe 5 times in the last 3 years or so.

Despite its flaws I would say its worth reading, definitely in the upper tier for fanfiction. I will also caution that it occasionally it will totally veer off where the plot seems to be going, but I would actually put that as a positive given that so many authors are content to retread the same ground with even worse stories.

** I would recommend reading it. The story delves into the aspects of combat. It also emphasizes constant work at bettering oneself, so Harry isn't an equal of Voldemort immediately.

** Maybe. The first few chapters are interesting and exciting, but for me it really jumped the shark at a point and I can't stand it anymore.
