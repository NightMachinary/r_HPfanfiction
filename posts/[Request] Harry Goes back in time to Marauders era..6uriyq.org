  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** linkffn(windshear by ChiLord), linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence), linkffn(Lone Traveler:Professor of Defense by Dunulos) are all stories where Harry goes back to that era to help. Stepping Back only has one chapter to go before its finished and will be continued in a sequel (according to the latest authors note anyway), but the other two are complete.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
