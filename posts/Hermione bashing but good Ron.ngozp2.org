Usually when I read bashing fics it's got both of them being bashed but I feel like reading something where it's just Hermione being the bad guy

Thank you!

  Severus Snape's loyalty has always been to Harry, not to Dumbledore or the Order. When he finds out that Harry is a horcrux and Dumbledore intends to have him killed, Severus goes to the Dark Lord with the information in an effort to save Harry's life, and in doing so changes the fate of the world.

  When Harry's nightmares get to much he finds solace in the most unexpected of places... Never abandoned, will update until complete. Merely sometimes forgotten in the face of ravenous plot bunnies.

** Harry Potter and the Siren's Song is an oldie that does this. Hermione is pretty awful and yet Ron is a chill dude and remains Harry's best bud when he hooks up with Daphne.

  When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

** I hesitantly reccomend linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix). It's very much not for everyone, but I read it pretty early on when I was getting into fanfic, so I have a bit of a soft spot for it.

** There are some hints of this in Motivations, by Jeconais. Nothing as bad as some: no love potions, evil plots, or such, but it does imply a few things with Hermione. Rather understated as 'bashing' goes and I'm not sure it counts as bashing, as Hermione's issues look a lot like her canon ones.

Ron on the other hand is very much book Ron, though he grows up a bit at the end too, so bonus.

** I haven't read The Red Knight but I've heard it has what you are looking for.

The second one is Fate, which I've read and really recommend. It has Ron as the protagonist and Hermione is frequently held responsible for her flaws.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
