Dumbledore constantly says Harry survives the AK because Lily puts her life on the line.

But doesn't that only work under the assumption that Lily is the only mother in history to have ever sacrificed herself for her son.


** You're not supposed to look deeply into the mechanics of how it works. It's an "ancient and mysterious charm", which is a Dumbledorism that means, "It's magic, stop asking questions!"

The purpose of Lily's sacrifice in the narrative is to be one part of a recurring motif, the power of A Mother's Love. It appears over and over in the story, in the power of Merope's love (or her lack of it) in shaping her son's life, the power of Molly's love to allow her to beat Bellatrix. We're told that Merope gave up on life and died, and Molly can somehow summon up the power to beat Bellatrix, who had previously taken down Alice Longbottom, trained Auror and original Order member.

It's a contrivance for the sake of the plot. You might notice on re-reading HP that JKR does that sort of thing all the time.

** Harry survives the AK not only because Lily puts her life on the line, but because she does this while given a choice to step aside. Lily's death is only a sacrifice because Voldemort was willing to let her go, otherwise it'd be just another casualty. It's a fairly unusual situation, and we don't know how recent an invention the Killing Curse is, so it's entirely plausible that Harry is really the only one who survived it that way.

It is never said that Lily is the only mother in history to have ever sacrificed herself for her son, moreover, Voldemort said at the graveyard after resurrection that he recognised the magic, so this kind of sacrifice is a known phenomenon, only it wasn't used against AK before.

*** Absolutely this. James literally died for them less than a minute beforehand. But Snape didn't ask for James to be saved, so he was always going to die.

**** Voldemort also agreed to spare lilly

I assume he owed snape a debt of some kind enough that Snape felt like he could ask for the life of Lilly

and voldemort agreed to spare lily so he must have felt snape was worth making that promise too

lily had a chance of getting out of there alive

********* I assumed that since no other teacher has this title, its an indication of his degree that he got before getting hired by Dumbledore, maybe after apprenticeship.

But regardless of the title, Snape was a talented potioneer, and probably brewed most of the potions Voldemort needed after he joined, so Voldemort might have have considered him valuable enough to humour him.

********** How did you come to the conclusion that no other teacher has this title ? The only person referring to Snape as the /potion Master/ is Snape himself.

Aside of it, I'm personally not sure Snape is better protion brewer than Voldemort, but sure Snape was probably a valuable tool to him which might have been the reason why he decided to spare Lily.

*********** Maybe other teachers also have this title, and I think at least McGonagall and Flitwick probably do. What I meant is they aren't referred as such in the books.

I'm not sure Voldemort was a better brewer than Snape, if only because this field seems like it requires constant practice and keeping up with advancements to be truly great, and Voldemort had other priorities. Even if he was a potions genius, though, he sure wouldn't sit in the basement himself and brew Polyjuice, Veritaserum, fresh poisons and anti-hangover potions for his DEs to use.

That's not a title of mastery on field that's just another way to call professors so yes they were respectively /transfiguration Master/ and /charm Master/ just like Pomoma Sprout was the /herbology Master./

There is no real way to compare their respective skills although Voldemort seemed to have conceived the resurrection potion which is an impressive feats to me, hence my doubt on the fact that Snape was better potionner.

*************** Voldemort's specific circumstances might be unique, but who knows how many dark wizards found themselves in need of a new body before. On the other hand, he had more than enough time to create the best possible potion for his resurrection, it's not like he got much entertainment while disembodied in Albania and then having only Quirrell/Wormtail for company

**************** I don't believe there were any, why would they need a new body ? The fact he went further than any dark wizard before creating several horcruxes should ruled out hypothesis implying his deeds were common things. I don't see what the amount of time he might have had has to do here, the 'man' was a weak being barely alive when Pettigrew found him.

***************** Even dark wizards with one horcrux might have required such potion. After all, horcruxes, as we see with Voldemort, don't make a person invinsible, they just tether the soul to the plane of living. But it wouldn't be a common thing, of course.

That last part about time was a joke, I'm not really disagreeing with you.

******** Agreed. Voldemort had to be somewhat intelligent to do as well as he did and realize that doing this also puts snape in his debt. People are more likely to do something for someone if they feel they owe that person.

** In addition to everything else, you must note that the sacrifice part isn't just "she died to protect it", but "she died when she would have live in any other case", which is an unusual scenario because someone who kills a newborn will probably also kill their mom if he can. This notion is also very important

*** I don't really accept that. I imagine the scenarios where a mother chooses to die in an attempt to save their kid would be common enough to be public knowledge. I'm not sure what it is without tossing in head canon, but that excuse is so flimsy that it takes serious head canon to make it work.

***** If something has a one in a million chance, then it is happening thousands of times per day. If something has a one in a trillion chance, it is happening every few of months. Small percentages aren't likely to happen until you're performing said percentage on a massive scale.

It also depends on how large you think the wizarding population is, of course. The examples I used above were for a rough current Earth population. On that note, are the people on the ISS counted towards the Earth population? Maybe for another time lol.

*** I can even see the logic in this. Magic being apart from time can see all potential futures. It can differentiate between between whether or not someone was going to die anyways. A "true choice" as it were, not something that gives the illusion of choice because people can only experience time in 1 direction.

** It is stated many times throughout the books that AK is a very complex bit of magic and not every wizard can do it. It's implied that in fact, most can't. Not just the Magic, but the feeling behind it, you have to want to completely destroy your target, so I don't think it would work as a self defense move. So it is entirely possible that countless mothers have put themselves in danger/or gave their life for their child, and then their child survived whatever the danger was. It's possible that no mother did it while facing down a wizard who they KNOW can/will use AK, AND, were given the option of saving themselves first, and then the child survived.
