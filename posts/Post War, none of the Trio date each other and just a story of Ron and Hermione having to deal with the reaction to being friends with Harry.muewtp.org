Lee Jordan yells out " Stunner. Potter nailed the Dark Lord with a Stunner. Potter is now stomping a mudhole and walking it dry. " This starts Harry pro wrestling career

** I highly recommend Loose Cannon on FF.net. None of the trio are dating (R & H break up near the beginning). Follows Harry as he learns to navigate being a celebrity and becomes the seeker for the Chudley Cannons. Incredibly well written and updates weekly!

*** I tried that and liked it at first but it became very unreadable for me. I love me some romance and no moral peril, but Harry became so deeply unlikable. He uses Wizengaunt for selfish reasons but never seems to use it to help out muggleborns or the various magical races. Also didn't love the whole "let's use up a ton of time to become friends with Malfoy" and "we got to be nice go the wizard nazis" If the purebloods still have a ton of power, it means he failed the war. He was a genuine icon by a point in the fic in multiple ways but never even uses that influence for good, just fashion.

TLDR: the Wizarding world is shown as being very corrupt but Harry benefits in ways it I and doesn't seen to care to fix it. And if he couldn't politically then he should have kept physically fighting.

**** Gonna disagree with you there about not wanting to change it. He is using a knife instead of a wrecking ball. He is rooting out the systemic racism by working from within the confines. If he just demanded a bunch of changes, sure he may get them, but inevitably that will cause another revolt/dark lord. There are characters in the story that resent how he is going about it. But there are valid in story reasons for befriending Draco and he is working with werewolves and helping out war orphans. Just working outside the system instead of in. And if anyone in that universe deserves a break, it's Harry.

They even show that while he thought he did it 100% on his own that there were many people who helped resist outside of the hogwarts system and many of them were purebloods

god, I love this line because it explains perfectly why the whole 'walking into a ministry and forcing them to change with a slap to the face' NEVER will work. At best you get a LOT of resentful enemies that will stop at nothing to tear you down, at worst you end up as a public enemy and criminal.

******* those examples involved killing a ton of people involved in the old system, so not really something Harry or Hermione would do.

Also the American revolution against the British was country vs country and the french revolution was near all population against a minority of rich individuals.

That can't be compared to Harry, or Hermione, or any individual, just walking into the ministry and going "CHANGE NOW!" while blasting curses at everyone saying no. Not only do they lack the numbers, but it is basically the kind of stuff that dark lords use as tactics.

**** I get what you're saying, but I actually like the way he's changing things. It's less about changing the laws and more about changing the culture. He's trying to break the stranglehold Hogwart's graduates have on jobs everywhere and is using Pratt's to bring around the old money to his “extreme” views. It's not an immediate fix for certain, but as the older generation dies off and Harry's friends rise in their place, the wizarding world will be forever changed. He's already put darks arts on the back burner thanks to his handy new abilities. I really think you should give it another chance!

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
