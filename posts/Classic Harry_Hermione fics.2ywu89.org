Hey, I'm relatively new to fanfiction and was wondering what fics would generally be considered a classic to the community. While I'd like any of them in general, ones with a Harry/Hermione pairing specifically would definitely be most appreciated. Thanks!

*** I had saved this list from the other thread. And after reading most of it I can easily say that Vox Corporis is definitely the best.

Can you recommend anything similar that is not in the list? No time travel, any character bashing etc.

*** Romances? Eh. Once you've read one, they all read the same. Can I have stories of any other genre?

EDIT : And no Weasley or Dumbledore bashing. Those are an automatic disqualification.

**** But that's the point of this thread...

I /was/ recommending romances. This subreddit's full of recommendations for other great stories in different genres. I can't really help you there.

And I tried to stay away from Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. The only stories I put that have it only do for comedic purposes.

***** Ah. I meant Harry/Hermione fics with a genre other than romance. No bashing, and keep Hermione glorification to a minimum.

If you can point me to another thread for this, that's fine too.

****** Oh, sorry about the misunderstanding then.

Actually, I put 'Romance fics' in the header as a catch all term. The only ones I would call straight up romances are Vox Corporis, Unlike a Sister, and Fulfilling Obligations. (And even then, Vox Corporis is generally regarded as the best romantic fanfic ever written, so you should give it a chance.)

The rest actually have a huge variety, ranging from a post-apocalyptic thriller (Resistance) to a surreal comedy (Champion's Champion).

And I definitely tried to stay away from nonsensical fluff. The romance is naturally integrated into most of the stories.

** I know they are not terribly popular or well thought of on [[/r/hpfanfiction]], but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Robst]] writes almost exclusively H/Hr with some H/HR/LL thrown in for good measure.

The big criticism of Robst is that the stories tend to be very trope heavy as well as fairly formulaic and many of the older stories simply have not aged well. Other than that they are not terribly written (some of the older stories have some rough spots) and they are often at least complete.
