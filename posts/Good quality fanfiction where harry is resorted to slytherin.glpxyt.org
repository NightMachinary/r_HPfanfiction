** Here you go! This author is absolutely amazing and has a very wide category of long stories. Many are complete and most of the works in progress get updated on a reasonable schedule (and often are long enough that it's worth reading up to the current end anyway!) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8835628/chapters/20258512]])

*** Came here to recommend this. Lomonaaeren is a great author though some people probably avoid their works because of the slash

*** 559 Harry Potter stories, holy crap that is one devoted author! They wrote the one where Harry is obsessed with transfiguration to cure his parents, right? That was a really great, very different story. I'll have to check out the one you recommended.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

*** Absolutely love Lomonaaeren, but I personally didn't enjoy this story. Many of his other works are far better in my opinion.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** Are you interested in time travel? Because there are a few that I know of where Harry goes back to Tom Riddle's era and is sorted in Slytherin. This one is good if I remember correctly : [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349][wear me like a locket around your throat]]
