Hi everyone!

This is Ronnie, the co-founder of the new and improved HarryPotterFanfiction.com . We've spent the last 6 months getting the site back up to full functionality and are considering launching new forums on the site. We'd like to hear the communities thoughts on this.

- What would you like to see on these forums?

- Any old staff from years past interested in making a come back?

- What do you miss from the old forums?

- What did you dislike about the old forums?

​

It's important to our team that we build products that are relevant and useful to the community, which is why we need your voice!

Thank you :)

​

- Gwen and Ronnie


** As a member of HPFF before it went down, and now a member of HPFT, which was created by members of the then dead HPFF after everything went down (literally) - and yes I may not be very active on HPFT at all recently but being a student sucks balls and I'm trying to get back into everything - I know first hand the reactions of those who had to experience the original shutting down announcement (wanna know how bad it was for me? - it was on my 13th birthday when I was having a shitty day IRL and had opened up HPFF for some cheering up) because I was one of those.

HPFF was literally the first thing I would open every day when I got home. I practically lived on the forums. I found the site when I was a lonely 12 year old, and 6 months later it had become integral to my identity. I loved the writing, and the sense of explicit community and a family it was to all of us.

And when it closed down, and all the drama happened with the previous owner (don't want to disparage him so publicly, but it was kinda bad) we members rallied together to rebuild ourselves, this part of our shared identities, and that rebuild in the wake of our shock is what became HPFT, which has grown strength by strength in members, activity and all-around support every day since it officially opened.

I don't want to put down your efforts, as none of the events of the past can at all be blamed in any way on you, Gwen & Ronnie, but in all honesty I'm not at all sure that you would regain many of the previously very-active members from HPFF at the time of its closing, for we (but I do not speak for all of us) seem to have found our home for the next while, at HPFT.

I wish you luck in your endeavour of rejuvenating HPFF, Gwen & Ronnie style of course. HPFF was amazing in the past, although flawed in different ways. Some advice: keep your operations, managing costs, policies etc. transparent and fair. Be just and sure in your decisions, but don't be afraid to admit mistakes and fix them.

I hope you create a loving community for new and old HP fans to come together on HPFF once more, free to write what they want (within reason and advisories/tags as appropriate of course) and speak their opinions and beliefs about everything within, and outside the fandom of HP and any others they may personally enjoy as well.

If you want, feel free to PM me about the differences of old HPFF vs. HPFT now, and what could be changed/fixed. As I try to remember, there will always be room to improve on everything.

Best of luck, always.

*** Hi there! Thank you so much for the thoughtful response and for shedding some light on the experience of members from the past.

We are definitely striving to build a brighter future for the site - one that's loving of all skill levels of writers and encourages them to improve their craft through fanfiction.

I'll be reaching out personally to learn more about the difference between old HPFF and the new HPFT.

Thank you again for sharing!

** I recently re-discovered HPFF.com when I googled my name and found that all of my fics were alive and well on there. I have to say the site itself is pretty gorgeous to read on, and the uploading is amazing (you kept ALL the formatting, even with the one story that had a full outline included! WHAT!).

​

I didn't spend much time on the forums back in the day, though I did love that there was a culture of helpfulness. I still have some fic banners created from back then!

​

I can tell you that what I abhor about the fanfiction.net forums is that it's incredibly difficult to use like an actual forum. If the functionality to find where you've posted in the past is there, I can't find it, which is a problem in and of itself. Their forums are not threaded, which I understand makes it feel more like a 'forum' but it does end up stifling discussion, in my opinion. I've posted to the ffn forums and then never been able to find the post, ever again. While some of that has to do with the fact that they're 'user created,' the overall feeling in the end is that of anarchy. I would participate in fic challenges if I could *ever find the challenge thread again.* So that's some stuff to probably avoid.

***** As someone that's been updating my newest stuff on their site, I will tell you it's a million times easier to upload fics onto harrypotterfanfiction.com than it is on FFN. I've been using FFN since 2003 and my jaw dropped when I recently uploaded one of my chapters on HPFF. I just copied it over from my google doc and it was exactly the same when I hit post. No fiddling with spacing, no adding italics or coding.

****** Thanks so much for the kind words and I'm glad you're enjoying the new publishing function! We put a lot of effort into making sure writers could do exactly that... simply copy paste from Google Doc/Word and keep their stories as beautiful as before!

If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the site we'd love to hear about it!! - Ronnie

******* My biggest criticism limited pairing options. With so many 'time turner' stories out there, it's really shortsighted to avoid having relationship tags for some pairings. I mean, I get that there is a balance to be had between wanting the site to be easily navigable and pleasing readers. Perhaps there could be a drop-down in 'other pairing?' I write mostly Hermione/Remus or Hermione/Sirius, and there's just no option for this. These stories are MASSIVELY more popular than any Sirius/OC or Remus/OC stories, but those are in the list. I've written both.

If you're looking for more users, you can't help but expand that if you make it easier to search for the stories they want to read. Since you've got non canon pairings already listed, it seems like the limit has more to do with either habit (the old site's already listed pairings) or popularity (you can't gauge how popular a pairing stuck in 'other pairing' is if you don't separate them by what pairing they are!). I strongly encourage that if the hold up is user interface related, please reconsider. Adding a 'more crowded' pairing list or more drop downs (splitting pairings by era? or having more rare ones in a 'rare' dropdown?) will only encourage people to write and read more of those pairings. If it doesn't, and they're not being used, make them a legacy code and don't make it available anymore.

​

I love that you guys are looking for suggestions. That is my biggest gripe about the site and it always has been. Having your pride and joy stories stuck in 'other pairing' because it's not an option is a downer.

******** Hi there, I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on the filters! It actually wasn't a conscious decision - its a left over from the old site and is a huge project to take on. We want the streamline benefits of FF net without the confusion of Ao3 - so its definitely on our development plan for 2019!!

** It would be great if you guys can improve your filters. The characters are missing and it's next to impossible to find great fics in consistent order. I'm not saying there's no good content (some of my favourite are up there), it's just such a hassle to actually filter them out.

**** I shall put it this way: there's no effective rating mechanics iirc, like favs in ffn and kudos in ao3. Sometimes I want to make more people to see the great fic I've read, but all I can do is to comment, which I don't think can be used as a filter option right now. This makes the story list very inconsistent, letting great fics mixed up with mediocre ones instead of having a way to make them stand out.

** - What would you like to see on these forums? I would love to see a shipping section and threads dedicated to each ship.

- Any old staff from years past interested in making a come back? I was never on that lol.

- What do you miss from the old forums? I don't, I feel like a lot of the old staff ruined it for me, they had rules they didn't follow, and they liked to delete accounts for no reason. I got deleted for rec-ing a fanfiction in the correct board/thread. I was more into the portkey & EWnet forums, good staff and communities.

- What did you dislike about the old forums? ^
