from reading it on the wiki page. I took note of this actions:

  with Muggle-borns either killed en masse or kept in utter bondage

  carrying out attacks on Muggles for sport and to sow chaos. Cleaning up these attacks, healing survivors, modifying memories, searching for the perpetrators, and attempting to prevent future attacks occupied more and more of the Ministry's time and attention.

​

#+begin_quote
  As their confidence grew, the Death Eaters began targeting Muggle-born and blood traitor witches and wizards as well, torturing and sometimes killing their victims, which shocked wizarding society.

#+begin_quote
  Many Death Eaters also managed to secretly gain strategic positions within the Ministry of Magic itself. They then used blackmail and the Imperius Curse to expand their influence and destabilise the government from within, which was desperately trying to keep order and continue to maintain secrecy from the Muggle world

These points give me a picture of how the war took place, but not completely. I'm wondering on how did Open warfare take place? Did the Death Eaters need to occupy buildings? And how were Dark Creatures utilised?

The wiki page also talks about how Dark Creatures like Giants and Werewolves were used by Voldemort. Werewolves make sense, but I don't see how Giants would be used since they are too big, and the Statue of Secrecy might be broken. During the Battle of Hogwarts, the way they were used made sense since the were fighting to take control of Hogwarts and kill everyone.
