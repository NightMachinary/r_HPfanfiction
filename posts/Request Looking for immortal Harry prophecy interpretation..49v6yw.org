I'm looking for fics that are based around the interpretation of the prophecy that states only Harry can kill Voldemort and the reverse is true. Which means that once Harry kills Voldemort Harry is immortal and can no longer die (forcing him to be forever unable to see his parents.)

Completed or in progress are both fine. However I would prefer fics that are still being written and are at least striving for novel length. Pairing doesn't matter much, although slash holds no interest to me when it is the main pairing.

Whether these are time travel, epilogue compliant, decades in the future, or next-gen is fairly irrelevant. I like most genres so feel free.


** linkao3(1068045) sounds like what you're looking for. It's a oneshot, although.

** There's "Elsewhere but not Elsewhen". Voldemort sends Harry off to another universe, thinking that both of them will be immortal that way.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.
