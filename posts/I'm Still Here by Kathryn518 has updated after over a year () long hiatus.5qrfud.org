From what I remember, it's a great sort of power fantasy story where Harry travels to an alternate dimension.Its marked as Harem, but there was nothing beyond flirting and the like as of yet. Unless my memory is failing me, I'd really recommend this fic to those who enjoy the bullshit angsty/powerful/mysterious dimension traveling Harry that meets his dead parents and whatnot.

** My biggest issue with this story is the writing. For some reason, the author (authors?) have a "why use 10 words when you can use 500?" philosophy.

"Heavy-handed" isn't even in it. Frequently you'll see scenes immediately rehashed from another PoV, just to make sure the reader really, really, really understood what was happening.

The writing just kills any kind of nuance or imagination on the part of the reader.

Reading this thing feels like reading this paragraph over and over and over:

#+begin_quote
  Harry paused, his left foot falling just short of the door as a surprised smile slowly crept onto his face. He'd just seen a naked house elf, and it was surprising, which is what made him stop moving, and also what made him smile in a surprised sort of way. "Oh, my, a naked house elf," said Harry, smilingly surprisingly, "that's surprising."

** I have forgotten most of the story. The only thing I remember is that the pacing is atrociously slow. I don't know if I should even re-read it.

*** yeah I'm rereading it now, and it's reaaallly slow. But that means you could probably skip most of the first couple chapters, honestly

*** Onebof the ANs at the end said she was unhappy with hiw slow the pacing had been in the previous chapters and wanted to speed it up. I haven't re-read the others but this chapter had a decent pace I thought.

** I think that I'm Still Here is my favorite piece of fanfiction. If it took her twenty years to publish the next chapter, I'd still read it as soon as I got the notification email.

** Just finished the chapter and it was pretty awesome. It's still power wank and the pacing is still reeeeally slow but it was a good chapter overall. Harry is appropriately epic and disturbingly depressed, he does a decent job at hiding the latter to the general public but we get some nice insights into his psyche and i especially liked how the Horcrux gets handled. No silly goblin healing rituals or a simple potion to fix a serious problem.

It's consistent with the rest with the rest of the story (although we're luckily moving away from the overly evil and rape inclined Slytherins) so anyone who liked the story before will probably love this chapter.

I do wish that it had been a little shorter though. Maybe dividing it in two or three separate parts might have been better.

** The sad thing is, this is still orders of magnitude better than her HP/SW crossover, even with this [[/spoiler][dementor-killable Sword of Gryffindor wielded by Harry-given-special-title]] madness.

*** Her SW crossover started great.

And then it devolved to pointless Jedi bashing, rants that take 10k words to finish, needless exposition and horrible flirting.

I still read it, but damn it gets old really quick. I don't think I'd be able to actually keep reading it if she updated frequently since then I don't have the 'cooldown period' that I need to progress all the pointless shit she managed to put in each chapter.

** The typical female writer creates male perspective multi fic. None of the writing is believable, and Fleur's accent is so unnecessary. Literally, all you have to do: "Fleur said in a thick french accent". I also enjoy how sometimes that author warps the words to the point where I can't read them, loads of fun.
