Has anyone got stories where Dumbledore realizes and is forced to concede that Godlike magical protection won't do shit if Dudley or Vernon take a bat to Harry's skull?


** Unless the godlike protection is one reason why it never turned into physical abuse.

*** Never? Hitting someone with fucking frying pans (which is canon I am afraid!) is PHYSICAL ABUSE!

Stop downplaying the neglect and - yes! - abuse that Harry suffered (really hate it when fans do that! I mean: Sure, it could have been WORSE, WAY WORSE, but that does NOT mean that what happened was or is in any way acceptable and should be allowed! IMHO the Dursleys should be in fucking prison, Vernon with a "nice" big black guy named Bubba and Petunia with some "nice" butch!)

**** I'm not downplaying it and I think he swung a frying pan at him and missed which would be in keeping with a physical protection spell.

It wasn't an anti-emotional abuse spell. I'm just talking about the semantics of the ancient blood protection not that any abuse isn't bad. Jeez.

** I've always felt that this is a consequence of how the beginning books of canon are meant to children's stories, where the Dursleys were written as overinflated, cartoonish villains in the same vein as Cinderella's evil stepmother. It's not a very realistic representation, a fact that unfortunately makes no sense as the books transitioned into more grounded, young adult novels.

In my head, I believe that the Dursleys would be at most negligent and verbally abusive, but Petunia would never let Vernon stoop to physical abuse- Harry's her niece, the last remnant of her dead sister, who I don't think she ever truly hated (there's a deleted scene in DH P1 that showcases this. It's not strictly canon, but it was so powerful I wish they left it in). Dudley might get a few beatings in because kids are cruel, and Petunia would probably turn a blind eye, but Vernon? No, she would've stopped him, probably indirectly by mentioning they don't want those "freaks" to notice or something like that.

Of course in my head canon Dumbledore personally delivers Harry to the Dursleys and McGonagall is the one who gives Harry his Hogwarts letter, so take that as you will.

I just absolutely hate it when authors dehumanize the Dursleys, and conversely love it when authors humanize them. I tried reading Jamie Evans, Fate's Fool and immediately stopped when certain implications were made. It feels cheap, an easy way to build sympathy for Harry.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/2/Potter-Ever-After][Reminds me of this]] for some reason. Also have you given [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] a shot? It's the one of the few fics I've read that have made me sympathize with the Dursleys for the shitty situation they found themselves in.

** I've definitely seen this trope but with Snape (where he like, adopts Harry, or something) but I do not think I have seen it with Dumbledore as the instigator.
