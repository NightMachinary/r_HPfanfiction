** I adored that one you mentioned ("On the Ground Running," maybe???), so I think you'd enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night]["Out of the Night"]], as it goes into some depth about Dark magic and what makes it different from Light magic. A lot of fics do that, but I think this one takes a unique approach, and I might even use this theory myself in the future. Sadly it's been abandoned, but what is there is amazing. The history the author puts forward makes a lot more sense than many fics I've read with the same concepts.

** It sounds like you might like that "Hogwarts is an Online University" site that appeared a few months back. There are textbooks to read and so on.

I forget what it's called, though...

*** Hogwartsishere.com

The lessons are crap, the teachers just read the wiki and just write what they find there. There's barely any original content and certainly nothing treating magic as a science, just what you'd expect from a class scene from Rowling.

**** Well to be fair, isn't that the point? This isn't "generic fantasy magic", it's very specifically about Harry Potter. So if they do things "you'd expect from a class scene from Rowling" then I'd say "mission accomplished".

** Okay. The one I'm thinking of involved harry and snape and them using Snapes voice as a potion, or spell or something. Ironically remembered it because of ops name. It was written partially like a textbook by Hermione

Warning. It's slash.

** Have you met [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][Taure]]?

He wrote a story that was literally called "Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling". I think he changed it to a google doc linked on his author page now.

All of his stories have extensive magical theory explorations. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic I]] is a rich new world - Harry Potter set in a world of very different magical rules which had only been hinted at before he abandoned the story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] made some amazing changes to the canonical story while sticking a bit more closely to canonical magic - DarkLordPotter forums have a breakdown by the author of the magic system changes he implemented from canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] is a bit shorter, but sticks the closest to canonical magic - though it doesn't explicitly give as much of an explanation of magic as the others do. It's also probably the best of his works. Harry gets Dumbledore's memories after his death.

**** Have you ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3322666/1/Echoes-of-Power-Part-I-Anger][Echoes of Power]]? Unfortunately it's not finished, but it's still quite long, and there are huge portions of it that deal almost extensively with magical theory. And there's a lot of 'darker' elements in there, too.

****** :3 It's one of my favorite ones that have a Dark!Harry because it's not /too/ over the top. And really, in my opinion, it's the writing /style/ that sells it, like the lack of grammatical/syntax errors, combined with the novel-like dialogue and whatnot haha. Enjoy :)

**** Fair enough. I like HP:MoR because we observe the actual experiments from the PoV of the experimenter, which I think is a great way to teach theory of anything really. I don't know of anything that satisfies what you're looking for though :(

Will take me a while, I'm making a decent amount of notes and possible routes to categorize stuff (wards/offensive/defensive/specialist/dark-light etc...) and I can see something pretty rad forming in my mind.

******** I'm more interested in the origins and function of magic. For example, how does being a Squib work? How do muggle-born kids get magic powers? Why is "love", which is nothing more than a chemical reaction in theory, such a powerful magical force? How do wands work? How can you "invent" a spell? How does time-travel work?

I have zero content planned for all these questions, but I'd really like to write a fanfic that attempts to answer them. It's just a matter of finding the motivation to write. :)

And I agree, you simply can't improvise these things! You have to have a general plan at least, especially if your story is full of technical things like spell categories and stuff.

*********** I'm afraid not.

I only started reading fics a couple months back (maybe less!) and began writing number one for a few days until I had to focus on exams.

I'm a very imaginative person, and think of new things /all the time!/. Sometimes I just see something new (i.e. the word "Mnemonist"), then I'll research it for a few minutes, then apply it to a fan fiction. Within a few minutes I have a rough story layout and beginning/middle point.

Right now I'm job searching so can't quite just focus on fics :(
