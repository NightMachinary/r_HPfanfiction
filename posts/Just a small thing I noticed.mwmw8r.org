Harry said the Dursleys stopped giving him pocket money when he was about six, which is also about when accidental magic starts to occur. Was it possible they treated him normally or at least less neglectfully before they thought he was a ‘freak'?

I don't think we can really say he was treated "normally" since he always lived in the cupboard, but the Dursleys were always more neglectfull than outright abusive. Before Hogwarts, Harry was mostly left to his own devices and was only punished when something "freaky" happened (and it's not like he used Accidental Magic every other week). Without Dudley, I'm pretty sure Harry's life could even have been considered as mostly peacefull.

I think we have different definitions of abuse if you think what they did to him is just neglect. Abuse has a lot of forms, physical AND mental. A child living in a cupboard, wearing castaways, having to do endless chores, feeling unloved , wishing everyday some distant relative would come and take him away. His aunt cuting his hair with cisors really shirt and not even thinking about his feelings about it, LETS NOT EVEN TALK about being punished by "locking him in the cupboard", letting duldey and his friends hit him, not giving him meals

THS IS ABUSE this is not Neglect.

**** Like, first, totally agree it's abuse and totally sick and not okay. But your last statement is somewhat of an oxymoron, it's abuse BECAUSE it's neglect not INSTEAD of neglect. Child neglect is a form of abuse.

***** I didn't mean it like that, yes they are neglectful, but its more than just neglecting him, its abusing him (other ways) too, because the comment before said that they more "more neglectful than outright abusive" and I didn't agree with that part.

****** Yeah, that was a dumb statement from them. Since neglect IS outright abuse. The accurate version of that statement would be more neglectful than physically abusive, which while accurate, would be a pointless statement since mental abuse isn't better than physical abuse. Abuse is abuse. It's not okay.

******* I agree with that, I woud even count "not giving meals" and "cuting his hair very short with scissors" as physical abuse.

To sum it up the Dusleys were abusive pieces of shit, and Im shocked at how no one noticed. Not at school, or the neighbours. And lets not even talk about how no one from the magical world ever checked on him. It's really sad.

This is a thing that happens, yes. It's good to keep in mind -- and it would also shortcut many of the discussions, which ultimately boil down to "different people from different places of dfferent ages have different norms and thus you're disagreeing about definitions".

Important aspect, good that you pointed it out.

***** As I said, abuse has many forms. It's sad that you have different norms for abuse, I don't want to sound disrespectful or look down upon what you think of it but it's important to recognise signs of abuse and realise that it's not okay and differs from neglect.

** I've always thought so. And I think something bad must have happened to make Vernon hate magic so much. The first chapter is from his pov, and he didn't seem so unreasonable about it. He just didn't approve. Maybe Dudley got hurt or something.

*** I think that's mostly Petunia's fault. He has no idea what wizards are really like, and Petunia's spite could easily cause her to tell him they're all akin to demons or something. He has no reason not to trust her, after all.

***** I think it's kind of tragic. Two grown up men who had big roles in Harrys life treated him like shit because they couldn't get over that fact that James Potter was kind of an idiot in his teenage years.

** Probably. As soon as he turned out to be a fReAk, they stopped treating him like a human. Since he was, in fact, better than them because he had magic, making them feel insignificant, they bring him down to make sure they stay above him. Petty /-insert nono word-/
