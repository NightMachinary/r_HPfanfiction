What if Romilda Vane is not depicted as she usually is, especially in fanfiction. What if she is incredibly brave or intelligent or simply the greatest girlfriend ever. But she's painted as the trollop because she took the opportunity to get Harry Potter to notice her and dosed some sweets with a love potion. Didn't Molly Prewitt do the same thing to Arthur Weasley? I think she is a blank canvas waiting to be developed into an amazing character. Has anyone undertaken this endeavor? Anyone know of any fics that paints Romilda in a positive light?


** Her sole purpose in the narrative is to be a gold digger who uses mind control potions and causes problems. It's hardly surprising that this is what most people take away from it.

Ya know, outside of JKR's magical realm (in every sense of the words), this shit is called date rape. People have been using Arthur's dosing to bash Molly and by extension Ron and Ginny for the last like 15 years. Romilda doesn't even have any of the positive scenes Molly has to balance it out, her only appearances were her being bitchy to Neville and Luna, and her trying to date rape Harry, only to drug Ron instead. Kinda hard to "unfarily characterize" a character when they have literally no positive scenes at all. Might as well call random death eater mooks "unfairly characterized" for the same reason.

  Romilda Vane realized she'd been going after Harry Potter the wrong way; it wasn't a question of how, it was a question of when.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** While this is quite interesting to think about, since I'm open to almost all kind of character interpretation. Nowhere in the book even hinted that Molly DOSED Arthur with love potion. She told Ginny and Hermione that she MADE it, that's all.

Slughorn made it too, and I don't see people accusing him of using it, right?
