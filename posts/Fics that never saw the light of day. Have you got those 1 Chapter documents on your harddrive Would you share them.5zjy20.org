Greetings,

I recently linked to a lot of my documents that have story beginnings, single chapters,... in them. They'll probably never be finished but sometimes I enjoy re-reading them to remember a few trains of thought.

Have you got those too? [[http://imgur.com/a/7CANt][These libraries of Google doc folders?]]

Would you share 'em?

edit: I just thought it a bit hypocritical to ask if people would link to theirs, if I don't link to mine.

Literally the entire folder you see in the screenshot minus Bloodmoon and Salem Settlement, cause, why not:

** I have the first two chapters of Espionage (sequel to Aurors) written. I'm yet to decide whether to upload/continue writing. As of yet, I'm not ready to share them.

I also have a word doc with a nearly finished one shot a out Harry losing his temper with toddler Teddy and briefly shutting him in a cupboard. I would probably share that if people were interested in helping me make edits and such, but otherwise I think it will probably stay on my computer as a character exercise.

** I have a bunch, and the more that I review them, the more I want to share them.

Try this one, for instance:

Tonksworthy

Summary: Harry obsesses over Tonks from the moment they meet, trying to learn more about her. Somehow, he plans to become Tonks-worthy.

Outline: They meet as per canon; she's flirty and fun and extroverted and magical, and this in Harry's mind becomes the essence of what he wants out of life.

He stalks her at Grimmauld. He pines after her while at school, until he can't stand it anymore and sneaks back to HQ to find out what she's been doing. He catches sight of her flirting with Lupin and starts plotting to drive them apart.

He follows her on her next Order assignment, interceding when she's about to be ambushed and escaping undetected. Later he dreams about revealing to her that he saved her and her gratitude turns into sex. After the fantasy, he bemoans his vulgar nature and doubts she would see him as anything but a disgusting groupie. Sirius picks up on his obsession, treating it like a crush but also encouraging his hijinks, because he thinks Harry needs a good caper and hopefully a roll in the sack to help him grow into a proper Marauder.

The caper leads to Harry discovering Tonks having sex with a fellow Auror. And later with a girl working in Diagon Alley. And again, while in disguise on assignment to extract info from a source. He retreats to Grimmauld to wrestle with his mix of disgust and self-deception.

Tonks bumps into him there and attempts to cheer him out of his melancholy. He kisses her. She shuts him down, suggesting that he date kids his own age for a while. Harry says something rude about not needing to bed so many before finding what he truly wants.

She coolly states that he's proved her point on the maturity thing, then walks away.

Sirius tries to console him but dismisses Harry's feelings.

Hermione corners him as he's stewing and asks the important question: "Okay, so you think she'd be perfect for you. Are you perfect for her?"

"What?"

"What does Tonks want or need? What do you offer? Why would Tonks benefit from involving herself with you?"

Harry turns the question around on her [this may become a rundown of Hermione's legitimate canon affection for Ron].

Hermione's confrontation is a splash of cold water. At the end of the discussion, Harry kisses Hermione in thanks. She kisses him back. They have almost-sex.

Tonks catches them afterwards and after Hermione runs off, she confronts Harry on his obsession. They talk, they argue, Harry explains the whole litany of why he desires her and how Hermione has shocked him out of his foolishness. Tonks explains that she knew he was there all along, but didn't know why Harry was so keen for her.

She offers to train him, but only if he won't take it as more than what it is. In a rare bout of maturity, he begs off.

Flash forward through the canon, though with minor variances.

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry goes to Andromeda Tonks to personally inform her of the death of her daughter and son-in-law, only to find Tonks there, recovering from a bonk on the head. Andromeda left a note, saying that the oft-neglected art of Divination indicated that only one daughter and son from the middle line would survive the war, and that she'd rather give Nymphadora a chance to live a life than have to grieve another loss in her family. She implores Dora to take care of herself and Teddy, equally.

Harry helps her grieve. He offers any help. Tonks realises that her world has been upturned (as it is with so many other survivors of this war). She considers returning to work under Kingsley, who would be quite grateful to have a well-trained and loyal Auror still alive to back him up.

Harry visits Tonks and Teddy again. Over drinks, he tells the story of his misadventures and frustrations with the process of fulfilling destiny. She loudly sympathises with his plight over every betrayal, every shock, every disastrous plan. He tells her that he's a little unspooled now because he really was expecting to die. He doesn't know what he wants anymore.

After such a long, emotional conversation, Tonks invites Harry to sleep off the liquor there. Just sleep.

Ginny blows up at him the next day over it.

He comes back to complain. Tonks explains that girls like to be cared for sometimes, and finding that a beloved safety blanket is missing when it was needed can feel like quite the betrayal. She explains that she has her own checklist of desired virtues and acceptable flaws. It has grown from the relationships she's had- keeping the traits that attracted her to one or another lover and marking the flaws that truly spelled doom for the relationship long-term. Sometimes they're the same thing. Lupin hit most of the features [particularly his werewolf stamina] and had few, though extreme, flaws that she could accept, and she was so happy to have him for as brief a time as they had. Really, she should have expected him to self-destruct eventually. He wanted to be the man even though he was most obviously the woman in their relationship.

They verbally compare checklists from before the Battle. Tonks says, "If you want to settle in and build a family and feel like a pillar of society, doing what you feel you must for the sake of everyone, then you should go back to Ginny and do that. Other girls might fit as well, but she is strong-willed and outgoing and sexy and has a large family whose entire membership already loves you. Your checklist is looking pretty full with her."

[perhaps a brief comparison of the flaws and merits of Ginny versus Hermione]

"Or?"

"Or... if you're willing to brave the unknown with a loving companion to lead you on adventures across the globe, you should track down that interesting blonde girl who followed you into the Department of Mysteries, and hitch your wagon to her star."

Luna. He hadn't even considered her. Harry envisions a life of chasing her through jungles and ancient temples across the globe. There is an appeal.

He goes off to ponder this. The one thing that trips him up about Luna is how innocent she still seems. Asexual, even. It's a fatal flaw for his checklist.

He considers other girls- Katie, Cho, Gabrielle, Parvati, Padma... and he asks himself why he wants a permanent girl at all. What's the rush?

Because I'm still a target. I'll always be famous. I want love, and the further I get from the people I already trust, the less likely I'll find someone who can handle being part of my life. At least here in Britain, though that probably applies to most of Western Europe. A muggle girl? She'd be a victim before she knew she was a target. I have a feeling that my allies will want veto powers over my partners...

He comes back and asks her, "Now that you've had a chance to consider your time with Remus, what does your checklist look like?"

"I'm not looking, Harry. I've got enough to handle already with little Teddy. Wouldn't want to spoil the romance with infant detonations and sudden bouts of accidental magic."

"Do me a favour."

"Anything."

"Look up."

She did. She stared at him, mentally calculating all that she would want and hope for.

He did, too. "I want a family. I also want adventures. I want fun. I don't want to 'serve the community' anymore, not as my life's purpose. Not now, at any rate."

"Ah."

"So, would you like to come with me to France?"

"What?"

"I want to go look for the Flamels. They've left their place in Devonshire but I don't think that they're actually dead, yet. If anyone could help me get perspective on Dumbledore's life, it would be them."

"Okay, yeah, but why me?"

"Because, I'm going to need your investigative skills to actually find them. I also believe that, unlike a few years ago, we'd be good for each other. And I love you."

Teddy spat his breakfast onto her chest. They both broke out laughing.

"And I love Teddy," Harry said. He drew his wand and cast a silent Tergeo to erase the mess, then handed her a damp dishcloth to wipe Teddy's face clean.

"Aren't you still a bit squicked out about my past lovers?"

"Oh, I have a plan for that. I'm going to make sure we have sex together more times than all your previous lovers... combined."

"Hah! Ambitious, aren't you?"

"And then we'll move on to Belgium. And do it again."

** I have one I have picked up, put down, scrapped and rewritten over and over since around 2005. At one point it was up on FFN as a WIP but it was (a) getting away from me and (b) awful. I've recently picked it back up but I have less time than I did 12 years ago to devote to it. I have a long prologue and a general arc but it needs bones before I can really start fleshing it out as a full fic. And jesus, it'll be long.

Nutshell: I wanted to explore the idea of Tom Riddle becoming the mentor he deserved, in nurturing Harry. I also wanted to explore Dumbledore's quite rigid outlook as a "everyone deserves second chances except Voldemort because if Voldemort can change then it means Gellert could have but I wasn't good enough, therefore Voldemort must be irredeemable". To do this in a canon compliant way required Riddle gaining some sanity and mental stability, and developing a reluctant mentor relationship with Harry. It's still a work in progress to make this as believable as possible. :/

** After reading a whole lot of half baked "Lord Potter" stories, I sat down and thought about what it would be like if the Harry Potter universe really WAS ruled by magical nobility. As in Britain was still a monarchy with a powerful aristocracy composed entirely of ancient magical families and the muggles were more or less second class citizens (but entirely aware of it). Harry would be an actual Lord, the Weasleys would be a family that were once considered to be politically powerful, but lost their fortune because of a failure to invest in the new industrial revolution (think what happened to a lot of landed nobility when farming quit being the main source of wealth in Britain). The main POV character would be Hermione though. As a muggleborn, she would be a true outsider. However, unlike in cannon, she is entirely aware of her status, and seeks to better herself by not just becoming a powerful witch, but marrying into a magically powerful family so that she can take care of her parents by gaining wealth and status.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

**** That's actually partially a point of the story: the Industrial revolution didn't happen until the late 19th century, and even as the 21st century approaches mass production and factories are still new concepts. This is at least partially because I want Voldemort to be leading a faction of wizards who believe that the muggles are gaining too much power, and that their dangerous new methods will plunge the world into chaos. Meanwhile, the muggles are bucking for more rights and privileges as they become increasingly important to a modern economy. Hermione and her friends would find themselves caught in the middle of this struggle, trying to form alliances and a power base in the shifting political landscape.

Also, Dumbledore would be a lot smarter and just the Headmaster of Hogwarts (although a decorated war hero).

** I have one google doc that is just a plot bunny farm...I have two WIPs right now that I would like to finish, but here's a couple of the ideas I considered writing (and will hopefully write once I finish some of my other stuff!):

Purple Like Violets "Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge." A pureblood!Hermione fic

The Enigma of Thomas Gaunt "Lucius Malfoy has an agenda. Albus Dumbledore has a plot. Severus Snape has a secret. Lord Thomas Gaunt will stop at nothing to gain power. Nothing is as black and white as it seems. Gray!Dumbledore Gray!Snape Smart!Draco" Basically a politcal / scheming fic where nothing is as it seems. So far I only have the summary and opening sentence written... "Disturbing little was known about Thomas Gaunt."

Phoenix Tears "Post GoT. AU. The Dark Lord has returned. Dolores Jane Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor, will do anything in her power to stop him and the threat he poses to her Ministry ambitions. Even if it means turning school children into soldiers. BAMF!Umbridge, Powerful!Harry, Secretive!Hermione, and Mentor!Snape." A little bit of an Ender's Game vibe. A bit of Snape-mentors-Hermione.

idk if these are things people would actually want to read, but I'll probably end up writing them XD

** I don't know where I'd ever go with this fic. But there's not enough to link. Not even this is finished, there were going to be bits between Luna's sorting and Ginny's I never wrote. So here:

Knowledge Above All

The hat was enchanted to say anything to befriend the one beneath it and make them feel at home.

"Lovegood, Luna!" The tiny first year smiled faintly as she daintily wandered up to the stool. Somehow even managing to make the act of sitting down and donning the hat look distracted, she began swaying in her seat.

"Oh my, Miss Lovegood. You have a mind after Rowena herself." Luna grinned.

"Really?"

"Oh yes! Knowledge above all, Miss Lovegood. Why, the last child I met with a mind like yours was just about a century ago. A young lad, Jack. Poor child, lasted only a year here. Ah well. Perhaps, my dear, you'll have better luck than he did in RAVENCLAW!" Claps rose from the blue and bronze table, and Luna, with her distant smile, stood.

"Mr. Hat, what happened to Jack?" She asked.

"Spent his remaining days in Azkaban, if I remember correctly," the hat said before being removed.

Ginerva was sorted into Gryffinfor. That was . . . Unfortunate, though not unexpected. She was hardly an intellectual after all. Still, it would make monitoring her condition harder. She could try to enlist the help of a Gryffinfor, but that would run the risk of someone alerting a teacher, and she couldn't have that. No, she would have to just rework some things. It wouldn't be as precise but it was the best she could do in the situation she found herself in.

There is an unrecorded, undocumented, but subconsciously observed fact in life; magic attracts more magic. This continuous occurrence often applies itself to reality in varying peculiar ways. The arrival of four magic user in northern Scotland who applied great magics invariably compelled a nearby forest to fill with magical creatures. In 382 BCE a family of wandmakers settled in Brittania during the Roman occupation, they built a shop in a walled marsh lands village ruled by King Belin along the rivers Thames and Walbrook, later known to be named London. Their humble shop become the center point of wizardry commerce in the area, which spanned the great market of Diagon Alley. And in a quiet mundane village of Little Whinging, Surrey a singular spark of magic would soon create it's own history.

The year was 1988, the season of summer and one Harry Potter had just finished with Year 3. He was tending the garden; a generally unpleasant chore when the hot sun beats down on you, but he had little choice in the matter. He wasn't allowed in the house during much of the day, and while more comfortable he might have been, he'd much rather be away from his family, the Dursleys. The Dursleys consisted of his giraffe-horse hybrid of an aunt, a walrus of an uncle and a piglet of a cousin, a twisted menagerie both irksome and cantankerous. Harry was nothing like them, and he was okay with that. He was a muted, unassuming boy of 8, with pickled-toad green eyes and hair the color of the blackboards at school.

Peculiar things happened to him while he had tended to the garden over his brief years. He dare not share these secrets with his family. Their utter abhorrence for anything not normal was burned into his memory; not hard to remember when he was the primary cause most days. The first bout of the supernatural for Harry was when he happened upon a common garter snake while planting some flowers. It had slithered from underneath the shed muttering to itself about crickets and mice. Harry had tried to hold a conversation with it, but after the initial surprise of having met a human speaker, it grew bored and irritated that it had been held up from it's hunt. Harry had met other snakes after that, they all tended to be grumpy and singular in their thoughts though.

** I have a few, but there is one in particular I really regret never publishing.

Its called /Brushstroke/. A one shot about a small silent magical portrait of a little girl that falls out of its frame and is found by Voldemort, who picks it up and keeps it. It frames the interactions of the portrait and Voldemort with the Second Wizarding War as a backdrop.

I didn't publish it because I thought it was too dark and didn't match with the usual half-humorous style of stories that I publish on FFN.
