It's simple, really. You simply force-feed blood-replenishing potions to Petunia, put her in an enchanted sleep, cut both her arms to have a maximum outflow of blood, put all that blood in a vat of sort, reattach Petunia's arms and make sure she's alright and here you have it. Now you just need to put the vat of blood somewhere it won't be in the way in Harry's new home.

It's crude but effective and everyone's happy. Next!


** I've suddenly got the image of Harry hugging a blood filled cauldron with a drawn on face and a wig.

** One thing people dont seem to realise is that the Dursleys were terrible parents to both kids. Just in completly different ways. Dudley is of harry's blood. Just have them both raised away from Petunia and Vernon.

** I think I read a fic where they used a similar idea where Harry using a ritual made the same type of thing Voldemort was before his rebirth (the little baby thing) only all it did was “live” and power blood wards basically just a blood sack that could produce more blood. No idea what the fic was called.

** Would that blood be categorized as "living", though? If you are going to go that route, might as well drain Lily's corpse.

*** I thought about that, but then if someone does this after Harry gets his Hogwarts letter than she would have been dead for ten years and she was hit by the Killing Curse so if anything /her/ blood would be considred dead. I also imagine it wouldn't be too complicated to find a way to oxygenate blood with magic

** Heh. There's a Gaiman novel called The Graveyard Book that could be a fun crossover/inspiration with this idea. Harry has to live with his mother's blood? Well, where better to get that than her grave? Could be a fun 'Harry is raised by a supernatural thingy' sort of fic. :)

** I've seen a variant of this used in a couple of (non-biological-parental) Snape-centric fics -- basically, as childhood friends with Lily, they did a "blood oath" ritual (the thing where you share a tiny amount of blood with someone close to you by a cut), which has no real importance in the plot besides the fact that apparently it counts as him having part of her blood in him and is thus eligible to serve as conduit for the blood wards. Why nobody thought of doing something similar with the very much alive Petunia in the aftermath I don't know, but I guess it would kinda ruin the excuse for Harry and Severus to get close. :P

*** I had a similar thought.

AHEM

*Blood Adoption Potions*

Yes, I made that bold. They are practically fanon-accepted by now. Find squib (or anybody willing, really), have them drink a blood adoption potion made from Petunia. Then, Petunia can bugger off and Harry has a loving family raised like muggles. Until the Hogwarts letter.

*** The thing is that the blood would get through their digestive system, not flow in their bloodstream.

***** Unless you're talking about vampires like Marceline in Adventure Time, vampires simply drink blood like we do water. Ergo, the blood goes from their mouth to their stomach and feeds them until it needs to go out by the back entrance. It's, like, ninth grade biology and third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts assuming you follow the British system of education set by the Wizarding Examinations Authority.

Edit: Blood feeds them like any food would. It's canon vampires do not only feed on blood in both Harry Potter and most myths. It doesn't grant them immortality, since they can't age because they've dead.

****** Um... you do realize that vampires don't actually exist, right? And myths about them vary widely. When Anne Rice vampires drink blood, it goes straight to their veins. That makes at least as much sense as it being digested in their digestive systems. They're undead. They don't have functioning organs like living beings.

******* Another example is in a lot of fiction, a vampire who has fed recently looks flushed/less pale, implying that the blood they drink enters their veins.
