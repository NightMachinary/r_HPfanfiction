I've read my share of Peggy Sue fanfics in my day, but I've never once come across a fan fiction where Hagrid travels back in time to stop the Bad Future. Has anyone come across anything like this?

** I haven't read anything like it before and time travel is my favorite type of stories to read and write.

Are you planning on writing about it? The plot bunnies are bounding around with the potential greatness of this idea.
