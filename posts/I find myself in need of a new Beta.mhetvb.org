What's the deal?

If anyone of you has read any of my work, you would know I have some time travel fics, most very early WIPs. Well, I used to have a solid beta for all my fics, still do, but she has been going increasingly busy. I keep writing stuff but I haven't published much because of it. She is still going to beta my Halfblood Weasleys story, but I now need to find a new one for the rest. Specifically my Ron Weasley story.

What do I need to get beta'd?

As I mentioned, my longest published story so far is a Ron Weasley one. Time travel to first year. So far I have 10 chaps published and 1 ready to be beta'd, the remaining 6 in various stages of finishing but quite advanced. It is interesting because I write an initial version of it years ago and had been coming back at it lately, so, even when I have tried to improve it and reread it dozens of times, it might still like being written in 2 different styles at times. I need someone to go through all the publish chaps and give me an opinion and help me improve it (my previous beta only went through chap1 of this story), I mean, I won't change plot points to force new readers to reread, but if I can improve dialogue and flow for new readers that would be nice. I would also need the new chap beta'd afterwards, and the upcoming ones, when they're finished. May as well ask beta to give a look at some of my other stories, but only after having gone through this one and if beta likes to. This story is my main priority atm.

What kind of story are we talking about here?

Well in this, as in most, I do canon pairings and try to stay close to pairing. Stations of canon are boring, yeah, I'll grant you that, and I plan to differ greatly from canon at some point, but atm Ron is trying to keep the timeline unchanged and return to his own time, so things are similar to some extend. (first 5 chaps are set before the time travel so those are entirely new). I write action better than romance, so brace yourself if I suck there.

What am I looking for in a beta?

Basically an all around beta

- So grammar, obviously. I think my grammar is not a horror show, but English is not my native language, so if an error pops up, I would expect to be told about it so I can fix it.

- Plot. I am comfortable about speaking to my beta about the whole plot of the story. So if plot holes can be spotted or twerked, I can do things on time.

- Pacing. I don't want any chap to feel too rushed, too loaded or too boring. As a writer is usually harder to spot these kinds of issues, but hopefully a beta can help here. Obviously no one likes rude people who are rude for rudeness sake, but I am pretty good at taken criticism. If you are going to say "This whole scene needs to go, it kind of sucks" I can probably take it if you tell me why and how what do you think would work better on its place.

- Details. I think I do understandable dialogue, but dialogue is one of those things that can definitely be improved and made feel more natural by a native speaker or someone who has a better grasp of it than me. Britishisms and HarryPotterisims I have a few, but I think the story could use some more.

​

I think that's it.

*** I write on google docs, where I have more recent versions of the chaps, even to those published. (MInor difference from those published, but still)

I publish on ffnet and AO3 and I upload to HPfanfiction as well.

**** Ah ok, can you give me a link to the ao3 one? Anything I might say should be taken with a grain of salt.

This is AO3. I think chap1 is my best writing there, haha (not very promising when you think you peaked at the start, right?) chap1-chap5 are more recent, I reworked most of them in the last year or so. chap 6- chap10 have a lot of my older story.
