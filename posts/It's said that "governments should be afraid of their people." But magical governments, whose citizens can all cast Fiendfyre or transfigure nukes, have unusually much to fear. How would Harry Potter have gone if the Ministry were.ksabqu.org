** Well, some fanfic writers make the argument (to which I personally subscribe to) that this right here is why the whole concept of Dark Arts and their censorship and persecution comes from. It's so much easier to hold onto power and abuse it as you see fit when your population can only cast a basic shield, a couple of stunners and a body bind.

I'm sure some really /dark/ Dark Arts exist too, but I'd bet good money that the vast majority of the stigma was orchestrated so that the ministries and ICW can hold onto power.

*** ... While distasteful in principle can't really blame them, ruling over a population is already hard on a good day, hand everyone guns with ammunition ranging from fake bullets up to atomic bombs capable of leveling entire cities and it would be a miracle to go a single day without someone deciding to conquer the world or kill everyone they disliked (Umbridge wouldn't manage to get up to even half of the shit she does in OoTP without being incinerated). If the dark arts ever became commonplace the entire ministry would be better served just admitting defeat preemptively and dissolving to allow the nut-jobs who are sure to come space to fight for power over the country.

**** Not sure I agree with the conclusions you reached here. If you look at places like switzerland and a few towns in the US, where it is required by citizens to own working firearms, crime, especially theft and home invasions, are significant lower than other places.

It's true that in this case the government would have far less control over their populace, but it depends on the culture of the community whether that's a good or bad thing. It could turn out like switzerland, or it could turn out like the wild west.

Of course none of this applies if wizards can actually cast spells as destructive as atomic bombs. If that was the case I'm pretty sure one nihilistic wizard could wipe out 80% of the world population before anyone could stop him.

***** An argument could be made that Fiendfyre is about as bad considering that it supposedly takes specific knowhow to counter and it is still difficult, plus the curse actively hunts down targets and can't be stopped by other means like water or shields, if we consider that it won't stop by itself than it could theoretically be worse than a nuke since it would technically be able to burn down an entire continent and even more if left to it's own devices for time enough.

It is not really a matter of the culture of the society when this type of firepower is involved, even if there are fewer criminals eventually someone suitably crazy will show up and start trying to take the power or mass murder some cities and the government will have to either capitulate to them or fight heads-on, capitulating means the nut job gets to kill lots of people while fighting means having two or more people capable of leveling cities ducking it out with at least one side having no regard for collateral damage (mutual assured destruction). So even a single case would end being one too many and chances are that at least some would feel empowered enough by their power to face the government heads-on.

****** What I'm saying here had to be taken with a grain of salt, since the exact nature of fiendfyre isn't expounded upon, and can be left up to your own head canon. But I think it's pretty obvious that there is a counter to feindfyre. If there wasn't it would have consumed the whole world the first time it was cast.

Given that there is a counter, and given the speed at which it spreads based on canon (i.e. the whole of the room of hidden things in a few minutes) I highly doubt that feindfyre could destroy a whole city. If the situation OP was postulating where dark arts knowledge is common, then I'd assume the aurors would probably have a specialized feindfyre fighting task force. The response time for fire fighters where I am is around 10min including travel time. Given apparitition, I'd be surprised if feindfyre released in a city had the time to destroy more than a few city blocks. Which is horrible of course. But still able to be responded to.

As for some one 'suitibly crazy' you have to remember only 2-3 wizards in a century were capable enough of taking down the government and even then they didn't do it alone. Most wizards are average by definition. So say someone like Crabbe decided he wanted to go on a dark magic spree and had easy access to knowledge for it. He goes to London starts casting feindfyre, AK's, ect. Aurors show up, they assume he knows all this stuff. They know all the counters cause they assume that. They take him down.

If on the other hand you have Voldemort deciding to do that, what would happen? Well basically the same thing short of him killing a greater number of aurors. The thing that made Voldemort scary was the amount of support he had in addition to his power. By himself I doubt he could take on the entire ministry.

Of course fanfiction can change that. I've seen plenty of stories where Voldemort dumbledore and Harry are perfectly capable of fighting armies single handedly. If you are trying to write a story in that mould than the logical conclusion is that governments have to capitulate to what ever the powerful want. However if that was the case I doubt a ministry would have ever been implemented in the first place. The form of government would have been dictatorial based on whoever had the power at the time.

******* Eh, guess the bit about Fiendfyre /would/ depend a lot on HC since it is barely explained, though I tend to consider it on the most dangerous side of the scale, if for nothing else then because of it spreading like actual, only intelligent enough to seek it's own fuel, so I always imagined it as having an exponential growth instead of working up to a standard power-level and then slowing down. Like, it burns a X volume and it's power increases in X, but then it will big enough that in the same amount of time it took to increase up to that it instead increases it's power to 2X totaling 3X, then in the same time it increases, this time to 4X and so in and so forth until it is just far too big to be covered in the AOE of any single dispelling spell, it probably would never get to that in a populated and/or under surveillance area, but leave it alone in a deep forest somewhere far away from civilization with plenty of fuel (animals and plants) laying around for it to feed on and by the time it arrives at a city it will be apocalyptically terrifying.

The thing about cannon power-levels is that the majority of the population had neither reasons nor the methods to really learn that much about the DA or to get up to Voldemort's/Dumbledore's level, in a setting where the Dark Arts are common, everyday stuff however self-preservation would pretty much demand that everyone do their best to be able to protect themselves, and since spells capable of massive amounts of damage would be available chances are that many more would become considerably good at them even if it is not their primary occupation.

Now this would be the situation at a personal level, repeat it to /everyone/ in the wizarding world and consider that with such a larger population with the means available many more would likely choose the Dark Lord career path (we generally think the truly insane are few and far between, they are not it is only rare for one of them to gain enough power to be able to make themselves heard, in this situation power would be /much/ easier to come by) then suddenly you don't have to deal with only a Goyle going around toasting a neighborhood, but with hundreds or even thousands of Goyles going around causing chaos, some stupid enough to make something flashy and disruptive that simple can't be ignored and distracts the DMLE of the others, smarter ones, that bid their time and plan attacks that are far more overall damaging at long-term and this is not even considering the more subtle in-between with things like maphias and gangs warring with each other's, quiet criminals imperiusing and blackmailing their path to power, everyday family mans that have a nice little human trafficking business going on the side when no one is looking, or even someone capable of the imperius with enough knowledge about the muggle government to know that nukes are more damaging than a bombarda but not enough to know how bad of an idea it would be to get some of them thrown at their sister's cheating boyfriend...

It's been established that the magic government can't detect magic done underground. All that one pissed off wizard would then have to do, is just go around looking for blueprint and layout plans for some of the more crucial buildings. Waltz in, put some holes in the support column with a simple piercing or blasting hex, then add the final one with a delay charm impedimenta which we already know can affect spells, before getting out of dodge. He can then just back and sip coffee as the building collapses in on itself without any warning.

** Hence, dementors which can only be countered by a very difficult spell which doesn't seem to be in the Hogwarts curriculum and that few wizards can master. And veritaserum, which is illegal to use except by the Ministry. And legimency, which few people know about and it's also illegal. And poor education regarding muggles, so wizards don't get to know about nuclear weapons. And a crappy job market which seems over reliant in government jobs (which people get through personal contacts rather than ads for the general population)

A lone wizard would be more successful in casting Fiendfyre at the entrance of the ministry than a muggle at improvising a conventional or chemical bomb to attack its government. But if he tells anyone and that person talks about it (or gets his mind read), it's off to Azkaban. If he gets caught, it's off to Azkaban. If he becomes a suspect, he'll be forced to confess. And it's off to Azkaban.

And ultimately, there is also the catch of how hard or easy it is to get information about how to cast Fiendfyre and not die from it. After all, in the real world people can study chemistry and learn how to use potassium nitrate as an explosive. And probably some chemical weapons too (A Japanese sect made low quality sarin gas in the 1990s). Or get a gun and try to murder his head of State at a public gathering. Or use a truck to run over random people as a terror attack. Or pilot a plane (after learning how) and crash it intentionally. Different countries will have different regulations in place to make this things harder. But ultimately, few people want to mess with their own government out of the blue and in solitude.

Finally, the British wizarding world did have three wars in less than 50 years.

** The ministry is afraid of its citizens.

They repress the truth about Voldemort through the Daily Prophet. They harass Harry and Dumbledore because those are their primary political opponents. They're afraid Dumbledore's supporters will seize power.

But it goes the other way as well; the Ministry is afraid of Voldemort's supporters too. In the books, Dumbledore says Voldemort's largest supporters are the Death Eaters and dark creatures. But order to wage a serious war, he must have had more support in the wizarding working-class, lumpen and middle class. The people Harry encounters in Knockturn Alley.

** You can definitely make the argument that the Ministry does fear its citizens. Fudge's entire administration is built around avoiding and covering up problems. Seriously, the ministry of magic is a dystopian government. They send individuals to Azkaban without a trial, when they have the ability to never arrest the wrong man, as Wizards are able to both /read your mind/ or give you /literal truth serum/. The no-trial Death Eater laws are completely ludicrous, eliminating something that the mundane British government has outlined as a human right since the English Bill of Rights of 1689*, on the basis of being suspected of terrorist acts. They didn't even roll up Sirius's sleeve.

Fudge was able to send Hagrid to Azkaban, just to be seen doing something. It's implied that Hagrid did not get a trial for this, or at least a sham trial, and was sent directly to Azkaban. Fudge was able to bypass the trial system personally, as well as did it to protect his public image.

Also, Arthur Weasley was able to get a bill passed which allowed him to raid the home of Lucius Malfoy, a personal enemy. Arthur is the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department, and Malfoy wouldn't touch a single muggle artifact with a 39 1/2 foot pole. Just to point that out, I find it suspicious.

Azkaban is a complete travesty of human rights that the Ministry uses to threaten individuals into compliance. We see that all the wizards are absolutely terrified of Azkaban. When we actually get to see Azkaban, I'd make the argument that the only reason that any individual survives there is plot convenience or wizards can just take more punishment. They starve everyone there, make their best efforts to freeze the prisoners to death, and that's not even mentioning the dementors. If we're not allowed to use sleep deprivation on individuals, I wonder how induced PTSD would be looked on by the United Nations. They feed the prisoners three square meals a day of misery, with despair for dessert**.

They are able to completely deny the claims that a dark wizard has returned and use a private newspaper to attempt a smear campaign on a /teenager,/ who /one year ago/ was entered into a Ministry endorsed tournament against his will because they couldn't be bothered to secure a stupid wooden cup, to prevent the only people they didn't want entering, from being entered. This smear campaign goes against all journalistic integrity, but the sheer volume of control that they influence over the newspaper because it is implied that the Ministry directly encouraged the Skeeter campaign.

They are able to launch a full trial for a minor***, who they change the times on, in order to prevent him from receiving legal counsel, and attempt to prevent the defense from even giving their version of events. It's a complete sham trial.

In this same campaign of defamation, they take over a learning institution, to attempt forcing conformity on the students. The Death Eaters tortured students in their run of the school. Umbridge attempted to brainwash students into pure ministry compliance through fear. We're told that they are trying to prevent students from learning to defend themselves, so they /don't overthrow the ministry./

She tortured students. I hate the fanfiction trope of, "oh, that's a blood quill, it's illegal," as you don't need to make the quill illegal to make torturing children a reprehensible act. She directly caused students harm, with the intent of causing them to suffer. The entire fifth book is a masterclass in what a tyrannical government looks like.

They definitely fear their people, but they certainly are taking steps to make themselves a more intimidating force. Incidentally, yeah, that's why I hate stories that try and show me how great the wizarding world is, with lordships and all that jazz. Those just make it an even worse place to live for those who don't get the blessing of not being born rich and famous. I'd rather live in Muggle Britain.

***Incidentally, if you'd like to emancipate Harry in a story, this is the route you should take. The goblet wasn't made by the ministry, the 17 or older thing was added later. There is no ministry acknowledgment necessary to make the contract binding. The trial, however, implies that the ministry acknowledges Harry as an individual who is responsible for himself. Add in Harry's wealth, and you have an argument for government acknowledgment of responsibility as well as proof of his ability to financially support himself. As soon as he turns 16, he can apply for emancipation. You could cite the Tournament as why Fudge was able to convince the Wizengamot to try him as a full adult, but that's not really necessary.
