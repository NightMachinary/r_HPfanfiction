What I enjoyed most: - politics/agendas without delving into 'Ancient Houses' and inherited titles via Gringotts etc. - multifaceted characters, no bashing - feministic approach - Slytherins that are neither evil stereotypes or would-be-aristocrats and experienced baby-politicians

Don't know why I overlooked this until now. Please tell me there are more like that :)


** Yes! The Changeling is really good and there's something to be said for Slytherin!Ginny and Slytherin!Ron (I'm a real sucker for the Grandmaster Ron or Seer Ron trope). Anyways, I followed it up with another Ginny-centric fic "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/2/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasely and the Half-Blood Prince]]". Book 6 from Ginny's perspective, canon-compliant.

I will grant you that there is somewhat less original world-building though. But I enjoyed it as a quick afternoon read, so maybe you will as well

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/2/Choices][Choices]] - Seer & Slytherin Ron. Currently at Chapter 17 and enjoying the premise so far.

There's also Fate by TheTrueSpartan, which combines all 3 tropes. Sitting at 2,6 million words right now. It's a bit out there, you need to buy into the premise that Ron essentially is sharing a body with a God and the whole /SlYtHeRin kNows No fRienDs, OnLy aLLiAnCeS/ thing. It is well-explained though!! I always picked it up from time to time, but it took me 3 attempts or so to get into it. I read it last summer or so, but then I tore through all of it and stopped looking at updates because it was exam season.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/775506][The Chessmaster Series]] - Slytherin Golden Trio IIRC. Shorter, but entertaining. I remember being pleased by the characterization of Ron. But I was also on a massive(r) chess trip after a good tournament run

There also was this fantastic (half-)crack fic that featured either a Capablanca or Alekhine game where Snape & Ron were playing in a wizards chess tournament abroad. If I ever find it in my history (phone, tablet, computer? who knows), I'll be sure to update it

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** I just read it last month, and I agree it was great. Maybe my favourite fic of all time. I love a fic that is AU, but still feels very Canon, which this one manages to do incredibly well. It very much reads as what life might have been like if Ginny was a Slytherin.

I'm assuming you also read the followup stories The Armistice Series? If not, that would be my first suggestion.

As for others, I will say, asking for fics like it will invariably lead to disappointment, because it's legitimately one of the best, if not the best, written ff I've ever come across. So, it's a bit seeing the Mona Lisa, and asking if there are any more paintings like it.

  How is Harry's characterisation in the story?
#+end_quote

Honestly, Harry is in it mainly in the prefiary for the most of it, as it's from Ginny's POV, and even in Canon Harry didn't hang out with her all the much until Book 5. And since she's in Slytherin, it's even less likely that he would have hung out with her.

Mainly, I'd say he's pretty close to Canon Harry, smart, but can be dumb. Doesn't particularly care for Slytherins, hates Malfoy. He's Harry as you'd recognize, but with a little more acceptance over time I'd say. There are other characters who you get to see more of, particularly because when Harry is away from Hogwarts in the 7th year, the story is focused on what happens at the castle. So, characters like Luna, Susan Bones, Neville, Terry Boot get better developed and more story.

Annerb has no such problem, her stories have great plot, as well as fully fleshed out character motivations and good dialogue. And most important, her stories /read well/. So many writers struggle with that part, writing a story that is complex, but also easy to read.

** Although Ginny was my favorite female character in the series (even more so than Hermione who although was cool to have in times of crisis didn't seem as someone that fun to hang out with on a day-to-day basis), I'll admit I haven't really read any Ginny centric fics until this one. One of the things I enjoyed about it is that the author proved that seven years can be written without dedicating a million chapters to every year where nothing really happens.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is a decent fit. The premise is that Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism, so lots more people are still alive but non-purebloods are banned from Hogwarts and from many types of employment. And the overarching conflict between Harry and Riddle is about thwarting Riddle's attempt to pass anti-miscegenation laws which are actually a mix of good and bad intentions; they're meant to encourage purebloods to marry halfbloods, so as to reduce the harmful effects of inbreeding, while still keeping muggle influences out of society.

There definitely isn't any character bashing; Harry is sorted into Slytherin and gets a very different impression of Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson (who are probably also friendlier in part because there aren't any muggle-borns around to stir up their prejudices), but still makes friends in other houses, such as the Weasleys and Cho Chang. Tom Riddle himself is egotistical and dangerous and yet not the violent sadist of canon.

It's quite an original plot; I think of it as not so much altering canon, but rather taking some inspiration from canon elements while going its own way. The way that some canon events are reimagined is quite clever and elegant at times, but it never feels like a rehash.
