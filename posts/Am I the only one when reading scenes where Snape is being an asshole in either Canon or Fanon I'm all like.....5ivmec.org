** Hermione would think it was an insult to academia to get up and leave. It took Trelawney to get her to pack it up and walk out of a class and that wasn't because of abuse but rather that divination was all smoke and mirrors. She has something to learn from Snape, even if he's an ass.

Harry was raised to take abuse. Snape is better than Vernon Dursley and the cupboard under the stairs.

Ron isn't that brave, especially in the early years. Besides, his Mother would skin him alive if she learned he ditched class and fear of that alone would keep him in his seat.

** Snape doesn't have anyone to be accountable to, unlike real life. Dumbledore would only intervene if he was physically torturing students or similar. And there isn't an alternative potions class to enroll in. So yes, you could walk out, make a stink to administration and transfer classes but the Gryffindors don't really have a choice.

*** I'd say it's pretty accurate for the early nineties. All the anti-bullying messages and campaigns did not start until after the Columbine school shooting. A teacher would pretty much have to physically or sexually abuse a student to be reprimanded before that, and not just make fun of them or call them names.

** Maybe not as an eleven year old, but I walked out of a class in high school where a teacher was being mean to me several times. She always singled me out even though there was a girl who literally left in the middle of her talking and would just come back whenever she felt like it. Not to mention all the other normal, not listening to her kids (she was a permanent sub who was not good at taking charge of the class). If we were working on something and I just whispered to the person next to me, she'd yell at me. I had no idea why she would react so strongly to me. I started walking out though and my mom talked to her and the **principal (totally with an a not an i, right?) and she quit her shit pretty fast. She had tried to report me for walking out (let it be known, she never reported the other girl; my mom asked).

** Sweeping out of the classroom just because the teacher picked on you is kinda pathetic... The British are less inclined to grand pronouncements of their rights. Also, consider that this is boarding school: if you regularly refuse to attend class, they can make life unpleasant, or simply kick you out.

*** I assume you mean Sirius. The worst thing we know Snape did to Lupin was revealing his status as a werewolf, which caused Lupin to quit to avoid backlash.

Also, Snape had a totally reasonable reaction if you look at it from his point of view. Sirius Black was an escaped convict and Lupin was in league with him. Snape had no knowledge of Pettigrew being the secret keeper and he hated Sirius, so from his point of view he was doing nothing wrong and getting revenge.

***** I'm not usually one to defend Snape, seeing as I usually think people are too forgiving with him, but think of his perspective in this scene like the other commenter said. Apart from already hating Sirius and Remus, he still thinks Sirius is the one who betrayed the Potters aka Sirius is responsible for Lily's death. The rest are a bunch of cunfunded kids and another wizard he hates acting as an accomplice to Sirius. I think thats why he was so upset when Sirius got away and blamed Harry. He thinks just like James he put too much faith in Sirius. I wouldn't be surprised if Snape somehow blames James partly for Lily's death too, seeing as "it was his fault" for trusting Sirius (and of course later revealed as being Peter instead) as the secret keeper.

****** If James hadn't married Lily and gotten her pregnant, and if Harry hadn't been born, then Lily would not have been killed (at that time). I'm positive he blamed James and Harry for her death at first, though not necessarily at the end. After all, he did only request that Lily be saved, not the other two.

******* Yes I can totally see him doing that, but if he follows that logic he has to blame himself because if he'd never become a Death Eater or had never reported what he'd heard of the prophecy to Voldemort than Lily might never have died either, which is something I think he knew well enough anyway. In a way I wonder if he felt so guilty about that, and had that much self loathing built up that as soon as anyone else even remotely close to sharing the guilt of Lily's death in his eyes was around he lashed out... hence his almost overwhelming need to see Sirius receive the dementors kiss... and the temper tantrum he threw when he escaped. I wonder now if that was more why he lost it that night instead of being upset about losing the Order of Merlin like Harry thought at the time... never considered that until now.

If you mean from Voldemort, there was no chance he would have spared Harry. If you mean from Dumbledore, do you honestly think he thought Dumbledore would only save Lily? There was no need to beg for his old enemy's life- obviously Dumbledore would save all the Potters. IMO Dumbledore was sort of stupid for pointing that out like it meant something, just by telling him Voldemort was after the Potters then all the Potters would be helped.

****** There was a fic I read where the author goes through that scene pretty much sentence by sentence and examines that Snape definitely just wanted to kill Black and Lupin. If you re-read that scene you will see that Snape came into the room and got all the pertinent information before pretending to still believe that Black was a criminal.

***** I'm going to try and look at that from Snape's perspective, three of the people there are probably confounded, one is a serial killer, and the last has been helping a serial killer get into a school potentially to murder students.

I'm pretty sure at the very least if that were the truth Lupin would have gone to Azkaban. Although it probably wouldn't have been hard to convince Fudge to have him kissed based on Fudge being Fudge.

Also, I don't believe Snape would have brought them directly to the dementors, he had a chance to do that after Harry and Sirius get attacked by the horde of dementors, instead he brought them back to the castle. I have a feeling he was going to do that either way, still intending for Sirius to be kissed with the minister there.

**** No, I never meant that Beauxbatons is /actually/ better, that would just be 11 year old me blowing up at Snape. You're right, we don't know, but I was never a rational child. We do know Draco claimed Lucius considered Durmstrang, but that was probably him bragging that a)his father would be able to get him into a school his peers couldn't get into or b)just making stuff up and bragging.

And I wouldn't get expelled, I'd withdraw :P I think both Headmaster and Deputy would hesitate to expel someone, especially if there were no other options. At most, you'd get a suspension. I refuse to believe in the real world, rather than the children's storybook world, that Dumbledore wouldn't tell Snape to behave himself.
