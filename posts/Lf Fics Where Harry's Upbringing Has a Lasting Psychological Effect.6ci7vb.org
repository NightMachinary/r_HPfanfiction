Up until the age of 11, he lived in a abusive household, lived in isolation with no friends, and never knew love of any kind. This is all massively damaging to the psyche of a child. I need some fics that show that damage, I've already read some of the popular ones like the one where Harry just turns the world upside down and dumps massive amounts of sand everywhere like he was dropping a hot new album. Which for some reasons I can only remember him brutally murdering Rita Skeeter out of nowhere because she said he was god or whatever and left her head impaled in the dessert he created. Yeah that was pretty amusing just murdered her out of nowhere she didn't even see it coming she thought he was going to leave her alive anyways I digress let the fic suggesting begin. Hand me some hidden gems

I'd prefer if the usual adventure crusade he hangs around in canon was brought to a minimum. Which means, he isn't friends with Hermione, Ron, Ginny (Definitely not Ginny good lord) if he is to have interactions of any kind I want them to be unique. Or he could be a loner for all I care lol just none of the tag-along crew.


** linkffn(11585823)- The Art of Self-Fashioning. Since he's deprived of love by the Dursleys, Harry grows up a sociopath, is sorted into Ravenclaw, and is obsessed with Transfiguration. He's kind of a loner. Neville is the BWL and the trio is Neville/Ron/Hermione. Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione... is NOT good to say the least...

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

*** Yeah I've read it, pretty much the only things stopping him from becoming a full blown psychopath are Regulas and McGonagall since it's not that he is morally against doing things like torture and human experimentation those two are against it so he doesn't do it even though he thinks it's a good idea. He's still extremely sociopathic though.

** In the fic I'm writing, Harry's closer to a young Snape in that he's isolated, unloved, and desperate for affection. While the case could be made that making lots of friends in Gryffindor saved him from the worst of his upbringing's effects, if he had been put in Slytherin and failed to make real friends for a while, he would have turned out very differently.

*** Would have made the transition from Sociopath into Psychopath fairly quickly just like Tom Riddle. When he got his Hogwarts letter, he should have already been a Sociopath since there is no way he would have been able to understand things like emotions and ethics only replicate them to appear normal. But, making friends would ultimately stop him from making that transition into violently killing things and jumping off the deep end.

**** I agree, but to keep him recognizable as a character I have to make the transition more gradual for the readers' sakes. He would definitely only go downhill without lots of positive influences like in the books, though. Dumbledore did his best to smother him with positivity as soon as he could. Even if he had been treated like a normal student, he still might have gotten very bitter and angry.

I wish there hadn't been so much emphasis on Harry being inherently good-hearted despite his circumstances. As though people like Tom and Snape were somehow failures for not overcoming as much as Harry did, even though in reality they had much less good in their surroundings.

***** Dumbledore did what? Sorry, but Dumbledore was very distant most of the time! He only saw Harry when something happened with Voldemort or when there was an injury but otherwise he really wasn't all that much of an influence in Harry's life (unless you count him being an accessory to abuse by placing him at the Durleys without due process etc.!)...ok, the mirror may have been a situation were Dumbledore tries to influence young Harry (keeping him from going down Voldemort's path), but otherwise I stand by what I said above!

This sounds like something that might interest you. The summary seems pretty spot on.

I haven't read it in ages though, hopefully it fits what you are looking for.
