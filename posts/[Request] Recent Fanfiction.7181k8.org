After recently looking for a story and realizing that the author has deleted every public trace of it from the internet, I decided to finally download a copy of about every fic I've ever enjoyed, including WIPs. While doing so, I have noticed one common thing: nearly all of them are at least 5 years old (from completion/update date). There are some exceptions of course, but this makes me wonder if I've missed any recent gems.

I saw a thread on this sub asking a somewhat similar question, and I did pick up at least one good fic from that (/Contractual Invalidation/ was wonderful and I have /I Know Not.../ bookmarked to read soon). I was wondering if y'all had any other suggestions for me.

Thanks


** Here's a list I did a month or so ago. It's for a couple of fandoms but Harry Potter is in it too. It's basically a list of popular stuff that's started a year ago or later.

Keep in mind that it's unfiltered, so complete garbo and NSWF are both present, but that's FFN for you... ppl like strangest things.

*** Thanks. It's looking like I case my net a bit too wide for this crowd, or this sub is just that inactive. I will have to give the list a perusal soon.
