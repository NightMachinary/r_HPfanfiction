The author was right in the middle of the sequel when out of nowhere both of them got deleted off the site, and there's no reason given on their profile. I really hate it when people pry into author's lives or their reasoning behind meta stuff, but I loved the first fic to death, and was wondering what happened.


** Was that the fic where Harry had a sister called Ariel who was raised by Snape?

I remember dropping that fic because everyone was so stupid it made me angry. I think it was somewhere after the Horcrux Diary plot, where every character was mad at everyone else due to forced miscommunications. It was well written, but the amount of teenage drama and angst was less like Harry Potter and more like a CW TV show.

*** Same. I swear, the author gave every single character an industrial sized idiot ball in order to keep the drama mounting.

*** To be fair, I do enjoy all the trashy CW shows.

** Ok so red sorrow was re-written at some point and the latest version was on both AO3 and FF.net. According to her tumblr, she was dealing with finishing school and was losing interest in her story.

***** Ok bad news- she deleted her stories from AO3 AND FF.net. Her tumblr still exists and it's got a lot of art that inspired her stories and a FAQ about RS and GITP.

******* You're welcome! I'd forgotten all about that story up until you asked about it! Kinda missed it I liked the premise and thought Snape was relatively in character.
