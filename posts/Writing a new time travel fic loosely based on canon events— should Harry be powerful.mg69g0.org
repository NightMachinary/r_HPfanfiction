So I'm getting back into writing after a (very long) hiatus, and I decided to go the Time/Dimension Travel route (guilty pleasure). I know this has been asked before, but what exactly do y'all think about Harry in terms of how powerful he is? I ask because I do want to stay at least somewhat true to canon in that aspect, but I can't help but think there's a lot of untapped potential, and I'm curious what others think about it.

Here's the way I see it: When it comes to casting magic in the HPverse, the way I've understood things is that there's three components involved: (1) the wand motion and incantation, (2) intent/willpower, and (3) magical capacity.

Snape, while I despised his character in canon, excelled in all three, as did Dumbledore and Voldemort. Those three, in my opinion, were always the most impressive, and were in the top tier (though Snape'd be on the lower end). In the second tier, there's Sirius, Bellatrix, McGonagall, etc. Then in the third, there's the generic Order members like Lupin, Tonks, etc. Then, there are the Hogwarts kids--- with Hermione being pretty impressive and Ron, Harry, etc., making do (but not at her level).

For Harry, I think his most impressive skill is athleticism and resourcefulness. When he was a scrawny little midget who had to constantly run in the interest of safety from his muggle family, he built up a fair amount of speed, likely influencing his future Seeker skills, and ability to evade (and eventually kill, with Fawkes's help) a Basilisk at 12 years old and survive. That skill stays with him, even when he finally gets healthy and (reasonably, though not very) tall--- he has good battle instincts in that sense, and knows how to survive.

But there are a few events in canon that, in my opinion, show that he could have a lot of latent power and skill; for example, he manages to cast a corporeal Patronus that drives away /hundreds/ of Dementors when he's thirteen years old, a feat managed by no one else in the series at any point except Dumbledore. And he's not magically exhausted by the effort, but rather, proceeds to go ride a Hippogriff to break his godfather out of a locked tower to help him escape while avoiding a temporal paradox. You can only attribute so much of that to adrenaline (though Hermione played a huge part in this too). None of the other students or Order members have Patroni that are as powerful, though surely they're all capable of love/happiness (especially compared to an angsty teenager whose life story would put multiple Greek tragedies to shame).

He struggles with Potions and nonverbal casting when Snape is involved, but in Snape's absence, he does well with the former (even ignoring Snape's old book, he manages an EE on the OWL for Potions, and also--- when he briefly felt sympathy for Snape after watching his memory of being bullied by his dad, he managed to make a good Invigoration Draught easily).

To quote OotP directly: “ ...and was pleased to find that when left alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily.”

And as for nonverbal casting, he's bad at it in class with Snape sneering over his shoulder, but has no problem doing it with Levicorpus and Liberacorpus on Ron after he reads it in Snape's book, with little care for the effects it might have.

We see that his ability to cast spells he's never cast before (and doesn't even really understand before he casts them) is quite strong and consistent, as he also manages to do Muffliato in the HBP, and Sectumsempra for the first time on Draco Malfoy (he legit almost kills him in that bathroom). Not to mention the Imperious and Cruciatus in book 7.

In OotP, we learn that most adults in the Ministry can't cast a shield charm, yet Harry can do so easily, and impart it to other students as well, including those members of the DA that are older than him (some are legal adults in seventh year), and said Shield Charm is noticeably more powerful than those of his peers.

He faces multiple tasks that his peers don't and wouldn't handle nearly as well. Outflying a dragon is amazing, though not a measure of magical talent--- which I think he surely has, considering he beats back merfolk and Grindylows and other stuff in the lake and stays put at the bottom of that lake until all of the hostages go free when Fleur--- an adult half-Veela witch who I doubt is magically weak--- can't even get to her hostage, and the other champions don't get there in nearly as much time (though Dobby's Gillyweed did give him an advantage there).

When his wand connects with Voldemort's in the graveyard, the book says his wand would have shattered if the “bead of light” touched his wand, at which point, Harry manages to beat Voldemort in a sheer strength of willpower and forces it to go the other way. This is when he's 14-- it happens again when he's sixteen in book 7.

What I take from all of the above ^ is this: despite canon, Harry definitely has a lot of innate power, and he's also quite good at Potions when he feels like it. He's no genius who can effortlessly do complex brews like Hermione, but he could easily be more than competent if he wanted to be. He doesn't have any interest or skill in magical theory, but despite that, he manages to accomplish spells he shouldn't be able to do simply through a combination of power/talent and sheer willpower--- he's quite stubborn. While Hermione or Snape could read a book and do a spell perfectly (or even invent spells themselves) based on that knowledge and appreciation of magical theory, Harry can't do (or at least, isn't interested in doing) the same. He also has a thin repertoire of spells, and isn't interested in expanding it, which leaves him looking to Hermione to do most of the work in that regard. He has intelligence, but after living his life making an effort not to outshine Dudley and subsequently Ron, he's fine ignoring that side of himself, and doesn't bother putting it to use when he can use Hermione as a crutch.

Canon Harry, IMO, has the capacity to be an impressive but fairly fallible wizard, like Moody, after maybe a grueling period of Auror training that he would put his mind to. But his disdain for power and lack of ambition (or rather, repression of ambition) would prevent him from reaching his full potential, which I actually do think could make him a top-tier wizard. While I doubt he'd ever be a theory nerd obsessed with the right wand movements and incantation-pronunciation, his willpower and magical talent would easily place him at the level of top Duelists if he put in some effort. As it stands in canon though, Hermione is a lot more impressive, and Harry only survives all 7 years through a combination of luck, circumstance (his wand sharing a core with Voldemort's, him coincidentally becoming the Master of the Elder Wand, etc.) and skilled friends, a case study of wasted potential IMO.

Do y'all have any thoughts on this (agreeing or disagreeing, doesn't matter)? I ask because I don't want to make Harry overpowered out of nowhere, but also want to see him use magic beyond the way he did in canon. Not sure which would make the most sense.


** I think your power scaling at the top end is a bit flawed. Yes, snape is very good /but/ Voldemort, dumbledore, and Grindelwald are basically gods amongst men.

** Debatable.

If he is more mature,has control and more experienced, then it would be fine. Powerful to an extent. There are more than enough super extra Harry fics l think. Maybe not boring, but not original.

But the first thing that comes to my mind is the flight of the Prince chapter , one of the last chapters in HBP. Where he attacks Snape near Hagrid's hut. That clearly shows that Harry is a boy who shouldn't be fighting Voldemort who is 50 years his senior, let alone Severus Snape.

It depends how you see Harry. Do you see him as intelligent and cunning man or maybe judgemental, sneaky,disrespectful, jumping to conclusions boy?

The way I remember that, what it shows is that in a 1v1 fight, an aware legilimens has an almost insurmountable advantage against an opponent who does not know occlumency.

**** Indeed.

If you want to make Harry more powerful you would make him a good Occlumens/Legilimens?

I think Voldemort himself is a very weak villain. He loses nearly every time. Harry always has some kind of a lucky advantage. Quite similar to Kylo Ren and Rey actually. Both villains remind me of petulant children.

My advice, if you are going to make Harry somewhat powerful and intelligent, please make Voldemort more cunning and sneaky. Try not to make him look like.a loser from the very beginning. Even the moment of his apparent triumph over Dumbledore's death, he was still a loser.

***** Not necessarily /good/. IMO, for combat he just needs basic competence in occlumency. A really high-level occlumens could completely hide the fact that he had ever heard of occlumency. But to out-duel Snape, Harry would just need to put up enough of a roadblock that Snape couldn't legillimance and fight at the same time.

*** This would be a good time to mention that I plan to make Voldemort a much more fearsome villain than in canon, because IMO it wasn't much. Harry will be more powerful, but there'll also be more of a reasonable explanation for why Voldemort is such a powerful Dark Lord, to the point where even Dumbledore can't defeat him. So while Harry will cast to a higher standard, it won't be a Super! Harry or indie! Harry fic. In fact, most of the fic will be him making mistakes despite that---- my main inspiration is the series “Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards,” and I think that's a similar direction for my fic. Him having future knowledge isn't a panacea for life's problems.

** For me, the biggest strength of the Harry Potter series is that Harry /did/ just get by with the help of his friends and mentors. He is competent and can be impressive at times, but he also needed all the help he could get.

I honestly prefer iterations of Harry that are as close to canon as possible, wasted potential and all. Harry does not plan because his traumatic childhood and teenage years made the future difficult for him to imagine. He is impulsive because in his experience he has had to do everything alone. He prefers to have fun and be normal because he is a kid with too much responsibility on his shoulders- responsibility he does not want but also can't turn away from.

Harry's magical potential is just about the least interesting thing about him. Making him OP in my opinion removes not only the things that made him interesting, but also the things that made him /Harry/. People's need to make Harry more competent or more powerful often result in the removal of all the nuances of his character. He becomes nothing more than a generic action hero with a personality about as interesting as cardboard.

The "wasted potential" is where the character work happens.

As [[/u/InquisitorCoC][u/InquisitorCoC]] outlined, you can easily make a successful time-travel fic without making him OP. And you get the bonus of giving him and the other characters space for compelling emotional arcs.

Now, if you really want Harry to perform magic outside of the things he performed in canon, then I suggest you create spells that are less technically intensive and more reliant on emotion and intent. Because your assessment of Harry in that regard was really spot on - he manages such strong patronuses and unforgivables because of how strong his emotions could be and how much willpower he has.

This way Harry is performing new and interesting magic, but he manages it because you are playing to his canon strengths, not fabricating ones that we know he doesn't have. If you have certain themes or character arcs in mind, you may even use these emotion-driven magics as a supplement to that.

Lastly, I'd like to point out that magical exhaustion and innate power are not things that exist in canon. With the exception of the Elder Wand, powerful magic comes about from what you know and how deeply you understand the magic at work. It is this knowledge that made people like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, and Hermione as powerful as they were. The major exception to this are, again, emotion and intent-based magic.

I wish you luck on your fic!

*** All that makes sense, but keep in mind that this is a time travel fic. The point of the plot is that Harry, as opposed to canon, is obsessed with /changing/ the future and being prepared for all the shit he has to go through. When I made this post, it was because I wanted to stay true to the canon background, but not because I wanted to make something with Harry being the exact same as he was in canon. We're talking about a scenario where Harry goes through most of what he did in canon, but the losses in the end aren't worth it, to the point where he makes a plan to literally /change fate/. That iteration of Harry does stay true to canon while departing from it IMO, because while he's not driven by a desire to learn and be powerful, he would go to hell and back for the people he cares about, or at least study and practice magic with a higher intensity for them.

Also, him being powerful or smart doesn't mean that he becomes a Mary Sue, although that often becomes the case, I'll admit. I got my inspiration for this story from Turning of the Times by noaacat and recently, the “Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards” series. Both involve Harry time traveling, one to Marauders era, and one to the next generation, and both have him exploring his potential to a greater degree, but that doesn't meant he isn't a flawed character who makes mistakes---- in fact, the main appeal of both fics is that even with that newfound power and dedication, he makes mistake after mistake and shit goes wrong (/especially/ in TotT).

I want to emphasize that this is NOT a do-over fic. It will start out with that premise, but the story isn't about Harry becoming an all-powerful edgelord with a cardboard personality who breezes through life.

** If you go for a time travel, there's really no need to overpower Harry. If he gets back to his Year 1 and he's willing to work with Dumbledore, things are going to be quite easy:

- Tell Dumbledore about the apocalypse if Voldemort is not defeated, scare him to the point where he agrees that *anything* is a go against Voldemort and his Death Eaters
- Get the Diadem Horcrux from the Room of Requirement
- Out Wormtail and exonerate Sirius, and have Wormtail kissed by dementors;
- Out Barty Jr, have him kissed too and his dad sent to Azkaban for life
- Stun Quirrell and hopefully Voldemort. If Voldemort's wraith escapes, he knows it's most likely in Albania
- Raid Malfoy Manor with Dumbledore and Moody in lead, they know where his secret stash is, they will have enough evidence this time to send Lucius to Azkaban for a very very long time. Most importantly, the Diary is now in their hands
- Assassinate Dolores Umbridge and frame the Death Eaters
- Blackmail Rita Skeeter (he knows again) to raise public awareness against Death Eaters
- Rile up Augusta Longbottom, make a big push in Wizengamot to confiscate Crouch, Lestrange, and Malfoy assets. Get the Cup
- Let Sirius and Kreacher have a talk about Regulus, bring the Locket. Put all these Horcruxes in front of the Gaunt Shack, and burn everything down with Fiendfyre. Dumbledore should be able to control it
- Back at Hogwarts, kill the Basilisk with roosters, harvest its venom, sell its parts for gold
- Continue with media campaign against Death Eaters, Dumbledore, now fully in control of the Ministry, proposes reinvestigate all incarcerated Death Eaters at Azkaban, only this time with Veritaserum and Legilimency.
- Follow up on their leads and arrest all known Death Eaters, those guilty of even one murder will be pushed over the Veil. Confiscate their assets to compensate their victims
- Meanwhile, ask Snape to seek out the wraith of Voldemort in Albania. Snape's Occlumency should make Voldemort think that he's on the run from Ministry's purge and he's the last one of his faithful. Once Voldemort is in that weak Homunculus body, a stunner in his back will finally see Voldemort captured
- Now in their custody, force Voldemort to tell all his secrets, then obliviate him fully and completely to his infancy, with the Elderwand. Even if his wraith should escape in some very unlikely fashion, he would only wander the mortal plane as a confused spirit forever! But for now, Voldemort would be petrified and locked behind a ward more powerful than Nurmengard
- Their last major task should be to remove Voldemort's soul fragment from Harry. It may work, or it may not. But since Harry is never a properly made Horcrux, it should be possible to get it out without killing him. If it works, execute Voldemort
- Harry and Sirius can further make big money in Muggle stock market by using his advance knowledge. Cisco stock went up 700 times from 1991 to 2000.

--------------

You see, there's no need to repeat any of the canon stations. There's no need to let any of those scums carrying out their canon schemes. There's no need to make Harry too powerful either, as there's no need to duel Voldemort in a straight fight. You go actively after their weaknesses and secrets (which you perfectly know), mercilessly and ruthlessly.

*** Honestly, I'm with this. Time Travel should break things. Either by the traveler abusing it to their advantage, or things spinning out of control. There isn't any need to super-power the heros.

​

If anything, you should nerf them. Maybe going back in time sapped Harry's magic. Maybe his magic took a hike and went to young!Harry, so now you have powerless!Adult!Harry trying to help Superpowered!Young harry. Or something to make drama.

For [[/u/godlypfer][u/godlypfer]], I had always thought that JK was going for a 'there isn't really inane power levels for wizards, its just how hard they work on connecting to their magic', so anyone with magic who works on it could become similarly powerful. It also limits them, because if you focus on one area it is to the detriment of others, and the jack of all trades is the master of none. I think she may have even tweeted it once?

It counters some other aspects of her world, like squibs maybe having some small access to magic and inherited abilities. Eh.

The biggest problem with fics that introduce 'cool, new magic' is it falls into the trope of 'no-one has ever seen my awesome runes/wild/space/nerfhearding magic. I can use it to trump everyone! Ya'll don't know the real legend of Merlin...' yadda yadda yadda.

It feels like an overlay on top of the world, instead of a puzzle piece. It is adding a 'win' sign to Rock Paper Scissors, instead of creating a piece that fits in equally.

Any new powers you do, you want to think through their limitations and how to make it interesting.

*** No but see, that's the problem. I personally get super bored by standard Super! Harry or indie! Harry fics where everything just falls into place---- it's too easy to make for an engaging read. This fic, while being time travel, is not something I would characterize as a do-over, or at least a successful do-over, because there will be difficulty and mistakes made littered throughout the storyline.

I'm planning to portray Voldemort like he is in Turning of the Times by noaacat--- IMO that's a much more fearsome villain than canon. Intelligent, powerful, cunning as all hell--- that's the type of Dark Lord that seems like the one that even Dumbledore couldn't defeat.

That means it's not as easy to just use future knowledge to fix everything--- in fact, the main point of the story is that everything goes wrong regardless.

** I'd say you could easily place Harry in the top 90-95% for magical power. He doesn't seem to be the best with book learning, and is probalby someone that learns better by actually doing whatever he's working on instead of reading about it. If Harry had one-on-one lessons for more than the Patronus I think he could have been a much stronger magical.

The downside is that Harry tends to be unmotivated through most of his schooling, which you can easily attribute to the Durselys and his early years. There weren't exactly going to pin his report card to the Fridge, and probably taught Harry that drawing attention to himself in any way was a bad thing. Snape, especially his unfairness, and a few other people really screwed up Harry's desire to learn.

I look at Cannon Harry as having a lot of potential that was never realized. Imagine if Dumbledore had talked to him after his first year, and told him that he would do everything he could to help Harry, but his survival would someday rest on his own shoulders. Then let him stay at the school over the summer and arranged a few lessons in magic, just a few people like Remus and Tonks or the Professors when they had time to build on what he knew/teach him a few useful tricks.

Albus could have helped Harry grow into a true juggernaut of magic, but instead we got a disappointment. Then again, that would have lessened the legend of Albus Dumbledore, instead of being the greatest that ever lived, he might have just been a teacher that helped his successor grow into himself.

** Try to give him a progression gradually ig. If he is like in his 20s before his time travel you can give a small sudden jump and then a progression due to motivation. If he is older and more experience you can again do that by saying he is not used to a smaller body or his magic hasn't matured. Nobody likes a suddenly insanely OP Harry
