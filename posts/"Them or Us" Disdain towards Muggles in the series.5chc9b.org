Hi all - my apologies if this has appeared before, but I have something of a gripe and I'm wondering if I'm alone in this or not.

Essentially, the older I became, the more /disillusioned/ (I guess is the best word) I became with the HP world, particularly the divisive "them vs us" mentality wizards/magical folk have towards non-magicals.

There's already been a great discussion about the funny lines of electricity here, but even among the "good" Purebloods, there's disdain towards Muggles - I'm thinking specifically Ron's "well we might have a second cousin who is an accountant, but we don't speak of him" attitude. I realize he's 11, but... still.

Anyway - thoughts? Is that disdain (I honestly can't think of a better word, sorry!) a product of world building to show the issues within the wizarding world, or is it sloppy writing? Is it careful consideration to show how society is, or just suited JK's purposes?


** You see the exact same thing in real life. Think about the Facebook posts, blogs, or whatever where someone goes to South America or Africa, or Asia or pretty much any country or continent that isn't a major superpower. What do they do?

They tell stories about the people's simple lives and snap photos and gush about how it's such an eye opening experience and how blessed they are to be able to come enrich the lives of these people. (Once they get home they instantly forget whatever profound lessons they claim to have learned.)

Not all the time, but quite often, these people's stories can get really patronizing, really quick. It particularly irks me how they go around snapping photos of people without asking, as if instead of individuals the people they encounter are living, breathing tourist attractions. "OMG, can you believe this young boy has never seen his face in a photo?!?"

So yes, I think this facet of the books is just displaying human nature. "These people do not have the same advantages as me, and so they are quaint and amusing."

** I'm actually somewhat.../disillusioned/ by the wizarding world in Harry Potter for different reasons.

It's actually to do with magical races and creatures; even though goblins, centaurs, elves, etc, are highly intelligent, they're refused wand rights, representation in the Wizengamot, and basically are treated as second-class 'citizens' or worse by the government claiming to rule over them.

Plus, the Ministry is utterly corrupt, with how it treats its prisoners (Azkaban), practicing indefinite imprisonment without trial (Sirius, Hagrid, Stan Shunpike) and even extrajudical killings (Sirius's Kiss was technically authorized. Barty Crouch Jr.'s was not.); also the aforementioned lack of representation of non-human races, mistreatment of werewolves, lack of oversight (remember how Dolores Umbridge attempted to assassinate Harry with dementors?)...

There's probably a story to be made out of the magical races thing.

Even though they've subjugated all of the magical races, the wizards still aren't satisfied, they have to make labels like 'pureblood' and 'muggleborn' so they can justify pushing more people under themselves.

If they were successful in ousting the 'mudbloods' in book 7 and beyond, the purebloods would just turn on each other for various reasons (Blood traitors aren't real purebloods! You're not a pureblood if you don't own land! You aren't a pureblood if your ancestors aren't Celtic Druids! Anyone with a muggleborn or a half-blood /anywhere/ in their family tree isn't a real pureblood!) and ultimately destroy themselves.

I suppose the Ministry corruption and incompetence is kind of deliberate, at least; Harry can't be a hero (and therefore, can't be an interesting protagonist) if the Ministry is competent.

The first book might be the only one with any sort of conflict, with a truly skilled Voldemort hunting the Philosopher's Stone.

The second book would have no Lucius Malfoy, the third wouldn't have a wrongfully imprisoned Sirius Black, the fourth wouldn't have a hidden Barty Crouch Jr., the entire plot of the fifth save for the prophecy would be shot, Draco probably wouldn't be a Death Eater (or werewolf) and Harry might not need to be trained for book 6, and the horcrux hunt in 7 would hopefully be undertaken by professionals.

By extension, with the primary antagonists being racial supremacists, mix that in with the incompetent ministry, and you have the systematic discrimination against magical creatures...and, I suppose, muggles.

The complete and utter corruption of the wizarding world in Harry Potter, in summary, is all so that a 11-17 year old teenager can genuinely be the world's best hope.

*** HAHAH thanks for that. I feel the absolute same way, but I focused more on the dividing line between superiority. I think you just put it better into words than I ever could.

Although, see, this is what I have an issue with in regards to some of the other comments here (not with them or the people directly, that is but) -- like JK Rowling deliberately wrote the series this way to reflect human nature. Ok, I get that. I really do -- but I also feel like that gives her /way/ too much credit given the world building required.

If we take what you said here, then she wrote the story so that a teenager can save the world. Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and say ignoring the other potential issues with some of these books, but what about other series where teenagers have to save the world? Like /Ender's Game/? or /the Hunger Games/? Even /Divergent/ to some degree has a fairly competent governing structure that requires a teenager to force change upon society.

So... if that's the case, is the fault with Harry as a not-interesting character?

**** I haven't read those, so I wouldn't know, sorry.

I do know that apparently the world of Hunger Games is some sort of dystopia; why else would teenagers be tossed into glorified gladiator games on a regular basis?

But then, everyone knows that the world of Hunger Games is dystopian; my disillusionment comes from the inherent flaws in the Harry Potter world rarely-if-ever being recognized by canon or fanfiction, it's all super-Harry and Lord Potter and rare magic rituals instead.

What's the fault of Harry?

** I'm going to throw up a "citation needed" tag on your premise, because, uh. That's not exactly how I remember the series.

  “Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,' said Kingsley. ‘However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbours, often without the Muggles' knowledge. I'd like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.'

  ‘And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be “wizards first”?' asked Lee.

  ‘I'd say that it's one short step from “wizards first” to “purebloods first”, and then to “Death Eaters”,' replied Kingsley. ‘We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”

*** I totally understand what you're saying here - but please hear me out on this too - but the language Kingsley uses is still... really "Noble Savage" like what [[/r/TheAxeofMetal]] pointed out:

- "muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering"
- "inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety"

(Although Kingsley does then make an excellent point about 'wizards first' and its delineation)

I just feel like even language like that can be condescending and continues to elevate wizarding folk above non-magical just because they're incapable of protecting themselves. Like, no one can figure out that magic exists in this universe? Everything seems to hinge on the idea that Muggles are dumb and *need* magical intervention against threats because things like, you know, guns, knives, forks even, are ineffectual. (Which I suppose they could be, but if you get a drop on someone... /shrugs/)

**** "Ignorant" isn't a slur, in this case. It's strictly true. Muggles literally cannot see Dementors, for example. It's not language or attitude that put Muggles and magicals on a different levels, it's reality. As Kingsley points out, a human life is a human life, they're "worth" the same thing, morally. But what you seem to take issue with is the reality of JKR's worldbuilding, in which, yes, there are ways in which Muggles are literally helpless and literally ignorant. Again, calling them that isn't meant to be insulting or demeaning, it's meant to be descriptive.

Treating Muggles as morally equal to wizards is not the same thing as treating them <i>the same</i> as wizards, since they clearly are not.

If I were a blind, deaf, 5-year-old, and you saved me from getting run over by a car, the language you used to describe the situation, the language you used to a third party describing how you might prevent that danger in the future, would be, by necessity, paternalistic. Because to treat me, in this situation, as being fully capable of recognizing the potential danger and acting to prevent it would be insane. If you talked about how I could take proactive steps to get out of the way of cars in the future, would that be "empowering" me, treating me correctly as a fellow human or whatever? And if you took steps to put up guard rails, or impose traffic laws, all things that kind of subvert any decision or agency I have there, would that be condescending?

***** I'm not talking about racial slurs specifically - I'm talking about the condescending attitude of "we are better than them" - superiority which /might/ be racist. Or maybe it's elitism.

As for the Dementor thing - that is a specific example of /one single/ threat in the entire wizarding world. Even if you take the Disillusionment spell, which just blends wizarding folk into the background of a scene, is comparable to camouflage.

I don't know - I feel like we're talking about two different aspects of the series here? I think my griping comes from a lack of recognition, whereas you're pointing out difference in ability and I see them as two different, separate entities? Because I completely agree with how you state your example of the blind and deaf five year old here (I don't disagree on that at all).

*** While true, many people in the Magical Britain, including the good guys, have a rather condescending view of the Non-Magical. They seem rather surprised when Muggles achieve things, as if not having magic is a great hanidcap. To magicals it is a handicap, but to muggles who never know about magic it isn't an issue. This innate misunderstanding of what life is like for a Muggle messes with the Magical people's ability to make accurate statements about Muggles and leads them to believe, rather condescendingly, that they are simpler people struggling against their own inability to perform magic and somehow succeeding in a world stacked against them. It's the Noble Savage principle for Magicals and Muggles.

***** Sorry, I wasn't trying to convey, prejudice or disdain, just a level of condescension. But yeah, I doubt people like the Weaselys dislike or are prejudiced towards Muggles just sort of treat them like we might treat a 6 year old who's drawn a cool drawing, "Aww, how cute, look what you've achieved." That sort of thing.

** I think it shows that muggles are considered inferior even by the light side. Other examples are Ron confunding muggles to get a driving licence, Seamus's mum springing the magical world on his dad after they married and the various enchantments that pick on muggles that Mr Weasley has to deal with.

** I don't think it's a "wizards/magical folk" thing.

One of the things JKR showed us, IMO, is that the magical world is exactly the same as the muggle world, just with added magic. I see nothing that is not directly connected to magic that is exclusive to the magical world (lost track of the negatives there). Everything good and bad is a /human/ trait. Magic is just another tool, like technology.

Death camps, bigotry, racism, shunning (even within families), corruption, charismatic leaders turning lethal, slavery, you name it. And definitely "them vs. us". /Tribalism/.

The more I read Harry Potter, the more /impressed/ I am with the accurate portrayal of humanity in general. Because this is the real world, wonderful, imperfect, horrible. People are /people/, with both good and bad attributes. Ron is a good friend, but also a jealous git, loyal but unreliable. Hermione is an annoying know-it-all loyal friend going behind your back to help you. And then there's Harry, the complex hero with so many attributes, a knight in slightly scuffed and tarnished armour.

With very few exceptions, heroes are not perfect, and villains have redeeming qualities. It's not /Disney/, where everything and everybody is essential 100% black or white. To me, it's Miyazaki, were you never really know. The evil witch in the beginning ends up a quirky grandmother at the end*.

*"Howl's Moving Castle". Watch it. (But stay away from "The grave of the Fireflies" (Studio Ghibli, not Miyazaki), a fantastic movie that will kill you. You will think [[/spoiler][Hedwig and Dobby]] lived happily ever after.)

*** I'm a big Miyazaki fan - I've seen /Howl/, thanks! But /Kiki's Delivery Service/ and /Castle in the Sky/ are my favs ;) I studied /Grave of the Fireflies/ for a Japan: Oriental/Occidental grad course last year - thanks, just... Thanks. Ugh. Excuse me while I go curl in a corner.

You have a really great perspective and I appreciate you taking the time to reply here. Thank you! I guess the only thing I would argue is that I don't really feel that many of her characters come across as multifaceted as you write them here (with very few exceptions). A lot feel one dimensional or tropey caricatures. However, I should put my judgment away and consider when most of this was written when all I'm thinking is I want to read about a Wilson Fisk-like character where I don't know if I root for him or Daredevil. :)

** This is something that I felt when I was reading the books more thoroughly as research for my own fanfiction than when I had read them originally. It may be true that it reflects society as it is, but I do see a contradiction in what Rowling claimed to be saying in her stories and what seems to me to be a casual subtext of wizarding (oh how I love that autocorrect turns wizarding to windsurfing) racial superiority. I can't think of any positive examples of Muggle or Squib characters in Canon. Are there any?

It's something I did touch on superficially in one of my own stories, but I was reluctant to give it as much attention as I really wanted to, and even suggesting it has got me into arguments I wish I had avoided.
