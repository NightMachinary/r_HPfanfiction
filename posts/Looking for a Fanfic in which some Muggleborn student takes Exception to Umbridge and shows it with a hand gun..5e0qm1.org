Other situations are also welcome, so long as it's limited to only a single or a small groop of muggleborn and the golden trio are not involved. It doesn't necessarily have to be Umbridge either, though that's preferred.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Imagine how this scene would go:

#+begin_quote
  Josh stepped into Umbridge's office, gun hidden in his pocket.

  As he stepped in, Umbridge looked up from her cat picture and fixed her gaze upon him.

  "What do you want?" She asked, clearly annoyed.

  Without a word, Josh pulled the gun from his pocket.

  "Wha-" She said nothing more, as her previously clear forehead now had a small hole, blood gushing out.

  Josh walked back to his common room, giddy with the knowledge Umbridge was no more.

  Professor Dumbledore looked bemused as Dolores Umbridge stood up to address the students gathered at the opening feast.

  "Thank you for those kind words of welcome, Headmaster" she began to simper, "And I-"

  *BANG!!*

  The words coming out of Umbridge's mouth were interrupted, as she ceased to have a mouth; indeed, the entirety of her head was missing, pieces of her skull and brain matter flying every which way and splattering the wall behind her.

  There was a hush, the entire Hall completely silent, before Umbridge's still-standing headless body began spurting gallons of blood out of the stump of her neck.

  "MARILYN OMEGA SUE!" Professor McGonagall suddenly roared, her eyes on the Gryffindor table where a ridiculously attractive girl was still holding a smoking gun, "I have told you before, .50 magnums aren't allowed at Hogwarts! Also, that was murder!"

  The girl just smiled innocently, "Sorry professor, won't happen again." She paused as though thinking of something, before, "It wasn't murder, though. See, according to Obscure Wizengamot Ruling #3373-6594, when Dolores Umbridge attempted to assassinate me and Harry by sending dementors to my holiday resort, her violating legislation against cruel and unusual assassination made her automatically an outlaw who could be legally killed on sight."

  McGonagall just grumbled, "Yes, well, 50 points to Gryffindor for slaying an outlaw, but, minus 2 points for possessing contraband items and making a mess."

**** Rorschach's Blot has written a nice snip about Harry with a .44 Magnum (enchanted), using it to kill the troll in the bathroom. Hermione freaks out about the gun, and McGonagall calmly explains that given the existence of Reductor Curses and similar spells, every student is walking around far better armed than with a gun.

**** I think they're going to have to care about where they /find/ a gun. Regular policemen don't just carry them around, they are usually kept in pretty secure spots in the houses of rare people who do have the permit to own guns, and underage magic restrictions make it hard to use magic to trick people .

Plane. USA. Confundus.

And even if they can't use magic, it's not like shit hasn't been smuggled into Britain before.

**** It's the /finding/ a a gun that's a problem. Rifles are more common, especially if you live out in the country or know the kind of people that like to hunt, but getting your hands on a handgun isn't easy. It's not like gun shops are common, and the regular police don't even carry them so it's not like you could just ambush a copper on the street.

Speaking as your highly average Englishman, the easiest way /I/ can think of to get a gun would be to put in an anonymous call to the police saying there's someone waving a gun around, and then use magic to nick one from the armed response team. I've no idea what kind of guns they would even turn up with, though. On top of that, any under 17 risks expulsion for underage magic before ever getting their chance to shoot Umbridge, not to mention the illegality of using magic against Muggles at all.

Maybe someone who spends their summers hanging about some kind of street gang might be able to get their hands on an illegal gun, but somehow I can't see a teenager having enough clout within a gang to get close enough to taking a gun (strict gun laws = rare weapons = gangsters treasuring what they do have) or having enough money to purchase one if they happened to know an illegal dealer. The child or sibling of someone high in some kind of organised crime group might have a better chance. (Or might not; I've no idea how these things work.)

Possibly also an army brat might have a chance at getting a weapon, depending on their parent's rank, although I don't know what laws or restrictions there are for military personnel having firearms at home.

****** Just for reference I think the UK police only had to discharge their weapons 6 times in the whole of 2014 outside of training. Pre 1996 handguns weren't completely banned as they are now but to say they were common is a lie. The majority of people with guns these days in Britain are farmers or people who shoot for sport but the sporting guns would be so expensive nobody would ever let one go missing nor are they small.

***** In Divided and Entwined, the Resistance got guns by heading over to Europe, mainly Switzerland, where assault rifles and pistols are kept at home by most men in the 1990s. A confundus, and it's reported stolen. With a Gemino charm applied later, you have all the guns you want. They could have gone a bit farther east, and tapped the Ex-Soviet markets too.

It's really no problem for a wizard to get a gun.
