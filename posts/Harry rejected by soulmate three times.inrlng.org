So basically soulmates are a thing in the AU and a person can be rejected but is he/she is rejected four times by their soulmates then they will never have a soulmate again. Harry is rejected three times by Draco, Remus and Charlie and his final chance was Bill and Fleur. This is all I remember but a huge thank you in advance!
