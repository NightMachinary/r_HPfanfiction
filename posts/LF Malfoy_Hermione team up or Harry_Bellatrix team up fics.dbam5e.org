as for Malfoy/Hermione, i would prefer AU Fics that have them both as Aurors or something like that. Both are in a Comrade/Friend Relationship, so no canon typical bickering or if, its just for the teasing. I would accept Canon Fics with this aswell. I think there would be some tension between them. They dont love each other (at least not both sides) but find the other one attractive and sometimes they share the sheets with each other.

​

As for Harry/Bellatrix....there can be Canon ones, slightly or complete AU. Bellas Behavior can be Canonical, but i would prefer her to be less sadistic/evil. Maybe they meet anew. Some tension between would also be there, maybe she teases him about her lookings or his apparently attraction to her or whatever.

​

I know "Only enemies", but it stays to close to the Canon or gets "worse" with a darkened Harry to the end. No necessary harm between them.


** Delenda Est is a Harry and Bellatrix team up/romance. Though it gets a bit weird towards the middle. It's also a time travel fic.
