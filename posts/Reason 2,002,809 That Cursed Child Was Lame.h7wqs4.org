Was researching the Peverell's for a story, and came across this family tree: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Peverell_family]]

When Voldemort knocked up Bellatrix, he was a /quarter century older than her/. Gross. 72 year old new dad.


** Huh, my dad was 30 years older than my mom. Same with a close friend of mine.

And going by the middleschool rule, half + 7, a 72 year old can date a 43 year old, no problem.

*** I'm sure your dad had a nose and normal skin, though.

** I've dated two guys that were 25 years or more older than me. It wasn't /that/ much of an issue.

**** It made sense for me at the time. I was widowed very young, and I found the younger guys often just couldn't relate to me and my life experiences. Now I'm with a younger guy, but he's very emotionally mature.

** Let me guess: you're American, right? No, I don't mean that in a derogatory way, it's just that... how to put this...

Most Americans I've talked to have this /completely/ bizarre cultural view about age-gap relationships that the rest of the world doesn't share.

Hell, average relationships in the UK would cause a lot of Americans to have aneurysms, heh.

Anyway, the only squicky things to me about Voldemort knocking up Bellatrix are a) he's a 72 year old father, though I suppose being magical and god knows what he did to himself negates that compared to a /real-life/ 72 year old fathering kids, and b) him actually, uh, /procreating/ with Bellatrix.

...Yeah, the latter is what squicks me out completely.

...Need the fucking brain bleach.

** Obviously the said knocking up was not product of /true love/ รก la The Princess Bride. There had to be some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gjws9a/how_au_is_too_au/fqno98u/][other reasons]] (and please ignore the subsequent inane flamewar about Harmony, I really truly don't care about ships that much).
