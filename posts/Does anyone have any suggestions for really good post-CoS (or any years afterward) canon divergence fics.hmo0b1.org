*What I'm looking for:* Fics post-CoS fics where Harry meets Sirius and they basically either live together, Harry realizes Dumbledore's manipulations, Harry discovers his lordship, Harry discovers he has certain powers, or fics where Harry is essentially independent (or any mix thereof). Of course, fics don't have to take place right after the Chamber of Secrets and can take place in any of the years afterward. I'm not really looking for anything post-Hogwarts and I'd prefer it if Harry was at least a little independent or takes control of his life. Weasley, Hermione, and Dumbledore bashing are welcome and I'd be totally cool if the fics include mentor!Snape. Time Travel fics are also completely welcome if they fall in line with what I've mentioned above.

*What I'm not looking for:* Crossovers! The only crossover I'm fine with is if it's Twilight.

*A few pairings I don't want are:* Harry/any-male-Weasley-save-Charlie-or-Bill, Harry/any-girl-who-isn't-Hermione-or-Ginny-or-Luna, any harem/multiple pairings, no Harry/Voldemort (Tom Riddle is okay, I suppose), no Harry/any-other-guys-unless-it's-stated-below, and Draco/Hermione

*Pairings I'm okay with:* Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Charlie, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Luna, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Sirius, or Harry/Remus

Many thanks and much appreciation!

*Some fics I've read are:* linkffn(Make a Wish), linkao3(Never Alone, Never Again), linkao3(The Road Not Taken), linkao3(Evitative)

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.
