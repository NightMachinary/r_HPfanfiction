  Yet Another True Story, chronicling the real incidents behind the myths in the books. (YATS, another genre like YATTFF). Rated M for safety. Chapter 5: Won but Lost is up. The events of 1981. The trials. Chapter 5: Word count 37.5k All positive canon characters are positive; their relations are tweaked.

It is not quite that, BUT, Harry ends up in a muggle world where the books exists, and no --- it is not a "reading the books" fic at all. :)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17409677][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.
