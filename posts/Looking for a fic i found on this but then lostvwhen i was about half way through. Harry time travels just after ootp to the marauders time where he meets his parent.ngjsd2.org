:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Charlus, Dorea and James know who Harry is but no one else does. Harry so far is getting close with the black sisters (Andy,Cissy,Bella). Harry is super powerful and was trained bybthe department of mysteries who sent him to that time as the wizarding world is dying out thanks to voldemort, so Harry is supposed to kill voldemort in that time quickly. Pls help, il pretty sure it was between 100 and 200k words and was on ffn.net.


** Is that stepping back?
