to clarify, I'm not looking for fics where Ron and Hermione betray Harry or they get in a fight and stop talking, just where life gets in the way and they hang out less and spend time with other people. Bonus points if Harry starts hanging out with the secondary characters more.


** Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) get past the first 8 chapters and it turns into a fantastic 5 part complete series

It's stops bashing after about chapter 8 and it's worth working passed it

  During the summer between first and second year Harry does something that has unexpected consequences, for himself and for the wizarding world.

** Linkffn(Prediction, no thank you!) has a three way fight among the trio, but by this point Harry already started hanging out with other people and eventually they make up.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.

** I'm kinda writing a time travel fix-it fic where Harry has already drifted away from Ron and Hermione before he's sent back in time. He'll be hanging out with other people, mainly Slytherins, but it doesn't feature a lot of bashing. The only bashing I've got is based on canon (like Snape's mind-rape or Molly practically taking over Sirius's house).

**** Yes, I have! Sorry for taking so long to reply. I just finished posting the fourth chapter, and just so you know, it takes me on average about a week or a week and a half to put up the next chapter. I probably post around three chapters a month on average, but I'm trying to work up to four or five.
