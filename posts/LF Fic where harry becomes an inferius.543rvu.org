I read a fic a while ago that had Harry getting killed but then resurrected as a special kind of inferius by Dumbledore so he could fulfil the prophecy. As I recall it made him extremely violent, and I remember Voldemort looked more like Tom Riddle than the noseless snake like guy he becomes when he's older. Any help finding it would be much appreciated.


** Nevermind, I found it. It's linkffn(4165301) if anyone wants to read it.

  Five years after Voldemort's victory over the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is a man on the run. But what happens when he is thrown into his twelve-year old body in a freak accident? Non-DH compliant. Complete.
