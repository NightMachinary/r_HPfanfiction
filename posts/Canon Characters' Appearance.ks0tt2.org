I just want to hear how everyone describes canon characters. Not how they're described in canon, but how you like to picture them. All of them. Any of them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Draco, Crabbe and Goyle, Zabini of the questionable gender*, Daphne, Tracey, Susan, Hannah, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Lucius, Narcissa, Sally Anne Perks, etc.

I think of Harry as Indian, Hermione as black, but lighter-skinned, Ron as the most British person ever, Luna as short, and Snape as a supervillain. For reference, I know that there isn't any mention of Harry's skin tone, and Hermione is specified as pale, but I don't care. We write fanfiction. We're allowed to have fun and go crazy. Give reasons why too if you want, if you have some amazing headcanon story for their appearance**.

Obviously, you can be more in-depth than their skin color, and I rather you would, like I imagine Harry as being rather short, and Hermione as rather tall, and Ron even taller than that. Go to town.

Let's have some fun with it.

*Zabini is a dude, but fanfiction is so unclear on this fact I'm thinking about writing a comedy fic where Blaise's gender is actually in question.

**For example, the history of the modern Potter family and how it originated from the combination of an Indian witch and a Potter who was descended from a Roman family who get married during the British occupation of India, with a complex family history as merchants all over the world, which leads to Harry exploring both sides of his heritage. This explaining why Harry might be Indian. Or the goatee Snape almost had actually coming from his emulating of Bond villains, who epitomized wealth and power, which was everything he didn't have.


** I personally think Harry really does have perpetual bedhead, while James just wanted to look messy and charming. That's not to say that his hair wasn't messy, but that Harry naturally comes across the way James wanted to.

*** Because I picture Harry with curly hair, I imagine James's haircut emphasizes the windswept curls, while Harry just has a mop on his head. I like the idea of them having those same appearance quirks, but presented in different ways. Like they both have the windswept messy vibe, but Harry's has his Dudley cast offs giving him more of an, 'I don't care' vibe, while James has expensive and well-fitted clothes that he messes up for the appearance.

** Overarchingly, a little by how JKR portrayed them canonically (in description), but mostly their actors/actresses (for example, Emma Watson with more bushy hair than the elegant curls she had in the later movies) that JKR had direct hand in casting -- so no Blackmione or Desi-Harry (those two always make me facepalm, to be honest).

The one exception is that I always picture Ginny not as Bonnie Wright but as a younger-looking Karen Gillan.

***** I really like her art, it was the cover art for the editions I had. I didn't quite have that same reaction to the actors, because after the Earthsea* special I've become unable to actually see actors as the characters for adaptations. But I definitely have issues imagining Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson as Harry, Ron, and Hermione respectively. The books just add so many minor details that they couldn't use because of the fact that they hired actors as children.

**** Because there's no evidence whatsoever of Harry having Indian ancestry aside from some vague, coincidental connection about Diwali happening the same time as Halloween. You may as well claim Lily Evans/Potter had veela or vampire ancestry by the same logic. Heck, it's so vague that it'd even embarrass conspiracy theorists!

I mean, it's great for an AU fic and all, but these people genuinely believe that canon Harry, the guy we see in the books and portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, is Indian in some way.

Frankly, it and Blackmione are appropriations of white characters. And no, before anyone thinks "it", I'd be just as pissed if characters of other ethnicities were claimed to be others, too. HP is surprisingly diverse and has undertones of acceptance and anti-racism (in the form of blood status) -- you don't need to create or force diversity.

Amusingly enough, Desi-Harry was originally pushed by Indian HP fans who were also of a nationalistic bent (yeah, I have no idea either why they were trying to claim a skinny white kid with green eyes as being Indian in some way), and it took off in the Indian HP fan community, which spread out into the main one.

***** Why would we all be upset about you thinking that characters are canonically a different color? The whole point of this thread is to share our opinions. I've not been trying to criticize yours, but to understand them. If it came across as me criticizing them, I'm sorry. I've been trying to respond to everyone, as I like it when people respond to my thoughts as well.

I hope I can speak for everyone posting on this thread that we aren't picturing them as different races out of a desire for forced diversity, or a nationalistic bent. I'm white, and I still picture Harry as Indian. [[/u/Flat_Ear6039][u/Flat_Ear6039]] is apparently a black woman, and she doesn't see Hermione Granger as black.

The thing I'll criticize you for is critiquing these people for not being 100% canon-compliant. We're writing /fanfiction/. These characters aren't defined by their skin, and the story doesn't in any way thematically revolve around the color of their skin. The worldbuilding doesn't fall apart if a character changes color. If it did, I wouldn't picture Harry as Indian.

This isn't a knock against you, I have no issues with the characters being white.

>I mean, it's great for an AU fic and all, but these people genuinely believe that canon Harry, the guy we see in the books and portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe, is Indian in some way.

But this is insulting. We do not picture them that way out of malice or ignorance. We do it because it makes sense to us. Sorry if this is a bit rude. I understand why you picture them like the actors, but not all of us do. Your image makes perfect sense, there is no need to criticize others for picturing things differently.

****** Because, in this day and age, if you voice an opinion that may seen controversial to other people, you often always get screamed at for 'being' a number of things, such as being a racist, a sexist, homophobic, or even the (misused) term of being a "Nazi" (and a shit-ton of other things). It happens anywhere and everywhere: from Reddit itself to forums, to YouTube comments. We live in an age where people are, well, complete snowflakes.

For example, on one forum I criticized the Harley/Ivy ship in the show Harley Quinn for a number of reasons: one, the relationship build-up was rushed, compressed, and actually unhealthy (as Harley has a co-dependency on Ivy). Ivy was also seriously dating and slated to marry Kiteman, and had genuine feelings for him, and the Harley/Ivy thing has been done to death so much that I hoped they'd go Kiteman/Ivy because it'd be a refreshing dynamic change from other media portrayals.

Within five, maybe ten posts, I was generally painted as being a homophobic bigot because I dared to have the audacity to criticize a LGTBQ relationship. So, yeah.

I guarantee you that someone reading my other comment right now is thinking "pft, what a Nazi" for having a differing view from them. It's just how the world is now.

Anyway, there is a difference between writing stories that have an AU element that diverges from canon and settings that are completely AU: the former is altered canon to fit the writer's needs, like a new branch growing from a plant, even if the branch ends up becoming something unrecognizable from the main plant -- it's still from canon. The latter is changing the plant itself, which is what I see Blackmione and Desi-Harry as part of. There's nothing wrong with that obviously (in fact, a good few of my favourite fanfics go in this direction), but there are people who genuinely believe that this plant is the canon one (to re-use the analogy), or try to change it as being the canon one.

You and others can view Harry as being of Indian ancestry: that's obviously fine and is your personal prerogative/thinking, but reality and canon says differently. Harry isn't Indian, unless something new from JKR says so. He's a skinny, white dude from Surrey that's an underdog hero, for better or ill.

Unfortunately, while you and others like you are different, there are those out there who are determined to retroactively alter characters to fit a narrative -- that includes gender and ethnicity. I've seen it across so many communities with so many different characters, it's actually disheartening (their rhetoric can be literally boiled down to "white is bad, must be diverse! It's not racist if it's against whites!").

Heck, we're even seeing it in comics, these days (although karma seems to be catching up with Marvel and DC on that front).

So, I think you can understand why my views are such.

******* No, I definitely understood your views from minute one. To be honest, I didn't like the Ivy/Harley done in Harley Quinn. It's been done better, and Kiteman was pretty good. I'm happy to see that your point was that we can't change the canon, not that it was wrong to picture these characters as other races. I'm a bit disappointed in some of the characters who seem to be defined by their diversity, rather than just them being diverse. I didn't love Miles Morales until Spider-Verse, and I don't think I'll ever like Riri Williams.

Here's a thought though, why do we care so much about the races for these characters? I mean, it's not super important world-building, like in Earthsea, or crucial to their arcs like Remember the Titans. It's just their appearance. It's the same as imagining a pretty-boy Draco, or Post-DH Ron having a beard. I will never argue Harry actually being Indian, but I do like him that way. It feels like an issue which only matters in the terms of movies, or more visual media. But who knows?

** In theory I don't mind Indian-heritage Harry and black Hermione, but I've begun to associate them with types of stories I don't enjoy. I found that when authors do decide to specify their races, it's rare to merely mention it and much more regular for race and racial discrimination to be a major theme of the story. That in itself is /not/ a negative thing, but it is also not something I personally want to focus on in a HP story, you know? (Some that I've read can also be quite heavy on teenage angst so there's that deterrent too.)

As for how I visualise characters, I'm mostly influenced by the movies. Just can't help it, the image exists and it pops up! There's only few characters whose actor counterparts I do/can disregard; The Marauders. Gary Oldman included, as much as I like the man.

To me, adult Sirius usually resembles [[https://pin.it/7gC2EIE][Aragorn]] from LOTR films but with [[https://pin.it/6CjB0ma][Rufus]] Sewell's general eye area (My headcanon Sirius needs open lids, I'm sorry Oldman, Mortensen..), and the teenage version resembles a model I found on pinterest, [[https://pin.it/5BwrAkK][Maxene Danet Fauvel]]. From there I intentionally continued searching for photos of boys/men onto whom I could project the rest of the Marauders. Here's what I've ended up with: [[https://pin.it/5HL0wpB][Dan Stevens in the role of Peter P.]], [[https://pin.it/3ApSCZh][Luke Powell as R.A.B]] (not part of the squad ik, but usually involved in their stories), [[https://pin.it/6ZEdgUb][Tobey Maguire as James P.]] (but with coarser hair and a more pointy nose)...Remus I haven't quite settled on yet, but something about this [[https://pin.it/2uJBEdW][young man]]'s face speaks to me. The expression is very reminiscent of the film (adult) Lupin, I think.

Also there's Walburga Black who seems to be by many fans imagined as [[https://pin.it/99PCdAC][Eva Green]] and I could get behind that one. But then I saw this [[https://pin.it/aAT4lm2][lady]] and my brain just claimed /this woman gave birth to Sirius Black!!/

And of course! Here's [[https://pin.it/Fw9x4CS][Lily Evans!!]] Something about her face resonates right for the role to me. There's the trademark red hair green eye combo, naturally. The only thing I see different in my mind's eye is that her lips are much thinner than the good lady who's likeness I linked.

Hermione is amongst those who's actress imprinted onto me, but I definitely do imagine her with curlier and more voluminous hair than Emma has.

** The more I read fanfics the more indian Harry becomes in my head which is weird. Because I'm remembering two Harry's. Old Harry from when I first read the books and now-Harry after reading so many indian descriptions of his hair and skin tone and parents.

I read Marauder fics so I've vivid images of them...

Remus is very tall. 6'5 ish. Long arms and legs that sorta hang from his body. He's always stooped. His skin is very pale with pink scars running across his nose and cheek dotted with freckles. Everything about him is knobbly, every joint and elbow. You don't often see his eyes but they're a light brown, hidden under a brown/blond messy mop of light, thin curls. He smokes and has this sternness to him. A sarcastic smirk that seems to live on the curve of his lip. He is either concentrating so hard there's a crease between his eye brows or he's raising one eyebrow at you as though questioning your decisions. He doesn't need to talk much. He is sarcastic just by looking at you 😊. He is casual and reserved all at the same time. Hands in his pockets and always leaning on something. It makes him look cool but it's to take the weight of his joints. He limps slightly when he walks. Hes one of those people who wouldn't take up space in a room but when he does he commands it. Can take on the whole world just by raising his chin and standing up straight (not that he does it often...) And God love this boy but he is always in brown and beige.

I got carried away sorry. I'll be here for days if I do the other three 😂.

** I love this!!

I dont really see the skin colors as different. I mean, I see characters like the trio, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Marcus Flint, etc as white but characters like Dean, Lee, Angelina, etc. Are black and Cho is asian. I just don't picture it as any different, haven't really ever thought it honestly.

1. Harry is short. He and Hermione are kind of around the same height. And some writers write him as having longer hair-nooo I can't picture that. In my mind, his hair is how Daniel had his in PoA.

2. Seamus is short like Harry but maybe a little taller. They're the shortest boys in their dorm (I like short guys so this is kind of where this comes from lol)

3. Katie Bell is a blonde. She's of medium height, not too tall or too short. She's a tomboy, so she's always seen in something casual when not in her quidditch/school uniform and her best friend is Oliver. She usually wears her hair in a high ponytail or two braids (where they start at the top of her head)

4. People usually write Marcus Flint as being super tall and with a lot of muscles. I don't see it. In my mind, he's of average height, maybe learning toward 6' but he's not really muscular. He also secretly has glasses but he doesn't like to wear them because they almost look like Harry's

5. Bill, Charlie and Percy are the taller Weasley boys. Ron is taller than Hermione or Harry but he only stands at 5'10 or 5'11. His older brothers (the three I mentioned) are over 6 foot

6. Colin Creevey has dirty blonde hair but Dennis is a brunette.

7. Percy has bright blue eyes (I don't know if this was mentioned in canon or not) and if anyone paid attention, those were his most expressive feature.

8. The Dursleys are brunette. Dudley eventually got himself in much better shape. Vernon did not

9. Adrian is pretty much how his actor looks in the 2nd movie

** Draco is almost as tall as Ron but carries himself much better (shoulders rolled back, walks with his chin lifted up, etc). Like I think I imagine around 6'2" ish for both. Harry is barely 6'0", and I cringe at fics that write him being one of the tallest characters (not sure why every characterization is a valid one!!!). Hermione and Luna are average height at 5'5", and I always imagined Ginny as being on the short side, like 5'3".

Didn't imagine Indian Harry until I started reading some fics, but I really do love the idea of him having some color to him! It's something I can't unimagine. I have a harder time with imagining Hermione as Black for some reason (even though as a Black woman I desperately want to), and I don't think any of the Weasleys are completely covered head to toe in freckles in my head. Draco and Luna are extremely pale.

Draco does not have silver hair, it's just blond, (I think I imagine Luna's closer to this silver color that I see in so many fics) Hermione just needs some good conditioner so I don't typically imagine her as having this massively bushy hair, and Harry's "messy hair" is a mix of neglect and genetics. And the Weasley's hair is orange!!

*** The reason why Harry is often short is due to the effects of malnutrition. It tends to stunt growth. I imagined Ginny as short too, I wonder why that stands out. As for Hermione being black, I tend to imagine her as having a lighter shade of black skin, with her having surprisingly light hair. The actress who they got for cursed child was good from what I could see, but I couldn't see her Hermione any more than Emma Watson. I have a hard time picturing a massive bush on her head too, especially in their later years. Once it gets to that point conditioner doesn't work the same.

While I don't think he's as tall as Ron or other tall characters, I don't think in cannon he was suffering from the effects of malnutrition. I think he just had a late growth spurt. I'd say his height by the end of the books was probably 5'10 or 5'11

**** Oooh I think I can definitely see a light-skinned Hermione! I completely agree with you about how the actress for cursed child and Emma Watson both weren't completely accurate in the way someone like Rupert Grint was for me (he's the closest to my imagination of Ron, although in my head Ron's face is thinner), which is why I might struggle with imagining Hermione as being dark skinned. And I completely agree with the malnutrition having a role in Harry's height, and I think Ginny being short is fitting for the running joke of short people are the most fiery :) Just seems funnier in my head to have her wildness in a smaller package!!!

***** Have you seen the Ron actor for cursed child? He looks a lot like Rupert Grint in some ways but has a lot longer and thinner of a profile than Grint. Also he looks super British.

*** One day, I'll see a fanfic where they make Susan Bones a brunette. On that day I'll know that end of the world has come. I wish Amelia Bones got to be a character for more than three sentences

** Idd imagine ginny has a different look than the actress, cause while she is no slouch ginny would be better looking. And narcissa actually looks like the youngest black, instead of the oldest. Discounting tonks at least. Other than That i always thought of angelina Jones as blond, alicia spinnet as a redhead and katie bell a brunette.

*** I have a habit of imagining Andromeda and Bellatrix as similar, but with Bellatrix having the years in Azkaban show, and Andromeda just looking like a happy person. Laugh lines and all that jazz
