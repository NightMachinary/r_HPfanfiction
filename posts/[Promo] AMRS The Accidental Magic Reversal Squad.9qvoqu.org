Setting: It is prisoner of azkaban and Harry potter has just blown aunt marge and left the house, but the accidental magic reversal squad is yet to arrive...

Aunt Marge had become blow and was bouncing around on the ceiling. Her fingers were like salami. "I told the boy that I didn't want any funny business!" yelled Vernon. "I hate him and all his freakishness!" /Although... I suppose Marge did have it coming. It's high time somebody to did something to reign in her abrasiveness, it's just a shame it had to be that little freak./ His sister's dog had calmed down the moment Harry had left the house, but Aunt Marge was still blow.

"AAAAAAAHHH get me down!" Screamed Aunt Marge, amid much terror and panic. "I'm going to die and it's all that freak's fault!" Aunt Marge wanted nothing more than to see Harry Potter finally get the beating he deserved. /Next time I see him I'll have ripper tear him to shreds!/

Aunt Petunia had closed all the curtains. "Oh my world, what are the neighbors going to think?! That horrid boy!" Secretly, though, Petunia was glad someone had finally made her sister-in-law shut up about Lily. Petunia just stood in the corner of the room awkwardly as Aunt Marge floated around and an irate Vernon fumbled around.

This whole fiasco was affecting Dudley quite differently, however. He was having flashbacks to the time Hagrid gave him a pig's tail, but was secretly glad Aunt Marge had been made into blow due to her spiteful presence. Unbeknownst to the others, Dudley seized the opportunity to stuff as much food from the table as he could into his shirt, and waddle into the lounge to watch TV.

Before long, there was a knock on the front door. "Don't open it!" Cried Petunia. "It's probably the neighbours!"

"Good! They'll be able to help." Snapped Vernon, unwilling to put up with any of his wife's paranoid nonsense.

"Tell them to do something quick!" Marge hounded at Vernon, as he scuttle out the room to go answer the door.

On the doorstep stood three robed, strange-looking men with silly hats. "My name is Cornelius Fudge," declared the one in the middle. "I am the Minister for Magic, and we are the accidental magic reversal squad. This here is Kingsley Shacklebolt," he said, gesturing to his left. "And this here is Mad-Eye Moody. May we come in?"

"Yes, get in here quick and put my sister right!" Commanded Vernon. The Wizards followed him in to the dining room, where Aunt Marge was still floating around.

The squad all pulled out their wands, pointed them at the Fat Lady and cried out "FINITE". A long, large fart noise filled the room as Aunt Marge started deflating and was lowered to the ground. Before she could gather her senses, Kingsley pointed his wand at her again and cast Obliviate. "We must wipe her memory of this whole ordeal, and you are never to speak of the flight of the fat lady every again."

"Thank you," responded Vernon. "Now get out!" The three wizards promptly left as Aunt Marge came back to consciousness.

Aunt Marge sat back at the table and took a large sip of brandy. "So, Petunia. What's for dessert?"


** Aye, thought the title was ASMR and was /really/ confused for a few seconds there.
