*Enter the URL or Story ID of a fanfiction.net story you want to find similar fics for.*

As an example, for one of my favorite stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero]], some of the top recommendations look like this:

- The Denarian Renegade
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom
- Ectomancer
- The Skitterleap
- Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time
- Hogwarts Battle School

Now I don't know about you but those recommendations seem pretty good to me!

It is pretty amazing that the bot can draw on the collective wisdom of this sub over the past few years to do something like this.

This is pretty crude/simple and there is a lot of room to contribute, so please do: [[https://github.com/FanfictionBot/fanfictionbot.github.io/issues/3]]


** Awesome! How did you set the relationship between fics? I chose a fic ID that I rarely see anyone else link and have linked multiple times and while quite a few of the fics on the list were ones I also often link, there were a surprising number I haven't linked or even heard of, so I'm assuming it's not just based on who submitted the link request or fics that were requested in the same comment.

-similar tags?

-amount of favourites/hits

-how many times linked w/bot

** Ok. Not a problem and I believe that this is a brilliant resource. However, I would like that there would be a little bit of white space at the bottom of the screen so that I could scroll down a bit more.\\
Also, if it could add the fic summaries in the same way that the bot does would be good. And a handy download button would be really nice.
