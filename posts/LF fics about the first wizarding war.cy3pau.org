I haven't really seen any of these and I think they'd be really interesting. How'd Sirius begin to suspect Remus? When/how did Peter join the Death Eaters? Who were Lily's friends, etc.


** It hurts me in the soul to read canon compliant fics about the first Wizarding War. I made that mistake once, and it was an absolutely excellent fic that I've since done my best to forget coz it made me weepy for a week.

So here are some quality canon-divergent fics about the first wizarding war.

The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety.

#+begin_quote
  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  (It all starts with Peter Pettigrew dying twice. First, Peter kills Wormtail (discreetly), and then Sirius kills him (less discreetly).It's never easy losing a friend, even in a war, but it's far worse when it means you lose the last of your childish hopes.)War is a complicated, messy thing. The Marauders have their fucked up shit to deal with, but they also have each other. It's not all that easy, though.

** Romance of the Age is one of my favorite fics, canon-compliant, and written in a style completely different from canon. It's hilarious.

Edited to add: I don't know why the bot isn't working, so I'll just copy and paste a little sample of this story:

Everyone always pointed out how popular Prongs was. Prongs seemed terrifically popular. Prongs was always laughing and flinging Galleons at people. That sort of behavior indicated popularity.

“He has precisely three friends,” grumbled Benjy Fenwick.

** And here's a self recommendation about Remus spying on the werewolves in the first war. Work in progress. Warning, it's pretty dark.

Sometimes the bot links things automatically when I do this and sometimes it doesn't. I don't know what's up with that.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.
