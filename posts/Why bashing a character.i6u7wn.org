Seriously, whats up with that? I dont get ut, characters are characters, and deciding to make a character only for bashing robs an author of so much creative potential and opportunity, it's bizarre!

You end up dealing with characters unable to change, having to fit the mold of the bashable character, and thats it, thats the character.

Hell, there are some wonderful fics where there is great character growth, an interesting story, and then they interact with the bashed character in the same old trite way, driving me out of the story completely.

So yeah, as I said before, why bashing a character?


** I mean, you've gotta remember that opinions on characters vary wildly in this fandom and bashing is thus Highly Fucking Relative^{TM.} Draco is both a war-criminal unrepentant-nazi and a floofy boy desperate for affection, for example. To people who believe the latter, calling Draco the former would be bashing. To those who believe the former, it's just who he is.

To give a more popularly-used example, for some people, it's totally believable that Ron would abandon Harry when he didn't get Hermione or Harry refused to share his incredible amounts of wealth or befriended too many Slytherins, or whatever else. For others, it's basically unbelievable that Ron wouldn't be the loyal-est of loyal friends and a total tactical genius.

Right or wrong, that's what they feel the character is, so what you see as bashing, they see as accurately reflecting what they see his character as. And yes, that applies both ways, though I'm not sure what the 'positive bashing' term is in fandom yet - I'm a fan of 'Sin-washing', personally. :)

For some, it's also that they really don't like a character and want them to get the comeuppance they see them deserving and not getting in canon. So, they don't want them to grow or develop into decent human beings - if they did, they wouldn't be what that person saw in that character that was so worthy of that comeuppance.

For others, it's just because they need an easy villain for a secondary plot and putting any more effort into a villain that isn't even part of the A-Plot would be wasted effort. If you're writing a Harmony Romance fic, your main plot is the relationship building, not the conflict with their ex-bestie over who boinks who. I know I've done that in D&D before - the bullying town bravo who picks a fight with the players doesn't need to be deep, just a dick. :)

And yeah, there's probably bits of laziness, lack of confidence, or otherwise 'writery' qualities mixed in through all those different things I mentioned. Sometimes they're the reasons all on their own. At the end of the day, Character Work is the hardest part of writing and some people don't feel they can do it, or don't want to put the effort in, or probably a dozen other reasons too. People are a weird blend of overly simple and deeply complicated that's hard to really capture - there's a reason why OCs are often hard to do right.

** Some people use the bashed character as a foil to be overcome in addition to the main bbeg. Ie ron bashing fics where his jealousy helps harry to make other friends that bring him better tools to fight Voldemort

*** Yup. They can't write him off or just have him not appear at all in a non-bashing manner. It needs to be at the forefront.

** It happens usually because the author thinks the character got off too easy in the original work. They need to be punished and/or called out more.

** Lack of creativity. Come on, people can argue that it helps move a character from point A to point B, but that's like the laziest way of doing it. Like "I need this character to have money, what do I do? Oh, I know, he just won the lotto!".

If in order to have Harry be friends with someone else you need to bash Ron, you show not only lack of understanding of Ron, but of all characters involved. There must be like a hundred clever ways of accomplishing it keeping Ron as a friend, and a hundred more of accomplishing it without keeping Ron as a friend.

Come on, even those who hate Ron can't find a natural way of producing conflict without turning a well-rounded into a cartoon of himself? You don't make people say "Man, Ron can really be a prick". Instead you get "This character, who is clearly not Ron, is a prick, a Buffon and a one-note lazy character. And the Hadrian dude kinda is too."

Want people to see Ron's bad traits? Well then write about Ron, not Ron's evil moutached twin.

All bashing if lazy. Ron's. Dumbledore's. Hermione's. Even the Malfoy's and Dursley's. I think Malfoy is a prick, but I wouldn't write in of him killing people for sport, or unrealistically coward (just his normal share of bigotry and cowardice). I think the Dursley's are douchebags, but I don't see them keeping Harry in shackles and never letting him see the sun.

There. Now all the bashing loving people can downvote me.

** Because people like it, simply put

I've seen people say that people who write it "lack creativity" because it usually follows the same pattern. But you could say the same thing for a lot of people who write marriage law stories, WBWL, etc.

I happen to love bashing stories. It's just interesting to see something different. Sure, some people don't wrote the bashing well; I'm kind of picky so I try to avoid the ones where the ones being bashed explain everything where Harry usually overhears and it's said in a way that feels too awkward and not like a natural conversation

** Because it is sometimes quite cathartic. We're not all reading or writing for some "correct" portrayal - sometimes it's just about beheading the imaginary barbie-doll because we feel like it today.

Why do you think humans tell stories at all? It's the same basic motivation - we're expressing or exploring something that for some reason (usually good reason!) is best kept imaginary.

** Because some people can't take criticism towards their favourite characters/ships.

There's also the lack of creativity to consider as well. Some pairings as so hackneyed that you only need to read a small sample of fics to know what the majority of the rest is like.
