That said, it's probably best to avoid if you hate the author so.

**** If you're concerned about the insane amount of suffering that his fics can have, that hasn't happened yet in this one. Relative to his other fics, this one is almost lighthearted!

Speaking personally, I liked Broken Chains a lot (it raises interesting ethical questions), thought how he tied HP, Star Trek, and Star Wars together in the Founders trilogy to be interesting, and found the Firebird trilogy to be too much for my tastes.

So that's where I'm coming from when I say that "Katarn Side" doesn't have insane amounts of suffering and isn't over the top.

  An aged, broken Jedi general came to Earth hoping to retire. However, when he went to a park and saw a young boy with unlimited Force potential getting the snot beat out of him, he knew the Force was not through making his life interesting.

** Just started reading linkffn(10937871). I found it while going through [[/u/KwanLi]]'s favourites on ff.net.

Harry is not invited to Hogwarts because of a preexisting condition. I'm about halfway through so far. I really like that the authors haven't treated Harry's condition as an endless source of angst. The magical/scientific theory subplots are a bit overdone for my taste, but overall it's a solid start.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** I get that he just wants to explore the idea (he jumps straight into year 4 after the prologue and never bothers to come back to it) but it's just so stupid...

If Vernon actually tried sending such a letter, then Dumbledore would have personally showed up later that very day to set things straight. Also, this level of obvious child abuse and child labour would never fly. There's no way a muggle school (and by proxy the police) would allow this to happen.

I just can't see it happening...

** Hmm.. well there are many and a few of my choices have already been mentioned, but here's one a bit off centre. This story is from a cross-over between Harry Potter and Stargate Atlantis. If you know the general gist of Stargate Atlantis, then you should be mostly right to read this story without reading the prequels. that said, the prequels of this story are really good and have an interesting branching concept (it starts with a short story before the next two stories branch into two different choices and then other stories hing off those branches). Being summoned by the cup is quite literal and very shocking since Harry is in another galaxy at the time and has no real knowledge of the magical world. linkffn(6562075)

Enjoy!
