  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** Time and Again [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13169380/1/]] After a drawn out conflict, Harry Potter disappears from the final duel and reappears in his fourth year. Dealing with all of the changes to his past will be his biggest challenge yet (Time Travel/Universe Swap. Powerful Harry. Teacher Harry. Alive James and Lily. 82k words/15 chapters. Gen. WIP.)

Burning Red [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19793110/chapters/46860157]] [Partial Summary] Around the time most young children do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. (Drarry Pre-Slash. Manipulative Dumbledore. 88k words/15 chapters. WIP.)

The Heir of the House of Black [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]] [Partial Summary] This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving. (Time Travel/Alternate Universe kind-of-not-really. MoD Harry. OP Harry. Reborn Harry. Political Harry. Slytherin Harry. Gen. 208k words/29 chapters. WIP.)

I enjoy all of these very much. I find the plots and character interactions very interesting, and the writing engaging, although I should put on a bad grammar warning for the last one. It's not horrible, but it does take a chapter or two to get used to.

  Around the time most young children do, Harry's hair goes from his father's dark locks to his mother's bright, most-likely-magical red hair. It changes everything about who Harry identifies with, who he wants to grow up to be, and who he thinks he is. Instead of having James Potter as his idol, Lily Potter turns out to be a much better influence. So instead of seeing a scruffy, most-likely-a-muggleborn boy standing beside him in Madam Malkin's before their first year, Draco only has eyes for the scarlet haired, green-eyed creature who just walked into his life and instead of an enemy, he finds a reason to be better than he'd been raised to be. Not that Harry will ever notice, given he's trying to simply survive at Hogwarts.And Severus might not make it to see these boys graduate when his heart kept giving out seeing his very-Slytherin godson repeat his own history and go chasing after a green-eyed, red-haired Gryffindor. Turns out the Malfoys aren't that bad and Dumbledore definitely is. Remus is at his wit's end and Sirius gets a chance to actually live up to his title as Harry's dogfather. Tom Riddle is not prepared for any of this.

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday.

It updates weekly, with breaks for research and writing up a backlog between books.

A bit of a nitpick, but the group is heavily into tabletop RPGs, with only Harry that is into cyberpunk (fiction, films, games) as deep as he is, and they only gave him an environment to experiment with magic, because he does almost all of the work himself.

** linkffn(*Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay*)

What it says on the tin, Harry is a dragon. well written, captures the tone of the first two books and runs with it. a delightful lack of the politics and angst that seems inescapable in HP fanfiction.

My one complaint is that actual plot is often substituted for jamming as many creatures and animals into each scene as possible, but still very much worth a read.

linkffn(*What's Her Name in Hufflepuff)*

A comedic story featuring an author insert character (or something very similar) that kind of just exists in the background of Harry Potter's story going on her own adventures and making minor adjustments here and there.

Great so far but has shown a few disappointing signs of abandoning light hearted fun in favor of humdrum grimdark.

linkffn(*Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting*)

Something like a single change fic (where one change is made and the story evolves differently as a result). In this instance the change is in the title; Many of the students in Harry's year are sorted into non-cannon houses.

Notable for interesting ideas, good delivery and (as rare as it is welcome), actual deviation from cannon.

So far the author seems willing to commit to the change that is the crux of their story and run with it in a meaningful way.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

It's very my little ponyish but becomes progressively less so as plot develops. That also counts for the Mary Sue-ness

I hope the story is funny but it's also a little tragic sometimes.

Currently I have one review! And it was a nice one. So by that faultless logic everyone should read it.
