Through some minor catastrophe, the Hogwarts Express breaks down and the students of Hogwarts must take the Hogwarts Rail Replacement Bus Service. Hilarity ensues.


** Every student crammed into the Night Bus. Unfortunately it's still running a regular service so it's making several stops before arriving at Hogwarts.
