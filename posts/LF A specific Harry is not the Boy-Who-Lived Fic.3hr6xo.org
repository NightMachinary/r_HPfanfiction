Hi. I remember reading a fanfiction with Harry being the brother to the "boy-who-lived"(i don't remember if Harry ended up being the boy-who-lived). The most vivid thing I remember is Harry ends up dueling his brother and beating him and his father, and ends up running away. If anyone can give me the title/link, I would be most grateful. Thank you!


** I just know the summary so i don't know the duel thing but, can it be sacrifices arc?

*** No. It is definitely not the sacrifices arc. I think the fic i'm talking about continues with Harry leaving for Flitwick's house. I'm not too sure though.
