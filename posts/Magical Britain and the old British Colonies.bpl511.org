Do you guys think it's just the Isles or do you think it spreads to the rest of the old territories?


** Hard to say. In North America, we know that wizards formed their own magical government there (MACUSA) long before the Muggle 13 colonies sought independence, and there doesn't seem to have been any struggle between the American and British wizards over this. The American wizards just got together and formed themselves a government out of the prior state of anarchy. So it seems like the British Ministry never even tried to assert rule over magical North America.

On the other hand, we know that there was a magical New Spain, implying that elsewhere European nations /did/ extend their rule to colonial holdings.

So I don't think it's a case of there being a general rule like "wizards did engage in colonialism" or "wizards did not engage in colonialism". Rather it's a case by case thing.

** I think wizards had a big role in colonialism. Using it to support the forced enforcement of it on the parts of the world that didn't have it. Mainly Subsaharan Africa, SE asia, native American groups.

Fast forward to WW2 and grindelwald's attempted destruction of the statue, I think a lot of the places that still could rise in support of him. After the war, those nations which could waged a campaign of suppression under ICW command while places like Germany, Britian, France, low countries were to exhausted to be involved.

Thus the commonwealth countries plus US parts of South America are fairly stable, they aren't fans of the do nothing British, Dumbledore international legacy, amplified if Voldemort was a threat to the Statute
