So Anyone know any fics where they find out Tom Riddle is Voldemort sooner in the chamber of secrets or where the public finds out sooner? Could also be considered a prompt I guess.


** Plot twist: The hat is an animagus time traveler or some shit and just wants to mess with everyone. Don't ask me how any of that works I have no clue.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
