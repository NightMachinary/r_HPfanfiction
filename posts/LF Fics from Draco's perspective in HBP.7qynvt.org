** I'm commenting mostly to bookmark this thread. I'd love to read something like this that is more canon compliant - I have come across this in some Drarry fics (I don't remember which ones though) but it's never quite how I would imagine canon Draco to be during that time.

Shameless self plug here: I did write my own fic that might be of interest to you (if you're okay with slash?). A lot of it is written from Draco's perspective in HBP and deals with his internal struggles. I'll link it if you're interested.

** Here is a story I wrote a few years ago that showed Draco's life during the summer before HBP. I hope there are good responses to this thread.

*** Not OP, but I read your story and just wanted to say that I really liked it. I thought your characters were well written and I would have liked to read the entire sixth book from Draco's POV - I love reading stories that show canon events from a different person's perspective, especially those on the opposite side as Harry. Thanks for sharing!

***** I just finished reading Detox and really enjoyed it! I like your characterization of both Draco and Astoria, and also thought the battle scenes were well written.
