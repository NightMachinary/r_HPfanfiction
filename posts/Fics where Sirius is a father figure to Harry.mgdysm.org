  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

**** I think they did a good job of leaving a few plot points that could be used in a sequel while also clearly completing their story and wrapping up everything important

  In a world larger and more complicated than anyone could expect, how will Harry Potter navigate and survive when raised by House Black -- an Ancient and Noble family with a long and bloody history? Surrounded by powerful new players watch House Potter rise from the ashes of defeat and reclaim their place in the annals of history, by any means necessary.

  The fallout from the Dueling Club was worse than in Canon and leads to the release of one Sirius Black from Azkaban. And he is not amused. 1 SLASH couple.
