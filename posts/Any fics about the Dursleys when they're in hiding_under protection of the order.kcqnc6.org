Currently re-reading the books (the original books, lol), and I'm at chapter 3 of the last book where there's a discussion about how the Dursleys need to go and they'll get protection by the order and be in hiding.

Are there any fics about their period in hiding? I'd like to imagine that they were exposed to a lot more magic than they'd wish for.


** - “Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows by Grey Streaked Fur” linkffn(11769405)
- “Dudley Dursley and the Bee Hive by Jmso” linkao3(14869065)

The first I don't recall much, the second one is really great.

  We all know Harry's story during this time, but did you know that his cousin Dudley also played a part in the war against Voldemort? Find out what happened to the Dudley and his family after they left Privet Drive to go into hiding.
