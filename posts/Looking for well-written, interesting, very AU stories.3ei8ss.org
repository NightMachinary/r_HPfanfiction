I really like stories like /Wit of the Raven/, /Hogwarts Battle School/ and /The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig/. I'm looking specifically for the best of the best of the very AU stories, hopefully similar to those mentioned above in terms of originality.

A complete rework of the plot and/or magic system is great, but I don't really like time-travel or Mary Sue stories, although a well-done time-travel isn't a dealbreaker. Just a different Harry (or other protagonist) isn't enough of a change - I'm looking for gems like /Dimension Hopping for Beginners/ or /End of the Line/ where the story is different from the standard "Harry (or other protagonist) is special because _____ and goes to Hogwarts for 7 years and fights Voldemort" - basically, the thing I'm looking for is more inspired by rather than based on canon.


** I'm sure that some people are beginning to suspect that I have some agenda for promoting linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) so much, but it does fit the bill for what you're looking for, I believe.

** Some heavy AUs that immediately come to mind:

- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph14), where Salazar Slytherin had taken over a thousand years prior, resulting in a very different world, where everyone has to be a little more cunning and ambitious.
- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin), which is very much an "everyone's more badass" AU.
- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), which features a reimagined wizarding world with a distinct and thought-out culture.
- linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl), where Voldemort won in 1991.
- /Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles/ linkffn(10644439), where... you'll just have to read it.
- An off-FF.net non-magic AU: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]], where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training spies, handlers, interrogators, hackers, and other operatives for Britains tumultuous Intelligence Community. Old families, like the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", send their children there; but some common children get an invitation if they do something sufficiently interesting and vicious at a sufficiently young age. (Hermione gets in for solving the murder of her friend, then gaslighting the murderer into suicide, and almost getting away with it; Colin Creevy gets in for taking some pictures that he shouldn't have and certainly shouldn't have been able to...) Magic is replaced with skill and science, and, occasionally, with James Bond style superscience.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** These two are really good. PotDK is ridiculously good and very different with Voldemort having won the original war because he was never killed due to Harry's parents going to Germany and it builds on that with one of the best Voldemorts, some really well developed relationships, amazing world building, and and a good deal of mystical elements which stem from Paganism and such. Magics of the Arcane has Dumbledore serve as Harry's mentor and adds in ancient magic and world building for places outside of Britain, it's less AU but it is different.

**** It's correct and it may seem a bit daunting, but it's absurdly good and probably one of the best stories on the entire site. It'd probably look better if the author broke it down into books. The part that makes it easy to begin is that until part of the way through the 5th book (it's currently around the beginning of the 7th) the chapters are short which makes you feel a lot better and something about both long chapters and a lot of them is a lot harder.

It has a really interesting Voldemort and Harry has a really unique relationship with him which is very hard to describe but, Snape is great and he has a nice relationship with Harry as well and it expands the world of HP while adding a lot of things which only make it better such as the effects of religion on magic, going into details about werewolves, and an optimized Wizard Britain.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  A shell shocked but triumphant Harry Potter decides to leave his world behind for another. Someone should have told him that AUs can be really, really different. HP/ X-Men crossover.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
