Does anyone know any good fanfictions where Remus is the one who ends up in Azkaban for betraying the Potters instead of Sirius? I think that would be a cool idea but I've never seen it done before so I was hoping someone could recommend a fic like that:)


** It's an interesting idea, the main "problem" with it is that Remus would be dead. There's no way the ministry wouldn't take the chance to execute a werewolf.

*** that's fair, but I feel like there could still be good fics disregarding or somehow explaining that - there could be activists that put pressure on the Wizengamot to not execute him for example, idk lmao

** Great idea ! But how would you explain Sirius not taking Harry ? He doesn't have the "werewolf" excuse to be far away

*** guilt maybe, for letting the Potters die? or because of the blood protection from the Weasleys I guess - but he could maybe have some kind of role in Harry's life, I feel like that wouldn't have to change the plot dramatically

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7245277/chapters/16449256]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7698577/chapters/17541160]])

both part of the same finished series. They're very dark, very AU and very well-written. Rating is explicit more for (psychological) violence than for sex if I remember correctly. Pairing is Remus/Sirius, a bit of romance but mostly dystopian mystery/thriller.
