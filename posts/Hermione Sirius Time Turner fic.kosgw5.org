Hi! I read this fic one time which I have never never been able to find again, wondering if anyone knows it? It's after the war, Hermione uses a time turner to go back to the Marauder's era (but she is able to get back; she knows she won't be stuck). She only tells Dumbledore when she goes back in time, and she befriends Lily and the Marauders. She helps push Lily to date James and she falls in love with Sirius. The big detail I remember is that she tries to steer Peter to good, and then at the end she is Sirius's date to a party (maybe the Yule Ball?) but Peter takes her aside and **I think kills her or something? Hopefully someone knows the one I'm talking about, thank you sm!
