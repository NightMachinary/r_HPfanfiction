- Crack oneshot collection on fanfiction.net, no pairings
- Harry is in Slytherin, everyone else is in original houses
- Malfoy makes fun of him for having a trunk with many locks on it, Harry later steals his stuff and Malfoy realizes why he has the locks
- DA still exists, Harry uses a chain of command system to exploit Umbridge's loophole
- Hermione and Tracy Davis hate each other but are on the same side
- Ron spies on Umbridge by pretending to get the Invisibility Cloak confiscated then using it to spy
- Harry tricks Hermione and Tracy Davis into having a sexy mud fight in the Room of Requirement
- Malfoy thinks Harry is dead and goes to his grave. He gloats, and someone asks what he's doing. He turns around and Harry pulls out a strap and shoots him

This fic is so hilarious and specific. Please help me find it!

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
