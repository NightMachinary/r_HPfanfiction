Justin is probably just as much of a rich kid as Malfoy or any other member of the Slytherin gang - probably even more so since the wizarding world was a bit sheltered.

Think about it. His name 'was down for Eton'. Eton is the most prestigious boarding school in England - if he had attended Eton as planned, he would have likely been a senior boy when Prince William entered the school. Eton has produced a large number of Prime Ministers, and generally just important people.

The double barreled surname indicates he comes from the upper crust of society. His family possibly had contacts in the government, law or industry.

There's so many things you could do with this character - he could help the new prime minister in navigating the Wizarding War if his family was associated with the government. He could struggle with the fact that he gave up his position in the upper crust, his place at Eton to become a third class citizen of the Wizarding World. Using his family's position in Muggle society, he could reach Muggleborns during the seventh year.

One story that explores this is here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/An-Interview-with-Justin-FinchFletchley]]

I honestly want someone to write a story about a bitter Justin moping about the new laws in Wizarding Britain and how much he gave up when his father - possibly an advisor to the new PM - tells him he accidentally walks in on the PM talking to Pius Thicknesse, the Minister of Magic and how he offered to help the PM tackle this.


** In the fic that I'm very slowly working on I am considering having Justin Finch-Fletchley being sorted in Slytherin. I could absolutely see a someone from a wealthy muggle family felling a lot of pressure to succeed as a wizard because their parents see the wizarding world as a risk they don't know what job prospects and such the world has but they do know their kid can get in a good muggle school.

**** Okay, so since you're interested I decided to edit a scene from Justin's POV and post it here. It's not much, but here it is:

“...For I'm a thinking cap!” the hat finished its song (a phrase Justin never imagined he'd even think) and the great hall erupted into applause. Of all the unusual things Justin had experienced during the (admittedly very short) amount of time he'd been in the magical world, a singing hat that sorts students into houses might just be the strangest. No, on second thought the bank run by an obnoxiously rude non-human race called goblins, that might weirder all things considered. Regardless, Justin would not be mentioning the singing hat to his father, something that silly would not convince him that a Hogwarts education was a good investment, and juvenile though it might be, Justin really wanted to learn magic.

“When I call your name,” Started the stern looking witch called Professor McGonagall “you will step forward and sit on the stool to be sorted. Abbott, Hannah!”

A girl with blonde pigtails stepped out of the line and sat down on the stool, Professor McGonagall placed the hat on Abbott's head and it (rather comically in his opinion) sunk down and concealed her eyes, clearly, it was originally made to fit someone much older than an eleven year old. There was a brief pause then the hat called out “HUFFLEPUFF!” The table on the right began clapping and Hannah Abbott handed the sorting hat back to Professor McGonagall then took a seat at the Hufflepuff table. Justin knew very little about any of the houses, everyone he'd heard mention Hufflepuff had not been very flattering, but the sorting hat's description of the house didn't sound so bad, all in all Justin wasn't sure how to feel.

“Black, Miranda!” for some reason that named caused some muttering in the hall in particular at what Justin thought to be the Slytherin table, as students turned to talk to their friends. Eyes throughout the hall seemed to follow a girl with jet black hair, high cheekbones, and striking violet eyes as she moved forward. Black either didn't notice or didn't care about the stir her name was causing however, as she sat down calmly. Her sorting took longer than Abbott's had but in the end the hat shouted “SLYTHERIN!” The Slytherin table clapped as Black walked toward them to take a seat. Strangely, an older girl with bubblegum pink hair sitting at the Hufflepuff table was cheering and clapping louder than anyone at the Slytherin table. Black gave the girl with pink hair a wave and a bright grin, but Professor McGonagall was fixing the Hufflepuff girl a deeply disproving look.

Susan Bones joined Hannah Abbott in Hufflepuff, Terry Boot became the first Ravenclaw, followed by Mandy Brocklehurst, while Lavender Brown became a Gryffindor, and Millicent Bulstrode joined Slytherin. Sooner than he would have liked, it was his turn. Trying not to shake, Justin walked forward and sat down, and then he felt the hat fall over his eyes.

A voice spoke in his head and Justin almost jumped in his skin Let's see we have here, my my, a complicated one, I see. Yes you would be a good fit for many houses. Hmm, but where to put you? Perhaps not Gryffindor, I don't mean to say you lack bravery, but I can tell it's not very important to you. Ravenclaw wouldn't be a bad match, you have good mind, but no, I don't see you as the type to learn for the sake of it.

That really just leaves Hufflepuff and Slytherin. You've been taught the value of hard work no doubt about it, but then there is your strong thirst to prove yourself, to make your parents proud, and that's not even to mention the ambition your family has instilled in you. Quite a conundrum. Slytherin would serve you best if you can successfully navigate it, but it would be an understatement to say it won't be easy for you...tell me Mr. Finch-Fletchley, are you the kind to take risks?

Justin thought it over, there was really only one option, if one house would be better for his future that was the only house he could really take, it's what his parents would want. Nothing ventured nothing gained.

Very well then, if you're sure then you'll do best in “SLYTHERIN!”

As soon as the hat shouted that one word the great hall when dead silent then just like what happened when Black's name was called the hall broke out in whispers and muttering. As he made his way to the Slytherin table, the staff table started started clapping and, as if breaking out of a haze, a few students at the Slytherin table joined in, though they stopped very quickly. Justin couldn't help but think he might have made a mistake. He waited for the rest of the first years to be sorted, he clapped for all the new Slytherins and tryed to ignore all the people glancing his direction curiously, or (and this was much harder to ignore) the hateful disgusted glares some of his housemates were directing at him.

Eventually, the last student, Blaise Zabini (Slytherin) was sorted and the headmaster stood up, the hall instantly quieted “Welcome,” He spread his arms wide “to another year at Hogwarts, as I am sure you're all quite anxious to get to the feast, I shall limit myself to a few words, and here they are: “Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweek!” “Thank you!”

There was appreciative laughter from the students (well, the other houses at least, it seemed most Slytherins were not fond of the headmaster) and as Dumbledore sat back down the house tables filled to the brim with considerable (and strange) varieties of food, and Justin felt his jaw drop. The students began talking among themselves. Justin however had a hard time focusing on his meal as he glanced at the staff table he saw a woman with heavily lidded eyes giving him a rather intense look.

“Who is that professor, why's she staring at me like that?” Justin asked Blaise Zabini who was nearest him.

It wasn't Zabini who answered however “That's my Aunt Bellatrix Black, she teaches the dueling elective.” Said Miranda Black from across the table “And she's staring at you for the same reason everyone else was earlier, you're bound to be the first Muggleborn to be sorted into Slytherin in...decades..centuries, a long time at any rate, and Aunt Bella's always been a bit...intense.”

A girl to Black's right (Greengrass, he thought it was) snorted “Yeah, intense, that's one way to put it.”

“Okay, but how does anyone even know I'm Muggleborn? Why should that even matter?”

“There aren't that many Mages in Briton, at least not compared to Muggles, and Mages tend to marry other Mages, so it's really easy to recognize a Muggle sir name.” Explained Greengrass then she smirked “Besides if you were from a family of Mages chances are you'd be at least distantly related to Miranda.”

In a much less dignified display than Justin was used to or had expected Black stuck her tongue out at Greengrass “As for why it matters, well it really doesn't but that point of view is pretty recent and the rise of the Dark Lord brought a lot of resentment of Muggles and Muggleborns back to the surface.”

Justin didn't really know much about the Dark Lord but he could tell that probably wasn't exactly dinner conversation, so he changed the topic “I'll understand if you don't want to talk about it but I noticed everyone was looking at you earlier too, Black.”

Greengrass smirked at Black again “Let's just say Miranda's family is rather infamous, they're one of the most well known and oldest families in the magical world.” She then changed the topic suddenly “So, Finch-Fletchley what class are you most interested.”

The three of them spent the rest of the meal taking among themselves Blaise Zabini listened quietly while a cheerful girl named Tracey Davis flitted between a number of other conversations and their own. Justin still wasn't sure if Slytherin would be the best house for him or not, but at least some of his house seemed alright.

****** Possibly, but if the Head of Slytherin House thinks a Muggleborn should have been in his house, the whole "practically impossible" is ruled out. Besides, Hogwarts is old school: Forbidden Forests, ghosts, monsters, moving stairs. They don't cuddle students. He'd more likely think Lilly could handle a few bullies than be ignorant of their existence. The kind of people who lead the Conservative Party went to Eaton, like Justin. And yet it was ruled for years by the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, a greengrocer's daughter, who would have made mincemeat of the Malfoy heir.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Is Justin the one who freaked out on Harry when he outed himself as a parselmouth in CoS? If so, I wonder if that is part of the reason why he is overlooked as an interesting character to explore more in fanfic? Like, did that make a subconscious bad impression on everyone.

** the Sarcasm and Slytherin series has a great characterization of justin that i loveeee! especially in 3rd year and onward you can see the influence of a life in the muggle upper-class, just like some of the purebloods in the fic. the scenes where he surprises everyone with a business mindset out of a hufflepuff are hilarious and multiple people ask him if he was sorted correctly. linkao3 (Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) and the follow up to year 5 linkao3 (Harry Potter and the Secrets of Vipers Part 2)

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
