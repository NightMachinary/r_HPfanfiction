** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] CC/OFC

#+begin_quote
  Colin Creevey leaves his camera with a muggle girl but never returns to collect it.
#+end_quote

/Albeit brief, it's sure to make an impression. It's able to be sweet without being overly saccharine. Pretty much a must read, in the way that most of the people on here have read it./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]

#+begin_quote
  "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.
#+end_quote

/After seeing this on the subreddit a couple times, I finally read Cauterize. While it's not the best piece of fanfiction I've read based on a recommendation, it's still able to be equal parts nostalgic and sad without being soppy or overly sentimental./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell That Wasn't]] HP/GW

#+begin_quote
  The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault.
#+end_quote

/Snape's ghost haunts the Potter's. Rather funny./

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] HP/DM

#+begin_quote
  It always rains for Draco Malfoy. Metaphorically. And literally. Ever since he had accidentally Conjured a cloud. A cloud that's ever so cross.
#+end_quote

/Even an ardent hater of slash might be suprised by this fic. The prose is interesting, and the execution of the plot solid. It's worth a shot if you're new to slash./

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/304864][The Grandfather Clock]]

#+begin_quote
  James Jr wants a summer job; his Mum suggests he help out Uncle Perce.
#+end_quote

/An interesting coming-of-age story, realistically showing the ups and downs of having a family./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9037795/1/The-Spring-Turnover][The Spring Turnover]] SS/HG

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, don't be such a killjoy. Come on, just tell me. If you could die in a way of your own choosing, how do you want to do it? I'd like to die by a lake. At sunrise. In the winter, I think. Yes, in the winter, with two feet of snow all around me, and my fading breath clouding the air."
#+end_quote

/I'll start off by saying that this could be considered a tearjerker--it's dark and sad--I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][Playmate]] was sad; The Spring Turnover is far worse. The prose is lovely, and it manages to capture the symbolism represented in this fanfic. Told through the eyes of an unreliable narrator, it's confusing, but all too realistic in the end./

** Harry Potter - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent][The Double Agent]] is my favourite one-shot of all time by a mile.

*** Love this one as well. If you like this one check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/The-Trial]] Great fic with the same premise sucks that it is updating slow and small bites.

** Here you go. These are mostly funny:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/][/Secure Containment of Prophecy: Case Number 368 (SCP-368)/ by AngrySlytherine]]: A post-Hogwarts / SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) crossover. A lost prophecy is recovered after the fact. Undersecretary Hermione Granger is not happy. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774443/1/][/Time on my Side/ by Mark Geoffrey Norrish]]: To prevent a pair of werewolf infections on the night of Pettigrew's escape, Harry and Hermione decide to turn their stable time loop into a time corkscrew.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/554931/][/Harmless and Easily Domesticated/ by Angie Astravic]]: Hagrid has been forbidden to teach any creature of higher classification than XX: harmless, may be domesticated. So nothing can possibly go wrong in his classes now - right? Augureys and Clabberts and Bowtruckles, oh my, not to mention Redneck Wizards.

Note: The above fic is pre-HBP, but it has aged very well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/][/In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life/ by SilverWolf7007]]: Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10748912/][/House, DADA/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]: Dr. Gregory House, Head of the St. Mungo's Department of Diagnostic Magic, was hired as a teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts: '92-'93 school year. After months of pain, terror, and attacks on students -- and also Slytherin's monster -- Dumbledore finally decides he needs to deal with the situation before Minnie finds that Castration Curse in the library.

*** A breath of fresh air is surprisingly underrated, no doubt because it focuses on a "boring" side character. I'll have to rec this one more often myself.
