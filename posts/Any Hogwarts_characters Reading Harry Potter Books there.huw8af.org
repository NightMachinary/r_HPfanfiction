#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** There used to be a series with Harry and friends reading the seven books, and then the Next gen reading Harry and co reading the books. And maybe also the marauders I think. But it was taken down due to obviously a lot of copying from the books.. it's sad, they were really good and complete
