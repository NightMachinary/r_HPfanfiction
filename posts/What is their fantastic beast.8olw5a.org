So I was thinking about this, and I realized the basilisk is like the magical beast version of Voldemort: spiders flee before it, its stare kills instantly and leaves no wounds, it lives for a very long time, sheds its skin to gain a new body, and is considered the *SECOND* most dangerous creature alive (I sometimes wonder if that is the entire reason Rowling created the Nundu...to make the parallel work).

Additionally, Dumbledore really is like a phoenix (besides the obvious I mean): the both prefer fire magic, they are widely regarded as "light" creatures (perhaps the only creatures with that designation too), they both have lived long lives, both are capable of accepting death...and coming back in one form or another. Hell, when Dumbledore died, he was reborn in the form of the portrait in the headmaster's office.

So if we take those as Rowling setting that up, what would magical beast represents Harry (or parallels him at least)? Or for that matter the other major characters (Ron and Hermione, the various weasleys, etc.)?

And yes, I know Snape probably would be a vampire. Either that or a satyr.

Harry literally says this about the Basilisk in /Chamber of Secrets/, that "Whatever it was, it sounded like a Voldemort to other monsters" (since the acromantulas would refuse to name it).

Anyway, the portrait of Dumbledore isn't really analogous to phoenix rebirths since portraits are really just clever imitations. A better one would probably be his arrival in Limbo to explain everything to Harry. And I wouldn't even say Dumbledore is "light" (that's not really a thing in HP), he was complicated and did some bad things for what he hoped were good ends. Phoenixes are supposed to be very reclusive, above the world in a sense.

That said, Harry's would probably be... a gnome. He's always getting thrown around by life and you'd think he'd be depressed about it and quit. But alas, he finds his way back into his metaphorical gnome hole: trouble.

*** Yes, that is how I came up with the thought about Voldemort. I just realized the parallels are even greater than what is pointed out in the books.

I know light isn't really a thing, I meant that a phoenix is really the only creature that could /possibly/ be described in such a manner, but its not actually a canon characterization, you are correct.

With Harry, I was kind of on the fence given the parallels with stag (it is his patronus after all): stands alone or appears to, portrayed as noble, strong and fast but not particularly dangerous. But I couldn't think of a magical quadruped that has sort of a deer/ram feature in the same way.

Perhaps something like a hippogriff would fit him. Its similar to a griffin (Gryffindor), loves flight, is dangerous but not even cracking the top ten in terms of ability, they can be easily offended, but jump to the defense of others who have earned their respect/loyalty/trust.

** *Harry:* a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Thestral][Thestral]]. A lot is made of Harry's acceptance of his death at the end of the series, so it seems fitting to assign him a beast that is only visible to those that have seen and understood death. Thestrals are also frequently misunderstood, and have a dark reputation despite being mostly harmless unless provoked.

*Hermione:* incredibly smart, curious (and with the propensity to keep picking at things that interest her even when it's probably a bad idea), loyal to her friends, and holds grudges against those who've wronged her. Given those traits I'd say she most resembles a crow or raven, but since we're never shown a magical subspecies of corvid I'll have to settle for a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kneazle][Kneazle]].

*Ron:* Loyal (horcrux-induced paranoia aside, Ron got over his jealousy issues in fourth year) and will eat absolutely anything put in front of him. I can't think of a better match than a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Crup][Crup]].

*** Crookshanks was half-Kneazle, and Ron's Patronus is a Jack Russel Terrier, which the Crup resembles.

**** Hell, our viewpoint character Harry /thinks/ Ron's Patronus is a terrier at first glance, but he might not necessarily notice the two tails; maybe it /is/ a crup.

** I don't think vampires are really what you'd call /creatures/. They /are/ sentient, after all. Though I suppose you could say the same about Basilisks.

You could, perhaps, make parallels between Hagrid and a Dragon --- a wild thing, but sort of awe-inspiring in its primal power, with a cute side, fiercely loyal to its "family circle" and oblivious to the fact that said family circle is composed of man-eating monsters, goes into a rage if said family is threatened.

With his connection to wood, his genial side, and his odd devotion to the wood he chose, I feel like Ollivander might make a good Bowtruckle.

If you take an uncharitable view of his character, and though I again veer into sentient creatures, Pettigrew might be an Erkling --- seems fun and sort of sad at first, and when you get too close it rips your throat out.

You say vampires, but if sentients can go, how about "Goblin" for Snape? Rough around the edges, despised by everyone, unclear allegiance, fiercely individualist. Have an odd respect for their chosen arts (crafting vs. brewing), at which even their worst enemies admit they are unmatched.

Vernon Dursley is, of course, a Dementor.
