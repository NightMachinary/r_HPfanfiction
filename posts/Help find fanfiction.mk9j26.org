:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I need help finding a fanfiction I read a long time ago but never finished! I believe it was a Hermione/Snape. Snape was on trial for holding Hermione captive years after the war and she thought she was in love with him and was like defending him in the trial. There are a lot of flashbacks to when she was held captive and back to during the trial. He didn't hurt her or anything, she just couldn't leave the house. He also lied to her about the outcome of the war to get her to stay with him.

Does anyone know what this fic is?
