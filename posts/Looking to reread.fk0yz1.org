:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the fic was a good Malfoys au w/ a manipulative Dumbledore. It starts off with Hagrid leaving Harry alone in Diagon alley but instead of going to madam Malkin store he goes to a more higher end clothes shop. The owner recognizes him and talks about his family with him when Draco and his dad come in. I believe it's complete and hints to Draco and Harry getting together as they grow up. There is also Slytherin Harry and Neville. Then Ravenclaw Hermione. The fic also has Victorian era etiquette rules among the pure blood.


** Sounds good. If you ever find it please let me know.
