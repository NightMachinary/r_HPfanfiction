In all those indy!harry fics, Harry almost always thinks “hey, why is Dumbledore telling me stay with muggles! He's just my headmaster!”.... but all the authors conveniently forget that he's: the Grand Sorcerer, Supreme Mugwump, and so on. At the time, you can't forget that he's also chief of the wizengamot. I mean, together with this, Dumbledore is literally the most powerful wizard in the world- magically and politically. Sorry Hadrian Peverell-Black-Potter, but I'm pretty sure the head of all international wizards does have some authority over you.


** Typically he's described as both incredibly manipulative and powerful, getting himself into those positions - and at the same time, dumb/useless enough to be outsmarted by a young Harry.

It's much tougher to realistically write Harry getting out from under the thumb of a competent manipulative Dumbledore - so it's easier to just handwave it away and have him as a smug, dumb guy.

**** Right - but he's not /really/ those in those fics.

That is, those titles are just put in there without thought/explanation 99% of the time. They're there to show that he's powerful and manipulative and controls everything - but then, the instant the story starts, it becomes apparent that he wouldn't actually ever have managed to get any of those positions because he's incredibly incompetent.

So in those fics, the titles are irrelevant because they're just window dressing - there for Harry to tear down, usually with whatever new ally he walks up to and somehow convinces (eg - Madam Bones, or a grey Greengrass family, or whatever).

** Its worth noting we aren't really ever told what authority he has as Grand Sorcerer, Supreme Mugwump, and Chief Warlock.

Is the Wizengamot a court, a parliament, or something else. As Chief Warlock does he have any actual legal power or is he like the Speaker of the House of Commons? What even is a Grand Sorcerer? Is the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation something significant? Is it like being an ambassador?

So basically, why would any of these positions give him power over a teenager? Yes, he could likely use them to influence an Auror who would have a more tangible form of authority over Harry. But I don't see it meaning he has any specific authority himself.

**** The reason I put court, parliament, or other is that JKR wrote something on Pottermore years ago about how it was both the highest court and the parliament. Which makes sense if its based on the British parliament, which included, at the time of writing, the highest court in the land as part of the House of Lords. So its not canon from the books either way, its that in the books the only clearly demonstrated function is as a court.

Dumbledore knew Tom would be in shadows and wouldn't reveal himself without a big bang like killing Harry. And the Ministry had the support of rich purebloods. So he waited till Tom revealed himself to the world. And he got his position back within a month.

** Because him having those positions doesn't mean a damn thing when it comes to the living situation of a child that he has literally no connection to in any way shape or form beyond running the school the kid goes to. This is like saying that the President should be able to wander into a random orphanage and not only toss the kids over to whoever he pleases but plan out their day to day lives just because he's the President. The only part of your argument that holds any merit is Dumbledore being one of the most powerful wizards ever and I think more than a few people are going to start objecting and asking questions if Dumbledore tries to flex on the government to let him have complete control over the life of a child he has zero connection to.

​

I see countless fics where Dumbledore had the Potters will suppressed and buried and just did whatever he wanted with Harry without consultation or oversight by anyone in any part of the government. Just once I'd love to see a more realistic fic where when he tries to suppress the will and keep him dumping Harry at the Dursley's secret, everyone from Gringotts to the Wizengamot just start laughing in his face and tell him in no uncertain terms that none of his titles give him the authority or right to do either one of those things and if he doesn't immediately retrieve Harry from where he illegally stashed him after having him kidnapped from his rightful legal guardian (Sirius) then he is going to at absolute best be looking at loosing all of his positions and possibly even time in Azkaban.

"I am in control of my life now Dumbledore!" Harry exclaimed. "You'll never control me again!"

Dumbledore stared at him with a stony expression before he beamed.

"Excellent Harry, excellent." Dumbledore laughed. "Finally you are starting to show some real initiative and backbone."

"W-What?" Harry asked confused. This was not going the way he had imagined it going.

Dumbledore shook his head with a chuckle.

"Harry, Harry. Ever since I've known you you have wanted to be normal, to fade into the background." Dumbledore told him gently. "I am afraid that that is impossible for you Harry. You are famous for something you don't remember true, but your fame really isn't necessarily about /you/. It's about Voldemort's reign of terror being ended. An end to the dark times that were plaguing our world. In the five years you have been in the Wizarding world you have faced Voldemort four times. You have know since you were eleven that a powerful Dark Lord was after you. You have been content to spend your time slacking off with Mr. Weasley and playing Quidditch. That's fair you deserve time to be a teenager but you have not dedicated to making yourself better."

Dumbledore sighed.

"So I had to have /clues/ leaked about a shadowy, manipulative figure trying to control your life. This invigoured you and made you wake up Harry." He continued. "You started fighting back. Started fighting for your independence."

"But you stole my money!" Harry shouted.

Dumbledore nodded.

"I did, I admit it. However, I took all the money I had funneled from your accounts and invested it for you in the Muggle world." Dumbledore told him. "In my humble opinion your investments have done quite well. You could live /quite/ comfortably just from the profits earned. All of it is registered in your name in the Muggle world."

"I did it all for you Harry." Dumbledore smiled. "To help you become ready to be the man the world needs you to be."

I've said this before on a few occasions: James was a pureblood, Lily was one of the smarter, responsible muggleborn. A will is pretty much common sense adulting. You get one when you're married, you get one when you have children. For purebloods, this cements the line of succession and cuts down on politics/thieving people from stepping in. For muggles, it's almost the same as above, and to see where the kid goes after you die.

You always meet new family at funerals. That's because unless there's a will, they could potentially be entitled to some of the money.

This is why Indy!Harry fics tend to have that "Now we see the wills" scene. Because it's realistic that they'd /have one/. The exact contents are up for debate, but they should have one.

Like, didn't Harry's great grandfather invent some hair product? If the family is still entitled to royalties or something that should be listed. Properties, where you want your kid to go, random bits and pieces you're bequeathing to family and friends, etc.

Wills are important, is what I'm saying.

Yeah, but a lot of those Indy!Harry fics go too far with the wills. Like enough galleons to rebrick Hogwarts with golden bricks is ridiculous. Putting in who their secret keeper was is dumb too. Putting that Sirius Black, Harry's /sworn/ Godfather should be the one who looks after Harry if they die. That puts the secret keeper thing in the dust with a more believable way.

Shares in a few companies, royalties from Skelegrow and Sleakeazy's, maybe a house (assuming they lived somewhere /before/ they went into hiding at Godric's Hollow), are all the standard things.

But what about some magical artifacts?

The Invisibility Cloak would almost certainly be listed (why didn't they have that on them again? Seems like hiding under the Cloak with a few silencing charms would have been a nice backup plan).

I remember one fic that had all the wands of the Potters of the past in a vault with some other stuff (with the vault Harry sees being one his parents set aside for him until he was seventeen).

The Potters are an old family, they might have some of those magical portraits.

A few spell books wouldn't be amiss. I could totally see Lily having her own version to the Half Blood Prince's Potion Book, but for Charms or whatever.

Maybe James kept a journal about his experience to become an animagi.

There's some stuff that you can justify them leaving for Harry besides fuck tons of money.
