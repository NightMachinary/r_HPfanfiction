** If you need something that will suck you in but isn't too heavy, I recommend this fic. It reads like a new adult romance novel. There's plot with the romance, there's smut with the romance, and James is fucking hot. My favorite part of romances are the build up and I usually lose interest after the get together, but I was invested enough to keep reading after.

** Ah Christmas, a time for getting drunk and reading fanfiction.

For the booze:

I recommend Colonel EH Taylor bourbon, if you can find it in your local liquor stores (spoilers, you can't). It has so much flavor. I've really never tasted anything else quite like it, and my liquor collection encompasses more than 100 bottles. Certainly unexpected in a bourbon, which are not known for their complexity. Thick and heady. Rating 1/1

If you can't get that cozy up with a nice hot toddy. My recipe is 2 oz of your preferred hard liquor (scotch, some other whiskey, rum, cognac, tequila, mezcal, whatever), .5 oz sweetener (simple syrup, agave syrup, maple syrup, honey, whatever), somewhere between 0 oz and 1 oz of added flavor (ancho Reyes chili liqueur, St Elizabeth's Allspice Dram, absinthe, really any liqueur that goes well with your liquor and sweetener of choice, which is most of them), and 4 oz of either hot water or your favorite tea. Put that in a mug with a couple of thin lemon slices (most toddy recipes call for lemon juice, but in such quantities that the lemon flavor overpowers everything, I find that a few thin slices provides that nice citrus flavor, but you can still taste the actual drink). Add a cinnamon stick to stir if you have one. Rating 1/1, unless you use actual lemon juice, then probably a 0/1.

For the fanfiction:

Last week I decided to reread Taure's masterpiece Victoria Potter. I had let six or seven new chapters build up since the last time I read it, and had forgotten enough that the reread was still a wonderful experience. What a great story. Is there anything sadder than being all caught up on this? Rating 1/1

linkffn(12713828)

Steelbadger posted a new chapter for the best crossover fic of all time, Shadow of Angmar which was marvelous. Of course, if Harry and Daewen don't kiss soon I'm going to lose my fucking mind!! But seriously, this is a great fic, probably everyone has read it already, but if you haven't it's well worth it. Rating 1/1

linkffn(11115934)

Also the same author posted a Harry/Fleur Christmas one shot that was a really good read. Even though I really enjoyed it I won't request more because I am perpetually dying for more Shadow of Angmar. Rating 1/1

linkffn(13757635)

TheEndless7 (a writer with many great stories to their name already) posted a new Christmas story called Chasing Snowflakes. It's a Harry/Katie Bell that's skipping between christmases, first chapter is third year, then fourth, then fifth, presumably it'll continue like that but only the first three chapters are posted now. Despite mostly following canon in between chapters, it feels very fresh and unique to me, and even a grinch like me can enjoy a sweet Christmas romance. 1/1

linkffn(13777689)

I also read a bunch of garbage. I don't even remember what most of it was, and really if something doesn't deserve a 1 I don't know why I would link it here.

This freaking comment made me grin so much my mouth hurts, and I will immediately go out and try to grab the stuff to replicate your recipe in the hours before the shops close. Hopefully after that I'll come home and rectify the MASSIVE mistake I've made of not having read Shadow of Angmar. My bad.

**** I almost said the same thing, about needing more Katie Bell, but then I felt silly, since it isn't like she was really a character in the books. I should have trusted my gut. Of course the fandom whose third favorite ship includes a girl whose name was mentioned one time in canon would have plenty of other people yearning for a Katie Bell romance.

** Sometimes I'm in an 'eff love' mood but most of the time I lean towards something where there's at least a little bit of romance.

Found an incomplete Draco/Ginny marriage of convenience one that has an interesting view of why Draco bites during sex and why he won't kiss on the mouth. There's sex but it's not porny IMO. Draco is fairly in character here, at least in his meaner moments. "I knew it would be too grand for you, perhaps I should dig you a hovel." Think this could have been really good if it was finished, I liked it a lot. linkffn(9117322) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117322/1/But-I-Want-You]["But I want you."]]

A romantic fluff piece is linkffn(7585918) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7585918/1/Strange-Bedfellows]['Strange Bedfellows.]]' It's rom/com but you can tell there's some thought into it. Oliver Wood is good here too, though not in character. It's a fun read. Hermione/George pairing.

I also read/skimmed a few stories where Sirius becomes Harry's guardian, the most recent being where they take the Dursleys to trial for child abuse. Wish it was longer.

** Title: Chamber Girl

Rating: T

Words: 238,713

Status: Complete

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13561400/1/Chamber-Girl][Chamber Girl]] linkffn(13561400)

I started reading this two months ago after seeing it recommended on this subreddit. Currently I'm reading Chapter 24. It's not so engaging that I would've read even one chapter per day, and I actually took a break from reading it for a month at one point when I had other things to do, but now I continue. Still, overall it is a good story, probably among the top ten percent of stories I have read or tried to.

The main idea is that at the end of CoS Harry and Ron do not find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, and Ginny is left down there and presumed dead. However, Diary Tom gets accidentally destroyed by the Basilisk in a deus ex machina sort of way. (That happens right at the beginning, so it's not that bad.) Ginny then wakes up and survives in the Chamber for two and a half years before finally finding her way out. The Second Wizarding War has begun, and Ginny's return derails the canon plot. Oh yes, and there's a romance between Ginny and Harry.

Thus far the plot seems interesting. The writer is good with the prose, and the characters are much more relatable than is common in fanfiction, making the story immersive.

However, there are a few things that take me out of the story.

First, Ginny's survival in the Chamber for so long is extremely implausible. The place was infested with rats, but she would have needed to eat thousands of them. There actually was a good point about the waste food of Hogwarts ending down there, but it was stale. All the writer would have needed to change to make it plausible was to make the waste food not stale.

Second, the romance. This problem is, of course, with me rather than the story, but every single romance in fanfiction becomes dull after the couple is together at the latest. This story is no exception. More and more I appreciate Rowling's decision to make Harry and Ginny's romance happen mostly off-scenes. There's nothing interesting about teenagers being on a honeymoon. Why do fanfiction writers forget that also romance is a story element that requires drama and tension to be exciting?

Third, the writer has a big problem with plurals and possessive cases. For example, almost every time the plural of the word Auror is spelled Auror's. At first I thought it was a systematical error. It would have been easy to understand, because sometimes people just don't know the grammar rules. However, it's not systematical, but random. It gets annoying when I can't stop myself from wondering what was happening inside the head of the writer when he sometimes wrote Aurors, sometimes Auror's for both plural and possessive cases.

** Been reading and finished Steelbadgers new DC crossover (2nd fic in the arc) and it is just as good as the previous one if not better. It really does deserve way more praise and recognition than it is getting. I've been reading fanfiction for 12 years now and it is honestly up there with the best of them. The worldbuilding is on point and it feels so natural. Steelbadger has done amazing background work which really shows in how true all characters involved act together. I implore everybody to read them. The enjoyment will not be impacted by your own DC knowledge.

** Started reading linkffn(To Know You Is To Love You); it has a moderately interesting premise, of Ron and Hermione getting pre-marriage "counselling" by using a Pensieve to experience each other's formative memories. I got a bit bored with it by the end of second year, though; it felt like a canon rehash. YMMV.

I've also been rereading bits of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series ever since it updated on the 18th, and adding to its TVTropes pages. It's a really well crafted series, neatly incorporating some canon elements but overall telling its own story, about a Harry who's never seen the effects of war but has to deal with legalised segregation and blood discrimination - and a Tom Riddle who isn't out for genocide but just might cause it anyway with his willingness to use the students of Hogwarts as political pawns.

The Unforgiving Minute

The end of 6th year gives rise to a more ruthless Harry when he kills Snape following Dumbledore's death. As a result, things spiral and Voldemort takes over. By the time he is 27 years old, almost everyone he knows has died and Harry risks everything to travel back in time 12 years to redo everything. The catch? He only has 12 hours.

Returning on the day of the final task of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry has 12 hours to destroy all the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort.

Kind of like a speed run, but with tons of complications at every step. A lot of flashbacks during the time leading up to going back in time.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was raised to be a “Christian”, but the Dursleys don't practice what they preach. When his Hogwarts letter comes, he is thrust into a wizarding world where angels, demons, and pagan gods fight in the shadows for influence over the world. A lighthearted, irreverent romp through a world where all myths are true, Hermione Granger met her first demon at six years old, and Ronald Weasley really wishes his brothers would stop showing off. Updates every weekend. Comments welcome. Romance happens eventually, but at a slow real-world pace.

** I just got finished with linkffn(Stay Standing by Windschild8178)

It's a Ron-centric AU story, no bashing, but there's lots of family drama among the Weasleys and the Golden trio. I really enjoyed this, despite there being a few words that the author seemed to mistake for the word they actually wanted (eg. They consistently use "appendix" when they mean "appendage", and I believe at some point they use "phenomena" when they actually meant "pneumonia".)

Even with that being said, it was a great story and quite different from anything I have read to date, which is an accomplishment! And it's complete! Plenty of twists and turns, some decent action, a couple of interesting new OCs. All pairings are from canon and exist in the background rather than as a plot point; they get mentioned, but they aren't a focal point. It was refreshing!

** Just started linkao3(One Hundred and Sixty Nine)

Rated T, Completed. I don't know what I think of it so far but I've barely started it. Premise is that Hermione goes back in time and has 169 days to change things (like Voldemort killing Lily and James). I like that it's a fan fic where she changes things, that's why I generally hate time travel fics. There's no Weasley bashing in the beginning, it shows everyone (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Molly and George) falling apart and away from each other, but realistically and maturely. Ron is portrayed as the glue holding everyone together, not some bashful dope, which I like.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

** I've just finished linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) It's about the oldest fic I've ever read. The first half is focused on Remus and is based on those hard boiled crime fiction Sam Spade fics. Remus rescues Harry and through some shenanigans successfully hides him from Dumbledore ( lots of Dumbledore bashing here). As Remus ages, the fic follows Harry more. I really liked although quite a lot of the author's depiction of women is chauvenist and annoying - I know that's also a feature of hard boiled crime fiction, but when it is applied to the prepubescent girls at Hogwarts, it's icky. There's also a harem thing going on with Harry which I disliked. Despite these downsides, the fic is really entertaining and it's great to see Harry being raised by competent grown ups.

** I'm a big fan of the Snape & Harry mentor fics (non-slash). There's a new one I started reading that I think has some interesting potential. I enjoy the Snape-Harry dynamic and am looking forward to seeing where it goes with Harry as Snape's apprentice.

Title: The Gifted Apprentice linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13775701/1/The-Gifted-Apprentice]])

Rating: T

Chapters: 7 (In-progress, frequently updated)

Words: ~23,000

Description: In the summer after Year 1, Harry is warned by Dobby not to return and instead of going back to Hogwarts, he runs away. He's on the run for 10 months before he's rescued by Snape. His enrollment at Hogwarts has been revoked by the Board of Governor's for failing to return, so the only way he can stay is to become Snape's apprentice. Shenanigans ensue.

I think the Snape in this fic is well-written. I don't like it when mentor/guardian Snape gets too gooey. Snape here is still pretty hardcore, but not a tyrant. This story is new but it is being updated quickly so I've been devouring it all week and waiting for more. Definitely recommend!
