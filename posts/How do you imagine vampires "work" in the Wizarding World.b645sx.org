By which I mean what aspects of the various vampire myths seen throughout the ages and across the globe do you think are/can be applied to vampires within canon?


** I was listening to POA last night and there was a moment in the sweet shop When Hermione said that the blood lollies were "for vampires, I expect". This would imply some level of integration with normal wizarding society, to the point that they're not really considered dangerous/scary like werewolves.

But then in HBP we do see a vampire, albeit briefly, and there's a sense that people are nervpus/uncomfotable and the guy that brought the vampire to the party has to control him a little. But he was still at the party and openly a vampire, so it's hard to say.

Perhaps it's unusual for a vampire to drink so much blood the person actually dies? Or perhaps they can, unfortunately like twilight, survive on the blood of animals?

That idea is older than the Twilight books, I remember it being mentioned in Buffy.

***** It turns up in at least a couple of the 19th century penny-dreadful vampire stories that culminated in Dracula. And I can't put my hand on my copy to confirm, but I seem to recall that the ship the eponymous Count arrives in England on had everyone aboard dead, down to and including the ship's rats, owing to his having fed on them.

(I'm no fan, but I think Twilight gets a lot of flak it doesn't deserve. Being completely bloody awful nonsense has been about half of the vampire story tradition for nearly two centuries now. If it wasn't complete crap /it wouldn't be a vampire story./)

***** Which version do you want? From the real world alone, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_folklore_by_region][folklore exists practically everywhere]]. Then you have major pieces of fiction dedicated to vampires, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Vampire: The Masquerade and everything in-between; and all of them depict them differently, in one way or another.

*** People can act nervous around people even if they are accepted into society. My own grandfather was raving about how a black man should be strung upon a wall and shot. They also sell clothes targeted towards black people in my area. Just because someone has legal protection and are being sold products doesn't mean they are accepted.

My own view/headcanon of vampires in HP is that they have legal protections, and they are seen in the same light as werewolves although they are less feared due to less attacks. The newer generation is uneasy, but they don't write home to their families complaining.

** A key point from the way they're discussed (in the same bag as Hags, Goblins and Veelas), HP vampires appear to be a separate humanoid species from Muggles and wizards, as opposed to people under a curse. This only makes sense, as the core of vampirism-as-a-curse is that it's a pathway to immortality; and wouldn't it be odd, therefore, if such an easily-accessed (and, as [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] notes, relatively well-integrated) path to immortality existed, that Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone would be seen as such a big deal?

As for the rest of it --- vampires' nature and culture --- one assumes they have an arrangement with wizards to use magic to produce large quantities of human blood for them to eat. Besides that, I would imagine that they can't turn into bats or wolves /per se/, but, like Goblins, are capable of wizarding magic, meaning any number of historical vampires may have been Animagi, thus explaining the Muggle misconception. They are, however, naturally covered by the Wand Ban.

I think it depends on the drawbacks. If vampires immediately burst into flames and died if they touched sunlight, had a violent garlic allergy, couldn't eat mortal food at all (turns to ash in your mouth), couldn't step on holy ground or enter people's dwellings without an invitation - /plus/ having to consume human blood, which for most humans that really consider it would probably seem more than a bit horrifying...would vampirism still be worth it as a way to become immortal?

I think a lot of wizards would say no, absolutely not - especially considering that souls are a known thing that definitely exist in the wizarding world, and an easy argument could be made for death not being the end. If you sought immortality, vampirism would be an unattractive option compared to the Philosopher's Stone (drawback-free, as far as I know) and Horcruxes (which have the added advantage of allowing you to survive total disembodiment) and probably most other options, if they exist.

*** Vampires can be immortal, but they can still be killed. If you have a horcrux, you can come back, but that is a good point. I don't think a normal person can be "turned" into a vampire, otherwise I'm sure Voldemort would of done that too.

This is interesting because I'm writing a story with a vampire in it right now and I've decided that vampirism is a transformational magic and one has to accept the change willingly. If you fight it, you die (no reward without risk). Once they go through the transformation, they are unable to cast any wizard spells as the cost for gaining immortality, self-transformation (bat, mist, wolf) hypnotic gaze and all of the other traditional vampiric powers and drawbacks. Because yeah, an immortal being able to cast spells? That's too powerful even for HP magic.

**** I suppose that works, but that doesn't change the fact that vampires are only ever referred to as a people of their own, akin to Hags, Veelas and Goblins, suggesting they are an independent species. The "immortal" comment was only a cherry on top.
