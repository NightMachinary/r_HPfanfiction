Hello,

I've come across so many authors recommending her stories, particularly What the Bleep. I even tried to look it up on the Internet Archive, but no luck there either. Is there someone with offline copies of the story willing to share ? I would love to read them.

PM me if you dont want to comment,

Cheers


** The best I can offer you in the complete ffn alphabetical file download. It would take you quite a While to find, but it might be there. Depends when the story was deleted and precisely when the download was compiled.

Ask and I'll link the 2016 repack for easier use. The mods don't like it shown off without cause.

*** I'd appreciate a link to the repack. Do you have any older repacks from before they wiped a lot of stories from ffn ? I think it was 2012 or 2013.

**** It's a repack of the original copy. Some wonderful person with a lot of time went through the original and created an alphabetical repacked version of it in 2016. The original was older, though by how much, I don't know. It holds almost ever id from 1-10,000,000, and though it's not easy to use by any stretch, it exists.
