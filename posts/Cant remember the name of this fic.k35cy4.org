:END:
Hey guys, I was thinking about a haphne story I read a while back where Harry shows Daphne the carcass of the basilisk and she tells him how it's worth so much.

I know this has prolly happened a lot but the next part is what is so clear in my head: Harry and Daphne are talking over how much each persons share should be and Harry accepts the first off Daphne gives. Here she ends up telling him that that's not right and he should negotiate.

Idk why I wanna re-read it but it's just smth I can't get out of my head. Any help would be appreciated.

** Probably want to re-read it because it is considered one of the best fics to be written in the last couple years ;)
