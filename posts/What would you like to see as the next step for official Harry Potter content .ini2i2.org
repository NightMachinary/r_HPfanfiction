Remakes of the movies ? New books ? An animated series ? A big triple A video game ? A musical ?

Because let's face it,Warner Bros will never let this thing rest


** I'd like to see that game that got leaked a little while back, and I'd like to see an animated version of books 1-7, faithfully retold.

Edit: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0elKGOUzYs&feature=share][the game footage I'm talking about]]

** A Marauders' era tv series that's aimed more at teens and adults than at children. They're teenagers in the 70s while Voldemort is on the rise and Death Eaters are everywhere. What were things like at Hogwarts? How did James and Lily end up together? How did Snape and Regulus come to join the Death Eaters? What did Sirius' rebellion and break with his family look like? Who were Lily's friends? What was Remus' life like, trying to hide his condition from his classmates? How did three students manage the Animagus transformation? How'd they end up mapping the whole school?

The fact that there's been 20 years of fanfic about all this suggests that it's reasonably fertile ground for storytelling.

I wouldn't mind accurate movies of pre canon Tom Riddle/Voldemort and an animated series of canon.

** New books that first and foremost officially ignores The Cursed Child, epilogue from the seventh book everything from Pottermore and J.K. Rowling's twitter account. Those needs to be removed from canon.

These new books will be mainly about Harry Potter's auror years. The HP books are mysteries at their cores and a magical cop/detective as a main character makes a lot of sense for the continuation of the series. I definitely don't want to read about the next generation.

On the side, I want proper prequel stories. Not like the Fantastic Beasts movies. But the one that details Dumbledore's childhood up to death of his sister. About the life of Regulus Black. Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle Sr. These need not be overlong. They can be short novels or even novellas. But these need to be SIDE PROJECTS. This is important.

That's pretty much it.

** Personally I would love to see a well realised story driven MMORPG game set in HP world. Something like World of Warcraft. You could choose your faction, race, what kind of wizard you are etc. And it would be an expansion to world of HP, not just remake/sequel/prequel. With new original content & story lines. Maybe some HP characters appearing in cameos and side quest givers - not as main antagonist/protagonists.

** Movie remakes are probably inevitable at this point. It's been almost 20 years since the first, but fantastic beasts is still ongoing.

What I really want is an actual HP RPG without the gimmicky bullshit. I want a game where you can make different choices, and those choices matter beyond just different endings. If we can travel to the past, seeing the game made by the Bioware of old would've been cool.

*** Spell crafting would be very hard to code, nevermind pvp balance. A massive (+1000) spell list to choose from would probably have the same result with fewer bugs and it would be easier to balance since you can adjust spells directly and don't have to fiddle with components which also affect every other spell using it.

** I would greatly enjoy it if they opened up the wizarding world universe to other writers to write professional novels just like (Dragonlance Fantasy, Star Wars ect) have a big team that decides the cannon, what stories people want to see and before they start they need to adjust the cannon.

Get rid of cursed child & epilogue & a lot of the thrown together at the last minute teen not a romance but lets pair all the characters with wrong people choices. There was no romance between ron/hermione or harry/ginny or luna/nevile. The deathly hallows was a okay ending considering the shit show the deathly hollows introducted and the ongoing boring fight with voldermort that had a boring expected ending.

There needs to be a bigger everything than just oh bad guy coming back to life 5 times and boring death eaters evil ministries and bad dumbledore. There is a whole wizarding world and your telling me harry who has been hunted all his life and has all this power and imigination just says ok well now that thats done, lets go work for the ministry thats ruined my life and lets be a cop and be forced to fight all my life like a dog in a fight ring. No 17 year old is going to want to do that, he didnt even finish school, he could have done so many things with his life.

** I've always been intrigued by the idea of a game where you play as someone, either Harry, or someone else with their own story (with several options), where you can choose to follow the canon adventures or take the story in a different direction by making different decisions than the canon person did. But it seems like too much work to be feasible.

** I'd like to see an animated version of the Harry Potter ebooks but the animations need to be based off the books not the actors.

I'd like to see a story that explains Dumbledore childhood and everything leading up to Grindelwald's rise including his relationship (I mean relationship like friends and lovers) with Grindelwald.

I'd like a marauders era series too.

Maybe a series depicting life at Hogwarts during the year of the Carrow (sp?).

Idk I just feel like there's so much that could still be explored in the fandom

** Kinda off the wall but a cliche "anime battle school" type setting if you want to go for a funny approach.

If not something set at Hogwarts after the fall of Grindelwald, so you have Dumbledore suddenly in the spotlight.

If memory serves Tom Riddle is now out of school so there aren't many canon important characters left to have to worry about so you could make up your own lore as you go.

** This will be an unpopular opinion. But YOLO. Remake.

​

1. Shift to a new universe. HP did not age well, and mostly got this far because of being "New" and hype.
2. Storyboard the whole universe. No conflicting continuity this way.
3. Five "arcs":

   1. Founding of Hogwarts: Backstory of the founders and maybe the building and running of Hogwarts year 1. One Book
   2. Dumbledore/Newt: Grindelwald's war. 3 Books. Ends right as he says he has to go to Wool's Orphanage.
   3. Marauders Era: 2 Books (years 1-4) and (year 5 until going into hiding)
   4. Harry Potter: 7 books
   5. Post War: Epilogue + Next Gen + Whatever.

It doesn't even have to be the same story. Just same faces, same places, different stuff.

***** I was thinking this too, but I didnt wanna be the one to open that thread. Pretty much everything she did with this franchise after the 7 books has been a cause of controversy and division within the fandom.

She had this stroke of genius with the HP storyline, but she quite clearly lacks either the skill or the interest in worldbuilding and expanding this universe (in meaningful ways, not 'wizards shit their pants').

I /would/ love to see more Potterverse content, but someone else should be at the helm of creative decisions.
