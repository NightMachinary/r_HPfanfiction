#+TITLE: Is there any fic where the division between dark and light spells is real and clear? And the author creates new spells that embodies the light side, while the dark side is actually something corrupting and evil ?

AFAIK, the most "light" spell in canon is the Patronus, which even cruel or DE could use (Umbridge and Snape) so it isn't an exclusive spell to the "light side". AK and Imperius doesn't seem that evil to me, considering its possible to use those spells for good, even if the hatred/domineering aspect of both spells could be considered a bit evil. For me, the only evil Unforgivable would the be Cruciatus, because the only thing I could come up with that it has a good use for it would be to help "activate inert nerves" from either re-implanted or gangrened limbs, but even then, that's a big strech.

I'm not looking for fics where they classify esoteric magics (as is classified like that in HP and the PoS) as anything where it needs emotion to use, like Fiendfyre or a simple Riddikulus. I want a fic where there is a whole section of the "light arts" as a counter to the "dark arts".


** OP if you're interested there's a series where there is such a thing as truly dark magic. It's called the Dresden Files.

*** Thanks, but no, I've read a bunch where the Dark Arts are evil and stuff, but never the opposite, where the Light Arts actually exist. Thanks tho.

** While looked at from afar those curses might look like they have some positive application, they cannot be cast that way in context. The mental state required to cast them successfully prevents the user from using them that way in any situation where that may apply.

Or in other words, while the use of the killing curse on non-humans is perfectly legal only a complete idiot would think it a good idea to have a proficient caster of that spell routinely use it to kill animals/goblins/centaurs/whatever.

As for the cruciatus - for one, there is no indication that it even affects the actual pain receptors. It might just as well directly affect the brain. For two, it is unfocussed, it fills you with utter and complete agony, /everywhere/. If you intend to stimulate nerves for medical purposes you generally want to /only/ stimulate the nerves you are targeting, to the level you intend. You don't want to put your patient into reflex anoxic seizures. The cruciatus only has two states, either it is off or it is on and how bad it is in its on state solely depends on how much a freak the caster is.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
