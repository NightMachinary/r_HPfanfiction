Looking for stories that have Riddle never jumping off the deep end, finding redeemption through love or Grindewald not falling to Dumbledore thus inspiring him to fight the good fight, maybe something like him taking pity on Myrtle and ending up with her, or maybe him ending up with Bellatrix down the line (bonus point if he has daughter that dates, cause scary father Riddle sounds hilarious). Would still want him to have his ruthless side, but not being murderous because he understands love.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord)

It has a Tom Riddle who ends up being raised by time-travelling Harry. As for Grindelwald, the war in Europe ends up being one of the major plot arcs of the story.

** linkffn(The Right Hand Path by Sophiax) is almost certainly abandoned, but what's written is good. The premise is that Merope survives to raise Tom. My sense is that Tom is still very much a psychopath in the clinical sense but a prosocial one.

** C&P from a previous rec of mine...

#+begin_quote
  /Living and Wildfires/ and it's sequel /Living on Land-Mines./

  I have always loved this AU, where small decisions by Dumbledore completely alter the HP universe, Tom Riddle included. WIP warning, but I have secret hopes that the author will finish this one day. :'(

  In a house in Godric's Hollow, three boys toss their magic around and a little girl dies... unless.

  #+begin_example
      \[Originally posted to my livejournal\.\]
  #+end_example

  So, there was a prompt at the Could Have Beens AU Comment Ficathon (which is great fun, you guys should check it out) that read as follows: "Dumbledore/Grindelwald; Ariana doesn't die, Dumbledore sticks with Grindelwald." And what I intended to do was...look at it and then look away, honestly. What I'm actually doing is more or less a re-envisioning of the entire HP canon, set in the Marauder era, that works around this concept and what such a change might have wrought. This is the first part, and if things go according to plan, there will be two more. Like Harry Potter, this is a war story; unlike Harry Potter, it is very up-front about that fact. I'm going to call this one a choose-not-to-warn experience, because there are things I am dealing with within for the sole reason that the books set them up and didn't deal with them; please proceed with due caution.

** linkffn(Boy Who Lived by Megii of Mysteri OusStranger) and linkao3(Doubting Thomas by AzarDarkstar) has Tom raised by Merope and/or a time traveller. Right Hand Path recced above is especially good.

linkao3(Unsealed by esama) mentions Myrtle/Tom as an aside.
