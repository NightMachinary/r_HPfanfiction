There is a nice series of one shots an author name Ebenbild has made. They /could/ be seen as cannon, but it is really your choice on how to percieve it. It gives us a glimpse on /why/ some of the characters were the way they were. /Why/ they made the choices they did. In all of these, they are seers, but nobody else knows (For a good reason). They had to make painful choices, and cared about their freinds and family so much that some of them would even play the bad guy. Here are the links.

It seems the Author Ebenbild is very good at making one shots that are meaningful and stay with you for a long time. Try checking the author's profil out! Midday Star gazing and A Star's Name were good one shots by her as well.

​

Next up is Basilisk Born. It features time travel, but actual proper physical time travel to thousands of years ago. It focuses on two characters. The Harry that is sent back in time, and the mysterious figure who sent Harry back in time and then took his place so there was no suspicion. It expands on the HP world a lot, and it has many good plot twists.\\
Harry does become quite powerful (Not too ridiculously powerful though), but it is understandable, as he trains under someone for /years/ and /years/. He is NOT a mary sue. This is the most unique time travel fic i have ever seen.

​

Lastly, why to sort a student is a horrible job. It is a re-incarnation fic, and chaos ensues. I like that it is quite light hearted but has a few scattered in and appropriate dark moment. I also like it's depiction of may of the characters.
