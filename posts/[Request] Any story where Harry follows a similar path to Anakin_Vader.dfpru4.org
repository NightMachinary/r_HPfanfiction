Or has a similar story?

Would be fun to read Dark Lord Harry fight James Sirius,

Or to read Harry's slow descent into darkness or whatever and joins Voldemort but it is not portrayed to be a good thing

***** Minister Riddle: Be careful of the Order, Harry. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Order member. Learn to use the Dark Arts and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

Harry: What did you say? How do you know that...?

Minister Riddle: Use my knowledge, I beg you.

Harry: [pointing his wand at Minister] You're Lord Voldemort!

--------------

Moody: In the name of the Wizengamot, you're under arrest, Minister.

Voldemort: Are you threatening me, Master Auror?

Moody: The Wizengamot will decide your fate.

Voldemort: I AM the Wizengamot!

Moody: Not yet.

[the Minister/Voldemort rises slowly, and his wand snaps to his hand from his sleeve] Voldemort: It's treason, then...

--------------

Harry: [after killing Alastor Moody] What have I done?

Voldemort: You are fulfilling your destiny, Harry. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark arts. There's no turning back now.

Harry: I will do whatever you ask. Just help me save Ginny's life. I can't live without her. If she dies, I don't know what I will do.

Voldemort: To cheat death is a power only I have achieved through decades of the study of the dark arts. And I'm willing to teach you this secret.

Harry: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Dark.

Voldemort: Good. Good! The Magic is strong in you, Harry Potter. A powerful Dark Wizard you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as... Hadrian Peverell.

Harry: Thank you... my Master.

Voldemort: Lord Peverell... rise.

--------------

Voldemort: [To Death Eaters] I'm sending my new apprentice, Lord Hadrian Peverell, to take care of you.

--------------

Voldemort/Emperor: [to the Wizengamot] In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Ministry will be reorganized into the first Wizarding Imperium, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

[Wizengamot fills with enormous applause]

Ginny: [to Hermione Granger] So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause.

--------------

Dumbledore: Into exile, I must go. /Failed/, I have.

--------------

Voldemort: Lord Peverell... can you hear me?

Hadrian: Yes, Master.

Hadrian: [looks at Voldemort] Where is Ginny? Is she safe? Is she all right?

Voldemort: It seems in your anger, you killed her.

Hadrian: I...? I couldn't have! She was alive... I felt it!

[Hadrian growls, and his accidental dark magic crushes everything around him in the room. He frees himself from the metal stretcher, and steps off. Voldemort has a smirk on his face]

Hadrian: Nooooooooooooooooooo!

Wouldn't Centaurs, Giants, Goblins, or Werewolves fit better?

Also. Harry Potter is the son of Wizarding aristocrat James Potter and his beautiful and competent wife Lily. I would have none of that immaculate conception bullshit.

James died early in a fight against terrorists called Death Eaters, and Harry was raised by Lily alone.

Lily was betrayed, captured, and tortured by a rogue Goblin group. The Order dragged their feet and delayed valuable time in rescuing her. She died in Harry's arms, who proceeded to wipe out the entire Goblin camp with Fiendfyre.

Damn, that would make the story even more tragic.

******* Ginny: Harry, I was so worried about you! Ron... told me terrible things!

Ginny: He said... you turned to the Dark Side. That you... killed First Years!

Harry: Ron is trying to turn you against me.

Ginny: He cares about us.

Harry: Us?

Ginny: He knows. He wants to help you. Harry, all I want is your love.

Harry: Love won't save you, Ginny. Only my new powers can do that!

Ginny: But at what cost? You're a good person, don't do this!

Harry: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother. I am becoming more powerful than any Order member has ever dreamed of, and I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

Ginny: Come away with me. Help me raise our child far away. Leave everything else behind while we still can!

Harry: No. Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore! We no longer have to hide our love for each other. I am more powerful than the Minister, I... I can overthrow him! And together, you and I can rule the Wizarding world! We can make things the way we want them to be!

Ginny: I don't believe what I'm hearing! Ron was right... you've changed! You have turned to the dark side! You're not Harry anymore!

Harry: [with a growing angry look and voice] I don't want to hear any more about Ron. The Order turned against me. Don't you turn against me!

Ginny: [tears in her eyes] Harry, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow!

Harry: Because of Ron?

Ginny: Because of what you've done... what you plan to do! Stop! Stop now... come back... I love you!

[Harry looks beside Ginny and sees Ron standing at the entrance overhearing them]

Harry: [enraged and paranoid] Liar! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me!

--------------

Just to be honest, canon Ginny is not Padme. She's more likely to enthusiastically follow Harry wherever he goes.

On the other hand, this is obviously a major AU, so she can be somewhat different here.

** Honestly i would love a proper Vader analog story for Harry, his parents are killed by Voldemorts followers (maybe snape) Harry slowly falls to darkness as the minister of Magic Tom Riddle makes himself out to be Harry's friend but slowly corrupting him. The order of the Phoenix is trying to hunt down death eaters and Harry ends up turning on them and killing them all to save someone only to end up killing the person he loves and for Ron to have to come and stop him.

Fuck it I might write it

** I have the plans for a fic lying around somewhere. Harry was recruited young by Voldemort and became his right hand before they took over the world. Dumbledore (and what remained of the Order) summoned the Justice League to work as a resistance force against their Empire. They get into deep shit for kidnapping little Princess Delphi.

If anyone wants that feel free, probably not going to write it anyway.
