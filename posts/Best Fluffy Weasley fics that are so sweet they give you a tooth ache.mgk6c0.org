I've been reading one too many fics with Weasley bashing lately so I need to cleanse my mind. Thanks in advance!


** I misread this request at first and now want to see Mrs Weasley adopt Fluffy as a member of the Weasley family. Imagine Book 2, with the boys bringing a Cerberus in the flying car to rescue Harry!

** It's not Weasley-centric, but they're an awesome family in Harry's New Home by kbinnz (mentor Snape). linkffn(4437151)

The Extra Weasley by Triscribe (unfinished): Dumbledore puts a young, bruised Harry with the Weasleys "only for a few days," but they refuse to give him up. linkao3(18890965)

  In which Albus Dumbledore keeps a bit closer eye on young Harry, and finds the Dursley family to be Most Unsatisfactory. That does, however, leave the problem of where to stash the lad - only temporarily, of course, until he can find someplace more suitable.The inhabitants of the Burrow have other ideas about that...

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
