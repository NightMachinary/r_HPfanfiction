NOW I love Snape, however I'm not a super fan girl where I'm oblivious of his flaws, he was a bully to children, he was an adult that should have known better. Yes, he had an awful childhood, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.

He was an absolute asshat, but despite that, I love his character. But, sometimes I'm reading a story, where Snape changes, and I'm like... he wouldn't act like this, he would never say this or that, even if his behavior did change.

I'd like a slow burning story about him slowly changing. Nothing outlandish, nothing unbelievable. He'd still be his snarky self, he'd probably still take points and give detention to students unfairly, et cetra.

But he might try to be more silent about things, help out in the shadows not wanting anyone to know, et cetra.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any Site.

No Dumbledore and NO Weasley Bashing.

NO OP Harry Potter, Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful is fine, but nothing unbelievable.

No character x is perfect or anything like that, I like reading about characters flaws, their self discovery about their flaws and slowly starting to change, and stuff like that.

Would rather it be completed, but not that's fine.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] might be something you'll like - I think I stopped a while in and never got back around to finishing it (I should do that) - but I don't remember Snape being very OOC in it.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

** Are you ok with Peggy Sue stories? He (very) slowly softens due to Lily's influence in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised).

Note that after decades of devoting himself to Lily's memory and doing everything for her sake, he's more than a little co-dependent when he finds himself face to face with her. He doesn't try to lock her up and treat her like an ornament or anything, but he can get a bit unreasonable if there's any possibility of her being hurt. Being around her really does improve him, though; he even ends up on first name terms, albeit not /friendly/, with James. Eventually. Sirius might take longer.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
