[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7587845/1/White-Lies-And-Other-Misdemeanors][White Lies and Other Misdemeanors]]

One Shot. "I was never a child. Just a very short adult." In which Albus Dumbledore is perturbed, Voldemort is disturbed, and Harry is just Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4590039/1/Future-Imperfect][Future Imperfect]]

One Shot. AU. A world in which Voldemort wins. And honestly wishes he hadn't. Time travel. Potential future slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]]

After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4213331/1/A-Family-Reunion-of-Sorts][A Family Reunion, of Sorts]]

Harry and Dudley, after the end of the war. Short and somewhat pointless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]]

Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]]

Dudley begins to see his family in a different light. Warning: strong language and themes of child abuse. WINNER: Best One-Shot at Quibbler Awards

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3718384/1/Knowing][Knowing]]

Missing DH moment, post Malfoy Manor. It's Ron and Hermione, of course.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2161841/1/A-Small-Thing][A Small Thing]]

#+begin_quote
  The centenary of the Battle of Hogwarts is less than a year away, and the Wizarding world continues to move forward. Modernisation requires change, and some things must be swept aside in the name of progress. Buildings can be demolished and statues, even statues of deceased heroes like Harry Potter, can be relocated. Can't they? Hubert Dalrymple has a problem.

*** This was quite good. If you don't mind me asking -- which are the best stories among the rest? I've read /Strangers of Drakeshaugh/ of course, but a few of the others I read aren't nearly as good, and have very little to them other than fluff.

**** I always liked Northumbrian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5670953/1/The-Mind-of-Arthur-Weasley][The Mind of Arthur Weasley]]. I'd like to think this is the real Arthur Weasley. A man who plays aloof but is actually quite shrewd and completely aware of his surroundings. I mean, could any other kind of man raise the twins and have their two younger siblings survive without being that way?

**** This is the best of his one shots, honestly. Most of his other one-shots tend to be "missing moments"-type stories for his world which, while good, tend not to have particularly interesting endings. (A case in point would be his most recent story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11128604/1/Remembrance-or-A-Muggle-at-Hogwarts][Rememberance]].)

** Also, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3111215][here]] is a cool oneshot about a squib at Hogwarts, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][here's]] a funny one about how Harry and Ginny named their kids.

  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10474427/1/Below-Her-Bed][Below Her Bed]] (Ginny Weasley/Tom Riddle)

#+begin_quote
  No matter what she tells her family, she does not regret Tom Riddle.

  Even if the sea kept running the Moon would only coax it back.

Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Gross! Pottercest! Just trust me. It's great.

#+begin_quote
  You see, all it takes is a bit of sacrifice. A little tit for tat. A bit of a 'you-help-me-and-I-help-you' sort of thing. And death isn't so difficult to conquer, after all.
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/23260][The Invisible Son]]

#+begin_quote
  Percy Weasley had been the perfect son, the perfect brother, the perfect student...until one day, his striving for perfection nearly became the instrument of his undoing. But then, watered by the pain of hard truths and the love of a father, the seeds of redemption are sown in the ashes of self-destruction.

** The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall]] has some great ones. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7202610/1/Chocolate-Stars][This one]] features cute little Hermione on her 10th birthday. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240750/1/The-House-Cup][This one]] is a pretty hilarious look at Dumbledore and the House Cup from McGonagall's POV. The author has several more oneshots, along with a bunch of "slice of life" fics, a really great long fic about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][the DA at Hogwarts during Year 7]], and a rapidly updating set of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473197/1/Great-Deeds][quick moments in McGonagall's life]]!
