The legend of the deathly hallows says that whoever unites the hallows shall be the master of death. What was misunderstood was that this was not a requirement merely a statement saying that the master of death would one day posses these items. Harry Potter has in fact been the master of death since the day he was born he met "uncle death" on his first birthday.


** Harry was placed in his playpen while Lily prepared the birthday lunch for her son and James was double checking over some of the wards around their house. So naturally, they didn't see the entity that approached the baby's playpen.

Harry's green eyes widened before he babbled at the strange entity, shrouded by what looked like shadows and smoke. The entity produced small animals out of his smoke and they floated around Harry as he happily giggled and tried to catch them, only for the smoke to trail from between his tiny fingers and reform again.

Before long, the smoke animal faded and the entity was simply content to watch his charge for the moment, seeing the boy wiggle and attempt to stand using the bars of the pen. When Harry was steady enough, he stared at the entity before trying to babble to him.

"Aruu ah gah ma?" Harry asked the entity, who simply nodded his head. Harry frowned for a moment before babbling again, "Ah gah ooo, fa meee?"

The entity paused for the moment before leaning towards the child and whispered in his ears. Upon hearing whatever the entity said, Harry giggled and tried to grab the entity's funny fingers. Instead, the entity gently poked his nose, getting more laughter out of the child. Only for the entity to disappear suddenly.

"Harry?" Lily called out as she entered the room after hearing her child laughing, "What do you find so funny?"

"Ma Ma! Ah goo fa mee!" Harry exclaimed excitedly.

"Is that right, little man? Guess who's here, Harry?" Lily asked as James came in the playroom with Sirius and Remus.

"Da Da! Pada! Mooey!"

The adults focused their attention to the birthday boy, forgetting about the war outside the house. When they ate and opened presents, Sirius took to opportunity to teach Harry to call him and Remus "uncles".

"Unnnn... Uncal Pada?" Harry tried out the word, being praised highly by his godfather.

"That's it, Harry! Such a smart boy! What about Mooney?" Sirius pointed to the tired man.

"Unca Mooey!" Harry exclaimed, giggling as Sirius rubbed his face in his stomach.

"That's all of your family, shame Uncle Wormy couldn't be here today," Sirius hummed to Harry, who was looking around for one more person. Seeing the entity put a thin finger to where his lips should have been, Harry felt a little sad.

"Unca Eth..." Harry mumbled as he felt rather tired from all the excitement. The entity gave a slight wave before fading away, only seen by Harry; who would be known in almost four months time as The-Boy-Who-Lived.
