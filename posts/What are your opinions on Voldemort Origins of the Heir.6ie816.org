What are your opinions on it? It was originally funded through crowdfunding, but Warner Bros got their knickers in a twist over copyright law, so it's now a solely non-profit project. Been following it since the original crowdfunding effort a year or two ago.

** It got the "Heir of Gryffindor" so of course it's going to be a bunch of cliche nonsense. But, since the fast majority of the HP fandom haven't been over-exposed to that kind of nonsense, they'll eat it up and praise it's originality.

*** This sub has really jaded a lot of us to many fandom cliches. I remember a time when I didn't mind many cliches at all. Now you have to be a very good writer or have a very good plot to get me to read extremely cliched fics.

**** Eh, I'm doubtful to how much of an effect this sub has had. Other than the same 3 guys reccing the same 5 fics over and over (or is it 6 fics now, with the addition of Wind Sheer?), the front page of this sub seems like the wild west, with anything and everything being searched for, or recommended. You'll constantly have "By The Divining Light" recommended in the same thread as "Harry Crow" so it's quite clear that not everyone is as jaded yet.

***** I'm sure I can't be the only one on this sub who went from enjoying cliched fics to (for the most part) despising them in the span of just a few months.

On a slightly different note, I have noticed that the diversity of the recommendations commonly found on the front page has shrunk quite significantly over the past few months, despite the fact that in the same period of time we've gained around 2,000 or so subscribers.

****** Eh, I just think it's a numbers thing. The fandom is shrinking. So, while there's less generic indy!Harry stories being written than their used to be (though still a fair number), there's also less good fics being written. Of course, "good" is subjective, and to some people, that bar is extremely low, or just completely different to me.

Book 7 came out /ten/ years ago, and many HP communities predate that. Some have died, some recently, and some still persevere. You get some conglomeration sites that draw in the more active users from those sites as well, since if you're like me, you're jaded but still love the fandom, and are constantly on the lookout for the new fic.

Yet, many people are leaving the fandom, whether they just outgrow it, or just move on to a different fandom, or perhaps just have different interests now, doesn't matter. But for every FloreatCastellum that comes along, we lost a Nonjon, Santi, and Ruskbyte.

Personally, I think it's all been downhill since 2012. There just hasn't been that many good fics since then (of course that's subjective). I can barely even remember the last new fics I actually completely (Handbook of Elf Psychology maybe), and there's only a single new fic in progress that is actually interesting enough that I follow (Shadows of Angmar). Like, when was the last time a multi-story epic like the Hero Trilogy came along? Sure, its very outdated, but where is the modern day version of it? It just doesn't exist, and probably never will.

I guess it's possible that new life will be breathed into it. But, when that catalyst is a cliche ridden movie like Fantastic Beasts, or just an outright bad play like Curse Child, it doesn't give me that much hope.

******* Your response screamed of a post-apocalyptic nature, wedded to the Harry Potter fandom. I'm not saying you're wrong, but that was depressing to read.

** I'm a little worried about the main opposition of Tom being that gryffindor heir - a person that doesn't exist in canon. It can literally only lead to one outcome - her death. Otherwise we'd surely have known about someone who stood up against Voldemort and lived to tell the tale.

They might make it cool and have her be the murder for one of his horcruxes though.

*** Any opposition to Tom ends in death, because we know how the story goes. Tom has to survive to end up at the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow that night.

** I lost it right at the 'I, Mary Sue McLaggen, Heir of Gryffindor'.

Ok, that's not her name, but that's what I heard.

** Super biased here because I hate Voldemort and think the series would have been better without him.

Not interested at all, especially because it is a prequel and canon compliant. I might have been interested it if it hadn't followed a central character. Knowing Voldemort will get away with stuff ruins it for me. A fresh story like Fallout Nuka Break would have caught my interest.

**** He should not have been the antagonist for seven books, his presence looms over them, especially the last two to three. It completely ruins the atmosphere for me, because it really dragged on and on. You can build a sense of desperation and fear, but you can't sustain it for so many books without it getting repetitive. I preferred the mystery novel format of the first three books.

He's really a very boring villain as well. For the entire series, his goal is killing Harry, and we don't see much else. The rest of his characterization comes from memories gotten from Dumbledore or the diary, which is just a few paragraphs.

In his absence, I'd like the story to be a character driven exploration of the wizarding world. I'd say maximum one Horcrux, just the diary, is maybe okay, but ideally Voldemort would not exist at all, and the adventures would tamer. More sneaking into the forbidden forest, less murder.

****** I always rec Murder Most Horrid. Other than that, I liked Voldemort's portrayal in The Pureblood Pretense and sequels, loved the Alexandra Quick series, especially book three, but the overall feel of that series is a bit like the Bartimaeus trilogy plus Harry Potter. There's just so few of these.

** What's there to have an opinion on? There's only a trailer so far. Canon compliant prequels can be interesting, in the "it's the journey, not the destination" way.
