:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im trying to remember a fanfiction where Harry is the heir to either Merlin or Hogwarts. When he gains his inheritance a tower rises from the lake and the house elves are all transformed into tall actual elves with like silver hair.


** It sounded like A Kiss Can Save the World by robst. But Harry is the heir of Gryffindor. And I don't think the elves get silver hair but they do transform.
