The first night it happened ,Vernon stormed into his wife's nephew room Bellowing for the boy to shut up. The moment the Dursley patriarch stepped into the room he knew this Wasn't a normal nightmare the boy wasn't just being dramatic and taxing as usual. No the freak looked like Vernon's cousin after he first came back from the Gulf. Instead of mocking his nephew as was his first instinct Vernon thought of his cousin for a moment before ask,” Who did you Lose boy?” Without an Ounce of concern in his voice but it was the best Vernon Dursley could muster.

Harry heart still pounding from this torturous dream, Answered before he could stop himself,”Sirius.”

​

That made Vernon laugh a cruel chuckle Like many other laughs He had at his nephews expense,” That psychopathic serial killer of a godfather , bit the dust did he? Good riddance some good news it last.”

​

Vernon bit his tongue For a moment stopping himself from expressing joy in the news anymore than he already had the boy was clearly suffering due to this man's death. So uncharacteristically Vernon asked,” So I suppose You'll be wanting to go to the funeral then boy, To say goodbye and all that. What with him being your kind and family.”

​

The silence that answered his query Vernon actually found disturbing before his nephew morosely said” You need a body to have a funeral.”

​

Greatly perturbed Vernon Dursley left the room in silence. Greatly Prospect of hairy quite probably witnessingdisturbed for the first time in his greatly disturbed for the first time in his life at the Prospect of Harry quite probably witnessing his godfather's murder and the thought no one of his kid had thought to inform them.

A few weeks later the Dursley family sat in the second row of Saint Sebastian Episcopal church in Little whingeing on a DrearyTuesday afternoon. In the pew in front of them sat Harry Potter and some man named Remus who he had never scene before but who the boy seemed to know quite well. This Remus character looked like a sickly librarian but he seemed to be doing a fine job Comforting the Potter boy so Vernon didn't regret telling petunia to write to him. The funeral mass was said for Sirius Orion Black , The godfather of Harry Potter who was gone but not forgotten.

It was paid for by an annoyed Vernon Dursley as his wife's letter addressed to Albus Dumbledore demanding to know when the funerals Sirius Black was went unanswered. Vernon himself might not have Thought there was nothing natural about his nephew sort. His mother Had imprinted one thing one his since he was a child, everyone no matter how strange deserved a funeral mass, It allowed their spirit to rest And those who love them to say goodbye. So be grudgingly because like anything that needed doing you couldn't count on a magical freak to do it Vernon begrudgingly wrote the check and had his wife arrange a funeral for Sirius black. It seemed to be the only thing that would stop their nephews nightmares. The boy deserves to be able to say goodbye the family just like the rest of them no matter how freakish he was.

​

the Funeral seem to have worked If you asked Vernon just a few days later as he was able to sleep and blessed silence with out hearing the Agonized cries of Harry Potter shouting for his godfather Sirius.

​

So it may have been for Selfish reasons the Dursley's did something kind for their nephew, Some thing that actually made a positive difference.

-----------

Vernon looked at the boy, and like always tried to ignore him, tried to hate him, it usually worked, but the boy's eyes, they were like Uncle Richard's had been, he would wake up screaming just like Uncle Richard too, Uncle Richard who was always kind to everyone, Uncle Richard who had to force a smile, Uncle Richard who would always show Vernon his medals if he asked, but would leave the room after explaining a bit about them, Uncle Richard the war hero, gone abroad to kick the Nazi's ass and kicked them he did, but Aunt Beth would say he left some of himself back on those beaches in France.

And Vernon wondered where the boy had left some of himself before this summer, he wouldn't eat right, he wouldn't speak right, the regular fire in his eyes was an ember, sometimes it wasn't even there.

He hoped those friends of his would write and solve this their way, he had even been paying attention to hear the damn owls, but there were no owls and every day the boy got worse, Dudley wouldn't even look at the boy, he went to taunt him and then would stop and leave, Petunia would look at him and then pretend he wasn't there.

One day the boy was in the garden and then Vernon would look at him and Uncle Richard was in his place, they were totally different, but the eyes were the same.

Shit.

"Petunia write that...that...old man and tell him something is wrong with the boy, that he is sick, he needs help"

"Wha-Vernon? S-Sick?"

"He's sick li-like my Uncle Richard, he needs-something needs to be done" he wrung his hands and Petunia was surprised to find concern and guilt in his eyes.

Vernon wouldn't say it, years of vitriol were there, but for some reason, his Uncle came to mind whenever he looked at the boy and his Uncle had said that without help...

Petunia went and wrote the letter, the second letter she had ever written Albus Dumbledore, and she told him what her husband didn't want to, she used terms like trauma, PTSD, depression, nightmares, and she warned of what may come from that, Vernon's family wasn't the only one who had members who fought in the wars.

She sent the letter, via mail, addressed to Hogwarts, like her parents used to do for Lily.

It took three days.

Three days later there was a knock on the door, and she opened to find Dumbledore there, in a very normal summer suit, his beard was even neater, and with him a woman, a few years older than her she bet, but still had an aristocratic beauty, magic, she thought wryly.

"Good Evening, Petunia, I hope all is well, this is Dr. Tonks, a psychiatrist, she's here to help Harry"

Petunia merely nodded, and let them enter, she would prefer ten times to send to boy to a normal therapist, but their damn secrecy prevented that, the woman looked professional enough, and she hoped she could help her nephew, otherwise it would be just one more sin for her to be punished by her sister.

"Old Man!" it was Vernon, he walked the hallway in large strides before stopping and looking Dumbledore in the eyes.

"Look, I don't know how your kind deals with this stuff, but something is wrong with the boy, his eyes, the way he-he does things, it's just like- like a family member of mine who fought in the War, I don't know if your kind knows what this is, and I don't care! He went there and fought against those damn Nazis and then he came back, but he wasn't right for a time, just like the boy is now, it's like he's not all there, he walks and eats and it's like a damn robot from the telly!"

The large man took a shuddering breath."My uncle got help and then got better."

"So you go up there and fix him or so help me I will send him to a real doctor for regular people and damn the whole lot of you!"

There was a pause, and Petunia could see that it was as if Dumbledore had aged ten years, his wrinkles were more prominent and despite his still straight posture, it was as if the weight of the world had been settled on his shoulders.

"I understand, Mr. Dursley, we will help Harry, no matter the cost."

The woman with him spoke for the first time "I am a trained psychiatrist Mr. Dursley, from St. Andrews, I assure you we will do our utmost to help Harry." she threw a very scathing glance at Dumbledore and Petunia had the impression they had already /talked/ at length about the situation, serves the old man right, leaving the boy here, alone, after whatever happened to him, these people truly lacked sense.

Vernon nodded and pointed up the stairs, both nodded and went up, he stayed looking at them until he heard the door open, and the boy's voice showed life for the first time, even if it was just a little.

"Professor Dumbledore!"

"Hello, Harry" came the soft voice of the man.

The door closed then, and they heard no more, Vernon grunted and went to the kitchen while Petunia followed, but then, she felt a sense of peace and hope settle on the house, and she thought she heard a soft tune, and felt just a bit lighter and warmer, shaking her head, she went to prepare tea, just her imagination, these people always made her queasy.

Vernon felt that too and looked over the window and thought he saw Uncle Richard there on the yard, the man nodded and smiled, and then Vernon blinked and he wasn't there anymore, the good feeling didn't leave him and he hummed a song his Uncle had taught him.

He wouldn't know he had saved more than his nephew that day, but for him, his nephew was enough.

**** I was thinking about that, the problem is canon Dursley's are quite hard to work with, they had no redeeming qualities AFAIK, maybe Dudley in DH, but after some 10 years of crap...

In this one, they are a bit OOC because I added some background(and something more) and a level of empathy they never showed in canon(in which they totally ignored him).

In this AU however, Andi would make some sort of family therapy, after helping Harry(with the voluntary help of Fawkes, who I think has one of the coolest magical abilities, a song that gives hope to the weary, hard to get more light magic than that), in here all of them have some serious problems and a lot of resentment, but I am no psychologist(merely someone who likes to read about it) so I don't think I could do it justice to how complex and hard this kind of treatment would be, even with magical help the level of a Phoenix.

I find it much easier for conflict to be ideological or martial, psychological based ones require a certain touch to not come out as dry or just unrealistic to a point it pushes you away.

And btw, thanks for the Silver! Much appreciated.

#+end_quote

The problem with canon Dursleys is that they are mostly from the first part of the heptalogy which was more like a childrens' fairy tale, and so they were more like a caricature, like fairy tale bad parents/caretakers everywhere. If you want to keep it in-universe you can say that they picture is very inaccurate, because it is a picture painted by the rebellious abused teenager. If you want to make any story where Dursleys play a significant role you must make them more human. And I don't mean make them better, they may be complete jerks, abusers, anything, but they have to be much more realistic than they are in canon.

****** Look, they kept a child in a cupboard and denied him food, gave everything to one child and nothing to the other and allowed one to bully the other with zero consequences.

They are child abusers, rebellious teenager or not. Making them more realistic would be the unenviable task of explaining that.

******* Read the last sentence of what I wrote. I am not trying to excuse them, they are horrible human beings, but they are human beings, not caricatures we have in the books. And yes, making them realistic is tough job, but absolutely necessary if you want to write anything about redeeming them (or about their penitence, however you call it).

********* To some extent, yes, but it is more like developing missing pieces, than replacing them completely. However, they are by far not the only ones: just from the top of my head ... there is really not much true character of Luna, for example. All those fantastic one-liners like “It would be like having friends” are probably more correct than expected by JKR: she is not real friend with anybody in terms of revealing to anybody who she really is. You never saw true Luna in the canon.
