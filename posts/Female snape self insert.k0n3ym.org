Anyone wanna make a a fic about a female snape self insert during 6th year? Needed is lily x fem snape. Recommended is fem snape befriending death eaters such as avery, rosier, regulus and barty junior and making them go neutral. and maybe fighting voldemort while reforming slytherin house into something better. Requested is bellatrix in 7th year with fem snape befriending her via duel ending with a punching brawl.


** That's very specific. Why don't you attempt to write your own prompt?

It doesn't even need to be SI, a female Snape is practically an OC.
