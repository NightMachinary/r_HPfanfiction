Hi everyone. I had an interesting idea yesterday, after reading /Delicate/, or the story about rose and scorpius having a one night stand in hogwarts, and resulting in a child, mad drama, and other events.

Thing is, this story idea I had has nothing to do with harry, hermione, or ron. Or even england.

Its about a "sister-school" set in the united states; North Carolina for that matter. Its about concurring events to Harry's but in a different country with a different cast. Its like a "meanwhile in the US....."

the school with have the same founder's names, but direct decendents of the original four founders of hogwarts, but the name of the school will be different, but be headmastered by a cousin or relative of Dumbledore. There will be the same classes but different professors. There will be the same currency; galleons, sickels, and knuts. There will still be quidditch and other similarities. Basically, the same world, set in the united states.

The trouble I'm going to have is with the wizarding communities similar to those in HP. Names of these communities. Etc. I could use some help with these descriptions, along with the sorting of the houses, and the grande enterance of first years.... (I would like it to be more grand than the actual book.)


** You might find some inspiration in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity's]] Alexandra Quick series, which did much the same thing with a U.S. magical school, though he created an entire magical society in the U.S. with its own history, culture, and set of essential conflicts.

For me, the most interesting idea of a second magical school set in the States is the ability to change whatever you wish, emphasizing cultural and historical different elements that are uniquely American. For example, aspects of the Native American culture and spiritualism could be adapted for a Harry Potter world (for an example, see jbern's Bungle in the Jungle and the way it approaches the Animagus transformation). An idea might be to note the profound influence of the Jesuit missionaries on the mundane world beginning in the 17th century. What about the magical world? For a conservative populace that lives into their hundreds (some into their six-hundreds) and have rather long memories, this is recent history and the imprint of events like these is likely to remain to this day.

** Just an idea, but change the founders names. All of the wizarding schools have different founders - so having the same founders names doesn't make sense. Also note that you can have more or less than 4 founders, 4 houses, etc. Each school would do it's sorting differently, I think, so you could really come up with some cool ideas for that! I think you should really stay away from a hat though if you are wanting to have it be unique. Maybe something with a task the students have to complete or something like that.

Just suggestions

*** Yeah, I'm trying to stay away from the hat but having a hard time coming up with a viable option.

As for the wizarding schools and different founders, I want it to have /some kind of tie/ with the harry potter world. I like the ideas of the founders, I did change the first names, so it seems more like descendants of the four original but a little different at the same time.

**** Oh what about this hogwarts was founded on ~990 AD (Acording to HPwiki) this is before the discovery of the 'new world' which was in 1492, what if a decendent of Slytherin (or he himself, wizards live longer) went to the new world and founded this school

As for the selection, if you really need to, what about a talking familiar, some kind of ancient animal (think of the summon toads of naruto ([[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Toads)]])

What if insitead of sorting by personalities they sort by abilities (oh you will be good at this or that) or something

or simply drop the sorting.

***** I actually did have an idea, and I have been using the HPwiki.

I decided to base the founders by elements; earth, fire, water, air. Since most magical abilities stem from the elementals anyway, I just thought I would incorporate that into the story.
