** If you want quality replies you should put a little more effort into your post. Proper grammar & spelling, and linking the fic go a long way.

Linkffn(What Would Broz Do? A Harry & Ron Series of Events by vlad the inhaler)

That being said, unfortunately I don't really know any like it. I would be very interested in seeing some though.

**** I think if you enjoyed that fic than you might enjoy some of the buddy cop stories with Harry and Ron that I see linked occasionally. If you go through the search I believe you'll find some of them. Thread' s such as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8gxedi/lh_ronharry_friendship_stories/?utm_source=reddit-android][this]] one.
