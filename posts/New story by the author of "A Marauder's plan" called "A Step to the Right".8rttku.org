**** Well, the same scenario as in “The Sum of Their Parts” probably.

The situation after the Battle was very much in flux, and if Harry didn't take an active role immediately, as I have imagined in my own fic, there could be a chance for hostile forces (not necessarily Voldemort remnants) to seize power.

***** Yeah. But there has to be a rather concerted effort to drive the saviour of Wizarding Britain out of Britain. And there has to be an explanation why Harry and co. didn't stomp them down instead. Sick of the war? Martyr-complex? Imperius? Why let them do that to you?

And, again, I really dislike the victim vibe Hermione gives off in the chapter.

****** I don't agree with that fic either.

I have this following idea:

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry retreated into a shell, as opposed to taking an active role immediately as in canon. The opportunistic 'neutral' Pureblood establishment, who had suffered few losses in both wars, managed to seize the control of Wizengamot. This cabal put the main blame on that "Half-Blood Imposter Tom Riddle", and continued to impose the Pureblood rule.

They appeased the population by throwing the worst Death Eaters to the wolves; they brought the elder Weasleys on board by bribing them with Malfoy's fortunes and giving their family members high level government positions; they gained Longbottoms's support by awarding them Lestrange's assets and brutally torturing the captured Lestranges to death; and they further won popular acceptance by bribing the people with some confiscated Death Eater gold (although they kept the bulk of it).

But their policies were all about reaffirming and extending Purebloods' control of Magical Britain's politics and economy. Although Muggleborns were released from Azkaban, they now faced formal legal discriminations and restrictions. The Wizengamot was tightening restrictions against 'dark creatures' further, even those injured by werewolves or born to them fell under scrutiny.

The once happy Weasley family was now split. Now part of the establishment and being subjected to ass kissers all the time, Arthur and Molly became increasingly reactionary. Bill and Percy also supported their parents unconditionally.

Ron and Ginny wavered at first. On one hand, they greatly enjoyed their newly found wealth and constant flattery by the press and the society. They thoroughly enjoyed Malfoys' executions and razing of the Malfoy Manor. On the other hand, Harry and Hermione's dismay with the new Ministry and Wizengamot constantly reminded them that things were not ok at all.

--------------

At this point, writers can make a choice depending on their views of Ron and Ginny. They can have less favorable of them, make them betray their ideals, break with their friends/loves, and join the new Pureblood establishment (that had already corrupted the elder Weasleys).

But based on what I interpret from the canon, Ginny was the kind of fanatic who would never betray her hero and her love. She was like the good guys' Bellatrix for me. Wherever Harry went, she would follow. Ron was less resolute IMO, but at the end of DH, after they went through hell and back, he would never abandon Harry and Hermione.

--------------

So the continuation of my plot bunny is as follows:

Arthur's vote for the 'Dark Creature Law' and Molly's alienation from Hermione shattered their last piece of hope. In the end, Luna (who lost her father in Azkaban), Lavender (who was now classified as 'dark creature'), Dean, George, Angelina, Lee, Justin, and Andromeda joined them. They decided to call themselves "The Dirty Dozen" and left Magical Britain.

**** Maybe Harry and co had to go against the Ministry to do so? Remember that they were overthrowing the Voldy and his followers only, not the entire establishment.

***** But Voldemort had overthrown the Ministry. And then he and all his Death Eaters were beaten by Harry and his friends. I'd like an explanation for this. (And I don't like the "Hermione the victim" vibe from the chapter. She's the character who stood against an entire country and told everyone that slavery was evil. Where's that witch in this story?)

******* The point is that she held on to her convictions, and did her best as a teenager, in the face of much worse adversity than this Ministry. She fought Voldemort, never giving up, when things looked the darkest. She stood against everyone she respected when they didn't care about elves. She is always ready to take a stand for what she thinks is right. I don't see that character in this chapter.

I think the best way of providing a feedback is actually writing a review for the author to notice.

Requesting something in a thread the author knows nothing about looks strange...
