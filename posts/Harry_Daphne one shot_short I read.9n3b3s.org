Hoping someone has the title handy I'm looking for a one shot or short story I read once with a harry/daphne pairing where he basically stalked her and I believe actually killed one or two of her friends? Dunno why but I had a hankering for crazy.

Edit: If it helps I remember a scene where he was literally hanging upside down from the ceiling talking to her. Was unable to find it via googling key words sadly.
