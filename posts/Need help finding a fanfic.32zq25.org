A while ago I saw a fanfic on here, it was about Severus Snape whole life, on his point of view. I remember he had poor parents and his father beat his mom, and that his mom hid the fact she was a witch, but he had a grandmother who was a witch too, and he visited her sometimes. I also remember that he used to hang out with some girl from his school (pre- Hogwarts)...Oh, and after Hogwarts, he created (i think it was) spells for Voldemort.

Sorry if this looks like a mess, I just wanted to keep reading that fanfic but I can`t find the title of it!

We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
