:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The premise is basically, because of some event, Harry becomes the mod at age 8. Death shows up, teaches Harry bits of wandless magic, and about the wizarding world. Fast forward a bit, and Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw! I honestly don't remember many specific plot points, but Harry can talk to death(mentally), and is pretty much immortal. There's a scene where he gets pushed off the stairs by a group of kids(who then run off), falls several stories. And bashes his skull on a separate flight of stairs, dies, and then wakes up like three hours later and scares the shit out of those who pushed him. I also vaguely remember that when Sirius falls through the Veil, Death just pushes him back out? I don't know if this actually happened or if I just wanted it to happen tbh.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)
