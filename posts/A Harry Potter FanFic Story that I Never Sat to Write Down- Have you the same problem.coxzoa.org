** As I read fanfics, I get all kinds of weird, and less weird ideas. Some are just random quick thoughts ("what would Harry's reaction be upon, after death, finding out that Snape got a 1976 do-over" after reading some SS Peggy Sue fic) to more developed storylines more akin to what you posted.

** I do these almost constantly, mostly because when I'm laying in bed, I have all sorts of ideas, but putting it to paper is hard.

** Yes. I have a fic which on paper sounds very good but I question if I can write it.

The basic premise is the Ministry is controlling everyone like a dystopia. And Ootp and DE are two rebel groups that fight each other and the ministry.

Sorting hat knows a way to end the civil war and finds Harry Potter a expelled student from Hogwarts, and they have a journey together with more characters joining to make a sort of group.

In the end Harry would sacrifice himself to save the day from a cross dimensional ritual to stop the bad guy (who is not Voldemort) who wants to rule all universes.

Think of Harry like Solo from Star Wars. I have it all planned out and even a sequel.

** Mine aren't as specific. I have a text file with very vague outlines like:

"Sirius loves Remus but Remus is straight and it doesn't work for them."

"When Remus might have killed Severus due to Sirius' prank, Remus is found out for a werewolf and forced as a guinea pig for Wolfsbane potion. It's horrible before it gets better."

Sometimes there's more than just outlines in the file. They are tiny scenes:\\
The fic in question is supposed to be a "pg-13 slash parody" and the characters know it. So they go like:\\
"Why's Snape so quiet?" Harry wondered.\\
"Bill told me there was a problem with a potion", Ron answered.\\
"Right... I suppose I could almost get along with him like that."\\
Ron looked at Harry suspiciously.\\
"No, not like /That."/\\
The headline of the story was really distracting.\\
*\\
"So where's that slash", Ron asked in the end.\\
"I think that's us", Harry replied.\\
"So we're supposed to stare at each other longingly and say how dumb we had been to not realise to start kissing sooner?"\\
"Apparently so."\\
"What if we'd just ask Lavender and Parvati in here? Everyone knows how they are."\\
"It's slash. If a girl was doing something, it would be femmeslash. Plenty of our planned readers are female and they might not like it if they ended up reading femmeslash without being told so."\\
"What about..." Ron started to run out of ideas.\\
"I think we should just get on with it so we can be done."\\
"What's the rating?"\\
"I believe it's nc-17."\\
Harry approached the very pale Ron.\\
"Gerroff! Stop that touching."\\
And that shall be the end of the story, for the actual rating was pg-13
