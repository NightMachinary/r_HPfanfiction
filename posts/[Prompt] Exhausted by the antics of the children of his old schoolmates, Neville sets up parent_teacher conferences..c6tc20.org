** Neville was beginning to understand his grandmother's spiels about hereditary behaviour.

Padma Corner was smiling in a way that told him she'd rather be in her own office,viciously grading Charms papers. Her son Lawerence smiled his own fake smiles like that when he was talking to his classmates Angus McLaggen(not that Neville could blame him). Her husband was much more personable,calling him Nev as he had done during the Carrows time at Hogwarts. This was reminiscent of Lawrence's twin Ingrid who had been a hatstall between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff but who had ultimately joined her brother in the tower.

"I'll see you tomorrow Pad-Professor Corner" Neville caught himself. The couple got up and Neville idly wondered whether they would find themselves in a broom cupboard before Mr.Corner found himself in the Floo Network. It had been a while since Hannah and him had had a moment...

He was shook out of his thoughts by the arrivals of the next couple of parents-he gave a smile at the Finch Fletchely's. Susan Finch Fletchely gave a wide toothy grin that made Neville think fondly of Amelia Finch-Fletchely. They sat down and Neville shifted into "Professor Mode"

"You are both aware what I have called these meetings for" he inquired.The Finch Fletchely's faces shifted into "Parenting Mode" as those of the McMillan,Finnegans,Thomases and Corners had done at the beginning of their own parent-teacher conferences."Tell us everything" said Justin Finch Fletchely.

Neville cleared his throat"Last Wednesday,in the 2nd Year Greenhouse during Herbology,a fight broke out between students. Mister Albus Potter was in the Hospital Wing following a flying accident and his cousin Rose was visiting him.On one side of the fight was Scorpius Malfoy,Morticia Zabini,Alexander Greengrass and Edward Pike" he paused to take a breath"And on the other side was Matthew Finnegan,Jessica Thomas,Cedric McMillan,the Corner twins,your daughter,Samantha Boot and my own little Frank"

"Why did the fight start ?" asked Susan,already guessing the answer.Neville continued"The four Slytherins were using the words,Mudblood,Blood Traitor and DA-Tards.I believe it was Mister Finnegan who initially Bat-Boogied Mister Malfoy. Miss Zabini then threw a hex that hit Miss Boot and was then herself hexed by Miss Thomas. It then became a free for all and by the time it over,the four bullies resembled various insects. Every student involved was given detention everyday for the next two months" he looked at his two guests who were processing the information

After a beat had passed,all three broke into grins"They're all gonna make us and the DA proud"said Susan proudly.
