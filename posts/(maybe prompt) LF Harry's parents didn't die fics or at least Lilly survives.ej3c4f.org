What if Harry's parents never died and he grew up with them?

- should be no or very little Lordships/politics\\
- no Hermione bashing, they should be close friends at the very least.
- no AngstyHarry, or OPHarry

Possible ways the story had it so they survive:\\
-It could be that Neville is the boy who lived. -Or it could be that Voldemort came for the Potter's but they fought back and survived, and Harry still got "marked as equal". -Or it could be that Voldemort couldn't get to then/didn't believe in prophecies and is therefore still alive.

Or better yet, forget about the whole Voldemort fiasco and just focus on social life and magic?

- Parents lived.
- Dudley is the BWL
- H/Hr, NL/SB DD/LL. Knew each other as kids.
- Crazy Dumbledore
- Besides some Dumbledore drama, the story focuses on pranking, social life, and inventions.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"
