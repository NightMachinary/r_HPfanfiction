Hello guys,

I've been currently reading linkffn(make a wish) and i'm 5(?) chapters in and all i can think is "man i wish the 'super!harry' in this was real". For those that are unfamiliar to the fic it's basically after Harry defeats some death eaters government follows him and he accidentally convinces him he is some kind of god level agent.

Fics that i've read and are familiar are linkffn(altered destinies; whiskey time travel)

Note: Site tricked me into not capitilazing the title by showing it capitilized in the submit page :(

Edit: I would love for Harry's power level to be close to the linked 2 fics or higher.


** The best part of Harry Potter and the summer of Change linkffn(2567419) is the training and the missions Harry does when he is recruited by a Special Ops branch of the DoM. It's a Harry/Tonks pairing (my favourite pairing), it's well written even if it cointains some cliches (Weasley twins completing each other sentences, Gringott goblins liking Harry because he respects them, Harry asking Tonks to see her "natural form"). Harry is not a God, he gets his ass kicked in some circumstances and the training he endures is very interesting The worst part? It doesn't have a sequel which could have been very interesting.
