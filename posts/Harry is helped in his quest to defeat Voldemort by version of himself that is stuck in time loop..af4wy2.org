** Damn, I've read it, but can't remember enough details for a good google search for a name.. From what I do remember, to stir others's memory hopefully, I'm fairly sure the time-looped Harry was originally adopted and raised by the Malfoys, his timeline's Draco died because of him in some way, and since Lucius was the master of his slave bond, he ordered him to not leave the area of Hogsmeade till ??something?? Also I'm fairly sure it was a not time-looped Harry/Draco fic, but don't quote me on that!

****** For the Price of a Soul, give it another read, I really do think it's that one. I've done that loads whilst looking for a fic, passed over the right one. Every detail mentioned fits exactly...

#+begin_quote
  After selling his soul to a demon for incredible power at the tips of his fingers, Harry flees Privet Drive to spend his next few years on the streets of London, hidden magically as well as physically. When he finally enrols at Hogwarts, only a handful of people know who he truly is, but obscurity doesn't keep him from trouble and power doesn't make for experience.
