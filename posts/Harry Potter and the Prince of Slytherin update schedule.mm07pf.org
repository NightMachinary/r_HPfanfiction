Does anyone know what the current update schedule for Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is? I am halfway through the fic and I wanted to know how often it is being updated these days 'cause it seems quite slow to me (compared to the chapters I'm reading)...


** Chapters come every 10 days to two weeks. If you want, you can join the discord server and preview chapters as they're being written. [[https://discord.me/thesinisterman]]

** We usually get one or two chapters a month. There should be a new one any day now based on discord.

** No idea about the schedule, it's been sporadic, but I'm sure you'll give up the book well before you reach the latest chapter

*** Is it that bad? I've finished reading three, but haven't started four yet.

**** This comment does a good job of explaining, but also read the entire post replies and you'll see:

***** Makes sense, thanks for the link.

I was pretty satisfied with the way things ended in the third book (except for a certain plot point with Sirius, which I was annoyed about, but am leaving vague so that I don't spoil the person who made this post). I'll probably wait until the fourth book is done before I try to read it. I have plenty of things to read in the meantime.

*** So I've just read the comment you linked below and honestly I kind of agree. I'm now on my, what, like 80th chapter, and I feel like I'm dragging this plot along instead of it captivating and dragging me in. The plot has become too intricate that while it is interesting, it's distracting at the same time. But I think I'll just finish it, just to say that "I've read the whole thing" before I criticize. Anyways, thanks for the heads up (tho I may be a bit too deep in for it to be heads up...)
