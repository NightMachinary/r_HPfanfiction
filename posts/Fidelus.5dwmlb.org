** That wouldn't have helped, because that Fidelius wasn't hiding the fact of the existence of the house in Godric's Hollow, it was hiding the fact that /the Potters lived there/. I think Flitwick says in PoA something like "You-Know-Who could have pressed his nose to the window of their living room and not know they were there". Goes to show how clever HP magic can be.

** To be honest, it is unknown what the exact mechanics of the Fidelius charm are, so we can but guess. On one hand, there is nothing that would negate this possibility that we know of in canon; but on the other hand it is possible that, due to the charm being a “loyalty” charm (as bizarre as that may sound for some), certain actions might negate the protections it provides.

Because thinking about it, the charm the charm works by entrusting the secret giver's secret to the secret keeper, and it ensures that the secret cannot be forced out of the secret keeper for as long as the secret keeper remains loyal (which is why torture and such do not work). Does that mean that the charm would not work properly if they chose to stash Peter away, possibly telling magic that they do not actually /trust/ him? We do not know, it is an area purely for speculation, but I would not be quick to discard that possibility. Likewise, if you put /everyone/ under the Fidelius charm in a chain, could that possibly make the thing stop working due to it being an attempt at escaping the loophole required for the charm to work? There is nothing that says it has to happen, but again there is nothing that says it could not happen, so we can but guess.

*** Maybe they could have bought 2 houses side by side, had siruis act as the secret keeper for house 1 where the potters lived and James act as the secret keeper for house 2 where Sirius lived. That way, as long as both families are in their own houses, Voldemort can't get at either of them. And James trusted Sirius not to tell, so this would only serve to protect Sirius from voldemort.

**** I do not think the idea you posted is a good one to post as a reply to what I wrote, to be honest. There is this part of my comment:

With that, your idea feels like just random rambling of someone who did not read what they are replying to.

** Or, more simply, the Potters could be their own Secret Keepers.

If I wanted to keep this charm as in canon and close the loophole, I'd say that the charm is weakened when the Secret Keeper stays in an area protected by any Fidelius Charm, and it's broken entirely after some amount of time. Several hours of meetings is just fine; living there for days on end breaks it.

For a mystical approach, I'd say the charm requires an element of vulnerability. For a technical approach, well, I'm not sure how I could justify the charm in the first place.

*** You can't be your own secret keeper in canon. But yes, reciprocal fidelius charms would seem to be an unbreakable defence... I agree with the explanation that the magic requires trust and making it 100% foolproof would eliminate the element of trust.

****** Sure, but you also want to avoid having, say, 30 houses under the Fidelius, and the Secret Keeper cycling through them.

In that case, you want the weakening effect be on the Secret Keeper rather than the location.

***** Not necessarily a case of being his own secret keeper. We don't know who owns Shell Cottage in the books, but in the movies it's said that it belongs to Aunt Muriel. And while the movies aren't canon, where they do not contradict the books they are /suggestive/.

****** That's close enough to exploit -- the Potters sell their Godric's Hollow home to Sirius for a knut, rent it from him for a knut per century, and then they can be their own Secret Keepers.

******* It's also simple enough to close off those loopholes. E.g. if magic considers leasehold a sufficient property right for the location to count as your secret. Alternatively you can use the law of trusts, which recognizes that when property is transferred to another person with the intention that the transferor will continue to treat the property as their own, then you have not transferred property at all but rather created a trust.

******** I don't think you'll get anything that would prevent the Potters from being their own Secret Keepers that would also allow Bill Weasley to be the Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage while living there. Maybe Godric's Hollow wouldn't have worked, but they probably could have swapped houses with another family.

********* Actually, he could get “anything”. By the time of the seventh book, we know they just moved there and they might very well have only thought it temporary until they can get their own place (remember, magic cares about the intent). Then the actual war took place and at the end of it all, after the battle of Hogwarts, they'd decided that they do not want to move if they can help it because they'd gotten used to the place or something. That might have broken the Fidelius after the war, but we never see it so if that happened we would not know about it.
