I'm just curious about this because I don't quite understand the Harry/Hermione thing, and I was wondering why people like the pairings they do.


** I don't really enjoy any canon ships particularly but I really enjoy the fanon characterization of Ron/Pansy that has developed.

It usually is kind of like taunting and teasing each other but not putting each other down. I also guiltily enjoy Pansy saving Ron from Hermione and Ron saving Pansy from Draco. It makes no sense but the heart likes the Fics it likes, OK?

** Harry/Luna are my favorite pairing bar none. Harry is an abused and manipulated young man who has never been shown kindness at home or allowed to heal properly.

Luna is a free spirited young woman who will stand and defend when needed or help bring light into the darkness if needed

She stormed the DoM, was a balm to Ollivander during their imprisonment, and never once treated her bullies with anything other than kindness that we know of.

She is perfect for someone who by all rights is a broken young man. A literal child soldier forced to win a war. She could easily bring that light to him, helping him move past his horrific childhood. He would be a sword and shield for her.

It also helps he wants to avoid his fame and she wants to travel the world. They fit really well and will always be my favorite couple.

** My OTP is Harmony but I'm gonna bring up Ron/Luna. This grew on me because it's like a cheat code for finding stories where Harmony is the main pairing but Ron is still a good friend/not bashed, but I think I can rationalize it a bit.

The very first time we meet Luna, she laughs really hard at a joke of Ron's that is not funny. Like its a little funny, but its not funny enough for more than a little chuckle. This is a widely known way to signal to a guy that you're into him. Luna continues to hint at this by humming Weasley is our king at random.

Not to make this about shitting on other pairings, but the girl Ron likes, Hermione, seems to generally put Harry first. This is understandable even if she prefers Ron, because Harry has worse problems, but it still isn't a great deal for Ron. Ron's whole schtick is being the youngest boy in a family of awesome people and wishing he could shine at least as bright as them. Luna meets Ron and Harry at the same time and could give two shits about Harry while Ron is there.

Ron has the meanest sense of humor of the trio. Hermione canonically ran off to cry in a bathroom when Ron said something mean about her, and even if he changed to mostly mean it affectionately, he continued to say similar things as things went on and I can say from experience that consistent ribbing of that sort can be painful even if your rational brain can see it's affectionate.

Luna sees the world differently. She can hardly see the surface level and can be more philosophical about such things than Hermione can. When Ron inevitably says mean things about how weird Luna is, Luna will hardly hear the actual words and just experience the spirit in which they were meant, which in the world where they get together would be affectionate.

Ron isn't great at self reflection or communicating his feelings. Hermione kinda jumps to conclusions. For instance, she says Ron is mad at Harry in book 4 because he's jealous, when really he's insecure in his friendship and is worried his previous loyalty to Harry is being taken for granted/ taken advantage of. If Harry had had that conversation with Luna instead, I suspect she would have told him this and Harry would immediately have been able to tamp down his resentment and go reassure Ron that he wants to be best friends forever. Luna would be able to help Ron deal with his feelings in a way Hermione can't.

I'm pretty sure that's because when he said she didn't have any friends, it was true and she knew it, whereas his teasing later on is about things she's confident it, like her obsession with studying or (relative) distaste for Quidditch.

***** Probably. I'm sick to death of the entire 'friends to lovers' dynamic anyway. What don't people like about relationships where passion is present from the beginning?

In any case, my friends - male and female - often make jokes at each other's expense. If I were in a relationship where teasing wasn't on the table, I'd be worried, because it would mean that everything I say would be analyzed and our relationship would be in jeopardy of a few misinterpreted words. Teasing reaffirms bonds and shows intimacy. It's like the one doing it is saying "I know this unflattering thing about you, and I feel comfortable referencing it while we both know I am committed to the relationship," and the one being teased is saying "I am secure enough in our bond that I understand your words aren't meant to hurt, but to point out a flaw, and I know if I were seriously hurt by something you said you would never discuss it again."

Again, this is probably just a taste thing, but I don't view Romione as a relationship with passion from the beginning so much as two people who each like Harry and are willing to tolerate the other for his sake. Then, due to a combination of spending forced time together and low self-esteem, they accept that the other is in their (vastly underestimated) league and decide to try dating because they think they'll be alone forever otherwise.

#+end_quote

Yes, that's the problem. To tease someone, they must first do something tease-worthy. Harry and Ron have virtually the same interests, from the obvious, like Quidditch and ragging on Divination, to the more subtle, like wanting to protect Hermione and wanting to do fun things to break up the monotony of school life. Hermione, by contrast, is a nerd through and through, and is happy both reading books 100% of the time and unapologetically quoting from them in casual conversation. She is also a bit of a snot about it, which is just inviting more.

They definitely step around issues. The only real differences between Harry and Ron are Ron's loving family vs. Harry's abusive one, Harry's money vs. Ron's poverty, and Harry's status as the Chosen One vs. Ron's insecurity. All of these are topics that would hurt if teased about, so they don't (except Harry's Chosen One thing, which he cycles between being okay with being teased with and not depending on what's happening in his life, which Ron tries to respect but messes up a few times - it's confusing, in fairness).

Hermione, by contrast, has her study habits as acceptable targets, while her social skills remain off-limits for teasing, and her blood status is obviously something that nobody /wants/ to tease her about. Her unattractiveness is the same thing - Ron and Harry both know not to bring her unflattering features up. Hermione doesn't jokingly tease them, she chides them about studying, but it's the same principle at work. She knows she's being irritating, but she thinks it's for their own good.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

She cares about it, but she's clearly fine with the teasing that ensues. Presumably because they've demonstrated many times over that they're not only fine with her despite her over-reliance on studying, they've been grateful for it.

I was including Romione in my statement, but that's an unavoidable consequence of making the series start before puberty. By the time they're 14/15, it's clearly passionate and dramatically affecting their friendship in negative ways, which is way better than "we are such best friends I bet we'd make a great couple oh look we do lol."

************* I think I'm going to just let this one lie, because reducing

#+begin_quote
  I read the first few books when I was 10-11 and I distinctly remember getting the impression that Ron and Harry were friends and Hermione and Harry were friends but Ron and Hermione's friendship was by proxy. By about book 4 or 5 I had thought they had grown on each other but I always thought of their relationship was that of squabbling siblings who love each other despite not really liking each other because all of their shared experiences forging them into pseudo-family. They have very little in common except for their friendship with Harry but eventually came to trust and tolerate one another.

  I think the constantly arguing dynamic can work for a couple so long as there's a strong underlying affection and respect, and perhaps even enjoy arguing. Ron and Hermione seem to row so frequently that half the time they can't stand one another. They spent most of 3rd year avoiding one another and seemed to de facto do the same for parts of 4th, 6th and 7th years (Ron ditching them for months wasn't really a result of a dispute with Hermione, but still). The respect they build for one another is slow and situational, a good deal of the time they do not want to be in each other's presence.

  During 4th year its implied that Hermione was spending most of her time with Harry while the boys were feuding -ergo she was not spending much time with Ron. This did not seem to bother either of them during or after the feud. You can argue Harry was more isolated and needed the companionship more but generally I think there's a pattern of Hermione preferring Harry's company to Ron's.

  In third year she's visibly more distressed when Harry seems to side with Ron on the Scabbers issue but was comparatively composed when Ron sided with Harry in the Firebolt dispute. In 5th year she's over the moon when she see's Harry holding a prefect's badge and dumbstruck when Ron reveals he's the prefect. She can hardly seem to believe it or even congratulate Ron on a fairly major accomplishment. Prefects also spend a good deal of time together patrolling- Hermione was much more enthusiastic at the prospect of being prefects with Harry than being prefects with Ron.

  I cannot stress enough how strongly I feel that had they not had Harry as a bridge, Ron and Hermione would never have been friends. Ron is laid back to the point of being lazy and lackadaisical, Hermione is assiduous to the point of being neurotic and obsessive. Ron enjoys a day at the Quidditch pitch and a party in the common room while Hermione would prefer a quiet afternoon in the library. Hermione only humors the boys about Quidditch, which she doesn't much care for, and Ron doesn't even pretend to hide his disdain for her political tirades. I legitimately do not know what they would do together 80% of the time if they didn't have a plot pushing 3rd wheel keeping them busy.

  Even by Book 4-5 when it's obvious Ron is sexually attracted to Hermione he doesn't seem to get emotionally or personally closer to her. At 5th year Christmas he buys her perfume that she has to diplomatically ( and poorly) pretend not to dislike while Harry gets her an Arithmancy book that she's ecstatic about.

  I love these characters as individuals and think the way they play off each other adds a lot to the books and makes their eventual friendship even more striking. I also do believe that Ron and Hermione by the end of Book 7 do have a strong emotional connection which makes me respect the pairing more than I ever will canon Hinny ( which is a rant for a whole other day.) But I still can hardly stand to see a competent writer put them together and I do not care for Romione on its best day.

************** Sorry, that one seemed to take my side, I was referring to

#+begin_quote
  One of the biggest strengths of Romione is that they simply enjoy being in the other's company, even without Harry. In PoA, they're described as "looking as though they'd had the time of their lives" in Hogsmeade (Chapter 8), and in every book after CoS, Ron and Hermione have already met up before Harry arrives.

  Also, while many anti-Romione people will point to their arguing, that's actually part of why I think they're a good pairing. Hermione likes to argue - we see her do it with just about everyone in the series. Harry is not a fan of it, and generally reacts by ignoring it, lying to her to get her off his back, or exploding at her. Ron, on the other hand, is happy to engage with her:

  #+begin_quote
    “Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,” said Ron sagely. “Anyway, I've always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape, where's the evidence he ever really stopped working for You- Know-Who?”

    “I think Dumbledore's probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn't share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.

    “Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can't you give it a rest?” he said. “You're always having a go at each other, it's driving me mad.” (OotP, Chapter 12)
  #+end_quote

  Note in particular that they both looked "angry and offended" at Harry's admonishment - as far as they were concerned, this was normal conversation and Harry is the one who was out of line.
#+end_quote

The arguing stuff is more of the hard "different strokes" territory; I just can't imagine actually enjoying that sort of arguing. And getting angry and offended in that situation is natural regardless if you're enjoying it, the feeling (for me) is always "I'm not the one being argumentative, I'm just correcting /them/!"

** I ship Harry/Hermione. My logic is that personality wise, Hermione is the closest to how I see my own personality. Specifically, at the age of 11 I was a bit of a social outcast who constantly had my nose stuck in a book and struggled with the idea that sometimes there was a difference between how things were written and how things actually are. This makes it kind of natural for me to subconsciously ascribe other personality traits of mine onto Hermione.

With that in mind, if I imagine myself as a straight woman (I'm a straight guy so there is some imagining), then Ron would not be my type. He's a great guy and I would be friends with him but I wouldn't want to date him. At the same time, I could see myself being into Harry, certainly more so than any of the other major male characters. I should note that Viktor Krum would also be my type and at least superficially more so than Harry so I find myself unable to come up with a convincing reason why I should think about Hermione's preferences differently. As a result, I tend to ship Harry/Hermione not because I think Hermione is the best fit for Harry, but because I think Harry is the best fit for Hermione.

The same thought process has resulted in me using Hermione as my POV character far more than anyone else so even if I am not doing Harry/Hermione if there is a major pairing in one of my fics it is Hermione/someone.

** First off let me say I that I have read and enjoyed fics with practically EVERY pairing possible, and if it's well written and a good story, I'll generally give it a go. I have some NOtps but that's not what this post is about, so.

My #1 favorite will always be Ron/Hermione. My number one reason for this is that in the novels, it is always extremely obvious how much they are crushing on each other. It's awkward, it's painful, they are not gentle with each other or themselves because of it, but the affection is real and it's intense. Neither one of them ever make ANY effort to impress anybody except each other.

I remember feeling that kind of crush, and it's intoxicating and painful and addictive and irresistible. It's absolutely delightful to read about both in canon and in fanfic, possibly because mutual pining is one of my favorite romance tropes.

I *never* get that feeling from any other character or between any other two characters in the whole series. Like I said, a good fanfic writer can make me believe it if they've spun a convincing canon-divergent AU, but it's just not there in canon (which is not at ALL a requirement of mine for shipping, I'm just saying).

Ron/Hermione also works in my mind because they are both sidekicks. Hermione is not "the girl" in this story, so that "the hero always gets the girl" argument doesn't work here. A Ron/Hermione romance works if they are both girls, if they are both boys, if they are gender-swapped, because their roles, characterizations and relationships to Harry as the hero are not dependent on their gender...they are his support team in a way that I don't think anybody else could really ever understand.

Now I'm reminiscing and off to find some of my favorite stories! :)

Do you have any good examples off the top of your head of them trying to impress each other?

**** I should have phrased it differently - because obviously Hermione always wants to impress her professors, and Ron would in a general sense love to be considered impressive in a sort of general way, the way his older brothers are considered impressive.

I meant more like Hermione's opinion matters more to Ron than anybody else's, and vice versa. Disapproval from anybody else could never sting as badly.

I mean all during Deathly Hallows Ron was obviously trying to seek Hermione's approval. Obvious a) because it was probably the first time he was doing it consciously and purposefully and b) b/c the books are from Harry's perspective and that's the first time *he* noticed. Also as soon as they become A Trio (and she therefore feels secure in their friendship) Hermione gives zero fucks that people tease her for being bookish, that Draco calls her names, etc. but when Ron might not notice she did her hair, that's a thing that actually upsets her. She picks someone as her date to Slughorn's party specifically so it will annoy Ron and therefore get his attention. I have long theorized that Ron loves to pick fights with Hermione because that way her attention is focused on him and he craves that attention, from her specifically.

Anyway I ship them because while reading the books it was obvious to me they were crushing on each other, and I found it charming as hell. I continue to do so because there's been so many great fics exploring their relationships, and even though I've read lots of good ones (great ones, even!) featuring either one with other people, their affection for each other is still one of my favorite things about canon, not despite how messy they are but *because* of how awkward and goofy and clueless they both are.

Also I love them both as characters and bashing either is my #1 deal breaker with any fic...just. Ugh.

** It might surprise you looking at my flair (do I even need to add a /s?), but I tend to like Harmony. Now I could give you all sorts of reasons why they should get together from serious;

(Ron's behavior looks like negging (and he literally used a pickup artists book to try to win her affection(but considering I throw large parts of the last two books out, that is something that I have no problem removing as well)))

To silly (If they get married, they can sign all their documents HJP^{2,} a hippogriff is a symbol of love and they had a ride on one together);

From feelings (Hermione definitely seems to carry a torch for Harry);

To kinda logic but really more feelings (Who was the only one to stand by Harry's side throughout the whole series? It's not Ginny I can tell you);

But really it comes down to one thing. I like it. Nothing more, I like reading Harmony and it makes me happy to read it. So, I read it.

We all have our own things we like, and that's fine. You read what you like, I'll read what I like, and we can both have fun reading fanfiction even if we don't enjoy the same things. :)

** My OTP is Harry/Fleur, largely due to how excellently it was portrayed in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]], but for the more specific reasons, it is because I find it to be the perfect pairing for a specific type of fanfiction that I enjoy, that being Harry centric stories with a heavy emphasis on a "divergent timeline" premise where one change, whether it is to an event or a person, can cause a butterfly effect through the rest of the story. My reasoning for the pairing is that it comes at basically the perfect time, Goblet of Fire is realistically the earliest time the two can meet, and it is also when the world really begins to open up to the possibility of wildy varied timelines that still make logical sense.

As far as the characters themselves and not just meta reasons, I find them to have enough compatibility that they could realistically work in a fanfic without too change to their characters, depending on where the author goes with it. Additionally, Fleur herself is perfect for fanfic writers, she isnt a fully developed character like Hermione or Ginny, whom the author will have less freedom writing, but she also isnt just a name like Daphne Greengrass, whom authors have only the fact that shes a girl, named Daphne, and a Slytherin to go on. There is enough information to give inspiration and guidance, but not so much as to limit the options of the writer.

For their personal chemistry, I find it comes down to their general positive and negative qualities as far as fanfics go, because pretty much everything else is subject to change. Aside from the physical, because we already know fleur is beautiful and harry is, while not exactly 10/10, definitely far from ugly. So, to their personalities,

*Harry is:* Noble, Courageous, Altruistic, Iron willed, Merciful (as exemplified by his pity for wormtail and draco), Intelligent, Humorous, Skilled in his specialities, Surprisingly Joyful, and most of all has an incredible capacity for love. He is also: Moody, Slightly reckless, has a tendancy not to think things through, Prone to concealing his problems, somewhat reluctant to trust, and does not find as much value in himself as he probably should. He is attracted to: Good looks (obviously), courage, intelligence, wit, competitiveness, quidditch, and high levels of skill in a persons chosen field.

*Fleur is:* Courageous (she was willing to fight voldemort), Intelligent (triwizard champion), Skilled in her field, Passionate, She does not base her attraction for a person on their appearance alone, and Physically attractive in the extreme. She is also: prideful, and somewhat vain She is attracted to: Good looks (again, duh), Courage, and a certain level of riskyness/recklessness.

All in all, none of their negative qualities are a deal breaker, and several of their positive qualities are things the other finds attractive. Due to this, I find them to be reasonably romantically compatible, and the rest of it is down to the author to write it well, as it is with all romantic fiction (fan or otherwise).

** Harry/Hermione> Harry/Luna > Harry/FanonVersionOfFemaleYearmate >Harry/Ginny

I can't stand Harry/Ginny because I never felt any real chemistry. We are shown what most characters are like, we are /told/ what Ginny is like, and for most of the books she doesn't interact much with him. Again, this might have been a deliberate choice to build up Ginny without giving the final pair away, but the result is it seems Harry doesn't care much for Ginny's company for most of the books. She's supposedly Hermione's best female friend, Ron's closest sibling in age and likely emotionally, Harry's visited her house multiple times for weeks, and they still didn't get on- Harry was uncomfortable in her presence for the first half of the books and did not even think of speaking to Ginny in Book 5 when worrying about possession by Voldemort.

Ginny's characterization was the worst in the whole series and her actress in the films was the weakest of the main cast in my opinion.Her personality does a total flip between GOF and OoTP- in the early books Ginny was shy and somewhat polite even in interactions with characters other than Harry, but suddenly in Book 5 she's popular, and good at quidditch, and a powerful witch. I was never convinced Harry had anything more than a physical appreciation for her and I am utterly unconvinced that she saw him as anything utter than the boy-who -lived, and for a story contingent on the conquering power of true love that's absolutely fucking pathetic.

Harry and Hermione probably have the most consistent and strongest bond in the whole series and I interpret a lot of their canon interactions as at least hinting at a potential romantic interest. There have been literal essays written on this subject but when two people stick by each other through thick and thin, when both their first love interests (Cho and Krum) suspected they were entangled or at least interested, when most of the Wizarding World including some personal and family friends bought such rumors, and when their mutual best friend who knows both of them better than almost anyone was so worried about them having feelings for one another that he broke down and left the group I take suspicions rather seriously. You could argue a lot of the cues for Harmony were deliberate red herrings by JKR but there are so many of them that I have stopped giving a shit; I will further elaborate upon request.

Most people also assumed Harry/Hermione was endgame early on because Harry had to end up with someone 'power of love' style and few people had confidence in JKR's ability to create a compelling relationship when half the books were done. Then Luna came by in OoTP and blew those assumptions out of the water. Luna was memorable, charming, likeable, and even had a bit of an arc with Harry. At first he doesn't really understand her but doesn't want to pick on her, then she becomes a core ally and trusted member of the DA and finally when he's grieving the loss of Sirius Luna is the one who is able to understand him, and shows wisdom beyond her years and a real kinship with Harry. While I don't think the foundation is as strong as H/Hr, I definitely see the potential and think Harry/Luna would have been a more memorable, engaging and believable match than Harry/Ginny.

After that, well... promote another extra sixth year. The whole "Ice Queen" Daphne Greengrass trope is played out but enjoyable-having Harry entangled with a Pureblood from another House could offer the audience a unique perspective on the central conflict- like the Dramione dynamic of differing backgrounds and world views without the crippling view of pre-established hatred and mutual abuse. Really you could take a promoted extra girlfriend almost anywhere for plot purposes and if you do it well it could expand the lore quite a bit.

A Harry/Katie pairing could also be hypothetically interesting. We never see a lot of their interactions but they were on the Quidditch team together for 6 years and fairly close in age.

Bill/Fleur is cool, Lupin/Tonks, Arthur/Molly. I even kind of dig Ron/Lavender, if I'm going to be honest. Voldemort/Bellatrix is twisted as hell and dysfunctional but I'm fascinated by it. Beyond that I don't much care- I'd like for most characters to end up with someone in the epilogue era but we know so little about the background cast that who ends up with who is unimportant, and as JKR has demonstrated in her execution of the canon romances, sometimes less is more. I have no antipathy to Neville/Hannah because I have no real idea who Hannah is and will just assume the best for her and Neville getting together. ...Honestly most of the canon ships I like materialized offscreen or didn't materialize at all.

** My only problem with Harmony is that I always saw their relationship as siblings in all but blood. Add a bit of romantic tension and I could definitely see it happen. I do prefer it over Romione -- they seemed to do nothing but fight in canon, which isn't exactly conducive to a healthy longterm romantic relationship.

That being said, I don't think Ron is a bad person at all. Just not the right person for Hermione. I detest the frequent Ron-bashing in fanon.

**** The Ron Hermione relationship seems much more sibling like. The sniping at each other but hanging out anyway feels much more like the relationship you develop when you're not really friends but you have the same parents so you have to get along, but in this case they're each friends with Harry instead of sharing parents.

Hermione is way more invested in Harry's life than most real life siblings are. You could make the case for mom a lot more easily than sister, and a lot of real relationships have that same criticism.

** Severus Snape is the only thing I really care about. So I'm always reading Harry & Snape (non-slash) fics and Snape/Hermione fics.\\
Snape must be a grouchy git, he can't be too nicey nice. It's fine for us to discover other sides of him as the story goes on, but he should never be sweet as honey! That's not him! He's a sarcastic bastard, even when he's being honorable and helping out!

I LOVE reading about Harry and Snape in training situations, aka how to make harry a competent wizard instead of an idiot. Stories that focus on legilimency/occlumency, DADA dueling, potions, etc.

I love reading Hermione/Snape because she's intelligent and probably the only one with a mind capable enough to somewhat match him. AKA they're both nerds and find nerd-love in the meeting-of-the-minds scenario or similar. There's been several fanfics that didn't include ANY physical interaction or outright romance and it was still AWESOME, well-written stuff that made this pairing very believable. I can't get into Lily/Snape just because we know so little about Lily in canon and I've never found her as interesting as Hermione. Hermione has BRAINS and cleverness. Lily has a pretty face and maybe some brains, but not like Hermione.

I think the whole dichotomy of a Gryffindor-Slytherin friendship or romance, (Harry and Snape) or (Snape/Hermione), is just A TON of fun and hilarious to read. Sometimes Draco gets in on the action in these types of Snape stories and that can be really funny too, even though I don't particularly ship him with anyone.

While I don't specifically ship it, stories that have undertones of Hermione/Harry are agreeable to me, only because I hate Ron.

I ship a lot of pairings, so I'm not going to list each and every one of them, but main ones would be :

Sirius/Remus : they too just work very well, almost obvious. Very interesting lives, lot of known context, a great relationship from the start but with a few obstacles...it just makes great stories.

Hermione/Fleur : though I feel a bit lonely with this one ! xD I can easily picture them travelling around the world and exploring old libraries for hours, chatting all night long and Hermione learning that there's nothing wrong with being girly.

And do I really need to explain Harry/Draco ? x)

I'm easily interested in certain dynamics, regardless of characters. Lovers working, training together, fighting on the same side (or at least trying to). Order members, Death Eaters, ministry workers, students, I don't care. And secret, forbidden relationships ! Give me ennemies, cheaters, traitors.

There's also some minor characters I really like, give me anything with Ernie MacMillan, Evan Rosier, Rabastan Lestrange, Barty Jr, Emmeline Vance... Some more major characters are just really nice to read and easy to ship with a lot of people. Fleur with women, though I do like her with Bill. Sirius is interesting with so many people. Remus, Lucius, James, pretty much any Death Eater, one of the Prewett brothers...Andromeda if we have to get incesty and badass. Draco with Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ernie, Percy. I am very very fond of Percy with one of the Malfoys, Lucius, Draco, Narcissa, whichever. Percy/Barty Jr too. Percy and a lot of people. Percy is the best. Fight me.

** My favourite ship across all fandoms is Harmony. And here's why (copy/paste from a different post):

Harry and Hermione were always the better fit, and Jo admits this eventually.

I could never buy into the Ron/Hermione ship since they had nothing in common aside from Harry. Their dynamic was also very unhealthy.

Harry/Ginny was a big question mark for me from the start. I felt that Ginny had no real personality until it was decided that she'd be the love interest. Their relationship felt forced.

Harry/Hermione is the complete opposite. Their relationship was organic. We saw how they evolved from strangers to friends to best friends. There was trust and loyalty between the two of them that Harry didn't even have with Ron. They were literally all each other had during one of the toughest parts of the series. They were there for each other through everything.

Harry and Hermione just made so much sense.

Also, from the very beginning, we knew that Ginny was starstruck by Harry's "fame". And, okay, I get why it would be romantic to be in a relationship with somebody you idolized. HOWEVER, why Harry was famous and how he earned the nickname Boy Who Lived was because his parents literally died protecting him which led to him being raised by a family who hated him. Ginny admired him for being the Boy Who Lived when it's not really something that Harry would have ever wanted to happen if given the chance.

I don't really fault Ginny for this... She's raised in wizarding Britain where they did revere the Boy Who Lived.

But it's another stark contrast between her and Hermione. Hermione knew of the Boy Who Lived; she knew of the story of Harry Potter but aside from their initial meeting on the train, she didn't let that colour her perception of the boy.

She treated him like a normal person.
