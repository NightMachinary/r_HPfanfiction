** My immediate thought is this sounds like an Ares Granger fic. I think linkffn(Harry Potter and his Veela Mate) has this scene in it, but I'm more than likely wrong. I do remember reading this scene myself, but I can't recall the fic title for the life of me.

As it happens, despite the terrible title that fic is actually fairly decent. Certainly well above the majority of what I come across.

#+begin_quote
  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.
