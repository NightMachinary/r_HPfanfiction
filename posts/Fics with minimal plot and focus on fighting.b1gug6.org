I am looking for a very blood and gory fics where the focus is mostly on action. Basically Harry killing death eaters.

It can be super trashy but the action sequence has to be superb.

Harry doesn't even have to talk.

Preferably lots of deaths. The story doesn't even have to make sense. He can start killing at year 1 and thats okay.


** linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Tons of huge battles between death eaters, aurors, death eater aurors, the Order, revolutionaries, zombies, etc.

Not much battle action in the first chapter as it mostly sets up the situation.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** I personally loved it. One of my favorites.

Hermione becoming rather ruthless during year 6 seems a bit out of character but that's mainly because year 5 is covered in the first chapter without too much detailed character development.

The Obliviators employing Seers to arrive on time to cover things up is a nice detail.

The Daphne subplot is interesting.

I love the battle scenes. So much going on at once without it becoming too convoluted to follow.

After the battle of Diagon Alley it becomes a bit more focused on politics, but there's still plenty of action with the Rookwood hunt.

  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.
