** Primarily researchers into obscure, dangerous and experiment magic; the wizard version of mad scientists. Also serve as consulting experts when weird, dangerous magic is encountered by another Ministry department that can't handle it, and (by necessity) as custodians for the many dangerous and inexplicable artifacts their predecessors left lying around the office.

*** This. For example, there was Eloise Mintumble who was experimenting with time and accidentally got stuck 500 years in the past for several days. When she got back she aged all that amount and died soon after. Oh, and dozens of people spontaneously disappeared, the past having been rewritten.

Also it's likely the place to go if you want to experiment with some Dark shit without getting in trouble. They have room devoted to Death, after all.

They're also probably exactly the people that Dumbledore should've talked to about horcruxes. Who knows what kind of knowledge and resources they have.

*** I agree with the above except for the "consultant" part. They are, after all /Unspeakables/. I think attempting to consult with them would be a rather one-sided, futile conversation. Maybe they'd be willing to tell the Minister what they're up to, but even then I'm not sure they would consider the Minister as having the necessary clearance XD

**** I feel like they would never speak about /their own/ inventions, but would be willing to help with getting rid of /other/ weird magic, especially if they can then take it home in a big box with a bow, no questions asked.

For example, I imagine they would have had a ball collecting the Horcruxes if anyone asked for their help, for example --- they just would absolutely refuse to destroy them afterwards, they're such fascinating finds, such fertile ground for new and daring experiments with soul magic.

*** There's some of that, but I feel a key difference is that the SCP Foundation (mostly) collects things they find and whose origins they don't try to find out. Whereas the Unspeakables are mostly /responsible/ for the existence of most of what they study (though if they stumble upon some preexisting fascinating item, like, say, the Veil, they will also take it home and guard it jealously forevermore).

** I do enjoy reading about wizard DARPA so that's my head canon but I always quite liked the point that we don't say secret things are unspeakable. We tend to say horrible things are unspeakable.

I've never really seen any stories that play with that interpretation.

** I see them as either advanced researchers working on developing experimental magic for the aurors. Additionally, I see them as a high level defense team, similar to SWAT. Basically, this is where the super intelligent go play with things that obscure.

** I see them as a mix of Area 51, MI6, and researchers. Like the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry is in fact a front for the real Department of Mysteries type of stuff.

A think tank with magical James Bonds and X Files is how I like to imagine them.

** In my headcanon they're Agents of a much larger secret organization for magicals that was founded by an Old God to prevent the end of the world from multiple means. They're why Timeturners are restricted and prophesies aren't common place and the SoS actually still exists and Pandoras Box is nicely contained and so on and so forth.

They aren't the only organization that obays that Elder God. And (digging a bit deeper into my headcanon) there ‘were' infact Three Gods, in the ‘beginning'. That is, the Atlantis Cascade was an event the muggles would call ‘The Toba Super Volcano”, and it created the Ley Lines as they exist today. Really, the tectonic plates are moving around beneath the Ley Lines, but all the same, the Ley Lines being formed really fucked up the Earth for a while, and no magical signatures survive from before that point, so that's what the magical world believes is the ‘beginning of everything'.

Really, those three Elder Gods came together to prevent the complete collapse of the old magical system, and in doing so robbed the rest of the world (and universe, whoops) of most of it's magic, making a lot of stuff seem older then it is, and containing most magic in what is today the Ley Lines.

Anyways, the Gods were Anu, the Creator and the Agent of Stasis; Padomay, the Destroyer and Agent of Change; and Ru, the Void, and Agent of Reality. Anu is what the muggles call God, but creation can not exist in a vacuum or it would hold no meaning, so Padomay is His/Her mirror though in the end they are one and the same. Padomay spent quite a lot of time living multiple lives as morales, and so was the one to notice the magical degradation first. He and the Others would have been fine anyways, but they desided to try and save the world rather then just start over. Ru is uncaring, She is more the stage Anu and Padomay exist on then an entity onto Herself.

Damn, that was a rabbit hole of the vaguely detailed deeper history of my headcanon. But anyways, the unspeakables are just the British sect of an organization dating back to Atlantis that is tasked with doing what they can to prevent the End Of The World. They are Protected, so they will be fine, no matter whatever is going on with the government they exist beneath.
