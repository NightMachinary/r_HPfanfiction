I mean weird time travel side effects, of the kind that are alluded to in canon (Mintumble) and only occasionally in fanfics (HPMOR's time travel prime number generator springs to mind, but again doesn't really explore the consequences)

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  Semi-sequel to "In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter." Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story.

  Voldemort uses an ancient artifact that sends Harry careening through time without being able to stop, while reality rapidly changes around him... can he ever return home without destroying everything? And slowly his oblivion creeps ever closer...

** The main character temporarily breaks time at some point in one of the later years of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red), and it's one of the most gloriously surreal things you will ever read. You may ask: is it worth it to read the whole thing just for that chapter? Not as such, is the answer, but the story is generally awesome and it is /generally/ worth it to read it.
