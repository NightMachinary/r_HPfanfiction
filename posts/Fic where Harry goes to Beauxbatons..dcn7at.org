Hello! I've yet again discovered another facination of mine any fics where Harry goes to said French school. Whether that's from transferring, becoming a teacher post-Hogwarts or only going there instead of Hogwarts, please recommend fics! Thank you.


** It's a self rec but I have this fic where Harry attends Beauxbaton: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14071023]]

** The French magical school is one I've always wanted to flesh out/see expanded - though not really as Beauxbatons, because its canon interpretation (like Durmstrang/every non-Hogwarts magical school) falls flat for me (Norway to Bulgaria for Durmstrang? Why is there one school for the UK and one for France + Iberia + the low countries? Where do the Italian students go? How do ministries without a school in their borders deal with that?

Obviously the other magical schools were (at most) an afterthought, so developing them wasn't very high up on JKR's list. I've toyed with some thoughts on expanding magical Europe's worldbuilding, with Western Europe being heavily influenced by the French Revolution with wizarding involvement (eg, Georges Danton makes for a perfect half-ogre ;) ). Just haven't found the right idea to bounce it into.

*** Reading Pottermore for what the canon lore on the other schools really rings home how ridiculous a lot of the expanded canon(everything not in the core books) is.

There are 7 Schools, 3 in Europe, 1 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in South America and 1 in Japan. That's it. It really kind of bad, almost as bad as how magical US turned out.

**** Yeah, it just doesn't make much sense. Plus the names kinda stink - like Beauxbatons/Durmstrang are in line with Hogwarts, if a little less silly. But the one magical school for all of Asia being called 'Magic Place Academy of Magic'? 'Wizarding Castle' in Portuguese for a Brazilian school supposedly as old as Hogwarts (ie, centuries /before/ the Portuguese came to Brazil)? Ilvermorny doesn't even /mean/ anything, and has houses for some reason.

It's just a mess.

***** Don't forget that Merlin was in Slytherin despite the latest reasonable time period for Merlin/Camelot/Arthur to take place was 2nd Century AD(Roman Invasion of Britain).

Actually that would make a lot of sense, if Merlin was a Roman wizard who revolutionized the understanding of magic in Britain.

****** It could easily be later than the 2nd century - the 4th/5th century attacks by Saxons would fit well too, particularly if we view the Arthurian legends as more Welsh (where the britons lasted longer). The version of King Arthur I'm most acquainted with included a Saxon invasion .

But your twist would work well there. I'd not been aware of Merlin supposedly being Slytherin - him being a mythical pre-founder figure works nicer imo, perhaps being the one to switch to the use of wandS?

******* I just recall a Rowling interview where she mentions that and when I read about about it I had a "Doh!" moment. Hogwarts was built in ~1000AD, given that they said it was a thousand years old at the start of canon. Well after Merlin would have been turned into a tree(Hawthorne to be specific).

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]] has Harry go to Beauxbatons as a teacher post war. It is a pairing centric fic focusing on a romantic relationship between Harry and Gabrielle (who has gotten much older at this point) and is quite well.done in my opinion. Harry is overpowered AD, but it doesn't really matter cause the conflict in the story is largely emotional rather than physical.

All in all 8.5/10 would read again.

It'd be quite the story if she hadn't, given the way time usually proceeds.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
