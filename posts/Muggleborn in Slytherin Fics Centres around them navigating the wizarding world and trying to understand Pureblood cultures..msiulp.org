** New Blood is a fucking wonderful Hermione-in-Slytherin fic. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood]])

I could swear I read another that wasn't Hermione lately...I'll have to see if I can track it down

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

*** Tangentially there is also Six Pomegranate Seeds which is Hermione going through Slytherin as a pureblood. It's not exactly what you're looking for but I do find the innovation she brings into the role as a full on Slytherin is a really interesting take and it's just a damn good story. But yeah, there are others that are definitely more relevant to your request, so I'll see if I can get my scattered brain to think of them for you

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.

** linkffn(New Blood) - Hermione's way too much of a Mary Sue in this for me(She is apparently as powerful as Dumbledore and pretty much does everything the trio did in canon and more alone) but perhaps you'll enjoy it.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
