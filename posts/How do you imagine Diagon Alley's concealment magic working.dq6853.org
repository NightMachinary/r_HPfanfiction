** It's just an ordinary street, geographically speaking; the back of the shops and buildings in Diagon Alley are back-to-back with the buildings of Muggle streets on either side, probably with sound-carrying charms to make it seem as though the Muggle houses on either side are pressed right against each /other/.

Likewise, a wizard flying straight up in Diagon Alley would just see it as one of the streets below, with no funny business. But if it's a /Muggle/ flying over London, they wouldn't /notice/ that strange street in the middle, any more than they notice the Leaky Cauldron. It's not quite that they wouldn't see it; it just wouldn't register with them. Owls, of course, have no such restriction.

As for other ways in... It's almost certain that there are ways to enter Knockturn Alley covertly, and from /there/ you could get to Diagon Alley. The Goblins also likely have tunnels leading from Gringotts to outside the city, just in case, but obviously those are for Goblin-use only.

*** Those ways into knockturn alley are probably just floo and apparition.

** I assume a lot of shops are connected to the Floo network. So it should be easy to enter the Alley thru those. Especially through one of the shader establishments.

** And does the magic there interfere with muggle electronics? Wouldn't the muggles notice that then? Or is that only an issue in cases of heavy magic concentrations like hogwarts?

*** My personal headcanon is electricity doesn't work at hogwarts because it's not wired for it. It just doesn't make enough sense to me otherwise.
