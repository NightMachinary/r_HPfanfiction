I really liked everything before Harry and Draco get sorted in Growing Up Black, so are there any other fics that have the premise of Harry being rescued and then hidden as Sirius Black's son?

Or, alternatively, an OC son of Sirius Black.

Thanks!


** Did I use the right flair?

*** Better to use request. What's that fic is for when you're looking for a specific fic. You give the details you remember about the fic and hope someone recognizes it. Request is like a more general “I like this and want more”

** I also want to see an OC son of Sirius, but I know a good one with a daughter of Sirius.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.
