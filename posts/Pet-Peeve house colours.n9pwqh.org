I really love fics where people redecorate/rebuild/DIY a house or a room. However, I keep seeing this little thing everywhere and it really annoys me (maybe illogically so). So here's how it goes: “oh my god I love my new room/house, what colour should I paint the entire room/house and which colour should ALL the furniture be? Oh my house colours of course! Everything is red! The floor is red, the walls are red, our furniture is proud maroon, Kreacher has even been dyed at our convenience!” It irks me so much! Maybe a nice touch to remind you of your house at Hogwarts - a little accent detail, a tablecloth, some upholstery, maybe a squishy chair that reminds you fondly of Gryffindor - but it's always EVERYTHING. And it's not even limited to home decor - what will the Slytherin princess wear to the ball? Oh a green dress with green jewelry and a green tiara and green outer robes and a snake costume to top it all off!


** YES! like I can understand Sirius doing it as a teen because he's like ‘mum hates that I'm in Gryffindor so guess what mum?!' And then regulus his little brother obviously reactively also does the same but opposite, like that's so juvenile. But for adults to do the same is so weird, lmao

Not that you don't see red and gold and silver and green in interiors seperate to school colours, but it's pretty mf gaudy, and people will be judging you. Like even when those colour schemes are done well, I'm still like...but why?

I could understand if they have grown up to have a subconscious preference for warm autumnal tones as the Weasleys seem to and stuff, but straight up having red and gold stripes wallpaper or something seems a bit off

Canonicly the only mentioned colour in Malfoy Manor are red and gold - that's the carpet and a mirror. So not even the Malfoys do the whole house colour thingy.

for the Weasleys though they don't seem to do red and gold, but they have a lot of browns and oranges and autumnal colours that are warm and possibly feel comforted with warm tones, while Slytherins might go for cooler tones, but yeah, I feel like the Malfoys would do that totally, and we know grimmauld place had a lot of ~creepy~ aesthetics and snakes and things because the Blacks don't do things by halves

*** I love your take on the Black brothers reasons for decorating!

I do think the idea that everything about an adult's color/design/style choices should be dictated by their house is quite juvenile, but I don't think decorating a room that way is - particularly not if having the room in those colors (or the occasional outfit, etc) makes them happy.

I will say though, I don't think using strong colors or combinations of red/gold or green/silver is always gaudy. It can be tastefully done. As far as why people do it, I think some people just prefer stronger colors (or color in general) to paler colors or beige/white. Likewise some people tend to prefer certain metals over others. Nickel or silver toned hardware is currently considered the norm/most ideal and gold or brass-toned is seen as more old-fashioned or only appropriate in house designed around their construction period (like a Victorian house).

I know I personally can't stand white walls and (edit: have) a dining room that is very nearly emerald green, and other rooms have blue or green, one is purple, one is mauve, and the kitchen is a soft yellow.

**** Oh sorry I didn't mean to say that it's hideous or anything, I was a bit out of it. It's certainly a loud combination to take red which is already a statement and then gild it, you know?

But jewel coloured rooms can be super lovely.

I guess I always think of medieval or baroque decorating when I think of those colours, neither of which are particularly subtle

And like you said I can certainly see adults subconsciously or consciously paining a room in the house like a den or gamesroom in their house colours as it's supposed to be comfortable and it is where they have fond childhood memories, but not the whole house

***** Oh no I didn't think you did, but even if you did I wouldn't hold it against you. Like I said I think all white is awful, and beige is just... blech to me. I can see that, depending on the red used. Certainly a fire engine type red would be overwhelming.

Saturated colors are definitely not subtle at all, that's for sure! I told my friend (who prefers lighter colors) that the rich wall colors make me feel like a mermaid swimming through rainbow pools. Meanwhile she's like ‘it's too dark!'

Oh yeah the subconscious can definitely take over, you're so right about that! Especially when it comes to color I think, and anything we associate with comfort/safety/‘home.'

Right, but thinking something is gaudy is a cultural thing. If you've got a society that has most of their members go through schooling at Hogwarts, and so a quarter of them grew up in red and gold, it's not going to look as gaudy as it will to us. This is effectively a tiny foreign country with a somewhat high immigration rate that funnels most of their population through a single school, there's going to be significant cultural impact from Hogwarts.

**** I was thinking about it after I wrote that and I agree, if it was something people tended to do, just like judging adults in their lives and workplace on what houses they were in at school (if perhaps only the peers who went through with them so they know) then I can definitely see that happening.

And I mean nostalgia really can be a big influence on the way we design our spaces. So I do think it depends on the person and whether the culture is as obsessed with houses as they really are in a lot of fics.

*** My pet peeve is when this is taken too far in the opposite direction, where virtually all behavior is constantly described through the lens of the house traits, even by adults who have been out of school for decades. Sure, the houses are important to people, but the traits shouldn't dominate every single mention of anyone's behavior. The text should not mention his "inner Ravenclaw coming through" every time Harry does anything moderately clever, or say, "I knew the hat offered me Slytherin for a reason" every time Harry does anything slightly deceptive or ambitious.

I get the idea of using a Hogwarts house as a shorthand for a number of traits, but, in real life at least, that's usually used when someone's being very reminiscent of a particular stereotype. Give me nuance, damn it!

** Characters don't treat their house in the story the way we fans do. We're all like "oh this is so Gryffindor of you!" or "I just finished buying Gryffindor clothes and furniture to display over my room!", etc. It's nice to obsess over the houses, discussing their values, taking a million sorting quizzes, etc. as a fan, but think about it from their perspective. There is rivalry, there is a lot of house pride, but no one starts fights with "Gryffindor arrogance" or "Ravenclaw backstabbing for good marks" as arguments in their personal lives. They graduate and their house is their favourite and all that, but that's all. They don't keep theorising about them and acting as though former students from other houses are their rivals. This is the equivalent of giving a crap about stuff from our high school years after graduating. We only like it so much because HP is awesome and we wish we were Hogwarts students.

Obviously it's nice to be a bit self-indulgent when writing, but subtlety is is what makes it enjoyable to read. You want house colours, limit them to the bedsheets, curtains or whatnot rather than making the whole house an eyesore.

** I'd actually prefer if they were more colourful. I think colour-changing charms are some of the simplest spells. You won't need to keep the staple furniture neutral to avoid clashing. Anything painful or embarrassing can just be changed to something else.

Maybe the spell has some limitations. Primary colours are easier so you can get your house colours done quickly. Tertiary colours are trickier so it is fashionable to show off a mauve or a coral.

Everyone is walking around with big hats and swishy robes so any kind of colour and clash is fun.

** I want to see an edgy Lord Potter fic where one or more of the founders come back to life. They are immediately invited to live in Potter Manor where they are offended to see the heraldry of their noble houses used in another noble family's home as a novelty.

** It's also kind of annoying how using any other house color for anything is seen as a betrayal. "Why are you wearing a green shirt, you have betrayed Gryffindor!" or something like that.

Also, slightly off topic, but with merch, it's so hard to find any that I like because I don't really like the color yellow. And everything hufflepuff is, well, yellow.

Finally was able to buy something though, a blue hufflepuff t-shirt with yellow lettering/print.

** This is a plot point in the Inquisitor Carrow series. Somewhere along the line, Carrow makes the comment that Sirius ruined Gimmauld Place with his sense of decor.

(Carrow has a special taste in home decor all of his own.)

linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the God-Emporerless Heathens) Link to the first in the series, not necessarily the one with the home-decor incident.

** It honestly has to be tastefully done. I'm planning on modeling my room after the Gryffindor common room, very cozy and warm and warm-toned. Will everything be red? No. Do I really like red (and not just because it's my house color)? Yes, yes I do. I want to feel like I'm in my dorm room at Hogwarts. And I believe that I can do it so it won't be gaudy.
