Hi! Can anyone suggest some Fanfiction in which Harry dies as an elder and Death gives him the chance to go back in his child's body and do it all over again? Pairings aren't important, they may not even be present. Thank you! ðŸ’š

AU Junior-Auror Harry meets up with an aspiring Dark Lord who's mucking with time magic and gets sent back to the beginnings of Voldemort's war. Not exactly what you're looking for, but there's a similar circumstance.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** AU Harry where he didn't manage to put Voldemort down in the Battle of Hogwarts. Only later after a long and gruesome war. he then became a mercenary and after being killed in Africa, was sent back in his 11-yo self. HP/HG. It's guilty pleasure level at most but I've really enjoyed reading it.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
