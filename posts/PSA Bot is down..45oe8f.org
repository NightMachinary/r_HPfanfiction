Hey, all,

Seems like the bot is down. It always seems to time out when accessing fanfiction.net.

Not sure why.

I'll be working on this.

*(Technical) Progress:* I could use a few ideas. I'm not exactly sure what's causing the timeouts. Basically, since this morning, all requests to =fanfiction.net= seemed to have timed out (using =urllib.urlopen= in Python). I thought we might have been IP-banned, so I changed the user-agent and launched a new EC2 instance with a new IP to see what was up. Timeouts still happened. I'll be testing on different devices to see if there's something wrong with accessing Fanfiction.net from Amazon's servers in specific.

A few weeks ago I spent a few days setting up [[http://imgur.com/a/9BLXb][a full Ubuntu environment on my phone]], just for an issue like this, because I don't have a linux env on any of my computers right now, and my university doesn't give us the =sudo= needed to install essential packages on our own CS account servers. It seems like it's paying off... *for now, the bot seems to be working again.*

But it's a temporary solution.


** [[http://imgur.com/VNPLPYx][I didn't understand any of that]], but I know [[http://imgur.com/aD7vDTc][you will figure it out]]. In the mean time, people might just [[http://imgur.com/ySj1xIV][have to recommend the old fashion way]], with website links. A reminder, if you use [square brackets] around your text follow directly by the (link) in round brackets, it will have the link as the text.

** Have you considered a $5 digital ocean server. Or maybe an Amazon ec2 in another region?

*** I've had bad experiences with Digital Ocean in the past. I'll look into getting an EC2 in another region.

**** Worth a guess. There's also Google cloud compute if you want to give that a try. All around the same price range

***** Not free, though. I have 1 year of EC2 free + $100 student credit. Maybe when I run out.

I'll look into it, though!
