I am looking for and HG/SS that I read probably 10 years ago. I might've saved it somewhere but so many of the archives I used to use don't exist anymore :(

Anyways here is what I vaguely remember from the story.

Severus and Hermione get married and after consummating the marriage, Severus encourages a curious Hermione to sample their mixed essence that includes her virgin's blood. He says something along the lines of this being her only opportunity to sample this specific brew, and I think that her comment was that it tasted coppery. Throughout the whole story I remember Severus being very informative and thorough in instructing Hermione in bed. The aforementioned honeymoon may have taken place in a property belonging to Severus or Dumbledore. It definitely wasn't Spinner's End and it may have been some sort of cottage.

As for other characteristics that I remember, it may have been A Marriage Law or a Surrogacy Challenge, and it had been completed already back when I read it.

This isn't much, but I hope it triggers someone who has a better memory than me.

Thank you for your help!


** I would have to hunt around, but I think it was on Ashwinder?

**** If you find it, let me know! It's really bothering me, because I definitely read it, and I can picture the scene you are talking about, but I cannot for the life of me remember the title.
