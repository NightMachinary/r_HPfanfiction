#+TITLE: Each of Voldemort's Horcruxes contains a different aspect of Tom Riddle's personality, usually related to the object they're stored in. Tom Riddle's diary is just half his soul. The Ravenclaw diadem holds Tom's wisdom, the locket his ambition, the cup his loyalty, etc.

*** Unfortunately that wasn't the case, so when Voldemort was resurrected he had his sexual prowess and nothing else.

** I might change the diadem from wisdom to knowledge. Ravenclaw herself arguably lacked the ability to tell the difference between the two. She alienated her daughter to the point she stole her prized possession and ran away to Albania.

** Oh I wrote a story like this once ! Where each horcrux was a virtue and the moment he cut off a piece of his soul the lacking virtue would reveal the sin. So the first goal of my main characters was to put his soul back together so that he would repent bc his true punishment would be his guilt and self hatred over all that he had done

I have to note though that this was only being set up, and I was leaving hints at it throughout the story, but it's now somewhat discontinued. I'll come back to it eventually!

** This concept makes me think of the G.L.A.D.O.S. fight at the end of the first Portal game.

What if, rather than destroying the horcruxes in this case, Harry found the one where Riddle removed his compassion and empathy, and then forcefully rejoined that horcrux with the embodied Riddle?

*** Forcibly?

All Harry has to do is show the Horcrux to Voldemort. This will cause Voldemort to feel remorse for creating the Horcrux, since if he hadn't it wouldn't've gotten in the hands of Harry. Bam! It rejoins his soul.
