I've tried to write her before. Reading back on that fic I wrote, I felt so dissatisfied. It didn't feel like I did her character any justice at all. Other characters I felt like I had a firm grasp on--while I may not be the best at character portrayals, I had an idea of what I thought they would say and how they would behave. But with Luna, writing her character is like grasping at air. No matter how hard I try, it feels like everything is wrong. She's one of the hardest characters for me to write, and imo, one of the hardest characters to write in the fandom.

I'm writing another fic now where I plan to have Luna as one of the major characters, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice. Maybe things they hated about some portrayals of Luna in fanfiction, or things they loved. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)

I also loved her in linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke)

I think a lot of writers have this idea that Luna is totally comfortable in her status as an outsider when she's not. She's a pretty lonely character ( " I enjoyed the meetings, too. It was like having friends."). I doubt that she shirks off the bullying as easily as many fics depict. Some of her beliefs are also plain dumb, and many writers tend to portray Hermione as unreasonable and close-minded when she actually had a point.

I'd like to see more about her parents. One thing I've barely seen explored is Luna's relationship with her mom. Luna seems to be one of the few people able to see Thestrals at such a young age and I'd like to read about how witnessing her mother's death influenced her. Also, anything post-DH about Luna and her Dad. I can't imagine her taking the news of him trying to hand Harry, Ron and Hermione to the Death Eaters very well, even if it was for her sake.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

That's actually a major plot point of one of my favorite Luna stories, /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./

** I hate it when people "sane-wash" her, for a lack of a better word. Luna isn't some seer-type person. What Luna /is/, is very observant and empathetic. We have a short glimpse of that in OotP when she is the one who gets through to Harry - by not even really trying. She also delights in believing. If her creatures are fake or not doesn't really matter. What matters for her character is that she loves to bring them up, to use them as metaphors and to veil the meaning of her words. Not just veil them, but also defuse them.

"My housemates stole my shoes" - "The Nargles took my shoes."

The first one would have Harry seething, the second one just left him baffled, at which point we come back to her incredibly observant and empathetic way of talking to people.

On the other side she is incredibly forgiving and calm, to a point where one might wonder if she just can't express feelings of humiliation, anger and the like. The way she is treated by her housemates has to be a source of constant stress. Her stoicism in the face of this bullying is an aspect many authors see as interesting, but then go ahead and over-emphasize a lot. I personally think that this could be a great place to show her incredible strength and also her stubborn side. The more pressure you put on her, the more she fortifies within herself. But if you focus on her in your story, it would be interesting where she goes or what she does to let all that stress out. Does she explode in privacy? Does she cry herself to sleep under a Silencing Charm? Does she go to the owlery and pet the owls until she feels better?

And all of this is of course also a weakness of her. As good as her way of talking works with Harry - an emotion driven character - as bad does it mess up her relationship with rational thinking characters like Hermione (and probably a majority of Ravenclaw). They think her weird, annoying, uncomfortable and obstructive - unnecessarily complicated and scatterbrained. She probably is a lot of that, too. We know she is smart, but smart and smart can differ greatly between people. Some go straight at a problem, some circle it, some first test whats around the problem and some try to avoid it completely. Luna makes the problem seem like a solution to reverse-engineer an answer, I feel like. And if she can't, she doesn't mind much. Then she just believes. Because to her believing in something is almost as, if not just as good as knowing it (which, to be fair, is something that may have some value in the magical world).

Hmmm... I'm out of things to say for the moment, but I'll add it if I think of something else. Maybe this helps, even though it also seems a bit scatterbrained, now that I re-read it.

I do agree that Harry would be angry if she straight up said that her housemates were messing with her and want to do something about it, but what is he going to do in the face of possibly made-up creatures?

*** I love the analysis of Luna's character here. You definitely put some aspects of her character into a perspective I hadn't considered before. As for what Luna does when she's stressed... your suggestion about petting the owls made me think of Luna feeding the Thestrals. We see her do it in canon; maybe that's what she does to take her mind of things?

That said, I'd happily accept it as canon.

In any case, I want her character to be what it deserves. Something 3 dimensional. Someone with strengths and weaknesses, with virtues and flaws. Someone who can truly be the heroine of a good fiction.

Did she say nargles took her shoes in the movie? She didn't in the book. And Harry felt more sad for her than angry ("pity").

** Step 1 is to go re-read her significant scenes in canon. She's featured relatively little in the series compared to other characters that many would consider even as minor characters (Percy, for instance). Much of what you remember about her is probably hobbled together from various fanfics, while only general idea of her from canon.

I discuss this topic in more detail as well as general Luna-writing tips in this post: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6n53jw/misc_question_why_is_luna_associated_with_pudding/dk738j9/]]

** For me, I think the most interesting part of Luna's personality is the part the Hermione /can't stand./ This also happens to be the part most writers fuck up. Most writes portray the ditsy part of Luna as a belief system, like Luna just had a blind faith in mythical creatures existence. While this is very close to the truth it's still missing a core aspect.

Why does Hermione dislike Luna so much? Is it because Luna is more accepting of the impossible? Because Luna has her head in the clouds too much?

Hermione is an logical person. Her world operates in facts, and systems. 1+1=2.

The kicker?

Luna is /exactly the same./

But her logic only makes sense to herself.

According to Luna, 1+1=395.

And this /infuriates/ Hermione.

Luna doesn't "believe" in crumple horned whatever's like someone might believe in a higher power, with an absolute faith that disregards common logic.

To Luna, crumple horned whatever's exist because that's what /makes sense./ That is her system of logic. She has this whole internal world of systems, and direct progressions, that if x is this y must be that. But nobody else has been shown that world in all its glory, so when Luna says things that sound crazy, in her matter of fact tone, like that those brain fuzzy bug things are what's causing Harry to not think straight, Harry just thinks that Luna has a crazy belief in nonexistent fuzzy bug things. Luna thinks that /obviously/ Harry isn't thinking straight, because the fuzzy bug things are affecting him, because that is how the system of the world works. That's the logical explanation.

I vaguely remember some exchange between Harry and Luna, where Harry has kind of an internal realization about how Luna sees the world in a different way that only makes sense to her, but I could be completely making it up. If it does exist, it feels like it would either be the talk in the forbidden forest, with the threstral in OotP, or the talk at the very end of OotP, with Luna talking about how her shoes keep disappearing.

Disclaimer: If it seemed like I was ridiculing those with a belief in a high power, I was not intending it that way. I myself have a belief in a higher power, despite the fact that my own system of logic says no higher power exists. This is also the difference between me and Luna, that she believes in her creatures because her logic system says they do exist, rather than believing in the creatures despite her logic system saying they don't.

When you put it that way, I can't help but think of Puddleglum's speech from C.S. Lewis's /The Silver Chair./

"Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things --- trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia."

The first 3 times I read that sentence I thought you were referring to our universe. I got very excited.

Also, that was an A+ quote. It pretty much encapsulates my thoughts on the subject of higher powers and afterlife and such. Like, yeah, logically, no such thing should exist, but I don't really want to just die and have literally nothing happen afterwards, that sounds really depressing, so I prefer to believe that there is something after death. And "talking with my higher power" has practically nothing to do with thinking I'm gonna get some kind of a response and everything to do with it being a kind of comfort to talk to something that can't or won't respond, like talking to your dog or cat. As long as you're "aiming" your thoughts to some ethereal being, or the universe, or Thor almighty, it doesn't really feel like you're just talking to yourself.

I really liked her portrayal in Linkffn(3676590) where's she incredibly blunt, really tests Harry's patience with her intensity, seemingly no sense of embarrassment but she's also nice.

** I don't know if you use mbti, but if you do, Luna's an infp. (As am I.) important parts of her personality:

Being authentic is her most important value.

She is inwardly focused to the extent of being visibly socially inept. However, she is observant of others when she finds them interesting.

Unlikely to be flexible about things she truly cares about, but they are few in number. She looks very chill from the outside because 99% of issues that come up are not things she deeply cares about. Internally she is very intense.

Her feelings guide her. She is empathetic and uses her own experiences as a foundation for connecting with other people. She is very good at connecting with Harry about Sirius' death because she has spent so much time processing her mother's death. However, if she is put in a emotional situation that she can not compare to her own experiences, she may flounder until she takes extensive time to think it through.

Not interested in power over others at all.

Does not think in a hierarchical manner. She will ignore titles and rank, instead prioritizing a person's character and knowledge. For example, she may consider it a point of pride to disregard an incompetent prefect.

Not good at managing interpersonal conflict.

She is protective of the people she cares for. When Hermione criticizes her father's work, Luna snaps back to defend him in a way that she does not defend herself.

She is her own bedrock. Her internal sense of logic is based on her own emotions. She feels it is true, therefore it must be true, therefore x, y, and z logically derive from that, and so forth.

How to piss her off: -do something that conflicts with one of her few highly internalized values. If treating animals well is a Value™ of hers and not just a habit, animal cruelty may visibly enrage her. -be deliberately unfair or cruel to others. Even if she doesn't like the person being mistreated, she will still be angry on their behalf. Likely to protest the Malfoys getting unjust treatment (even though they imprisoned her).

** Luna Lovegood is one of my very favorite characters, but I agree that she's hard to write.

What do we know?

She is unafraid of her emotions. She laughs so hard she cries at one of Ron's jokes, and it wasn't a very good joke either. But she thought it was funny, and laughed. But it's definitely worth noting that everyone else stopped laughing. So Luna herself is not a jokester.

(Did Luna have a crush on Ron? Maybe, but given that we never see her date anyone in canon, I have a very hard time seeing her pursuing romance with anyone)

While Luna doesn't seem to mind people taking her belongings, she definitely doesn't like it when people make fun of her beliefs. She's subdued, but clearly furious when Hermione mocks the Quibbler as "nonsense," and raises her voice to Parvati and Lavender when she thinks they're laughing at her for backing Harry, and outright fights with Hermione when she agrees that there are no such things as Crumple-Horned Snoracks.

There are several ways to interpret this, but my favorite is that Luna values honestly. She believes in taking people at their word. One could take this as very trusting, or possibly empathetic (After all, why would someone lie about seeing a Snorack?)

She's also very committed. Not driven, but committed. Especially with friendships. The most notable instance isn't the moments of compassion she gives Harry or Hermione, but the scene where she helps drive off Dementors. "Think of something happy, Harry....we're all still here, we're still fighting." Luna undoubtedly is reliving seeing her mother die, and whatever happened to her in Malfoy Manor, when a Dementor gets near her. And there's dozens upon dozens of Dementors surrounding her and her friends. And Luna is certain that an afterlife exists--to her, there would be /nothing/ more terrifying than a Dementor's Kiss. And yet she fights and comforts.

Assuming you're not going too dramatic, a good way to put this sort of interaction in is Luna comforting someone upset when she has every reason to be just as upset. (Think if Luna and Ginny both had detention with the Carrows).

Luna's not without her faults, of course. Much like Hermione, she's stubborn as a mule--though in fairness, nobody ever really tells Luna *why* she's wrong or tries to find a middle option (Take Heliopaths. Hermione dismisses them, Luna insists they're spirits of fire that burn everything in their paths. Fiendfyre, anyone?).

Luna also has a knack of embarrassing honesty. In other words, she is the perfect character to say something when it would be smarter to not say anything at all. Though she doesn't strike me as someone who would betray a secret on purpose, she may say something that was meant to be a bit confidential. Or just have a whisper that carries ten feet. In any case, this could cause problems.

Personally, I'd recommend making sure Luna has somebody to talk to:

Have Luna and Ginny study together in the library, or at the Lake. Maybe give Luna a chance to see what Good Fun Teasing looks like, compared to the bullying she's gotten (Ginny's somewhat of a jokester, so I can see her trying to make Luna laugh)

Have her talk to Hagrid about something (maybe have her apologize--Luna mentions she doesn't think he's a good teacher in OotP, but I find the idea of them interacting delightful).

Oh, and on to your point about fanfics. My favorite fanfics with Luna tend to be those that emphasize her friendship with Ginny (On that note, I once again shed a tear for the magnificent fanfic "Faith and Understanding" that was taken off Fanfiction.net and I stupidly didn't archive it).

"Fire and Air" is one of my very favorites. Ginny is /not/ happy that Luna's barefoot habits are a result of her shoes being stolen, rather than just an eccentricity.

** I love her so much though. You actually got it though, how do you describe something that doesn't subject itself to description? "writing her character is like grasping at air. No matter how hard I try, it feels like everything is wrong." is exactly right!

Luna's only quality is that she is unpindownable. That's why everyone in canon feels lighter after talking to her.

You know that metaphor about the glass of water that gets heavier the longer you hold it? Luna's the girl that takes that glass, pours it out, does a rain dance, and invites everyone to pour their own glass on the ground and join her. That's why she makes you feel lighter.

What fanfic often does with Luna is make her make sense. Some ways of doing this are by saying she's damaged and hold people off with her creature comments. Some say she's so smart she uses it as a way to see who around her are smart enough to look past her silliness and recognize her wit. That's fine, but it /is/ the easy way out as I think you'll agree. Because the real Luna doesn't make sense.

She doesn't have a personality like most people because she doesn't have a consistent image of the world in her mind. To her the only truth is what she sees right in front of her, in this moment. She has habits, sure, ways she is used to describing thing, but those aren't even things she consistently hold in her mind, more like recurring themes. You use those when writing her, in a way that feels natural. When does she say a Nargle did something? What does that actually mean to her? If you can understand that, you understand her.

So how the hell do you write that? Well, in the words of an ancient Zen master, "there's no method to it". You can't find a way to do it because you can't grasp what it is that makes her her. But that doesn't mean it isn't possible, you just have to not grasp anything while writing her. Everything Luna does, feels, sees, things, is entirely spontaneous. There's a situation and she has a line? Don't think! Write! You can never find anything to rely upon to make her make sense anyway! So just write her!

If you somehow feel like you can't do it, or it frustrates you. Well that's just your thoughts that are in the way of your spontaneity. You wanna know what Luna calls that? Wrackspurts. How do they go away? Do something spontaneous.

*** The easiest way I've found is to write her in action, without exposition. Work her plans from the end and write in reverse.
