  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

The Dursley are adamant that there is no magic, that the sheriff secret police says so, or else. anyway. It's probably nothing. After all if every mysterious thing happened is deemed magic then that's just being racist and rude.
