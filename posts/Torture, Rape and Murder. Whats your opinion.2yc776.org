Reading through some review of fics I personally enjoyed, I wondered how you guys stand to the three big ones, Torture, Rape and Murder.

The Reviewers aren't shy with accusing the author of being a psychopath for elaborating on a scene with these three crimes in it, no matter how important the scene is for the story.

My thought is that these people maybe don't like reading about their favourite character being tortured into insanity. However, I deem it a necessary thing, especially for fics that turn characters 180Â°. I don't see a sane, unharmed Hermione ever becoming the apprentice of Bella Lestrange, for example. There needs to happen something huge that breaks her character and reforms it. Feeling sad or nauseas while reading it is good, in my opinion. You go down with the character and stand up with him again. This time either steeled by the experience or reformed into something new.

Anyway. Whats your opinion on the matter?


** I agree with you to a certain extent. The big 3 have their place in any storytelling medium, fic included. However, I also think authors need to be very careful in how they use them. It's very common for authors to use them as a crutch or unrealistically. For example, if Vernon tortured Harry for the entire time Harry lived with the Dursleys prior to going to Hogwarts, Harry's gonna be really fucked up for a long time. Some hugs from Hermione and a lemon drop from Professor Dumbledore aren't going to be enough to fix him.

That's my main concern with the big 3. If you think one is necessary in your fic, you'd better commit. I'm certainly not going to enjoy it happening, but I'll read a fic with one or all if they're done right. That requires a lot of writing experience and research, honestly.

*** Thank you. You bring a good point. It always bothered me in my re-readings of the originals that Harry never developed at least trust-issues, let alone any behavioral abnormalities that usually occur in abused children.

I catch me often enough healing the characters too quickly. I currently write on a dark Hermione fic to train this particular weakness of mine. She fucked up in chapter one and every time I catch myself making it better for her I go the other way and hit her with an even crueler fate.

***** Well, in that case I also had trust issues. I also never told any form of authority, not my teachers, not my parents, not anyone, anything because I was a hothead who thought he knew better anyway. In fact, I still don't like to tell authorities anything.

What I was talking about is for example the immediate trust in the fact that the big hairy half-giant that tells me I'm a wizard is probably te safe way to go. Maybe thats not the best example, though, since I cannot imagine a way in which it would be a good thing to go with a stranger, evil relatives or not.

******* I never was in the situation, fortunatly. So I wouldn't know. I just figured that a hairy, half-giant/superhobo that tells me I'm a wizard isn't exactly something I would latch onto, child or not. But then again, I'm pretty sure the Dursleys never told Harry not to go with the uncle that gives him candy in a van.

And: true. I mean, its not like I expect a novel tailored to my age when I re-read HP. But its still fun to read it having the knowlenge of an adult.

I read fiction and watch films to /escape/ and /forget/ the horrors of the world, not to revel in them... but I solve this, by, you know, /not/ reading or watching that stuff. It's personal taste, and I always dislike when people spout off their personal taste as objective truth. No, writing or even enjoying graphical content for it's literary value doesn't make you a sick fuck (even getting off on it doesn't, fantasy is fantasy), it just isn't for me.

** Murder: No problem.

Torture: As long as it doesn't turn into over-the-top torture-porn, sure.

Rape: I don't think most authors can handle rape appropriately in stories, they seem to use it as a plot device either so the male hero can get revenge on his love interest's rapist, or so that the main character has a "tragic" backstory / story. So I don't particularly like seeing it in stories, especially in graphic detail, unless there is a VERY good reason and it's handled appropriately afterwards.

Also, I read one published novel that had the lead character almost get raped ever other chapter, so it got very old very quickly. As if that's the only bad thing they think could happen to their lead female character.

*** Well, the 'best' (gods, thats a horrible word in this context) situation for rape is, in my opinion, if you need to break the protagonists defiance and make him submissive. Torture just breaks someone, rape, however, goes deeper into the core of a person and destroys them in a way that physical torture never could.

I gotta agree that rape is often used as a lazy plot device, and I already edited my own fic because I catched myself doing exactly that, even though I do not want her to have the after effects of rape on her.

** I'm in much the same opinion as you are when it comes to those scenes. If it's furthering the story I understand why it's there. These are all things that are a part of war also, I understand why writers utilize such events. It really brings home how awful war is. I can't stomach a rape scene though. It physically makes me sick, I'll usually skim over that chapter when reading. I understand why it's there and I don't get upset with the author for it, I just really can't read it.

I had a near rape in my fic and I had a lot of readers PMing me and reviewing begging me not to let it happen. I never planned on allowing it to happen, but yeah you're right there is a great amount of people that are very vocal about such scenes.

** I don't really mind murder, but torture and rape bother me, especially when it's being done to characters I like. You can say that it's necessary to the story, but I don't think most writers can use it effectively. Even professional authors mess it up all the time and use it gratuitously. I dropped Codex Alera because it had gratuitous rape and magical slave collars perpetrated by a pointless side villain. I'm not going to touch Game of Thrones in any format since I've heard it has rape in it. If you want me to believe that the rape/torture scene in your story is necessary, then you need to write it better than most professional authors do. Otherwise, just leave it in the background and don't write it in excessive detail. And leave a warning in the chapter it occurs in so that I can at least skip it or drop the story. You can say that reduces the impact, but I don't want to be impacted by something so emotionally disturbing. Sometime I honestly just hate authors who write those scenes gratuitously.

I, for one, actually do. Draws me into the same abyss the character is in. I love it when I can literally feel the despair of the character. I guess its just such a rare feeling for me that I kinda enjoy the occasional rush that comes with it.

But I get that its actually a rare thing to enjoy this in a text. Normally people watch these things. Movies like SAW or Hostel are prime examples. Having to imagine these scenes might actually cross some borders for more people.

**** Perhaps I was pussyfooting a bit around the word 'particulars'. You can certainly describe the 'abyss' the character is in and the dread they're feeling. On the other hand, you shouldn't write about Death Eaters gang-raping Ginny or Hermione to find Harry's whereabouts in perverse detail. Leave some of the horror to the reader's imagination, because, frankly, it's better that way than delineating it all.

Torture is acceptable to write about as well, but you shouldn't write it as though you're taking sadistic pleasure out of it.

**** It's done either for angst, which is boring, or out of sheer sadism, which is boring.

And either way, it's been done in a hundred cookie-cutter fics already, so even if at some point it was interesting, it's long been beaten to death.

I mean, where can a fic go after the main character has been tortured? Either a) they're severely psychologically damaged, and you're left with a snivelling main character who repels you or b) they're strong enough to endure it/get over it, in which case, what was the point of doing it in the first place?

Not to mention the utter stupidly of the villain to keep their enemy alive for torture. It's right off the evil overlord list. Just finish them off immediately, and with it the story.

***** There are many ways where a character can go after he's severely damaged by torture. True, there is often the easy way out of a constantly whining protagonist. I gotta say, I'm not a fan of this either. I despise it really.

What I cherish, however, is when a previously naive character gets brutally thrown into the 'real world' and begins to act accordingly. Most of these characters develop a low or better, a matchingly low threshold for killing and using violence. Makes them horribly human. Its great for breaking the hero image and creating an anti-hero.

And there is of course a way to include torture logically. I always have a good laugh at the 'evil overlord monolgue' myself. But when they need intel from the protagonist, for example, then the whole thing starts to make sense.

** I think authors are willing to go a little bit further with their descriptions of these scenes when they're writing specifically for a teens and older audience since the the source material, written for even young children, has two of these crimes right at the heart of canon.

I understand why some people are squeamish about too much detail, but sometimes you need them to properly convey horror to an older audience.

** I think stories that have Torture, Rape, and Murder should always have a warning label, but they can be interesting plot devices if used correctly and tactfully. Personally, I don't like anything too detailed, but I love stories that address PTSD and depression and trauma, so it's a bit of a trade off. I'm not naive, I know what happens out in the real world, but sometimes I would just rather not have it shoved in my face.

Literally /anything/ can be a trigger, there is a comic floating around recently by a rape survivor who's trigger is the word /breakfast/ or descriptions of eating breakfast (because she cooked breakfast for her rapist the morning after). You know what my trigger is? Fucking Super Mario Bros. (it's not a story I feel like telling here, but usually I have to include this to avoid having my opinion summarily discarded).

I'm all for trigger warnings, but to let people just weed out shit they don't want to read, and not just for rape or sexual abuse either.

*** Worth posting this famous Reddit comment:

#+begin_quote
  We really need to talk about this "triggering" phenomenon. First off, let me give you my backstory: I'm a former Marine who's been diagnosed with PTSD. I've seen this commercial, in real life. Children who froze up from fear too near to a firefight, who end up getting maimed by shrapnel. Four years ago, this commercial would've been a "trigger" for me, and the results wouldn't just be hurt feelings. It would've been a night of downing whiskey, dip, beer and cigs until I passed out for a few hours, before the unavoidable nightmare made me jump out of bed.

  But here's the thing - I've identified my triggers, I've spent years in therapy, and I have a much healthier mindset now. Sure, I might still relate to this commercial and these experiences, but it's not going to ruin my day.

  Regardless, the last thing I would ever do is ask someone to modify THEIR behavior to prevent MY triggers. That's my albatross, and I'll carry it, not my family's, not my friends, and certainly not any online community. I find anyone who openly scolds people for triggering them must have one hell of an ego, to think that the world will bend to coddle them.

**** Agree with this very strongly. As a reader, you pick up from context what tone the fic will have, and if you don't like it, you drop it. It's not the writer's job to anticipate exactly what some subgroup of people will have a problem with and preemptively spoil their own story and warn them about it.

The big 3 should always have a trigger warning, even though saying at the beginning of the story that its extremely dark and often brutal should be enough for most people. I mean if I say this at chapter 1, do not expect it to change the whole story.
