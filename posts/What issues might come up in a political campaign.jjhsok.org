So, I've had an idea for this for a while now, somebody runs for minister in an election on the platform of repeal of the International Statute of Secrecy, Muggle Protection Act and I think I might add the repeal of the International Ban on Duelling. It also has a major overhaul of the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, so as to allow many new things. What might be the objections to such things? What esle could happen?


** So that guy tries to be the next Grindelwald? But does he have similar power to back up his goal? If not, he will be dog piled on and gang assaulted really quickly. If he ever makes it to the Minister for some ridiculous reasons, Wizarding Britain will be instantly attacked by everyone else. You think Britain can fight the whole world?

**** Well, if you get Elon Musk involved, you might as well try to go for a "Wizards in Space" story here.

If magic works in the outer space, that's actually the solution to the SOS problem. They can just create their new worlds and not worry about Muggles anymore.

Overturning SOS is just too much risk when space colonization becomes a far easier and more exciting option
