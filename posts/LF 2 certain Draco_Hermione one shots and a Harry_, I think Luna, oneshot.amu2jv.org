In one they're Head Boy and Girl and becoming friends, Hermione freaks out when she sees writing on his wrist as she thinks it's the dark mark, but actually it's a tattoo of her initials. In the second it's years after the war. Hermione has just been hired as a Hogwarts professor after been missing for years. Malfoy's kids are getting sorted and everyone's wondering who he had them with. During the reunion Malfoy floos into the teachers lounge and starts arguing with Hermione, their kids are there and Hermione ends up revealing she's their mother.

In the harry/??? one they get locked in a bathroom and end up confessing to each other and when Harry goes back to Gryffyndor tower him and Ginny end up talking, I think about her being the one to lock them in, and he tells her that one of her female friends likes her.

Thanks in advance


** The second one is Who Could've Thought That linkffn(8112505)

  "Enlighten me, Granger, as to why you are being referred to as Professor Granger." Sorting. A new professor. The children make new friends. And Hermione has something to reveal -- who is this mystery man of hers? DMHG

  ONE-SHOT. When she saw the line of black ink on his left arm, she always assumed it was the dark mark. HermioneXDraco.
