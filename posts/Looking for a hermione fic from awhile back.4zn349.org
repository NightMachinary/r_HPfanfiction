From what I can remember Hermione was Ravenclaw's daughter (And maybe Gryffindor or Slytherin's? I can't remember which was her father) and she, Ginny and Luna are trained by the founders to help defeat Voldemort. I can't remember what pairings there were. I know it isn't a ton to go on, but I have pregnancy brain at the moment and I just remembered this fic and would love to re-read it. Thanks in advance for any help!

  In which Harry discovers there is more to being the Heir of the Four Founders than than just having really cool tattoos. Powerful Harry, Multi-Ship. Post OOTP. No Slash.

** Oh. God, I just realized: if you do read this, don't read the sequel until after you've had your kid and you're past the hyper emotions of early mother-child bonding, there's a few scenes in the next story that will trigger on a new parent some serious emotional responses!

Edit: ... and i just remembered this story has a trigger that could really screw with a pregnant woman too...

*** I'll give it a read, doesn't look like the one I was looking for but I love finding new stories (: and thanks for the warning! Im on baby #2 so hopefully the warning won't be needed. I've seen some pretty crazy pregnancy fics (one with Hermione, James and Sirius comes to mind, she was pregnant by both of them at the same time)

Thanks again!
