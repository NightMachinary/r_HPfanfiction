Bonus for fics with minimal bashing. It seems like most fics where one of Harry's parents survive the attack on Halloween include plenty of bashing and even a somewhat arrogant/jerky Harry. Thanks


** i haven't read it but i heard this series is good:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/106703]]

James is POC and him and Lily raise Harry and have more kids and then I think it follows Harry on his journey to Hogwarts

They even work to have a good relationship with the Dursley's and stuff
