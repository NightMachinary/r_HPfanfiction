Perhaps I misunderstood it, but the end of HBP seemed to imply to me that Ron and Hermione would stay with Harry at the Dursleys, and when DH came out in was surprised it wasn't mentioned. Are there any fics like this?


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/]] was written before DH and I never read the whole thing, but the start has a plot involving Ron and Hermione at the Dursley's.

** I don't recall the end of HBP implying that. From what I remember, I think Ron and Hermione said they'd see Harry soon, meaning they'd pick him up from the Dursleys.

As for fics, I haven't come across any that have the Trio staying at the Dursleys.

*** Page 607 of my copy says:

"We'll be there, Harry," said Ron.

"What?"

"At your aunt and uncle's house," said Ron. "And then we'll go with you, wherever you're going."

**** Exactly, doesn't say anything about the Trio staying at the Dursleys. Just that they'll be there (the amount of time they would be there for is unspecified).

***** I mean, I only said implied. Someone saying "we'll be there at your aunt and uncle's house" implies, to me, anyway, that they'll stay there at least for a while. I was just interested to see if people knew of any fics where this had happened.
