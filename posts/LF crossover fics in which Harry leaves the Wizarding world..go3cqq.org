Hi there! I need fics in which Harry leaves the WW completely behind and the story focuses mostly on the crossover.

It could be before Hogwarts, or after the war. Heck, it could even be after Harry dies and is somehow reborn in a new Universe or something.

Crossovers can only include Naruto, Marvel(both MCU and X-Men), Stargate, Transformers, DC( but only tv shows), Game of thrones.

Thanks!


** Well.. one of the more absurd examples is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][/Lightning Dragon's Road/]], which does have him in the wizarding world for a while, but he also ends up doing a lot of globetrotting.

One of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729635/1/Through-the-Wormhole][/Through the Wormhole/]], which is a crossover where Harry basically emigrates from his home dimension, and winds up residing on Deep Space Nine(from the eponymous /Star Trek/ series)

EDIT

Sorry, didn't notice you only wanted those specific crossovers.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Hat Kid was a simple girl, finding her way back home with all Time Pieces in hand. But a nearby planet had other plans for her. Join Hat Kid as she journeys through a new world.
