Anyone got some suggestions?


** Have linkffn(a boon for bill by canoncansodoff) for your standard "Molly attempts to love-potion her kids and people who she wants to end up with them" fic.

You might wanna narrow down your request to a specific type of Molly-bashing tho.

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10089646/1/Prized][Prized]] has Molly bashing (along with bashing pretty much everyone on the "light" side.) It's a psychological horror fic until chapter 26, at which point it does an abrupt 180 and becomes a crack fic focused on fluff/smut. linkffn(10089646)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] has a Molly who is much less sympathetic compared to the books. I don't know if I would call it bashing, since her character is realistic and relatively close to canon. She penalizes Ginny for wearing fancy clothes that were gifts from her Slytherin classmates (according to her, Weasleys shouldn't accept charity), and she and Arthur blame Harry for breaking the blood wards around Privet Drive. linkao3(12608820)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Severus Snape's loyalty has always been to Harry, not to Dumbledore or the Order. When he finds out that Harry is a horcrux and Dumbledore intends to have him killed, Severus goes to the Dark Lord with the information in an effort to save Harry's life, and in doing so changes the fate of the world. Eventual slash, rating subject to change.

*** Is /Sarcasm and Slytherin/ the one with the ridiculous James-bashing which makes PoS look rather tame?

**** No? I've read up to chapter 27 of PoS, and from what I've seen PoS definitely has more extreme James bashing.

I get the impression that James in /Sarcasm/ has a rational behind-the-scenes reason for treating Harry the way he does. He's never going to be a candidate for father of the year, but his behavior is realistic compared to the outright hateful buffoonery of James in book 1 of PoS.

But maybe other readers view the two fics differently than I do? I'd be curious to see how others rate those two fics on the sliding-scale of James bashing.

** Can I just ask why? I'm genuinely curious why you would want to read about Molly characterization being bashed? I swear to god I'm not being sarcastic or anything. I really want to understand why. Like this women took care of SIX BOYS (not all the same time but six baby boys and then a girl for any amount of time is a lot. Urg baby throw up baby poop!) with only her hubby for help and let's face it Arthur's kinda of...a handful himself. So seven boys and a girl. She had to homeschool these kids too. I mean they weren't all at home at the same time but still that's a lot anyway.

I'm sorry I don't have any rec's for you. I could look but then I'd probably just find ones you've read already.

*** Not OP, but I'm curious to see some Molly bashing fics just because I haven't read many, and I'd like to see what well written ones might be like. I'm not particularly attached to any characters in the books, so I don't mind when they are written in non-canon ways.

As for what qualities might make people want to see Molly bashed:

People usually mention her mistreatment of Hermione in Goblet of Fire (Molly ostracized her based on lies in a gossip magazine), and some people interpret her attitude towards Sirius in OotP as victim blaming. There's also a scene in book 3 where she seems to condone the use of magical roofies (love potions).

**** Ahh Thank you that helps me understand a lot more. I wouldn't mind reading Molly bashing that's just not so blatant. Most bashing is so badly written. More like anti-Molly? Honestly as long as the plot for the story is interesting I'll read it. Most people focus on shipping instead of plot which annoys me. But what you can you do.

***** I don't like Molly for the stuff chiruochiba mentioned as well as the fact that she claims to care about Harry but then never follows up on her words. She does not inform the DMLE or the Police, nor does she visit Harry to threaten the Dursleys with disembowelment or something similar if they continue to mistreat Harry if she sees no legal alternative. In CoS she says that she suspects mistreatment and her sons mention clear signs of child abuse. And she does nothing that actually changes the situation. She happily lets a teenager sit alone with hateful relatives after traumatic events and then has the gall to claim that she cares.

HOWEVER

That does not mean that I want to read weird plots where she love potions everyone (Arthur might be canon, but the "Potion Queen" trope tends to overdo it). There is more than enough canon material to shit on her, no need to make her call Hermione a mudblood or rape drug everyone.

*** I usually don't enjoy bashing (especially the same old fanfictions where Dumbledore is a manipulative jerk) because it doesn't feel natural, like they'd take a character and completely turn it different from canon but there's something fun in Molly Weasley bashing. I'll be honest, I'm not really a big fan of her. If it's upto her, she'd keep all her kids in nappies and tell them stories of how there's no evil in world. I like Moody's quote quite a lot - “You need to what you're up against! You need to be prepared!”, this is something which she never bothered to do. Gred, Forge, Ron and Ginny really wanted some information about what's the Order is doing and they'd deserve it too, they're living in their headquaters, cleaning it and this is overlooked but they could've been at The Burrow doing their usual stuff, they deserve to know why they had to move to Grimmauld Place leaving their usual comforts, and as Remus said “It's better they get an overview from us, rather than some retarded version from somewhere else”. She always kept people in dark, something which I'm not fond of. This is also seen in PoA as well (not telling Harry about Sirius). Just like Remus allowed an overview, Harry should've known some things already rather than finding it out from somewhere else, like maybe not the Secret Keeper thing but the fact that Sirius is a childhood friend and such.

My opinions of her really hit rock bottom after these two things:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes" said Mrs Weasley her lip curling, "the thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?"
#+end_quote

It really was a low blow. She wasn't the living with Dementors for 12 years, not the one escaping Azkaban and swimming an ice cold water or living on dead rats and travelling with nothing but a hippogriff. And it's not like he wanted to go to Azkaban, she really should've thought about it before saying it.

#+begin_quote
  Percy's letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harry's and Ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee. Hermione's, however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.

  “Your mum doesn't read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?” she asked quietly.

  “Yeah,” said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. “Gets it for the recipes.”

  Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg

  “Hello, Hermione,” said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.

  “Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley's face.

  Harry looked between them, then said, “Mrs. Weasley, you didn't believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione's not my girlfriend.”

  “Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley “No - of course I didn't!”

  But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.
#+end_quote

Hermione looking sadly at her egg was, for some reason, so heartbreaking for me, how she has lived with them for two years, yet she easily thought that the article is true. I think the worst part, for me, is not that she talked to her stiffly but the fact that she openly showed that she thinks less of her by sending her a smaller egg. Even if you're upset with her, it seems petty and childish to openly show that. And then she goes off to lecture Amos Diggory about how Skeeter is a liar and you shouldn't believe a word of her, even though she herself believes it.

And the fact that she overreacts a lot, like Gred and Forge's ambition of opening a joke shop. Maybe I'm just weird (and I don't deny it because my favourite character is Snape) but I'm just not a big fan of her. She saying that it isn't upto Sirius to decide what's good for Harry even though Sirius is his godfather not Molly, so he's the one who's supposed to decide it. And the fact that in the end, Harry has to know the information anyway, there's no point hiding the prophecy from him. The most laughable thing I found in the whole encounter is “He's just a boy”, which really is a bad argument. He has done more things than majority of the Order combined - fighting Quirrellmort, a basilisk, then Dementors and then Voldemort himself.

At the end of the day, as Dumbledore said that it's our choices, you can choose to like her (which I have no problem with, I also think the duel with Bellatrix is one of the most epic scenes in the entire seven books) or dislike her.

*** She did had more family available before the end of the first blood war and most of the kids went through their nappies during that time. Also Muriel was very fond of the Bill and Charlie so she may have been a common face in their household in their early years.

Also, I guess magic is helpful for this, a few waves and all messes cleaned up and fixed.

I'm not saying she didn't had a lot of work taking care of so many kids, the truth is that we don't really know enough, and from what we do know it isn't very hard to twist her into a horrible mother or individual.
