So I've had this prompt in my head for a while now.

What is when harry is little, he picks up the newspaper for Vernon, but he catches a glimpse of an article about the pac man ghosts and mentions their names (Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde). When Harry is eventually sent back to his cupboard he remembers the names, and says them out loud. Once he gets to Blinky however, a Potter house elf appears before him.

IDK i just thought it would be a cool way for story writers to get harry out of that household a little early
