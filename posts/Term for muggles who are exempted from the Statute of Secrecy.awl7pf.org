Squibs are children of magical parents who don't have the ability to use magic.

Muggles are children of people who don't have the ability to use magic and who also don't have the ability to use magic.

Half-bloods have varying definitions, but for now they are those who can do magic, have a muggle as one parent the other parent is magical.

Muggleborns are children of muggles (d'oh) who can use magic.

Those are the genetic definitions. There's also the cultural aspect, where you go into "muggle-raised" and the other kind of half-blood, where you are born to a family with at least one parent who was muggle-raised, and thus your culture is "contaminated." E.g. Harry if his parents had lived.

That's all fine though, more or less. My issue is that Hermione's parents are still just.... muggles. Now, I know culturally the wizards have generalized contempt for them all, and don't distinguish much. One could argue they might as well just be regular muggles, with how little rights they have in the wizarding world. But there's a /huge/ issue with this, because they have one /huge/ distinction legally and culturally.

They are muggles who are exempted from the Statute of Secrecy. That's... momentous. Regardless of cultural differences and suffrage exclusion and disenfranchisement in general, they aren't obliviated for knowing that the wizarding world exists. So they aren't strictly muggles.

Socially, they're lower in status than squibs, though. And while they really are the exact same (non-magic users who can know about magic) there is enough social distinction that they merit a separate term.

But what? Any ideas? I'm working on my fanfic and I need a term for 'em, but I'm kinda stuck. The best I've come up with is...

Squibbles.

***** Very helpful! I have a prodigious vocabulary, but several of those I'd never seen before. My main research will be into their coinage and provenance, now. I jettisoned "mugwump" as a thing in my AU as soon as I started it, lol, because it makes absolutely zero sense for an international wizarding organization to use a slang derivative of an anglicized native American word. So yeah, I might use the French as the legal term, but colloquially use a British derogatory term. I'm leaning towards numpties or nits at the moment, hehe.

** Muggles in the Know.

Very simple and covers all cases (spouses, blood relations, Prime Ministers, etc). Inspired by the book /The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know/, even though /Muggles Who Notice/ is more recent and seems to be closer to the topic (though I think it's covering muggles who independently discover the Wizarding World (and are thus obliviated)).

This term specifies them as a subset of muggles, so anti-muggle charms would still work --- which makes sense, because what elitist wizard would want a muggle, even one aware of magic, to wander into Diagon Alley?

A clunky name is understandable if it's never used enough to justify a shortening, and I doubt this term is used very often, except in the spells detecting breaches in the Statute of Secrecy.

** This one of the most common mistakes, IMHO. Half-bloods are NOT those who have one parent magical and other non-magical. Half-bloods in the JKR world follow (and that's IMHO canonical) standard of the horse breading. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purebred][purebreds]], who have ALL ancestors purebreds, and half-breds who have any ancestor which is not purebred. In the same manner magical purebloods have ALL ancestors purebloods (to some number of generations), there are muggleborns who have no known magical ancestors, and half-bloods who are somewhere in between. Brutal majority of all wizards and witches are half-bloods, but many of them even don't remember the last non-magical ancestor. You don't have to invent muggle grandmother for Dumbledore, just to have him half-blood.

*** I see your point. My concept is that there are varying conflicting standards for what moves you from pureblood to halfblood. The Sacred 28 would be the most strict (pedigreed you might say). Legal definitions might be much less strict. Each person would adhere to a standard that conforms to their political or ideological preferences. There's not one conclusive definition in my AU. It's rather an in-universe point of contention, actually.

*** *Purebred*

Purebreds, also called purebreeds, are cultivated varieties or cultivars of an animal species, achieved through the process of selective breeding. When the lineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed.

The term purebred is occasionally confused with the proper noun Thoroughbred, which refers exclusively to a specific breed of horse, one of the first breeds for which a written national stud book was created since the 18th century. Thus a purebred animal should never be called a "thoroughbred" unless the animal actually is a registered Thoroughbred horse.

** Bloodless, or perhaps Mud.

Because I don't think a term to differentiate muggles that get to know from those who don't would be a kind term. Pure-blood, half-blood, muggle-born (mudblood) sets up a naming system. But muggles who dare to show up for their magic children, who are seen as less than and also culturally invading, would get a name worse than what we call their children.

The average which or wizard is not likely to regularly encounter or think about muggles, and any muggles they do encounter don't merit a distinguishing word. They know about magic or they wouldn't be standing there, sort of thing.

I also don't imagine the ministry being so organized as to check for muggles aware of magic when acting in the muggle world. Something magically blows up, they'd obliviate everybody, not check for exemptions, so no need for official vocabulary.

  "[...] I saw dementors running ---”

  “Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don't run, they glide.”

  “That's what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.”

  “What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle's edges disappeared into her flesh.

  “Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny ---”

  “No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors . . . describe them.”

  “Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. “They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”

  Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air.

Chapter 8, OotP (US epub)

Muggles and squibs can definitely feel them, but neither can see them. I think the entirety of the difference between the two is that wizards create spells specifically to repel muggles, not squibs or non-magicals as a whole.

  1 The incantation to the muggle-repelling charm is /repello muggletum/.\\
  2 Magic can respond to human concepts.^{[citation needed]}\\
  3 Squibs are non-magicals with at least one magical parent.\\
  4 Muggles are non-magicals with non-magical parents.\\
  5 Squibs are easiest to identify via lack of a Hogwarts acceptance letter.\\
  6 Harry doesn't notice the Leaky Cauldron until it's pointed out.^{[negligible support]}\\
  7 Hermione uses the muggle-repelling charm in conjunction with disillusionment.\\
  8 Muggle-repelling charms are a possibly-valid reason no one comes near their campsite.\\
  9 Hogwarts is bewitched to appear as a ruin to muggles.\\

#+end_quote

From 1, we can assume the muggle-repelling charm specifically repels muggles. From 3 and 4, we learn the only canonical difference (that I know of) between muggles and squibs. From 2, we know that the only difference needed to exist between the two is that wizards recognize that difference. From this, and Occam's Razor, muggle-repelling charms repel only muggles.

From 5 we know that common elements of the Wizarding World work identically for wizards and squibs. "Common elements" can be assumed to include muggle-repelling charms, since wizards like secrecy. This indicates squibs are not affected by the charms. If we assume prior knowledge matters, all a wizard would have to do is bring the child somewhere new, or create a new charm on something like a random tree, to differentiate a squib and a wizard.

From 6, it can be assumed that the "notice-me-not" effects wizards and muggles alike, and therefor the muggle-repelling charm acts in a dissimilar way. From 7, we know it isn't invisibility. From these and 8, we have good reason to believe it keeps muggles out of an area.

From 9 and 10, the only muggle-oriented charm we know of on Hogwarts does not obstruct Filch in the course of his duties.
