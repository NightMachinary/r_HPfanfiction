** I like canon-compliant stories, so most of my favorites are Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. I don't know what you mean by "not too long", but here's a Percy/Audrey that's complete. linkffn(4800046)

If you are looking for canon-complaint, but not main characters, I'll recommend James/Lily. There's a lot of romance stories out there featuring them. If you go on FF.net and search for that pairing sorted by favorites, you'll find most of the ones that people will recommend. Here is my personal favorite, unfinished: linkffn(5200789)

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  Percy is given an untidy and absent minded assistant named Audrey Larrabee to help promote himself in the Ministry. Will he be able to handle her seemingly complete apathy for the Ministry? Or will she be able to help him in ways he never dreamed of?

** You want a fic with Harry or Hermione, but that doesn't have either of them in a pair?

Or are you looking for fics that don't feature Harry or Hermione as the protagonist?

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  It has been Severus Snape's greatest wish to go back and fix his life with Lily. What happens when he suddenly gets the chance, remembers everything, and has changed enough to avoid Slytherin? Marauder-era, pre- and established Severus/Lily. 50/50 COMPLETE!

** First fic that springs to mind is linkffn(dumbledore's army and the year of darkness), an in-cannon telling of Neville, Luna and Ginny (mostly Neville) time during the trio's quest for the Horcruxes. Really, really good fix with some sweet romance.
