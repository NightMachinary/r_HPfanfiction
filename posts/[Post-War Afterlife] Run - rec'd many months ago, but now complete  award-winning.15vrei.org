** Run! is a truly amazing story. I sort of know the author from HPFF and she's awesome. Can't recommend this enough'

** I read a bit of it when it began, but I wasn't able to keep up with it and I really wanted to properly recommend it to people. I've just finished reading it and I regret waiting so long to catch up; I think this is the best novel-length HP fic I've ever read. I'm going to copy paste most of what I blathered on in a rec of mine that I posted elsewhere:

  It's so much more than just a race, which is what I think a lot of people might assume from the banner/initial summary. This is a fic about living after death, about moving on, and even growing up. Post-war is my favorite era, because that's when we get to see most of the characters we loved from the books growing up. We don't get to see that happen for the ones who are dead usually, in fic. But here, we do, and it's so satisfying from start to finish. This world is like JKR's, and it could fit right in. It's my headcanon now! But it's also so utterly unique that it doesn't stale, and there's a bit of mystery and great adventures (that is what death is!), and I can't say anything more without spoiling.

  I already knew Sarah's an awesome writer, but I am still sitting in my bed shocked at how brilliantly she wove everything together, with a zillion plotlines that I all cared about. It's long. You may be wary of stepping into Cliodna's Clock at first. But trust me and everyone who voted for it in the Dobbys: it's worth it and more.
