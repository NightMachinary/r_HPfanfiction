Suggest your best, well-written fanfics, which include non-magical combat -- i.e. hand-to-hand, guns etc. (Bonus: Fics that have enchanted weaponry, akin to Dresden's .44 magnum).

Additionally, suggest any fics where Harry (or any other main character) does not use Potterverse wanded magic, but instead utilises alternative magics. For example, Harry doesn't rely (or even have) a wand; he manipulates mystical-dimensional energy via hand motions to create the effects of magic (i.e. Doctor Strange). Bonus: Someone besides Harry, like Padma, is akin to the Sorcerer(ess) Supreme of the Marvel Universe, with the power and skill that makes Voldemort into a trivial problem, at best.


** Linkffn(Rise of the Dragon Child) Harry learns Tamrielic magic along with swordplay, archery, and of course, the Thu'um.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8775833/1/Per-Ardua-Ad-Astra][Per Ardua ad Astra]] a SG:Atlantis crossover and it's side fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] a NCIS crossover set in the same universe as Per Ardua are good. the premise is that in expelling Voldemort from his mind in OotP Harry loses his magic but gains the ability to sense and manipulate the air, basically controls the weather, and joins the RAF. The author was applying/is in the Royal Navy and has studied Military history so his knowledge of military tactics and how modern fights are played out is pretty good, and his writing of the combat is very enjoyable. I've never watched any of any of the StarGate shows or read any of the SG fan fictions but i found Per Ardua to be easily readable without any prior knowledge.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source) /edit, since the Bot preview doesnt really tell you much:

Harry Potter does not grow up at the Dursleys. Instead he is adopted by Chiun of Sinanju. He becomes Sinanju and learns their Martial Arts.

Hope you enjoy it.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

** I've written a few stories where muggle weapons and hand-to-hand play a significant role. A few use enchanted guns, too - though just in the "silenced, cooled, recoilless gun with infinite ammo" role, not in the "shoots magic bullets" role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl]["Harry Potter and the Spygirl"]]: Mostly British weapons from the 80s used James Bond style.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined]["Divided and Entwined"]]: Modern small arms and explosives as well as military tactics used in a guerilla-style civil war alongside magic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution]["Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution"]]: Military and Mages fighting side by side, including enchanted small arms and vehicles, in a more conventional war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]: Naval action, WW2 style - sort of. Including shore bombardment. Magic's more in a support role, the war's fought with naval weapons.
