:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find a fic I read ages ago where canon Harry takes the place of an arrogant alternate Harry who's had fame go to his head while alternate Harry wakes up with the Dursleys.

I remember alternate Harry having parents and a sister. Pretty sure he's prejudiced against Lupin and says to the Dursleys something along the lines of "How dare you speak like that to the Boy-Who-Lived".

Also fairly sure the swap happens when canon Harry wishes he had a decent family while alternate Harry's sister wishes she had a better brother and both get fulfilled.

If it helps at all, I also think I found it initially from a post about if Harry was just as bad as Snape thinks.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

Warning: the story is abandoned. Nothing that interesting happens in the 22 chapters completed so far (chapter 23 is just an author's note), but at least there are no unresolved cliffhangers either.

** Don't know this one, but reminded me of a fic where canon harry swaps places with Harry in a world without magic. Everyone is just normal, he goes to a highschool, and Voldemort is a pastor while Dumbledore is an eccentric priest. Potters are alive of course and sirius teaches Harry how to fix vehicles. It was a Drarry IIRC

#+begin_quote
  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.
