:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this fanfic I read a few years back where a pregnant Severus is sent to live with the Potters for his saftey. Lily was nearing the end of her pregnancy and he was at the beginning. I remember they kept the baby daddy a secret for part of the fic and then they reveal that the father is Regulus (who they think is dead but turns out to be alive). The last thing I remember is that Severus was always reading Alice in Wonderland and it ends up having to do with how they find Regulus. I would really apreciate it if anyone remembers the name of this fic.


** What the fuck? I want to read this now. for morbid curiosity reasons but. What the fuck?
