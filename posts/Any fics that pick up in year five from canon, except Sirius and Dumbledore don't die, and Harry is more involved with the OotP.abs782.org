Sirius and Dumbledore can die, just don't tell me about it, and make sure it's different from how they die in the books. I'm looking for a fic where there is a more prolonged war with Voldemort. I really dislike the turn books six and seven took, and would prefer to read something else, such as Harry making it to seventh year while still in the war(just an example, don't only recommend this specifically or I'll know what happens).

If anything rings a bell, but doesn't fit completely, feel free to mention it anyway. The only rule I have is no slash. And the longer the story(es) the better.

*** Obviously what I meant is you can ignore some rules if it fulfills most of my requests in spirit, but the only hard rule is no slash.

​

I don't know how you didn't get that. I literally sayed this before that sentence: " If anything rings a bell, but doesn't fit completely, feel free to mention it anyway. "

​

As for not recommending something specifically, I was referring to Harry completing seventh year while the war is going on. What I meant by that is for people not to misunderstand and only recommend these kinds of fics, and not any that don't fit this requirement.

​

I really don't know why you're giving me a hard time about this. I was very specific in the kinds of fics I'm looking for wide leaving a while margin for error.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
