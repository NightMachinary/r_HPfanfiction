**** Hmm... I see you've changed the title of this to include obscurial. I was going to recommend a fic in which Harry was abused, but he's not an obscurus, so....

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

******** This is one of my two favourite ongoing fics. The writing is fantastic! I hope you enjoy it. It's starts off a bit trope heavy, but really comes into its own.

**** I liked Serpentine (linkao3(31884009)) whose main topic is Harry having a basilisk, but the abuse theme is present, and it is how he gets the basilisk in the first place.
