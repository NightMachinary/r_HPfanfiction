Is there any fic about Harry time traveling, meeting his parents either at Hogwarts or during the War, and being upfront about his identity? The whole secrecy thing has been done about 500 times and I'm kind of done with it. Or a Harry time travel (or any one else, really) story in which the time traveler actually does something to change history/better the wizarding world. Thanks!


** Oof I'm in the same boat. I'm sick of all these time travels fics with secrecy or the future not changing at all.

***** I like the theory of, if you went back in time, the timeline is destroyed and recreated anew.

​

Meaning that there is no way to return to what once was, because time traveler being there changed it.

****** My favorite, and the one that generally seems to be used in universe (and in Artemis Fowl, which introduced me to the idea), is that if time travel is going to be performed, it essentially /already has been/. Think, like, Harry saving himself from the dementors - Harry is saved because Harry goes back and saves himself, and that's paradoxical if you don't accept the timeline as fundamentally unchangeable - at least in this manner.

Time travel fics usually break all the rules right from the get go, though, which is fine. As others have said - I ain't reading these just to get a rehash of canon with slightly different dialogue. I want to see CHANGE. If the timeline was really going to implode because things happened differently, that'd be the case five minutes after said time travel occurs.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** !linkao3(face death in the hope by LullabyKnell)

It's exactly that. Harry doesn't die in the forrest, is sent back in time, meets his parents and immediately tells them who he is and they go hunt horcruxes.

It's a lot of introspection and dealing with the consiquences of this but I do reccommend it it's very good!

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim) is a good one, as time traveler Harry does everything possible to send the story off the rails. He isn't too upfront about his identity mostly because he doesn't spend long enough in any one place to actually hold a meaningful discussion with anyone though.

I will note that this fic is best described as intense. VotN writes very good battle scenes that tend towards the horror and gore end of the spectrum.

I also haven't seen this fic rec'd in quite some time (by anyone except myself, anyways) but it was very popular on this sub a while back so there is every chance you've seen it before.

** Stepping Back - Harry back to marauder's era. James finds out almost immediately, Lily later.

Wind Shear - 20-year old Harry goes back to the first war. He doesn't tell anyone, but he definitely changes things.

Timely Errors - Harry back to marauder's era. Turns out to be a stable time loop, depending on if you consider that changing things or not.

Many Thanks - Hermione travels to marauder's era and immediately goes to Dumbledore. James POV, he has a very limited understanding of what's going on.

We are the Golden Trio! - The Trio return to just before first year.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** Currently reading Timely Errors on your recommendation. I'm really enjoying it!! I also hate Thursdays 😋

It's a fun tone. I'm really interested to see why Sirius is being so weird and the DADA teacher is throwing up some interesting controversy and Harry having all this weird ward magic is very very cool. I'm sad it's only 13 chapters.
