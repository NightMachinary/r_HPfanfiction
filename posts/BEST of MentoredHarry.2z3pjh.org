Post your favorite Mentored!Harry fanfics. I'll start with my favorites - I haven't found better ones than these. I'm looking for more, though!

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light%5D][*/By the Divining Light/*]] - /Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][*/Conlaodh's Song/*]] - /Book 2. As the Second War begins, Voldemort becomes obsessed with harnessing the realm of Old Magic to his own ends.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][*/Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë/*]] - /Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing./

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][*/Magics of the Arcane/*]] - /Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Because surrounded by giants, there is no choice but become one yourself if you want to keep on living. [GoF, Mentor!Albus]/

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][*/Bungle In the Jungle - A Harry Potter Adventure/*]] - /If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759007/1/Turn-Me-Loose-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][*/Turn Me Loose - A Harry Potter Adventure/*]] - /The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?/

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][*/The Denarian Renegade/*]] - /By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord][*/The Denarian Lord/*]] - /Lord Voldemort readies for war while Albus Dumbledore seeks peace- through any means necessary. At the same time, Harry Potter moves to eradicate the Order of Blackened Denarius. In the middle of this is the Winter Lady, whose motives remain unknown.../

After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone./

 

 

And now I'll shamelessly self-promote the fic I'm writing. I would love some feedback. Certainly not up there with the best, but as I said, this is a shameless self promotion. I have no shame, truly. I should be ashamed, but I'm not.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11007761/1/Worth-It][*/Worth It/*]] - /Follow Harry through a journey of epic proportions as a bit of extra ambition influences the rest of his life. There are men, and then, there are titans. Will become VERY AU. (Looking for beta) (Non-slash, no pairings)/


** By the divining light has the best mentor Dumbledore of all time in my opinion.

Anyway for your request,

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7017751/1/Harry-Potter-Rise-From-Dust][Harry Potter Rise from Dust]] - Haven't read it in a while but from what I remember it was at least decent. Merlin mentors Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6947125/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] - Sherlock Homes mentors Harry.

** I read a really good story based around the concept, it is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave behind]]. The story is still early on in its development yet all the concepts are believable and it gets me to care about the characters witch i find that may story's in this theme.

As stated there are several main divergences from cannon that have interesting consequences, that include;

1)Ariana survived the Grindelwald/Albus/Aberforth duel, and thus the history of Grindelwald's rise and fall is significantly different than canon.

2) Harry was born exactly one year earlier, and is thus one year ahead of his canon self - he's in the same year as Cho Chang and Katie Bell.

3) Sirius Black's trip to Azkaban was much shorter, as detailed in the prologue.

And all this is explored in exquisite detail it is also a Harry/Fleur story, but there is very little interaction so far and seems to be well paced and not an overriding theme in this story so far.

Overall the story is amazing so far and i would highly recommend it to anyone even if you are sick of these cliche's give this story a chance. the first chapter is a bit jarring but once you get past that it is just high quality writing from their on in.

** I am not a huge fan of Mentor!Dumbledore. Not enough conflict between Mentor and Mentee for my tastes. Mentor!Voldemort on the other hand........\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] : An AU in which Voldemort wins the first war. Amazing worldbuilding and characterizations. It has its flaws -- the work is unbetaed and the author keeps on adding subplots and extra characters that gets hard to keep to track of, but in the end its still one of the greatest pieces of fanfiction there is. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]] : Pettigrew kidnaps Harry instead of leading Voldemort to the Potters. Voldemort raises Harry as his Dark Prince. Probably showing its age by now, but I loved it when I read it the first time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702269/1/Do-Androids-Dream-of-Electric-Sheep][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10170838/1/The-Counterfeit-Cousin][The Counterfeit Cousin]] both have mentor!Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] has an OC necromancer mentor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]] has Grindelwald as Harry's Mentor. It is abandoned though.

*** I've always said that you never know if Escape is abandoned.

I updated Unlocked Knowledge after a five year hiatus - you just never know. I actually think like 3/4 of a chapter of Escape is written, so it might be easy to pick it up again if I get the urge ;)

** [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice Potter]] followed by Journeyman Potter and Master Potter by Draco664. It's very old, and some might say it hasn't aged well, but I still find it very entertaining.

The last part of the trilogy is incomplete and abandoned though.
