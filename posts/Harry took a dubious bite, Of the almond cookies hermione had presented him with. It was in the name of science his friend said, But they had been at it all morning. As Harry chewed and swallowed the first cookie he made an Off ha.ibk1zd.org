She smiled and said, “ Oh I know I had to add extra almonds to cover the Pungence scent t of the cyanide I added. I'm glad you like the recipe. You should be dead in a minute.”

​

With that harry mentally groaned and waited for the convulsing. Hermione was right he was dead and 62 seconds.

​

The Granger girl his dear friend started her stopwatch after his heart stopped beating. 46 seconds 47 seconds 48 seconds.

She hit the stop button when she heard Harry gasping, 49.28 seconds. She nodded and jotted down the data in her notebook along with the other experience results.

​

as she looked at the Potter Scion , Currently sitting up and gasping for breath she made a note in an offhand remark,” Your resurrection rate has gotten Incrementally faster.” I think it's something you're going to have to practice to get it down to under 10 seconds like Quidditch or Your time with Ginny.”

​

harry just glared at her and grabbed another cookie. Quietly grumbling under his breath that this had better be worth it to get back Sirius.


** "Bone of father, god Hermione, you know that James' body hadn't fully decomposed? I had to boil the flesh off!" Ron said, dropping the bone unceremoniously into the pot. "Blood of enemy...wasn't it kind of Malfoy to donate some blood, Harry?"

"Sure was, Ron. Poor Malfoy, tripping and falling on a knife in the middle of the hallway," Harry said, in a homonculi that had been hastily conjured the trio had found out that horcruxes only preserved one's spirit and not body.

"And flesh of servant," Hermione said as she peeled some of her skin off before quickly applying dittany. "You owe me a case of butterbeers, Harry!"

"Weren't you the one that wanted to try killing me?" Harry asked indignantly.

Edit: Instead of "she peeled some of her skin off", an alternative could be "she peeled some of Dobby's skin off".

Props for a good prompt. I'd note that Hermione would probably use a more potent (magical) poison, though, as mundane venoms and poisons don't pose lethal threats to wizards. It'd probably just hurt Harry a lot.

Comments on my response for those interested in what I see as the long-term ramifications:

The poison would probably mean Harry's body becomes inhospitable for his spirit and that he'd become a spirit as well, hence the resurrection ritual. Long term, it'd probably be a disadvantage as Harry would lose his mother's sacrifice, meaning that because Voldemort and him no longer share blood and Harry's mother's sacrifice, Voldemort can kill Harry.

Because JKR detailed her thoughts on healing when she was writing about it in the books.

Edit: Also because Harry survived an impact that would have fragmented a muggle's head with only a cracked skull, and then also survived a fall with a cracked skull. Dumbledore grew up in the 1800s when safety measures around chemicals were lax and was doing a perfect breaststroke at 115 with a dead hand.

***** Where's that from? It's not in the series. Pottermore?

Also, surviving impacts that would crack a skull - or surviving injuries that would leave people braindamaged or dead - is something that happens in almost every action movie. Few authors or directors actually care for realism in that area. See: "Knocking out enemies". Not to mention that a scorpion's sting can greatly vary in strength.

****** Car crashes tend to be dangerous, even in the most gung-ho action film, yet the thought of a wizard dying to one is impossible. People don't comfortably live past 200 years either. It may very well vary, but the point is that a scorpion sting that /would/ kill a muggle would be comfortably survived by a wizard. 115 year olds with dead hands don't tend to be swimming either.

The point is that the impact wouldn't even crack a muggle's skull. It'd be an instant death. I've seen lesser blows that have led to death. The bludger would have killed a muggle on impact. It merely cracks Harry's skull and makes him fall. Corresponding injuries on a muggle (from a less-severe accident) would be fatal as well.

So yes, given that a venom that would kill a muggle won't kill a wizard and that a wizard at 115 can pull off a perfect breaststroke, Hermione would be better off with a magical poison. Or just a far more efficient, if less dramatic, killing curse or spell of choice to the back.

Edit: Additional evidence that I found with a quick comb-through the books. Lionfish spines are used as potions ingredients (GoF). Lionfish venom can be fatal, and certainly are unpleasant. They're given to 13 (Harry runs out before 4th year) year olds to use. I believe, from your previous comments I've seen, that you may excuse this away by saying that Hogwarts is simply negligent. I disagree, but in any event, I'd note that we never hear of anyone needing the hospital wing for them. Hellebore is also toxic. Aconite has been used to kill people. Belladonna as well, yet it's a school ingredient. No one dies in 7 years at Hogwarts, and some of them are 11. If my high school lab had let all teenagers free access to the chemical room, someone would have died. Hell, some of them got into the hydrogen peroxide and started (no joke) splashing around in it. They ended up with minor chemical burns.

You seem to be selective with what you respond to as well. Falls can break bones and falls can kill wizards. I never disagreed, but it's clear the falls must be more extreme than the ones that kill muggles. After all, no muggle would survive what Harry did. Harry did, allowing his mundane broken bones to be healed.

Where's the response to Dumbledore's capabilities? To the lack of deaths from potions ingredients? To Griselda marchbanks and Dippet? To the phrase that's comfortably survive and not comfortably cure?

And I disagree about "Falls needing to be more extreme" - if that were the case, non-magical fistfights wouldn't break wizard bones, or every wizard would be so strong that muggleborns would be detected by accidentally crushing the skulls of their playmates when play-punching them, or wrecking doors and cribs and house-hold appliances.

********** Dogs don't live to 60, no matter how much money people spend on their health care. People still die of old age, so it's clear that healing in this regards is limited. Newt directly states that muggle physiologists are different and offers Jacob a helmet that he himself, though you may not consider that canon.

The inconsistency with numbers favors my argument. Dumbledore was originally 150. In any event, there's a clear consistency of increased ages that cannot be explained away by this argument. 12 years is also a much smaller gap than the big gap between 78 and 115.

Resiliency is not the same as strength. Bones still break yes, resiliency means that they're less likely to break and it's much harder for mundane means to kill them. And it's pretty clear, they do have to be more extreme. Harry's accident in half blood prince would be a trip to the morgue for a muggle. Again, I've seen accidents less severe where people died.

And yes, if you gave lethal poisons to 11 (very least 13) year olds to own personally and store in locations next to them, there will be accidents. Especially if they're not aware or forget some ingredient's lethal nature. As I've already stated, much older teenagers do far worse than accidentally ingest poisons, they actively do so.

And you miss my point: If your bones are less likely to break, you need more strength to break them in a fistfight. A lot more if you take the "enchanted cannonballs don't hurt them" as an actual fact and not some "JKR has no clue about physics" mistake.

************ Griselda Marchbanks, who oversaw Dumbledore's NEWTs, isn't. And I'd like to see a 115 year old do a perfect breaststroke with a dead hand. That wasn't sarcastic by the way, if I'm very wrong on the bounds of human age, I'd like to see a video of 115 year old swim through a frigid ocean and go rock climbing, all with a withered hand . Or a 115 year old do the other things Dumbledore does. So no, while people have lived to 115, it's not normal for them to live many years longer and for them to do things like swim.

Bones still break, even if they're more resilient. It's not exactly like they're that resilient in actual life anyway. I once broke my pinky toe from kicking a door, and I don't have any underlying issues and am in a healthy age range. So yes, I consider it plausible, even with increased resiliency, that a hard stomp on one's nose can break a nose. If Draco had killed Harry with that stomp or broken a stronger bone, I would most likely not hold to my theory regarding physical resiliency. In any event, it doesn't change the fact, that Harry survived something that would kill a muggle. I don't really see an inconsistency when she's consistent with increased lifespans, survivability of mundane injuries, and she's so consistent with increased resiliency that fantastic beasts shows it as well.

But most importantly, it's directly stated that wizards can shrug off poisons. JKR directly states that a venom that would kill a muggle can be comfortably survived by a wizard. Children play around with poisons for class and live. Regardless of how you interpret physical resiliency (and the implications of it such as increased age), Harry Potter would comfortably survive the cyanide. And Hermione would be better off with a magical poison.

************* "Might kill" is not the same as "would kill". And with poison, there's always the question of how much was applied. You can safely survive a minor dose, for example, while more will kill you.

The potion argument is not really convincing - at the same age the kids start at Hogwarts, I got to shoot assault rifles - under supervision. Same as the kids in potions class.

I'm just not buying the "JKR said Y, so that means X is also true" way of thinking. JKR sucks at consistent world building. Extrapolating stuff from what she introduced as a parody (Quidditch) or for jokes is on the same level as assuming wizards really shat on the floor where they stood after reading that one tweet.

************** Look, if your only argument is that JKR is a poor writer, I'm not sure we're going to get anywhere with this debate. Extrapolating from a direct quote regarding venoms is more than fair. I think I've presented a lot of evidence for my theory.

Did you get to bring the assault rifle home with you? Did you also get to bring cyanide home with you? Were you allowed to own them? Were you allowed free access to the medicine cabinet? To synthesize compounds from toxic substances in a laboratory at 13 with only one teacher to supervise? Did you use the toxic substances you took home and owned to create other compounds on your own? I was allowed to play with acid and other toxic substances, but I sure as hell wasn't allowed to keep them to myself. And I know teenagers that tried bathing in hydrogen peroxide, eating tide pods were once a thing, and someone, somewhere, got stabbed with the lionfish spine.

I'd like to think I've nicely resolved, multiple times at that, each of your doubts about the weight of my evidence. I've provided a consistent argument and have rebutted the evidence you've presented against my theory. I've explained misinterpretations of my theory. You've presented evidence that is simply incorrect, and often a matter corrected by common-sense. To say that a 115 year that can swim and go rock-climbing is within human norms is simply ridiculous. Or that a 132 year old (115+17 though I note that Griselda Marchbanks is most likely older) existed.

Your main argument is that JKR is simply a bad writer. Aside from the issue of the maliciousness behind that statement, I've also rebutted by showing how consistent JKR is on this issue, starting with the first book to the fantastic beast films. Half the time, you don't even respond to all the evidence I detail out.

It feels like your arguments are simply an attack on the books because you don't like the idea that wizards are more resilient. If that's the case, and I know you write fics, you're more than welcome to not use those ideas. That's the beauty of fanfiction!

*************** The studnets don't have access to all the ingredients - the trio had to steal some. So, no, I don't buy the "they regularly imbibe poison" argument. (And even if they did - the potions classroom has beozars handy, so that's not "they're immune" and more "they can be easily healed" since, again, it depends on the dose and few poisons kill you instantly.)

I got to take the assault rifle home over the summer, yes - at 15. With a stern warning "not to switch it to full-auto, like this". That's how it was handled in Switzerland in the 90s. Also, in the average household, there are a lot of toxic substances (and in far higher quantities than in a potions kit), yet we aren't immune to them.

My main argument is that if fistfights can break bones, then wizards aren't supernaturally tough. You simply cannot break bones that can resist a bludger with your fist. And growing old and in good health doesn't mean they're supernaturally tough either.

  Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit --- he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.
#+end_quote

Not all the ingredients, no. But they certainly got to take home the lionfish and belladonna. I never said that they regularly ingest poison but that accidents occur and someone would certainly have been injured. And I don't think Harry has bezoars in his potions kit or that the burrow has a potions lab complete with bezoars. And again, Harry would survive venom a muggle wouldn't.

Very impressive of Switzerland. Must have been an interesting childhood. I still think there's a different between a rifle and poisons which can be accidentally ingested far more often. In any event, the rifle comparison might still be apt, accidental gun deaths exist. A cursory search revealed gun deaths and accidents in Switzerland, even though it seems that the laws have been changed. Some wizard would have died from an ingredient accident if mundane toxins were lethal.

I've addressed the last point multiple times already.

And these are substances usually kept away from children, not given to them for them to use and get habituated to having around. Weren't you the one to say that dosage of poisons matter? Those potions ingredients and venoms certainly seem more lethal at lower dosages. Though, of course, I doubt their lethality to a wizard.

I'll repeat that saying JKR can't be trusted is a lazy and malicious argument. In any event, it clearly doesn't apply. There is no "JKR said one thing here and another thing in another case". She has been consistent on this issue from book 1, through pottermore, all the way to the fantastic beasts films. It doesn't take a physics PhD to intentionally write 115 year olds that can swim and rock climb and 132+ year olds that can walk.

And cyanide and scorpion venom work via similar mechanisms, namely via interference with biochemical pathways. In any event, under your view of JKR, venoms and poisons would be even more similar because they are conceptually and intuitively similar.

You went from kids can be trusted with poisons, which you drew a parallel to assault rifles, as they can with household substances which kill kids daily. Now you're saying that they only get nonlethal amounts, completely undermining your previous analogies?
