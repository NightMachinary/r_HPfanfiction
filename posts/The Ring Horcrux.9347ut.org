It was the Ring that cursed Dumbledore when he put it on, the Withering Curse, but was it the Ring, or the Stone itself that was the actual Horcrux? Did Voldemort even know he had the Resurrection Stone, or did he just think it was just a fancy family ring? He didn't really know about the Elder Wand til he followed a long path that led to Grindelwald, so I do wonder.


** The ring (in its entirety) held the Horcrux. Voldemort did just believe that it (like Marvolo Gaunt did) was a family hierloom, and he kept it because it was the bounty of his second - I think? - murder (his Muggle family, that he framed Morfinn Gaunt for) that signified him expunging the weak aspects of his heritage from his life.

Edit: Correction regarding who was murdered (I made a mistake)

*** Morfin wasn't killed, the Ring was made a horcrux using the murder of his paternal family, for which he framed Morfin, who died in Azkaban.

** It's believed that the stone counted as /part/ of the "ring", which, in its completeness, was the Horcrux. If you'd managed to dislodge the Stone from the golden band, this would have counted as destroying the Horcrux; but of course, this was nearly-impossible thanks to the supernatural protections; all you could do was cause damage to either the stone or the band (which Dumbledore did with the Sword of Gryffindor), which would release the soul-shard, and allow you to once more separate Stone and Band.

It's believed by Dumbledore that Voldemort /didn't/ know what the Resurrection Stone was. This does seem likely, as you'd think that otherwise, he'd have gotten some /use/ out of it rather than Horcrux if; and before someone mentions it, though he didn't have any /loved ones/ to call back, there are lots of /evil/ ways to exploit the Stone. As a neverending food source for his Dementor allies, for instance. (/Shudders/.) This, I think, is precisely why Harry dropped the Stone in the Forest rather than have it with him when Voldemort killed him, because /then/, the now more Hallow-savvy Voldemort might have known it for what it was.

Nonetheless, I don't think Voldemort thought it "just a fancy family ring". I think he must have realized the Stone held /some/ magical power, of extremely ancient origin; noteworthy enough, thus, to hold a part of his soul. I don't think that he'd have been willing to make a non-magical object into a receptacle for a version of him.

** I hope it was just the golden band that voldemort soul attached to because then dumbledore's blunder would be that much more funny.
