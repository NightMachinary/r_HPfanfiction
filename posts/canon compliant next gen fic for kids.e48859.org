** I've recommended this series several times, and it seems to fulfill your needs. They were actually my very first introduction to the world of HP fanfiction. It's a series of books by [[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][George Norman Lippert]]. They're canon compilant, and they follow the story of James and Albus and their new friends in their school years after the epilogue. There's a total of 5 books (yes, books), and they're really well written, and the narrative style matches that of Rowling very well. They were even endorsed by Rowling herself at some point. You can find them all in Lippert's [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][site]].

*** They weren't endorsed by Rowling, it really irks me that people advertise it as such. He didn't understand fanfic as a concept so specifically sought out her permission to write it unnecessarily, and then when she said yes as long as you don't make money from it (which he is cheekily ignoring by having a Kofi link in my opinion), it somehow got twisted into her endorsing them, which would be a completely different level. They're decent enough fanfics, there's no denying that, but they're not a higher status than others.

** This is one of my favorite next gen fics. I felt it captured the feel of the original seven books. I don't remember how kid friendly it is as it's rated T and I haven't read it in a while. But the story is centered around next gen kids like Teddy Lupin. It was written shortly after DH was published, so it has the feeling of reading more of the books due to direct references to parts of DH

**** The author of this fic also wrote the Alexandra Quick series if the kids are interested in america or female main characters that are similar to hp.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** At risk of being downvoted into oblivion-

Have they read The Cursed Child? Its the play that was released based on the epilogue. Its been released in book that you can buy and I think you could have a lot of fun reading it with them if you guys split up the roles and acted out the voices. It would be age appropriate reading if they read the original series without any trouble.

*** haha i didn't want to mention cursed child cause ik it's controversial. they read it & thought it was fine - this is kind of my personal mission to show them there's way better out there because i hate the cursed child with a passion lol. thank you so much though, you're right that it's basically exactly what i was describing!

*** I feel like even 7 and 9 year old children can recognise pretty easily that it's badly planned and written.

**** It's fits the description of what OP asked for, that's why I recommended it.

We're all adults and we didn't like it and obviously we're all entitled to our own opinions, but the Cursed Child is /exactly/ what the kids are asking for and it's cowritten by J.K. Rowling.
