Like, she can be rich or actually Sirius's daughter or gay or Slytherin or whatever as long as she's not suddenly on Voldemort's side or evil or cool with murder and torture.

Canon!Harry is sassy and stubborn and has a temper and is sometimes suicidal, but he also has a rather implacable moral code that allows him to see the good and the bad in others. I don't think these things would change just because he's a girl.

No Severitus or pairing her with Snape, because I personally find fem!Harry X Snape very creepy as she generally looks and behaves like Lily in them. Plus, I prefer pairing Harry with friendlies, slash or het, as I like to read fics where he has a supportive partner whose motivations he doesn't have to worry about on top of all the shit that's going on in his life. But that's just my opinion.

Quality fics that fit these requirements would be appreciated.


** Well... it's VERY AU, and she's still just a young child, but if you accept some shameless self-promotion, I have a fem!Harry whom I at least hope come across as fairly nice and chill. Well, she does get into a bit of a fight with Dudley, but it has to be said that he started it. Her interactions with Dumbledore, Hagrid and other kids her age are generally positive.

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

I certainly wouldn't describe Holly, in this fic, as dark. Why, she's so white she's practically blinding.
