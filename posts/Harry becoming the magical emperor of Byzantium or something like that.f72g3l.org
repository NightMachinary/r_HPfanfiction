I read the story years ago and that's what I can remember: He gets found by a resurgent Byzantine empire or something like that, is crowned emperor, gets the soul shard of Voldemort removed and IIRC he gets to rule over some part of the muggle world, as well.


** It's one of the dozens of started-but-abandoned-for-a-rewrite-and-then-actually-abandoned stories by Darth Imperius.

It's on AO3, as he deleted most of his fics from FFN, called “Dominus Mundi: The King of Kings.” Good luck.

*** Thanks, I found his archive account (his main account doesn't seem to be that active, either).

**** Try Spacebattles, he posts more regularly there. But again, he will come up with a story, get halfway through the first act, then abandon it to start over. He tried four times to write the one I mentioned before and gave it up within a month or two of starting over each time, after the first “draft” posted actively for about a year.

Wouldn't be so bad but he then deletes the old versions - some of which were fine stories on their own - and then never quite makes it back to the original progress point in the story before his muse wanders off again.
