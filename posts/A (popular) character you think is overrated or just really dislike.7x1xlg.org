A character that is usually involved in most fanfics and naturally also in canon. This could be Dumbledore, Sirius or maybe someone less known like Molly or McGonnagal?

For me it's definitely Hermione. Especially the way she is in introduced in fanfics. Found her somewhat annoying in canon but in fanon she is either introduced to Harry before Hogwarts, which is really annoying, or somehow mashed into the plot.

It can honestly ruin a good story for me when it's all good and then Hermione is introduced, and she plays no role other than to demand to know the secrets of Harry or she will either guilttrip him or simply order him to tell his secrets - as if friendship means you're obligated to share everything?

My problem is that pretty much 85% of fanon, if not more, has Hermione in it in a major way. And the ones that don't have her as a good character, end up bashing her, which (bashing) just makes for a poor fic.

In some ways I like Ron more. You hate him in the 4th book, you hate him in the 7th when he says that shit about Harry's parents, and clearly he can be a jealous prick with an inferiority complex but that just makes for a nuanced character. I can't remember once, where Hermione is actually made out to look bad in Canon? Except for perhaps the 3rd book when she ratted out Harry and the Firebolt thing. She is clever and intelligent, she has talent, she has a moral compass she sticks to, she can be beautiful when she wants to and yet she doesn't care much about it.

It seems clear to me that she is the Mary Sue of the HP world and I think she is Rowling's guilty pleasure, a little wish fulfilment perhaps.

PS: If you know any good fics where Hermione doesn't play a major role please let me know

** Hermione is probably my favorite character in the books, but I absolutely agree that her rate of appearance in fanon is stupidly high, and the rate at which she is shoehorned in into fics of genres like Slytherin!Harry, or AUs is making reading some of these fics a rather tiring experience. I'm at a point where I'll throw out a fic in which a Slytherin!Harry goes to save a Gryffindor girl he has never even spoken with from a troll.

I absolutely despise a few popular fanon characters like "Evil and manipulative Dumbledore" or "Ice Queen Daphne", even if they're written very well.

I think Sirius Black is often overrated. So overrated that authors seem to not be able to stomach hurting him in any way, devolving him from an interesting, albeit broken and tortured character, to a bland character of a few variations.

I heavily dislike what a lot of fanfiction made of Lily Potter. I'm somewhat indifferent about James Potter, even if the "lol omg so randum"-dad thing gets old very soon. But I despise this stereotype of Lily Potter as a calm housewife that blows up into ridiculous, choleric outbursts at the slightest misstep of /anyone/. I get that she was described as "having a temper" (or something like that), but there is a big difference between having a hot temperament and devolving into rage filled screaming at the slightest provocation - scratch that - at the slightest /annoyance/.

It's because Rowling threw him under the bus. He had the potential for being a really great, complex character (he ran away from familial indoctrination at a time when such things got you /hunted down and killed/...and also tried to accident a fellow student into murder), yet was sacrificed in order to show...I don't know. Life isn't fair? His house needed to be used as a macguffin later? Simply to write herself out of the box she'd written herself into?

So a lot of writers have responded by trying to fix this void of a character that got Snoke'd, but because there is so very little to go on he's become Flanderized. I agree with you assessment, mostly. It's one of the reasons I more or less wrote him out of my story.

Personally, Sirius always came across as kind of a bully to me, so I was more so surprised that Rowling acknowledged this in book 5 instead of sweeping his behavior under the carpet.

**** DISCLAIMER: Massive LDS spoilers. If you don't want to be spoiled, minimize my comment.

Regarding feedback, the people who have more moderate opinions (like me) are probably less motivated to make their (dis)pleasure known. On top of this, the story is completely character driven so romantic interactions are vitally important no matter who they're between, which makes opinions much more inflexible.

Me specifically, I'm reluctant to comment on Harry and Hermione's interactions because their current character arc isn't complete. The story has a lot of people avoiding talking about a lot of things and I don't feel comfortable making judgments until the characters actually lay out what they want from each other.

For example, Harry and Hermione are clearly aware of the implication of sleeping in the same bed, even to the point of joking about it, and yet there's been no discussion about what they want from each other. That's fine because as I've said elsewhere, I don't think even they know what they're doing. Fifteen/sixteen year olds, and all that. Harry also isn't talking to her about Emily, and Hermione hasn't said anything about what makes her want to sleep next to him in the first place. The situation should come to a head eventually but neither of them seem particularly interested in getting there.

Harry and Emily aren't exactly communicating either, leading the story to feel like it's come to a high tension stand-still until something breaks. Both Harry and Hermione have been through a lot of emotional trauma in a short time and their refusal to talk about it both realistic and volatile, and the situation is only compounded by Emily.

There are many questions and no answers and I don't know how to comment while only knowing half the story. If you're looking specifically for a non-shipper opinion on what the romance looks like, there's a giant flashing sign toward Harmony with a higher than average chance of disaster.

The only real issue I've had with the story so far is how Harry and Hermione draw emotional comfort from physical intimacy, platonic or otherwise. But that's more of an opinion I'm setting aside because they clearly do in LDS.

**** I'm a non-shipper. I just like good writing about complex characters and this story delivers.

Fair warning: I've read the story piecemeal as chapters come out, so I'm probably building up mental models that don't quite match the author's intentions. (When it's been over two years since the story started, I'm sure key plot elements are fuzzy by now.)

I think the Harry/Hermione relationship you've presented is interesting, confusing, and oddly authentic--much like watching my sixteen-year-old son fumble through his own attempts at dating and intimacy. I asked him once whether Sylvia was his girlfriend. He thought for a while, then said, "I don't know." Harry would likely answer similarly with Hermione, realizing that what he shares with her doesn't cleave to the classic definitions, though there's closeness, sexual overtones, and a sense of love that's somewhat ephemeral, yet present.

They themselves don't quite know how to define their relationship and that's fine with me. It's intimate, physical in the literal sense, borne out of shared experience and need after trauma, yet not sexual (yet). There is a sense of sexuality, trauma, and complexity with the Emily back story and the banter (and breasts). I could see it going that way, toward a sexual relationship (and buying it); I could see it not (and also buying it).

There's something to be said for your making it not matter in the larger schema. The contrast with the complexity and triumph and pain of his relationship with Emily (including the persistent mind-screw she's putting him through and enduring herself) is what makes the tender moments of intimacy between Harry and Hermione work for me as a reader. Without either, the story would be much less.

Agree with everything else as well, Evil Dumbledore especially pisses me off. Dumbledore is pretty much the god of the HP world. People reading Canon might get pissed off at every wrong thing to Harry because in their eyes Dumbledore is so powerful that he should be blamed for everything wrong in the magical world, forgetting that he might not have had better options. It's like when people are mad at God for a disease or something. Do I make sense?

******* Depends how you define good, really.

If you define being good as being "anti-Voldemort", then sure he's good.

If you define as good as being a caring individual who tries their best to help others and not make the world a worse place? Then Snape is almost certainly evil by both words and actions.

As far as I'm concerned, you can want to kill Voldemort and still be an evil git. There's no evidence to say that Snape ever cared about Harry beyond his "mother's eyes".

That being said, he has an incredible strength of will and natural talent matched only by Harry and Dumbledore himself to keep up the double agent lifestyle for god knows how many decades. That's what makes him fascinating.

** Remus Lupin. A 17-year-old virgin (Harry) had to save his marriage after he ran away from his pregnant wife. Marriage vows include some variations of "in good and in bad times" and he broke those vows. Realistically speaking, that would have destroyed a lot of trust and would take years to heal, if not done irreversible damage.

He also did nothing for Harry outside of his job and he was getting paid for that. Even Sirius Black, facing summary execution, tried to help Harry during the tournament, while Lupin has absolutely 0 excuses for doing nothing. And he seemed to value his "connection" to Harry since he made the boy, who hasn't yet gotten his dick wet, godfather of his own son.

Yes, he had a rather difficult life, but outside of the Weasleys, who didn't? Harry was abused at home, his parents murdered, Sirius was abused to a lesser degree as well and falsely incarcerated for 11 years, James lost his parents before 20, Hermione was bullied, Andromeda was thrown out of her family and even Snape had abusive/neglectful parents.

Katie Bell and her friend Leanne play larger roles and the eventual paring will be Harry/Lisa Turpin.

She doesn't want to be in the spotlight but ends up there due to Harry either way and will struggle with that. Her boyfriend may not care about fangirls, but they will make her life difficult. She will neither be the smartest nor the prettiest girl but instead have balanced strengths and weaknesses.

One of my biggest goals as a writer is to have characters be more than tools for the protagonist, people who have a life besides doing stuff for Harry. Therefore she will be spending time with other people and, for example, Lisa will have different electives and be quite passionate about them, even if Harry can only nod dumbly whenever runes are mentioned.

** It's Hermione too for me. She's kind of written from this ~not like the "other" girls perspective in the books and has a tendency to come off as self-righteous and judgmental, which I think carries on to a lot fics. They tend to gloss over her more problematic qualities. An example being her sort of "I know best" arrogance that reflects on how she disregards the feelings of house elves when she crusades for them (which makes her activism more about her feelings than theirs). And also the way she doesn't seem to have female friends? Usually when a woman doesn't get along with other women, I'm more inclined to think it's more about her rather than all the other females being trash? It really irks me how Ginny/Fleur/Lavender/Parvati/etc. are all characterized as stupid, horrible, shallow, & vain in comparison to her in so many fics (and sometimes in the books too).

And all of this is... blatantly not what Fleur is about in the books. Veela "Allure" in the way it's usually presented (an aura of lustfulness) doesn't exist; Veelas are simply ungodly beautiful, and an effect somewhat like the "Allure" appears when they dance and sing. The rest is just fanon. But moreover, Fleur /does not/ identify as Veela. That she has some Veela blood is really secondary --- she's usually just treated as a witch who happens to be very pretty.

******* While I agree that harem are actually made for or written by a male audience, I (a probably good human female) actually enjoy reading fanfiction with harem ships that aren't ridiculous (like ones with about fifty girls who aren't attracted to the main character at all) and don't objectivise and completely destroy the personalities of the participants. You could say that I don't really ship harem because I like all the characters having relationships with each other simultaneously, but that all depends on how strict you are with the definition.

I don't know whether this is because I want all the girls to end up with the main character and have a happy ending, but not all harem fix are trash +even though 99. 9 reoccurring percent are+

And yes, I'm aware that I'm probably a small minority, but I just wanted to put it out there

****** Nah, she's extremely overrated too. She might have been exceptional at potions, but that doesn't mean she wasn't average at other subjects and yet people act that way. 'Oh but Slughorn praised her a lot!' Slughorn didn't teach her all subjects, only potions. When people do bring up the evidence that James /was/ smarter (along with Sirius) it's more often than not ignored or 'James was dead so people are trying to make Harry feel better!'

That argument isn't used for Lily and yet it's just as applicable for her as it is to James.

I'm not saying she wasn't kind, or decently smart and had a wonderful personality. She might have been' flawless' for all we know and she knew it. But thats arguably a flaw itself. Her personality is commonly rid of every single flaw. I mean come on, she was dead and people praise the dead a lot. She was human, therefore she had flaws and she's ripped of off them.

** Hermione comes across as the bad guy in a fair bit of Philosopher's Stone, Half Blood Prince (with the book and Malfoy) and clearly goes about her House Elf protest in Order of the Phoenix/Goblet of Fire the wrong way as well.

I would also pick Hermione to be exceedingly overrated in fanon.

Hermione's capabilities are blown out of proportion in fanon whilst her flaws are ignored. She panics in dangerous situations and is at times a detriment to the group. She's nowhere near as powerful in the books as she often is in fanon.

Harry doesn't criticise her cruelty and vindictiveness (towards Luna, Ron and Marietta Edgecombe) but several characters are critical of those aspects. She also has a 'black and white' morality, particularly in the early books.

It's a shame that many of the fanfics miss the more complex aspects of her character.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns.

For example, my favorite thing about Hermione is her vindictiveness and ruthlessness.

Taking that away from her just makes her boring and a wet blanket, literally taking away character-defining character development.

Compared to Harry Potter?

Canon Harry is a good side character: he doesn't have many emotions or attachments to muck things up, he has his own plot points, and he mostly goes with the flow. (A teacher torturing him isn't enough to get him to be proactive, fercrissakes.)

Fandom Harry actually gives him a hero's journey a lot of the time, which is an improvement. They give him angst a lot of the time, which is actual emotion, and that's also an improvement. But that's papering over moldy plaster. And he's the protagonist in the vast majority of fics.

When authors come up with interesting ideas, they use them on Harry Potter pretty much every time. In the few exceptions, they erase any motivations the characters have in favor of slavish submission to Harry fucking Potter. I read a fic from Hermione's point of view where she heard of a powerful artifact that would grant its owner success in all things, or near enough -- she was focused on getting it so she could give it to Harry. (Harry's canon quest is rather important, but she could have used the artifact to aid him and then advance her own ambitions.)

I read a fic wherein a person with access to magic came across a holocron and learned to be a Jedi. Who was it? Harry Potter. Did he do anything particularly interesting with the ability? Not really; he just beat the stations of canon more easily.

If it were Ron, he'd have plenty of opportunities to be tempted by the Dark Side, and we'd potentially see Darth Weasel. That would be fun. If it were Tom Riddle, that would potentially be interesting. A Jedi Hermione would have severe problems interacting with normal people, which wouldn't be as good as Darth Weasel but wouldn't be utterly bland. Some random OC? You'd have to make them an interesting character and couldn't lean on the stations of canon. No such luck.

...dammit, I'm totally going to write Darth Weasel now, aren't I.

*** You make good points but all your points can easily be disregarded with one simple statement: Your examples of fanfics are terrible. This might disrespectful since you wrote so much but I don't see your point. I can easily bring up fics where Hermione or any other character is written terribly. That shouldn't prove my point in that that character is essentially overrated.

Harry in HPMOR or Dark Prince or well, generally a lot of fics is an amazing character. This is the responsibility of the author, not the character. However that is not to say that we can disregard the entire discussion with this one core argument.

Which leads me to the question, is there a trend of Harry written in this way? I don't believe so, but of course this depends. Some people want for the boring wish fulfilment slave/harem/godlike Harry fic. Personally I believe the protaganist having it too easy kills the soul of the story so there it is. I don't believe there is a trend at least to the degree where the more.. Well, qualified population of readers are into this genre.

Finally and most importantly your points on canon Harry. That's where we truly disagree. Compared to Harry Hermione is a one-dimensional, rule-abiding, pro-authoritarian girl. Honestly she is by far the bigger side character, however she is given the skills of a protagonist with her intelligence. It's like Rowling was in doubt about who she wanted as a protagonist.

Harry is far more interesting, and not proactive? Really? He leads a war against a major villain. He has fought him since he was 11. He is only not proactive when it's something concerning himself because he is not egocentric, maybe he could use a bit more of that but he is certainly proactive when it concerns the wellbeing of others? He decides to learn the Patronus. He wants to go to the ministry because of Sirius. Time and again he offers his friends to bail. His guilt, his selfdoubt whether he can actually defeat Voldemort and save people, all of that adds to his interesting character.

Hermione is always commandeering him, she pushes him into the Dumbledore's Order, she finds a project like houseelves and demands everyone else acts according to her whims. Once she realizes Harry has a book helping him in potions she can't handle anyone else being better than her. She is honestly, by far, the most overrated and overblown character in the series. Both canon and fanon.

They're what I recently read. There was also /The Denarian Renegade/, in which Harry was a jerk and the only thing I particularly wanted to read about him doing was dying.

The fics that do better generally do so by making Harry unrecognizable. Like /Emperor/, or the Sacrifices Arc, or /A Second Chance at Life/, or /Seventh Horcrux/, or /Stages of Hope/.

Harry was proactive when sneaking into the Ministry under Polyjuice Potion. That's a plan that he came up with and executed without a pressing and urgent triggering event. It took about a month of staking out the place for them to do it, and the whole thing was still poorly planned, but what the hey. He tried, and he even saw some success.

When else did he come up with a plan and then execute it?

***** Denarian Renegade is nto to my taste but I suppose that is one of the higher quality fics at least. Personally I'm not too much into dark Harry because he often comes across as an asshole. Actually a huge asshole and yet other characters in the fic still cater to his every whim and that's annoying. Again, that to me, is a badly written fic, not just the character.

Ectoplasm for example is a fic where the author writes VERY true to his character and it's one of the most amazing I've ever read.

I suppose it would come to that, wouldn't it. If I had read The Hermione Granger series, I would be as equally annoyed by her role as the protagonist be pushed aside to include a side character. It wouldn't make sense. In fact from a feminist point of view this would probably piss a lot of people off, I imagine. Just think, a female protagonist has this perfect handsome, altruistic, driven and intelligent friend who does everything for her and basically demands to know her secrets and pushes her into new movements he starts at his whim. Sound kind of demeaning? Yeah, I think so too.

Honestly I don't have a problem with her because she's a girl and I want to read from a guy's perspective. My problem is that Harry is the protagonist, not Hermione. Hermione doesn't have to be shoehorned into every fic. You're criticizing Harry's character but perhaps you're doing that exactly because no one wants to see a complacent character. While I don't agree that Harry isn't proactive, I DO think he tends to be less so with Hermione in the picture. And that combined with all my other aforementioned points is why I truly dislike Hermione. She is a Mary Sue and one dimensional and if you can't see it, you do you, but it seems obvious to me.

Harry takes action countless times. He is the one who attempts to solve the mystery. Going into a forest of huge spiders, going into the chamber to kill a snake, going after the stone etc etc. And btw. the definition of proactive isn't just to have a well considered plan, it's to generally take action and do something to improve a situation.

Give me a hero's journey every god damned day over this!

Finally: Ron Weasley - gets away with too much in canon (without some punishment, like Harry not talking to him for a few months or something...maybe Arthur really should have died, then Ron might have grown up faster (if he ever did, because to me it doesn't look that way!))...abandoning your supposed best friend twice (remember: Ron leaving/not talking to Harry could have meant Harry's death!), being jeaulous of somebody who doesn't have a family (damned, I was Ron when I was younger and I despise my younger self for that! I was jeaulous of two of my wealthier friends, but I didn't see that both of them didn't have a close relationship with their parents (who gave them goods and money to try and make up for their lack of time!), but at least their parents aren't dead, Harry's parents are and Ron is still a jeaulous little shit!)

It's a rather blurry kind of grey zone. However, if someone at the age of 14 or 15 complains about a sexual act with someone above 21, even after the fact, the above 21 year old may face legal charges and the benefit of the doubt will in all likelyhood go towards the 14 year old.

******* To quote Wikipedia

#+begin_quote
  The age of consent in Germany is 14, as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14- to 15-year-old person's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself. Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18

***** (Oldest characters age / 2) + 7 = Okay age of relationship partner.

So youngest possible couple is: Both are 14. Theoretical oldest possible is: 100 and 57 years.

Lets see: a 40 year old and a 15 year old. -> (40/2)+7= 27. No, s/he should be 12 years older.

Maximum for a 15 year old is: (15-7)*2=16

****** In Class (Grade 8 Germany) we covered "The Reader", which has a relationship between a 15-year-old boy and 30ish woman. And not even the teacher spent more than two sentences on the age difference. Apparently, your rule does not apply to any actual writing.

That relationship would be rather illegal in real life but that did not stop people from putting it on our reading lists in a public school.

******* Of course my rule doesn't cover actual writing. It's just a guideline and it isn't mine.

It is just a simple way to avoid 'They are to young to date!' or 'Pedophile!' comments on practically all sites that feature stories.
