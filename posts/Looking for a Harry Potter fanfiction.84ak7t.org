This was set during Harry's first and second years at Hogwarts. Harry might have been sorted into a different house. He had friends from different houses ( Cedric, Neville, Fred, george, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Susan bones etc). He and his friends meet in a secret room that they have discovered. During his second year when they brought more people into the group they made an inner circle of friends and an outer circle. The inner circle members would mentor the outer circle. This fanfic was a WIP when I read it which was a couple of years ago.


** I think Fred and George mentored Ginny while Harry and Hermione mentored Luna. There was probably some Dumbledore bashing while other members of the staff may have helped them (flitwick, McGonagall etc). Hope this helps to jog your memory.

** Too few details. It's ringing a bell with me, but there's not enough to go on.

Thanks,

Warryn.
