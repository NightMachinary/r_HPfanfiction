  A real prophecy involves Rubeus Hagrid. In Harry's second year, the giant spends his days planting a hedge around Hogwarts. Story takes dark turn every once in a while with "wait... what?" Lots of bashing of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Fudge, and Umbridge. There'll be seven parts.

**** I hope you enjoy it! It's in my collection of fics that are just a bit different, but I really liked it.

Especially in the context of this year. I read it when we'd been in quarantine a month here, I think, and so it was just the right timing for me. I just reread it though, and still enjoyed it.

** One of my recent faves is this amazing portrait of a toxic relationship between Tom Riddle and Amy Benson (if she was a witch) from their orphanage days to Hogwarts and beyond.

linkao3(My heart is a fist of barbed wire)

And of course, another great fic is this one, but it contains Wolfstar, even if you don't like it there's very little of it, so don't worry.

linkao3(The Boys Of Crowhill)

If you like AUs, I want to also recommend my own fic which is a pretty heavy AU I'd say, give it a look if you're curious about Harry being /sort of/ raised by Remus and Sirius ;)

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.‚ÄúThat's mine,‚Äù comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. ‚ÄúThat's mine,‚Äù he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

** My favorite fanfic, or at least my favorite one shot, for this fandom is /Faith and Understanding./

Essentially, this tells the story of the friendship of Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, with Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Link]]

As a final note, it has my favorite passage from any Harry Potter fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  ‚ÄúLuna, who's your favorite person?‚Äù

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  ‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely---nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Yesss, I always recomend a series by LightningOnThe Wave - it's an au, basically a series rewrite from the 1st year. There is no cannon rehashing - which I hate. Very heavy worldbuilding- the author expanded the universe SO much! I love their ideas about the world and magical creatures. They go in depth about magic and politics and how the influence each other. They also expand the world outside of the UK.

It is Drarry but nothing starts happening until the middle of year 4 (I think), and it is slash. Soo.

But I really hope you will read it! The first book its linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]])

** My favorite Harry Potter fanfic is definitely Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 link]]\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][FFN link]]

Holy shit I just adore this fic. It has much more worldbuilding than canon, and the Death Eaters actually feel like credible threats. In general, both sides feel a lot more competent now.

other notes:\\
* /major/ canon divergence.\\
* some characters are suicidal at times.\\
* I don't like the first chapter. It actually turned me off the fic at first, but then I read chapter 2 and was instantly intrigued.
