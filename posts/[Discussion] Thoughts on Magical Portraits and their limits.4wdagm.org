So magical portraits are pretty common in fics, but is there (or should there) be limits to them?

I've seen fics where Harry discovers portraits of his parents, and all of a sudden they're basically surrogate parents for him, and their deaths are basically nullified. To me, it feels disingenuous. I mean, if that's the case, why not paint everybody? What's the point of being sad about death if you know that there's a near-exact clone in a painting?

In addition, there's a ton of fics with portraits as teachers. Basically, Harry finds a portrait of Merlin, Morgana, Slytherin, Snape, and they train/teach him. I mean, after the DH, Dumbledore is dead, but his mind/memories are still there in his portrait. I'm pretty sure he could give some awesome lectures on alchemy or transfiguration. The same applies to the rest of the headmasters.

The way I see it, magical portraits, without limits, can really take the emphasis out of character deaths, which could really break plots in fics.

Just wanted to hear your thoughts on magical portraits, and a good way of using them. Or, maybe it's better to just ignore them?


** Portraits are a cool worldbuilding idea on the surface, but JK clearly didn't think them through.

Are portraits simply a "record" of the person at the time of the portrait's creation, or are they magical AIs? Walburga Black's portrait gets pissed at Order members in OotP, which implies it can recognize them, which means the portrait had to have been able to learn new facts long after Walburga herself had died. This is canon. Is it simply an impression of the portrait learning new facts? Going by Sirius' words, it seems to "portray" Walburga's personality accurately. He refers to the portrait as his mother. The Fat Lady is referred to as the Fat Lady, not Fat Lady's portrait.

A plot hole waiting to blow up, imo. Like Felix Felicis, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.

*** I always thought that the Fat Lady was never a real person and was always a painting, at the very least there's got to be one painting in the whole school that's without and real person to base it off. And that begs the question, if a painting has no real person behind it, did the artist create life?

** I agree with the suggestion that Rowling didn't think this one through - still, I like some of those fictions you mention!

Still, if what you suggest were the case:

Why would Hogwarts not use some portraits as instructors? They'd could teach classes just as effectively as real teachers if they had some way of controlling the class and hand out punishments (and they'd need to be highly damage resistant because of dangerous magic in their vicinity and because disgruntled students might try to destroy a portrait that punished them!) and would give the real teachers some breathing room (they are stretched quite thin as it is...I mean McGonagall has it the worst: Teacher, Head of House (not that she's a good one, she's too hands off and not really involved with her house...then again: So are Snape and Flitwick! We don't know how Sprout handles her 'Puffs!) and Deputy-Headmistress, but the others aren't much better off...still beats me why they have one teacher teach all 7 years!)

In a way portraits are really powerful - they are even a kind of way to cheat death (a form of immortality)...depends on their limitations (did Rowling ever speak about that? - If not it's up to the author, so they can be quite powerful - especially if you think something up like them being tied into a place's wards and controlling them etc.)

** I've been toying with the idea that, like ghosts, portraits are a sort of "imprint" of the soul. Ghosts are natural imprints, and one day inspired a wizard to copy the effect. I haven't put too much thought into it, and like others, I haven't nailed down any firm set of limitations. But that's my personal thought on it.

** I assume the portraits are not the characters, just some slightly smarter recordings.

** I was just thinking about this the other day. In my WIP I utilize the potrait of Dumbledore in the headmasters office. However (in story) Dumbledore died knowing a secret I don't want his portrait to be able reveal.

** in the hp universe not having a soul is the same as serious brain damage, portraits don't have souls. i imagine dumbles was charmed in unique ways to make it useful against riddle but that's about it. same with the black, hers probably had specific charms added to make it react that way. i didn't see any sign of intelligence or cunning.

so, some portraits are probably unique, but not able to change their minds much.

** Imagines if someone found out how to get around a portrait "waking up" only after its death. And it also seems portraits have edict memory
