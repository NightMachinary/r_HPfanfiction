Dumbledore's decision to move the students in books 1 and 3 make no sense. The Great Hall and the students' dormitories are all very defensible positions.

Book 1 - The Great Hall has two ways in: the Entrance Hall and the chamber the Triwizard contestant went in. I think due to the size of the troll, you can rule out it coming through the chamber, so they would only need to watch out for the doors to the Entrance Hall. With hundreds of students, about two dozen prefects, a head boy and girl, probably a couple professors, and ghosts that could quickly contact Dumbledore, there is no need for the students to leave the Great Hall. And of course, I can't forget to mention that the last known location of the troll was in the dungeons, where the Slytherin dorms are.

Book 3 - The dorms have only one entrance, which are protected by passwords or other tests. The fact that the Fat Lady kept Sirius Black out of Gryffindor Tower proves that the defense work (until Crookshanks steals Neville's list later in the book). Even if Sirius could get past the password protection, the common room would likely be guarded by six prefects, the head of house, and maybe some seventh year volunteers who want to protect the younger students. Good luck getting through them. You could argue that the Gryffindors, at least, would need to stay somewhere else because the fat lady had left, but to this I ask, wouldn't the headmaster have the power and authority to enter any house? Could he not open Gryffindor Tower himself?

By having the students leave their current, perfectly safe locations and traverse the castle to another location, Dumbledore was putting the students at great risk for seemingly no reason.

Out-of-universe, leaving the Great Hall allowed Harry and Ron to sneak off and save Hermione in the first book, while sleeping in the Great Hall allowed Harry to overhear Snape and Dumbledore in the third book. But in-universe, I can't think of a good reason to justify what Dumbledore did.


** It's politics. If you leave the students where they are, people complain you're not doing anything.

** Book 1: Dumbledore has no idea how long it will take to locate the troll, or whether it will be a feint (it was) to get at the students (it wasn't). Separating them so that no one student/teacher has access to everyone is a sound move, and hiding them behind much more defensible dorm access points like the Fat Lady is a genuinely sound plan.

For all he knows, Voldemort will be stepping into the Hall behind the troll. Also, trolls are tough to take down. What if it bounds into the hall while throwing its club? Are you /sure/ you could take it down before it hit a kid?

Book 3: The Heads of House don't room in the dorms. This is the opposite situation - Dumbledore knows that Black is alone and has been turned back before. Thus, he knows that there is an upper limit on what Black is capable of (getting past the Fat Lady) and that he's got a plan for it. He has no idea what plans Black has made, but there's an important distinction this time as opposed to last time - Dumbledore doesn't need to do a damn thing. He can watch over every student without having to go look for a troll, because the Dementors are looking for Sirius.

#+end_quote

Dumbledore understands Voldemort more than anyone else in the world. He of all people would know that Voldemort would not do this. It was not Voldemort's style to commit mass murder of civilians.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, so tough that two eleven year olds armed with one of the most basic charms could take it down.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Easily. One hundred stunners or impedimentas from the upper years would certainly take it down, and an arresto momentum on the club would stop it from hurting anyone.

#+begin_quote
  The Heads of House don't room in the dorms.
#+end_quote

I never said they did. But more importantly, you believe that because they don't sleep in the dorms, that means they can't stay in the common room for one night?

#+begin_quote

Ok, so if he knows that upper limit is the very entrance to each houses' common room (as I myself stated), then why abandon those defenses in favor of the Great Hall?

#+end_quote

Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Dumbledore go searching the grounds with the other teachers and left Head Boy Percy in charge? Can't exactly watch over everyone if you're not present. Also, Dumbledore did not allow the dementors to look for Black in the castle.

You know what would ALSO be a good distraction? Wounding/murdering a few. Teachers are occupied trying to save the kid, Dumbledore has to make sure the school is safe before he can check on the Stone, even Snape couldn't sneak away. So Dumbledore had to prevent that.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, so tough that two eleven year olds armed with one of the most basic charms could take it down.
#+end_quote

Unintentionally, in a one-in-a-million chance. Most trolls would have kept their hands more firmly on their clubs, and most combatants wouldn't have been able to stick a wand up its nose.

#+begin_quote
  Easily. One hundred stunners or impedimentas from the upper years would certainly take it down, and an arresto momentum on the club would stop it from hurting anyone.
#+end_quote

Conscripting the older kids is morally wrong. The Prefects have some excuse, since they have agreed to an increase in responsibility, but the minors are still minors and shouldn't be expected to be forced to defend themselves. To add onto that, there aren't 100 seventh years, and how do you know that the people who can cast the spell AND hit the target AND not freeze up in fear would take down a troll if they all cast simultaneously (and they'd have to manage that, too)? Dragons certainly resist such spells, and while trolls are smaller than dragons, that means they're a smaller target, as well.

And who, exactly, is hitting a thrown club with that spell?

#+begin_quote
  I never said they did. But more importantly, you believe that because they don't sleep in the dorms, that means they can't stay in the common room for one night?

Fair point, honestly.

#+begin_quote

Because Black knows his limits, so if he tries again, it would only be after he's made a plan to get past them.

#+end_quote

That's as may be. I don't actually remember. The point is that he can make sure they're safe to the best of his ability and search at his leisure, if indeed he did do so. Sirius is the devil Dumbledore knows, in contrast with the mysterious troll summoner.

You know what would be the easiest way to do that? Attack the students while they are walking through the halls to their dorms, protected only by their prefects.

Yeah. So he separates them, so if one group is attacked, they won't /all/ be in the line of fire. Cold equations. He can't fight Voldemort while protecting an auditorium full of kids. He can barely do it while protecting just Harry. I'm not saying they're safe. I'm saying they aren't all in danger at the same time.

The moment you make the kids part of the battle plan, you're conscripting them. That's what deputizing is. Whether they want to fight or not doesn't matter, because they aren't equipped to make that choice. You said only the older kids - why not the first years, too? Because it's downright criminal to allow them. I feel like I should ring up Hellstrike to talk about the Geneva Convention.

Probably would have laid low, like how he hid after he killed Pettigrew, or after he betrayed the Potters. Walking up to Hagrid and giving him a motorcycle like that... he's a damn chameleon./s

From anyone's perspective, he's a nutjob who happens to do impossible shit with disturbing regularity that seems planned. Sit in Azkaban - largely sane - until he catches sight of a line about Harry in the newspapers, then break out in a month. Break into Hogwarts under Dementor guard. Who knows what he's capable of?

Excuse me, what?

No, taking them out of the line of fire is not conscripting them. In their dorms, they will not have to fight. We don't know that one professor could take down a troll. We are merely spreading the students out so they aren't all in danger. If there's a gunner in the room, do you stay grouped up so he can do the maximum amount of damage, or do you scatter so he can't hit you all at once? The deal is that the students are going to get hurt if they fight a troll, period. There is, even in the best circumstances, an unjustifiable risk. Therefore, he spreads the students out so that the danger cannot find them all at once.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, there are.
#+end_quote

Haha, nope. That's some WoG that I refuse to accept. Two other girls in Harry's year in Gryffindor? Bull. Approximately eight per House per year. 32x7=224 students, 64 of whom are sixth or seventh year. The extra broomsticks, earmuffs, and cauldrons are just that: extras.

He can't fly indoors - or at least, it's pointless to. And the question is whether or not it's better to have all the targets in one location where he can kill them in one second, or spread out where he can't. Even if it only takes him 30 seconds to kill them all, which we've seen isn't the case in DH, that's still 29 seconds you didn't have for Dumbledore to get there.

They aren't.

You know reflexes aren't like a Matrix slow-motion thing, where you calmly choose a response, right? A reflex is something that's only barely conscious - something either evolution or training has hardwired into your brain. Hitting something with a bat? Sure. Casting a momentum-arresting charm? Nope. Not most people, and not students or any of the teachers, save perhaps Moody. Casting a spell also takes a second, whereas a club hurled by a troll travels fast.

  You and I have no idea what Dumbledore does and does not know.
#+end_quote

I have a good idea what he knows. The fact that he didn't immediately phoenixport to the troll would suggest he doesn't know everything going on in the castle.

#+begin_quote
  The entire point of this conversation is that Dumbledore does not know what Voldemort is capable of. That's canon - otherwise he'd have just checked the professors for Voldemort possessions.
#+end_quote

He does know that Voldemort is without form though.

#+begin_quote
  Then tell me about your way.
#+end_quote

The simplest way. Cast your spell at it repeatedly. It will go down eventually.

#+begin_quote
  You know reflexes aren't like a Matrix slow-motion thing, where you calmly choose a response, right? A reflex is something that's only barely conscious - something either evolution or training has hardwired into your brain.
#+end_quote

I don't know about you, but seeing a club fly in the air, pointing my wand at it, and casting a spell doesn't seem like some matrix level dodging bullets kind of situation, nor does it seem like it require god-like reflexes. It seems pretty straight forward.

#+begin_quote
  whereas a club hurled by a troll travels fast.
#+end_quote

But not faster than a person can react to. Certainly not as fast as a bullet or a baseball.

Nobody died then, though. He does show up seconds after the first students come into danger.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Still doesn't know anything about what he's capable of. Also, does he actually know that?

#+end_quote

How do you know that will work? If it resists one spell, logically it will go on resisting that one spell, probably long enough to hurt someone.

Really. So if I hucked a baseball bat at your head, you could see that it's coming toward you, pick a spell, perform a complicated series of gestures, speak an incantation, and aim the spell - all in time to stop the bat?

Impressive, if so. I doubt everyone could.

Trolls are strong, and their clubs are large. It only has to hit one person.

  guarded by six prefects, the head of house, and maybe some seventh year volunteers who want to protect the younger students. Good luck getting through them
#+end_quote

You are overestimating the 15-18 yr olds and underestimating the fear Sirius Black, who was known to have murdered 13 people with one spell leaving a crater in the street, caused. McGonagall could take Sirius, sure, but why risk that with a bunch of children over head while believing Sirius did what he did.

** Moving them from the Hall was stupid, especially given "TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS" One, it could have moved anywhere, and two... the Dungeons, specifically, Half the School could have died, given that Hufflepuff and Slytherin both have Common Rooms in the Dungeon.

*** Hell, even I thought it was a stupid idea to send kids away from the one place he knew /100% for sure/ the troll actually /wasn't/ when I was barely in double digits!

Seriously, the better plan, for the troll at least, would be to barricade the doors, give Hagrid a weapon of some sort, and tell him to guard the students with the Prefects as the everything-has-gone-to-hell backup while the other teachers dealt with finding the troll itself!

*** ...maybe "dungeons" mean the subterranean levels of the castle which may not be all connected? Hogwarts is pretty darn big after all.
