I'm looking for a fiction I've read a year or so ago. If I remember the facts correctly, Harry transfers to an American school of magic. He meets a girl fairly early on that he starts dating. There are still werewolf wars in America. I believe one part of the story is where the wolves attack the school in force. I believe the school looks like a farm barn or something like that to muggies. Any ideas as to a name?
