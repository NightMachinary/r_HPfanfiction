Other than my wish of seeing a HP/Stormlight Archive crossover and an M:tg/HP one, this suddenly came to mind. I've been trawling the FF.net section and it only has 71 fics. That's not even excluding badly written ones.

So internet! Do you know any crossover that fits the bill? HP as a Knight Enchanter sounds awesome. Or maybe Ron as an Arcane Warrior or Hermione as a Force Mage or the generic Elemental Mage?


** Yeah some crossovers are seriously lacking :( would it kill someone to write a decent hp/ffvii story where Harry finds and uses materia? :(

Sadly i cant help with your request, as its not fandom i follow myself, but leaving this comment with my randomness so i can come back and check later:)

*** I haven't found a Materia wielding Harry yet. I saw a fic that's by quartermass set in 8 where it is obvious that the Horcrux in his head became a guardian force. I'll link it if you like

  When Voldemort tried to kill Harry Potter, the backlash of magic sent Harry to another world. Adopted by Cid and Edea Kramer, Harry, a rare Sorcerer, has Quistis Trepe as a Knight. But when his mother begins acting strangely, and Galbadia steps up its aggression, Harry, Quistis, Squall, and so many others must unravel a plot, and defeat a foe from the future...

** Every time I try to write one, I can never make it more than a chapter. I've personally found it very hard to capture what I enjoy most about DA (which is honestly mostly just Morrigan interacting with other people).

*** Considering that difficulty, I would suggest not to start in Origins as that part of the game can be a real pain considering the choose-your-hero type start. It'll all go to hell there.

I've always thought about starting a fic in Kirkwall/during the Inquisition where the plot is more defined. A MoD!Harry dropping in during the prologue or the midst of the Mage/Templar war will have more potential IMO. There are so many paths that story could take considering Hawke and the Inquisitor's actions. Place a Harry (after-blood-war!Harry not pre) that's considered an Apostate who can learn from comparing notes from an Alive!Bethany in the Mage's Circle or a Mage!Hawke and the story line would write itself.

Inquisition on the other hand would be interesting because Harry can be dropped in the middle of it all trying to learn new stuff and helping out other Mages.

Yes it is obvious I sided with the mages in Inquisition and DA2. Lol

*** Tbh the DA universe for me is more of a “Magic is a Weapon” type universe, along with Warcraft, Stormlight, Kingkiller, and the like.

HP is, for me, “Magic is a Tool” type universe where there's a 101 uses for magic. That's why its so easy to splice HP into any universe.

  All Origins may be true, but that doesn't mean it'll be easy to take out that pesky archdemon. Between a xenophobic Dalish, a reformed playboy, a mage prodigy with a bad temper, and others, getting through the Blight without strangling one another (or Alistair, for that matter) will be hard enough.

*** I must be remembering DA badly, cause the magic seemed pretty damn powerful to me. Dragon Age had some powerful and great area of effect spells that Potterverse seems to lack or need Dumbledore power to use. Potterverse magic is without a doubt the more versatile of the two systems though.
