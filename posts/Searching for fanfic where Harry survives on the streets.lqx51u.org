At the moment, I'm going through a bit of a phase where I just want to see dark/grey!Harry fanfics that has Harry living off the street and in the alleys before attending Hogwarts.

Something like: Harry comes to Hogwarts and is not sorted into Gryffindor, he's not the "golden boy" that he was in canon, and he's not afraid to use violence and do bad things for a good result.

Preferably if he also has a family from his time living in the streets and maybe something happened to them and they separated? Also Dumbledore and RW bashing.

Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13251826/1/I-m-not-a-hero]] although maybe without the ridiculously overpowered Harry.


** linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) features a Harry that is an elf. Not one of those lame house elves though, a forest elf. As such, he lives on the streets or in the woods, woods are good too.\\
He doesn't have a family as such but he does have friends he meets while wandering that he keeps after getting to Hogwarts.

He has no problems using violence but isn't particularly interested in doing good or doing evil which he sees as 'wizard business'.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  A disabled Harry comes to Hogwarts story. Everyone expects him to be like his dad, but how can he be with such a different past? A Slytherin Harry takes on Hogwarts in an unusual way.

** Why it has to be Harry? I always dreamed that somebody would write linkffn(12278819) ... Harry Potter (or Fantastic Beasts) meet Oliver Twist: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Modesty_Barebone][Modesty Barebone]] growing up on the streets as a magical child (somebody would have to tell her about her magic and train her a bit to use it, to make it fun).

*** Because he's the main character and I dig stories where Harry stands up to Dumbledore and actually thinks.

Also I don't remember who Modesty Barebone or Credence is, I just know that they're Fantastic Beast characters
