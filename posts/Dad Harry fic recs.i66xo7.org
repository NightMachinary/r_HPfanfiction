Can anyone link any good fics where Harry being a father is an important aspect? Can be future fic, can be time travel, het or slash, etc.

Especially if Harry tells any terrible dad jokes in them


** Have you read The Cursed Child? It's a bit unrealistic and OOC at times (like Harry being an ass to his wife and kids) but it's decent and the author /is/ fandom famous.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]])

Highly recommend this fic. May be slightly romance focused, but Harry as a father is also kinda prominent. Might not be exactly what you're looking for.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

Harry is a grown Auror with 3 children when he chances upon a child wizard in an unstable home situation, and he and Ginny decide to take him in as their foster kid. I loved it.

** I'm currently reading the Linear Circle series (I believe I'm on part 3) and Harry's a father in this series... it takes a while, though, before you actually meet Harry and get to that part. Totally worth the wait, though, when you do get to the part where he's a dad; I love his fatherly instincts. No terrible dad jokes yet.
