1. Friends with Benefits, Post-Hogwarts and Post-War. Their Canonship might hold for a certain time, but it shouldnt be to long. They consensualy decide to break, but remain Friends and occasionally have Sex with each other, but also that none of them is emotionally hurt, if the other sleeps with other Partners.

​

1. AU Fics that contain them never meet before. Their Age should be around 30 possibly. They meet randomly, perhaps in a Bar or something and have a pretty Night that possibly would follow other Pretty Nights.

​

1. Political/Business Fics that have both of them are High qualified Employees but in different Companies. However, when they meet the Attraction is there. If there would be Negotiations, Ginny would try to get the Best by Flirting (and possibly more...) with Harry. Harry eather getting weak under her Pressure or stays equal and they reach an agreement.

​

1. Threesome Fics. One of them, i think it would be Ginny, but i leave it to the Author, will offer a Threesome. I imagined a FFM. The other Partner would be uncertain about it and they let drop this Theme. At some point, however Ginnys Best Friend would seduce Harry and they sleep with each other. Ginny arrives at Home and catches them, but instead of being Angry she gets turned on by this and happily joins them. You could "beautify" this out with Ginny has a conversation with said Friend about how to convince Harry, so the apparently Infidelity is no such one. Well, it doesnt matter to me, as long as they have fun all together. Oh, i would prefer Ginnys Friend to be an OC, maybe one of her Quidditch team comrades.

​

1. Infidelity Fics that might contain somethling like Ginny cheats with Draco, but she feels remorse after that. At this Point im uncertain about what it should be: either she doesnt love Harry anymore, but she still feels bad for doing that to him (the sex with the other Guy was good, thats why her Guilt isnt getting better and the Sex wouldnt necessarily make her fall for Draco) or she Loves Harry but the Sex with Draco (or other Partner) was better.

The Infidelity may count for the both of them, so around the time Ginny cheats on Harry he does the same. The encounter for him could make him feel the same as Ginny or make him clear, that Ginny is his only Love. However, it could collide into a Conversation between them that Harry thinks the sex between them is already good, but she has other/higher Requirements. I would leave it to the Author, if they stay together after this or separate.

​

1. Female Harry, whether he is transformed into a Girl/Woman or is Born as a Female doesnt matter. Ginny gets attracted to her and they have some hot Nights together.

​

1. One Final Session before Break up/Divorce. That might sound objective. What i thought was that Ginny and Harry were married and lived for so long together, but their Passion and Love would be rather dimly now. But then something happens and their Lust is ignited. After the Act both of them agree to separate. I would be also open for them to give their Relationship a chance, but i think it wouldnt last long.

​

These Points dont have to be in one fic of course and i would be glad, if you could make notes to the Recs that you post, unless the Summary makes it clear about the content.
