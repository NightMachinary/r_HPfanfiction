...despite knowing that there's a horcrux in him (especially if looking into other methods of removing it haven't been looked into or tried!).

Why? IMHO that wizard world just doesn't deserve Harry's sacrifice (not even his friends deserve that IMHO)!

Bonus points if there's some Dumbledore "bashing" (note: For me getting on Dumbledore's case about all the mistakes he made is not truly bashing after all, I mean Dumbledore has a serious god complex and his secrets tend to get people killed!)


** There is a difference between pointing at his mistakes and bashing. Also, Dumbledore doesn't have a god complex. He knows his weaknesses and shortcomings very well, though he is also the leader of an era. There is just a lot of responsibilities on him, including those that cost lives when he fails.

If I remember correctly, Harry refuses to sacrifice himself (without doing research first) in linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane). And, hey, it has a very cool, benevolent Dumbledore in it who owns up to his mistakes.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** Very true. There is a HUGE difference between making Dumbledore own up to his mistakes, and actual bashing. Bashing is things like:

- Having him steal Harry's money
- Marriage contracts with Ginny or somebody else to "control" him better
- Setting up Harry's death to make Dumbledore the hero and for him to gain more power
- Having him deliberately create Voldemort (again to gain more prestige and power)
- Placing Harry with the Dursleys' to make him more malleable and weak (we all know that's not the reason he was put there, because there's no guarantee he would've turned out that way)
- Having him use things like compulsion charms, memory charms or whatever on Harry
- Having him seal or destroy Lily and James' wills (These wills were never mentioned in canon, there's no evidence they even existed. Besides he has no power to dispose of a legal will).
- Having him trying to control the magical world
- Basically having Dumbledore act way more evil than Voldemort, having the whole world turn against him, ascribing some malevolent or self serving motive to his actions, or making him basically act like he's the villain of the series.
- Having him deliberately set up Lily and James' deaths
- Having him set up Sirius' death
- Turning Dumbledore into a cackling villain and making him some soulless bastard, OOC incompetent over the top evil Dumbledore put in the story for the sole purpose of taking jabs at him. That's what bashing is, the bashed characters don't further the plot or serve any purpose. They're literally only there for the author to attack because they don't like them.

*** What do you call keeping the prophecy hidden and not helping Harry in fifth year and not trying to gain Sirius a trial?

I'd call that either a god complex (seeing people as pawns and all that!) or stupidity!

IMHO Harry should have been told the prophecy as soon as it was clear that Voldemort wouldn't leave him alone (it's not like he had much of a childhood left after the Dursleys anyway!)

ps: I've seen that fiction, so I'll give it a go - thank you!

Actually, I think Dumbledore did the right thing in not telling Harry about the prophecy earlier. It was basically a delayed death sentence, something a child shouldn't have to deal with. On top of that, Dumbledore was wary of the link between Harry and Voldemort. That was why he only told Harry about the prophecy after Voldemort failed to possess Harry directly.

Then, you might have overestimated Dumbledore's influence on the Ministry. The Ministry was able to sack Dumbledore during CoS, post dementors around the school, politically trash him for a year after GoF, and send in a minion to take over the school.

***** Yeah, not telling Harry the prophecy was the right move. Not telling him that Voldemort might try luring him to the Ministry/DoM was not.

Frankly, it disturbs me that so many people want a young (pre-15/16 years old) Harry "trained" in combative magics/Defense to an extreme. Because they're endorsing the creation of child soldiers.

****** Training Harry for combat isn't the same as training everyone. Harry's life was at risk well before he even knew about magic. The idea of training him to survive the trials specific to his life follows from the same logic as having the royals join military service; there are greater demands on his awareness, behavior and education than any normal citizen would be expected to fulfill.

***** As if Harry didn't get that Voldemort wanted him dead, he just didn't know why (ok, he knew half: Voldemort wanted him dead because he supposedly defeated him as a child - the prophecy wouldn't really have added much to that!)

Well, I think Dumbledore didn't fight these things (he knew that he was right and would be vindicated, so why fight?), but I am sure he could have!

****** It was as much upto Harry to train himself, as it was to Dumbledore. Clearly Dumbledore didn't want Harry to duel Voldemort in the end, he wanted Harry to allow himself to die, instead of Duelling and likely winning against Voldemort. I never even understood how Harry managed to become a Horcrux, as it was never explained. And Rowling always alluded to the fact that creating a Horcrux was some disgusting ritual, that she didn't have the stomach to describe to children. So we can assume that Harry was not a full Horcrux, we have seen that he has a connection with Voldemort, we have seen that he got Parseltounge from Voldemort, yet we don't really see anything else to allude to the fact that Voldemort could reincarnate through Harry's body.

Personally, I would love to see a good Master-Apprentice fic with Harry and Dumbledore, starting after the events of PS, but with the catch being that Harry did go to Slytherin, that way you can show clearly Harry's talent in magic before hand. I always thought that during Harry's first year, Dumbledore was thinking of training Harry, but only if Harry showed any promise in his subjects. It's likely that that is why he kept the cloak until Christmas break, as he assumed that he would use for a "Magic Sensing" type training for Harry, where he would hide under the cloak and fire hexes at Harry from random locations. But this is all just my headcanon.

**** I'm just of the opinion that "exposing" those failures has been done to death and is, at this point, neither clever nor does it make for an original read. Much more interesting would be to delve into Dumbledore's inner character and explain why he decided as he did in the light of how Rowling has presented his character - a benevolent, wise wizard.

Why did he hide the prophecy? Because he genuinely believed it would benefit Harry to not know it right away? He didn't help harry because he genuinely believed being close to him would make Voldemort break Harry's mind. He didn't give Sirius a trial because he also was tricked into believing Sirius was the Secret keeper, therefore the Fidelius breaking was enough evidence for him.

Anyway, you can always deconstruct something. But I always thought that constructing a story explaining these things is much more interesting.

***** Why? Because of his past, Dumbledore hasn't totally let go of his and Grindelwald's ideas! He's just much more subtle than Grindelwald! I mean look at the hollows stuff, he's still after them (he had the cloak and the wand and later on he even had the stone for a time!).

He might not be as bad as Grindelwald, but he certainly isn't a benevolent grandfather either!

Then there is his mercy BS (sorry, but that's not how you fight a war, that's how you LOSE A WAR!)...Stunners? Really? When the other side is using killing curses, cutting curses (like the one that hit Hermione at the DOM) etc....sorry but without Harry the Light-Side would have lost the first Voldemort-War (it was only a matter of time - they fought a war of attrition without Voldemort's forces actually feeling any attrition because almost none of them were actually killed!)

  I think this is the perfect example of our different approaches to the HP books. You seem to want there to be problems with canon - you take joy in finding what you believe to be failings and errors and do not seek out any kind of way to explain those apparent failings, instead being satisfied with your cleverness in having found what you believe to be a problem. - [[/u/Taure]]

Still, this way he'd have survive first year easily (why? Because he'd have trusted the adults, he'd have made McGonagall check or he'd have writen a letter to Dumbledore himself (the stone was safe in the mirror at least till Dumbledore shows up because Voldemort only got it out of there by using poor innocent/clueless Harry who wasn't even tempted by the stone like most other people - including myself and the likes of Ron Weasley, hell even Hermione etc. would have been tempted (more gold to buy books, more time to live so learn everything etc.))
