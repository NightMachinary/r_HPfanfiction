So the War ends and everything, but unlike the Canon, Harry stays single. Maybe he has an on/off Relationship with Ginny, but nothing serious. Harry lives and enjoys his now peaceful life. I would imagine him kinda like Bruce Wayne, so Harry has multiple lovers, but all of this is just for fun...maybe there is the one or another Women that develop feelings for him, but he just wants fun.

Well, to keep it Canon, Harry would make an education to Auror.

If there is a serious Relationship, it would happen at the end of it.


** linkffn(Madley in Love)

After the war he lost his vault, or rather, he never went to Gringotts and because of it, he's completely broke. All he has is a cottage and he works helping a lot of people, basically a handyman. You can clearly see he's happy and satisfied with his life, though he gets a bit lonely. Which is where Laura comes in and changes things up. Really sweet story overal, pretty chill. No big drama at all. I don't remember if he joined the Aurors and then quit or didn't join at all, so I'm sorry that this doesn't exactly fit your request.

  Living a frugal life in a small cottage out in the middle of nowhere, is Harry Potter really who he seems? New recruit Laura Madley finds an odd file going through the tax records and begins to investigate. She doesn't know what to think, but something about him keeps pulling her back.
