Hey fellow fans,

As described in the title above, I am looking for a fanfic with a lot of political involvement, like in the Marauder's Plan.

All recommendations appreciated.

Cheers.


** A Marauder's Plan is a very unique if flawed fic, but I can get behind this.

linkffn(The True Story by Harmonious Cannons) has some.

  Yet Another True Story, chronicling the real incidents behind the myths in the books. (YATS, another genre like YATTFF). Rated M for safety. Chapter 5: Won but Lost is up. The events of 1981. The trials. Chapter 5: Word count 37.5k All positive canon characters are positive; their relations are tweaked.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

** So, this is a bit of a stretch, but it's my favorite fic, so whatever. Linkffn(one hundred sixty nine).

Hermione goes back to 169 days prior to Halloween, 1981 to stop Voldemort and enlists Sirius' help to gather the horcruxes. Sirius is forced to play the "repentant son" in order to get back into his family's good graces, with Hermione playing a Swiss pure-blood socialite. More "high society" than politics, but like I said, it's my favorite.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
