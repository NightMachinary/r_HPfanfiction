Dumbledore's eyebrows rose in surprise at the letter he was reading from one of his agents. The scar horcrux was confirmed to be dealt with. This was going to change things. Moving to his filing cabinet he took out a thick pile of parchment, before promptly throwing half of it on the fire. He took out a fresh page from a draw and set it on the desk, then inked his quill, and started to write.

​

Goal: destroy Voldemort

​

He paused, then crossed that out. No, that was the old plan again, and that's what got him to overlook the method that got rid of the Horcrux without condeming Harry to an early grave. Time for something different. Pausing for a moment, he set quill to parchment again.

Goal: help Harry destroy Voldemort

**** He might have planned for figured that the Horcrux was central to the prophecy. Instead of just plain out kill Harry himself why not use his death as a rallying cry. If Dumbledore is manipulating things who would miss Harry Potter in the muggle world? The only person not directly under Dumbledores control would be Hermione. If she asks questions about Harry's early life it's easy for Dumbledore to get rid of her.

*** Yeah, I think at that point his mindset would be "It's not a war a child should fight".
