*** im not talking about a fic where harry is in love and that gets him motivated or there is some ritual where he bonds or something that gives him power. I'm talking about where harry being in love hurts voldemort like [[/spoiler][in the forgotten contract where harry has sex with susan and realizes that he loves her it gets rid of the horcrux and hurts voldemort.]] .

**** Harry Potter and His Veela Mate. Linkffn(10633819). Hermione discovers she is a Veela and conveniently can and must have sex with no risk of pregnancy until she fully matures as a veela. Voldemort suffers excrutiating pain. Every time.

(He eventually brews a potion to destroy Harry's horcrux and has his minion slip it to him.)

  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.

**** Sorry, I replied based on the "Power he knows not" being love - as an abstract. Pet Project had Harry figure that out and utilise it quite interestingly. Now I realise you meant Harry being in love being the power which is obviously a different kettle of fish. I don't have a suggestion for that. Sorry.

***** sorry that was my bad but that is indeed what i was looking for harry using love as a power. I just assumed that since it was a Severus/Hermione that they prob did something mundane like set up an ambush to off voldemort thanks.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
