There's no record of what Tom Riddle has done in the 50s and 60s ( apart from him failing in a job interview for DADA and murdering Hepzibah Smith) and there's a scarcity of fics that explore the middle years of Tom Riddle's life when he was not quite the Dark Lord, but at the same time he also wasn't Tom Riddle Sr's clone as Merope intended.


** While not exactly what you're looking for, you could try The Imposter Complex [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002]]

Tom Riddle escapes the Chamber of Secrets and then has to try and piece everything back together. It's a bit of a crazy romp (and a lot of fun) but the author also spends a long time fleshing out all of that missing history by having Tom try to trace back what Voldemort did and where he went so that he (Tom) can figure his shit out.

** linkffn(The Crown of Mètis) fits. It's just a single area, and a one shot, but it's great world building for it.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

#+begin_quote
  Six years ago, the kingdom of Ocrisa was conquered, forcing king, queen, and crown prince to flee. Now, the crown prince is in Camelot, as he somehow managed to be appointed the manservant to Prince Arthur. Merlin's world is turned upside down when his mother - Queen Hunith of Ocrisa - comes to Camelot, asking King Uther for help in finding her husband, King Balinor.
