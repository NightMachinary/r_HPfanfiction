Any recommendations to fic similar to Jewel Amongst Stone? I want the fic to feature a neutral Harry who later choose a side. Harry has to be unknown (in the sense that he is not particulary important to either side in the beginning) but powerful.

Another type of fic I would like to read is where Harry learns and behaves according to the tradition of pureblood as heir to the Potter or any other House.

I am also looking for a fic where Tom does not goes insane and pursues political path to achieve his goal. I like it most if while doing so, Tom is a professor at Hogwarts.

I'm not particularly picky about pairing. It could be anything except harem. No romance is acceptable. Harry could be light, dark or grey, doesn't matter to me.


** linkffn(Wind Shear) is a new fic that's looking pretty cool. It has a powerful, neutral-ish, unknown Harry so far though it has time travel which may not be your cup of tea.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Well, technically, in my story "Patron", Harry does learn how to act as and behaves as a traditional pureblood head of family. But he's also working to change a significant part of that culture and the pureblood culture is rather different from canon - magic is used far more often, and the society is partially far more liberal than muggles - they consider muggles prudes - and far more archaic as well, having rather old laws still on the books (although how those laws are enforced is very much tempered by custom and peer pressure).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** This harry potter is a veela. Future mate and mated to lucius malfoy. Tom is sane and took his lordship. Harry potter took his lordships and learnt his traditions to be a lord. Harry will make hell to dumbledore with his seats and his supporters. Good action, and romance.
