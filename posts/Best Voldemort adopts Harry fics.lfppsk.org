Looking for good fics where Voldemort adopts Harry/takes him in, or mentors him. Preferably where he is somewhat sane - doesn't have to be completely sane ‘cause let's be honest, it's Voldemort, just as long as he becomes fond of Harry (grudgingly or not). Any rating and relationship is fine, just no ‘mega harem Harry'.

Bonus points if Harry has been abused by the Dursleys and Voldemort takes him in afterwards or because of that.

  After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, since in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; Dark, Light or no side at all.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1855237]]) is my favourite. Voldemort is quite OOC.

** If you're looking for a story where Voldemort kidnaps Harry as a baby, and raises him ( where Voldemort sorta grows fond of him, but he's still evil and always puts himself first ) until Harry realizes that he's evil and rebels against him, check out the one below.

(There's a good chance you've already read this one, but if not do it. Like do it right now. It's the best thing ever, just read it.)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

If you're looking for about the same thing except Harry always remains loyal to Voldemort, at least for the most part try this one.

(This one is a tragedy, so beware. It's a very sad ending.)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy]]

And then there's this one.

(This is just a crack/humor story, but it involves Voldemort raising Harry so I thought, what the hell? Check it out if you want. It's funny.)
