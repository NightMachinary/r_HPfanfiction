  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

** The only Ron/Harry slash that I've ever enjoyed is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5519225/1/The-Abysmal-Dating-Life-of-Harry-Potter][The Abysmal Dating Life of Harry Potter.]] It's pretty funny, and it's quite good at also showing just general friendships with other characters, particularly with Seamus.
