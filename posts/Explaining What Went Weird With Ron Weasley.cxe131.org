So I found an interesting Video that talks about how Ron ended up getting the short end of the stick in Harry Potter, and while I don't think it talks specifically about the fandom you can draw parallels to the fandom and the actual movies/books

** Ron definitely got the short stick in the movies. They gave all of his best lines to Hermione.

*** The film version of Hermione stole a few lines from Harry as well. Some people in the fandom claim to this day that Hermione could've defeated Voldemort on her own. That's just completely ludicrous and shows just how bad the films cocked up Hermione's character. In the books she's a complex girl with real human emotions who makes mistakes and needs her friends to be a heroine. In the movies she's perfect and she has everything figured out already to the point where fans disregard the accomplishments of the main character (Harry) in favor of her. Movie! Hermione didn't just ruin Ron, she ruined the trio's entire canon dynamic.

**** They left out the parts from the book that revealed she was just as human as anyone else. When Lavender finds out that her rabbit had died, Hermione went about proving a point (that Professor Trelawney was a fraud) instead of being a little more sensitive and using some tact. The movies made her look pretty much perfect.

*** What's more, there were two deleted scenes in the movies that I think they were absolutely wrong to delete, and both of them were Ron scenes--only Ron giving exposition, but still. The first is when Ron describes Tom Riddle's award in Chamber of Secrets. Without that, there's no logical reason for Harry to ask the diary about the Chamber. The second is when Ron explains the Taboo in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Without that, the part where Xenophilius says Voldemort's name to summon the Death Eaters makes no sense.

** The films cocked up a lot of character development across the board. While he was never as bland as he was in the films the later books did seem to move more towards that side of things, with Ron's development seeming to be more "drama-driven" at times than this character we'd spent years with. His issues with jealousy and being forgotten about that he worked on and finally seemed to have overcome by the end of book four are suddenly brought back in book six with the Quidditch issue (which also has to have Hermione helping rig it to a degree, taking away from his success) while in DH his whole arc feels so contrived into having him come across as a complete arsehole during large segments once again only to have a dramatic turn around when that occurred several books ago (I haven't read Cursed Child but I've heard he has similar placement as "comic relief" in that too)...

***** I think her choice to kill sirius instead of arthur was a poor choice

even if you changed nothing else, it would make book 6 and 7 make much more sense.

Ron would be moody in book six because he is trying to cope with his fathers death and doing it poorly.

ron in book seven would make more sense too he recently lost his father and is now terrifed of losing another family member so soon

****** The problem is you keep Sirius alive and you give Harry too much hope, and if you kill Arthur you bring him too much pain. Harry and Sirius barely knew each other or had a relationship. He was much closer with Arthur (and his family). Sirius' death was about killing possibilities, but there was never anything concrete about them. Arthur would have killed very real parts of Harry's life. Sirius was the possibility of a family, Arthur /was./

Sirius dying was a step along the path in slowly leading Harry to accept the idea that death, really, was just another great adventure. One that you could come to terms with.

******* odd that I never got the impression that Harry was closer to Arthur than Sirius. He turns to Sirius in book 4 when he is worried but he talks to Arthur in book 6. Of course that is because Rwoling wanted to establish the fact that Sirius meant a lot to Harry before doing what she did. I personally always imagined that for Harry Arthur's death would be more about guilt than anything else. It's easy to notice that Harry has actually very few interactions with him, but somehow that possiblity of a family is more painful than his friend's father's death.

******* I agree with the idea that Arthur's death would've be so much more meaningful, but disagree with the notion that you should therefore not do it. Killing him instead of Sirius would've made more sense and could've really created some friction between Ron and Harry that actually made sense ("How can you act a so depressed, he was /my/ Dad, you selfish git!")

Hermione is the same is when Ron date what's her name.

** Hits a lot of good points. I think the movies have had a major impact on how people view certain characters. Specifically Hermione and Ron. I know that my preference for Harmony is largely inspired by how Hermione's film adaptation changed her book persona.

That being said in my opinion Ron's movie portrayal only highlights some of the less favourable characterisations of his book personality. I'd still call Ron the more goofy one of the bunch, and his actions in GoF and DH leaving Harry (and Hermione) are very much book canon.

I also think that the creator tries to "blame" the movies a lot for the disparity between Harry/Hermione on one side and Ron on the other hand. I think that the books themselves already set up Harry and Hermione as more prominent special characters. Ron on the other hand rarely has moments in the books that truly make him shine. The video tries to make out book Ron as a character that overcomes feelings of inadequacy and coming into his own out of the shadow of his brothers. But in the books he still is very much overcome with jealousy and he rarely has really big accomplishments on his own. The highlights of Ron (solo) that come to mind are the chess game in book 1 and the Quidditch match in book 5. While Hermione and Harry both have a ton more to show.

So while the books certainly allowed for a far more nuanced character it's not as if the movie invented a bunch of stuff out of thin air.

*** Good on you for at least admitting that the movies impacted your affinity for Harmony/Hermione and her different persona. A lot of H/Hr shippers won't admit that the movies somewhat influenced their liking for the pairing (I know this isn't true for everyone who likes them as a couple because some ship them on the books alone).

Steve Kloves took it too far in the films and I'm not even talking about the dancing scene in DH Part 1 (which I thought was a sweet and appropriate for movie!Harry and movie!Hermione, even though moody book!Harry would never do it). The films gave H/Hr non-canon intimate talks and touching, Hermione crying on his shoulder, that line about 'growing old together,' Hermione crying and hugging Harry saying she'll 'go with him' when he goes to meet Voldemort in DH Part 2 while Ron just stands and stares in the background, and Dumbledore (of all people. Isn't he supposed to be all-knowing?) suggesting that they might like each other in the HBP film. None of these moments being canon is a major red flag against the ship for me. I would ship H/Hr if I hadn't read the books and only saw the films thanks to the ridiculous hoops the screenwriters jump through to give them moments together.

**** I think that people trying to ship them in a strict book sense are just trying to find all sorts of things that aren't really there in the books (at least not to the extent that some people want it to). I also think that there is nothing wrong with going beyond the books. For experienced fanfiction readers, it becomes very hard to keep a strict canon interpretation of any character in the series. It's very easy to see with characters that were minimal in the books (Daphne Greengrass is, of course, the prime example of this), but in my opinion, it happens to every character.

****** Not every fanfiction, but you are correct that there are a ton of common personality traits for her. And that's exactly my point, her character was heavily influenced by fanfiction to the point where a lot about her character has basically become canon (or fanon). I think we can see this in a lot of other characters as well, and it shows how much stuff like the movies and fanfiction has influenced our perception and interpretation of certain characters.

**** I really don't get the concept of shipping. The whole point of fanfiction is to expand on cannon or present a different universe than the cannon one. A good author can make ANYTHING work. From evil Dumbledoor to "good" Voldemort. Unless yone is in the mood for a certain type of fic, I don't see the point in discriminating fanfiction based on cannon.

***** Some shippers give their ship a bad reputation though with their bad attitudes and bashing other characters. In the case of H/Hr, 90% of the fics are badly written, Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, cliche nonsense and generic crap. It just makes the whole H/Hr fandom look immature because some people feel like they can't write their ship without turning Ron into a literal Death Eater even though it's 100% against his character.

****** Yeah, this is what puts me of from H/Hr.

I used to ship them on 2011 when I only read fanfiction in my local language, the fandom there pushed what made H/Hr great instead of bashing another character. I was surprised that the international H/Hr fandom is really toxic.

At this point, I won't even read H/Hr unless it's a total AU from first year or comes from an Author that I liked.

*** u/zsmg:
#+begin_quote
  Ron on the other hand rarely has moments in the books that truly make him shine.
#+end_quote

The last true moment where he shined was in the third book where he stood up for Harry with a broken leg against Sirius. There is a good moment in book 5 and several good moments in book 7 such as the final quidditch match or escaping from a group of snatchers on his own. But they all happened off screen so we get informed about them which leaves no impact.

It's obvious that JKR didn't know what to do with the character in book 4-6, and just used him as a source of conflict between the trio.
