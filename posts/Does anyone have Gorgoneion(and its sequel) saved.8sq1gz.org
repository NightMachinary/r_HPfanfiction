the author recently updated his profile saying he was being harassed and deleted all his stories. which is a shame cus gorgoneion was one of my favs. i'd appreciate if anyone who has it saved share it here.

edit: holy shit the author just dropped the n-word with hard r on their profile. starting to see what exactly they were being harassed for.

Hahaha, that's pretty funny... I tried reading "Gorgoneion" once and it gave me weird vibes (like Perfect Lionheart). Glad to see my radar was on point.

***** They're a who. Let's just say his stories venture into a lot of nonsense like "the gays are pedophiles".
