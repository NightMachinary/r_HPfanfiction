  AU. Starts 2nd year. The Weasleys didn't rescue Harry from the Dursleys, the Creevey boys did. Join them as they build friendships with the trio and join them on their adventures. Read as Harry gains his deepest desire: a family

** The Dead Master by FalconLux link ao3 (The Dead Master by FalconLux) She has quite a few WIPs but updated “Dead Master@ in January. It's supposedly Harry/Snape but nothing has happened between them and maybe she's planning to go in a different direction with the fic. Harry is MOD and wakes up in the Dursley's cupboard, but leaves and locates the current head of the Black family, assuming a new identity. He is shocked when, at the start of his 5th (??) year, Harry Potter shows up to be sorted . . . .

I also recommend checking out her other WIPs---the ideas are fascinating! “The Many Faces Of Harry Potter” and “The Power of a Well-Organized Mind” are both Gen fics, both WIPs, but definitely worth a read! Harry mentors ‘himself'.

Here's her fic list on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FalconLux/pseuds/FalconLux]]

Excellent writing skills and style. Very unique premises!

If that bot doesn't work, I'm gonna stick a fork in my eye!

Ok, I need a fork . . . .

  Dumbledore's schemes took everything from him, including the man he loved, but now Harry has devised a means with which to travel back in time to his younger body before he started Hogwarts. He's going to get another chance at his life, and this time Dumbledore won't be getting in his way.An unconventional approach to a Do Over story.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]] If Thems the Rules by MayMarlow is good. Harry goes back in time and adopts Tom Riddle to try to raise him to be a better person. It delves a lot into what's happening in muggle areas during WWII.
