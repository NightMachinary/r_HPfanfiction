After reading a lot of stories where Harry Potter is very clever and finds clever ways to solve the problems in the original novels, I'd like to read some stories where Harry Potter prefers the use of the simplest solution he can think of for every problem he ends up facing. I figure, in its own way, the simple solution can be just as clever as the most complex plan, plus it'd be entertaining to read.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** My own /No Longer Alone/ fits this request to a certain degree. While not always the /easiest/ solution, simple plans are chosen over the Dumbledore-esque 4D chess. For example, Harry ditches Divination and takes Muggle Studies instead, because there is no way he could catch up a year worth of material within a month or two. Which is a good representation of the overall spirit of the story. Another example would be the holidays. Instead of some grand journey to foreign lands, an apparation commute to the French beaches is the chosen way. Pop over for a few hours and be back for dinner.

It is overall a slice-of-life story which focuses on characters over action. The premise is that Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family after the Third year. The story is centred around Harry growing into said family and his friendships (Katie Bell and Leanne over the summer, Hermione and Ron afterwards although Ron is /difficult/ due to his canon behaviour around the tournament). There is a romantic side-plot in the later chapters, but nowhere close to a shipping story (hence no romance tag).
