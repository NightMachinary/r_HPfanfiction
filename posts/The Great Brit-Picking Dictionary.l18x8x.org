Brit-picking seems to be a problem for many fics, so I thought it might be useful if we can compile a list of the most common Brit-pick errors to help people improve their writing in future.

I know there's plenty of writers that won't care, but for those who want to sound more realistically British, it could come in handy.

I'll keep this updated as entries are suggested below.

For starters:

"Mum", not "Mom"

"Jumper", not "Sweater"

"Trousers", not "pants"

"Register", not "roll call"

"Milk" is added to tea/coffee, not "cream"

"Crisps", not "chips" (also "chips", not "fries" unless your character happens to be inside a McDonald's)

"Arse", not "ass"

"Term", not "semester"

"Take-away" food, not "take-out"

"Fringe", not "bangs" when referring to hair

"Autumn", not "fall"

"Holiday", not "Vacation"

"Bin", not "Dumpster"

"Rubbish", not "Garbage"

"Pavement", not "sidewalk"

"Trainers", not "sneakers"

"Playing practical jokes", not "pulling pranks"

"Down the road" or "around the corner", not "X blocks away"

"Boot", not "trunk" when talking about a car. Not an elephant's nose, trunk is still the right word for that.

"Cinema", not "movie theatre"

"Primary school", not "elementary school"

"Nursery", not "kindergarten"

"Sweets", not "candy"

Keep it going!


** Arse, not ass. Including in compound words (Dumbarse, Arsewipe, Arsehole, etc). The only ass in the UK is a Donkey.

We don't tend to use words like Dork or Dweeb or Poindexter or generally any insult from US teen movies/series. Whatever you think of Insults like Old Goat or Dumbledork, they basically wouldn't ever be used by a British Person. Might get Bumbledore or Dumblefuck, but even that's a stretch.

Ginge is short for Ginger (pronounced to rhyme with Hinge) and used in our weird cultural habit of insulting redheads.

Taking the piss is mockery, being pissed off is angry, being pissed is drunk, go piss up a wall is go away because I don't like you.

Bags the Thingy/Bagsy on the Thingy, not Dibs.

/Subject/ Master - not a degree, basically just a posh people term for a teacher. It's a job title at public schools (which are the fancy private schools in the UK). Saying Snape is the Potions Master isn't saying he's really good or really qualified at potions, just that he's the teacher of it at Hogwarts.

Chips, as in Fish and. Not Crisps, I repeat *Not Crisps*

Gutted - slightly ironically, but sincerely devastated.

Knackered - Tired, or slaughtering animals.

Skiving, not playing hooky. Older people might say 'Playing Truant', but I'm not sure where one changes to the other.

Kip - sleep

Legend/Epic - You are a Legend, that thing you did is Epic.

Quid - Pounds

Skint - Having no money

Starkers is naked, Stark-raving Mad is crazy.

Cunt - both "Hey friends" and "You're the worst thing ever" depending on context and tone. Also sometimes a very hated word, like 'moist'.

**** You got it exactly right. It's a state, so it's always used as an adjective.

You might say that you are skint, or that you've gone skint, or that you're a skint person, but yeah. Always used as an adjective. I've heard some friends say Londoners use "I'm right skint" meaning "I'm very broke", but I'm from the North so I can't confirm.

In terms of who might use it - it's seen as having quite working class and teenager-ey tones, really. Not an absolute pattern by any means, but the association is there. People like Dudley would be the ones most associated with the usage of it in 'popular stereotype' terms - "Woss the matter then, mate? You skint or something?"

I vaguely recall 'Gobby' or 'Gobber' being used when I was in Secondary School - about ten years ago, in the North of England.

I would say to pay attention to the specific characters. What Seamus as an Irishman would call it would be very different to what Londoner Harry would call it, for example.

** Even worse, “pants” have different meaning in UK English, so this makes me laugh always:

No, Adam, you really shouldn't. Or

#+begin_quote
  It was Emma. Harry cursed at himself. He hadn't heard her come down the stairs, She was dressed in a fluffy blue robe, over flannel pajama pants and blue slippers. She was looking at him with concern.
#+end_quote

(Emma being the Hermione's mum, and the chapter is called ominously “The Best Christmas Ever”)

or I remember a scene (which I cannot find exactly right now), where Harry woke in The Burrow in the middle of night due to a nightmare, went down to a kitchen, and found there Ginny “sitting just with t-shirt and flannel pants for her pyjamas”).

** "Trainers", not "sneakers"

If you're going someplace to participate in an activity related to that place's intended purpose, then you go "to placename" rather than "to the placename".\\
For example, you would go "to hospital", "to school", "to church", instead of going "to the hospital", "to the school", "to the church", etc.\\
However, if you are going there as a visitor, perhaps to see someone there, then you would add the article "the" after "in".\\
For example, if I were needing medical attention, I would go to hospital and be in hospital. But if I were merely going to visit someone in hospital, I would go to the hospital and be in the hospital.\\
Americans make this distinction with some places (school, work, etc), but they are inconsistent about it, whereas British people are more consistent with their phrasing. In this matter, at least.

To expand on term/semester:\\
Hogwarts is split into three terms, not two. So "semester" not only is not the British word for it, but wouldn't even make sense.

To expand on trousers/pants:\\
"pants" to most Brits means "underwear", specifically the underwear you wear on your hips. Also, women wear "knickers", not "panties."

"Exams", not "tests"

"Biscuits" are generally small, hard sweet baked goods that Americans call "cookies". They're almost never gooey or soft. The closest thing Brits have to what Americans call biscuits are scones, but those aren't exactly the same thing.

****** Well, here in the USA there's a distinction between "jelly", "jam", and "preserves."

They're all very similar, but jelly is basically juice from fruit and sugar put into a gelatinous form. It's very smooth. Jam is fruit pulp and sugar. It's less smooth than jelly. Preserves are chunks of fruit and sugar. They're even less smooth than jams.

They all taste fairly similar to each other though, but with different textures. I personally prefer jam and preserves over jelly.

I'm not entirely sure how that corresponds to our definition - Jam is a sugary thing we spread on toast and put in porridge, Jelly is a wibbly-wobbly thing kids tend to have at parties or in school lunches. And in all honesty, it's probably been about the same length of time since I've actually eaten either and that was aeons ago, so I can't speak to the taste or texture of them.

- Bollocks! (In response to a statement) - you're lying
- Talking bollocks - chatting shit
- It's bollocks - It (a thing or a statement) is rubbish, this can be emphasised with other adjectives eg a load of bollocks

I think one of the big differences is that there's no real sense of "successfully" completing school in the UK.

You go through school until you are 18. Then you leave. You could have failed everything and be leaving without a single qualification to your name, or you could have done amazingly well. Either way, the process is exactly the same. Leaving school is simply a function of time passing.

There's no achievement in completing the process, nor any kind of standard "you finished school" qualification like a HS diploma. Everyone leaves with different qualifications depending on what subjects they decided to take and what grades they achieved in those subjects.

********* There is a centralised online system of university admissions. You create an account and write a single application which is used to apply to 5 programmes (e.g. Physics at Bristol is one application, Physics at Imperial would be a second, and Mathematics at Imperial would be a third).

Those universities will review your application and will make you "offers". An offer is basically an offer to attend that programme provided that you achieve a specified set of grades in specified subjects in your final exams (called A-Levels).

You can accept 2 offers, one as your primary offer and the second as a back-up in case you fail to achieve the grades necessary for the first.

You then complete the school year, do the exams, leave school, then in August you get the results and find out if you achieved the grades necessary to fulfil the requirements of your offer(s). If you failed to achieve the grades to fulfil even your back-up, then you go into a system called "clearing" where the universities try to fill up the free spaces on their degree programmes created by people not achieving the grades necessary. It's a bit of a free-for-all.

Oxford and Cambridge are slightly different - you have to do 2 applications for them, one through the centralised system and one direct to the universities which is substantially more rigorous. And depending on what programme you apply for they will set you their own exams in addition to A-Levels.

I suspect NEWTs operate in the same way to A-Levels, as they are clearly based on A-Levels (as OWLs are based on O-Levels/GCSEs). Just as the owl with their OWL results came during the summer after 5th year, probably an owl with their NEWT results comes during the summer after 7th year.

I have no idea what my primary school did, my secondary school did nothing and just mailed the qualifications, my Sixth-Form just did a final chat with your teachers to get some end-of-time feedback, then a big dinner at a fancy hotel, and I have no idea what my uni did because I didn't go due to them only having a tiny tent and the vast majority of attendees got put in lecture theatres to watch it on a projector whiteboard and I was not paying all that money for /that/ shit.

It's also common to leave school at 16 and do an apprenticeship or a BTEC (which does give you a diploma, but it's in one specific subject).

I left school at 16. There was no graduation. When I left college, my course went out for pizza. We didn't have a graduation either. It's just not done.

** Just a couple of things I'd like to point out for the list:

Mum/Mom is either regional or dependant on raising. I'm a native Brit, Brummie specifically, and I was raised with 'mom'. You'll probably also find Scots/Irish (mostly) will use 'ma'am' or 'mam' instead. Or marm might be another.

Take away/out, this might be due to Americanisms more recently, but I've had a few fast food servers ask if I'm 'eating in or taking out' so the term can be used if the context is right but if you're asking someone about food or the store it's the former.

Crisps/fries. This is another that /can/ show up in Britain. We have a brand of crisps called Walkers' French Fries, so you can use it in some contexts, just make sure it's the right one. Also chips tend to be about four times as chunky as fries when actually talking the differences between the chips you get from the local 'chippy' (fish & chip take away) against the fries served in American import takeaways ala McDs.

Coach - PE teacher/professor or a sports team coach yes, but in Britain we also have it as an intercity bus, usually one running day or week trips to other towns/cities. Americans call them 'greyhounds' or 'greyhound buses'.

Subway - Either the sandwich shop or a term for public pedestrian underpasses. The underground rail is either the Metro or the Underground for the most part.

Rhyming slang is a thing, the most famous set is the Cockney area of London, but it does show up elsewhere. For example: Apples & Pears (stairs), Berkshire Hunt/Berk (cunt), etc. (Try this for some possible Londoner sayings: [[https://thetrove.is/Books/Fireborn/Fireborn%20Speaking%20the%20Queen%27s%20English.pdf]])

There's also some local phrases that might come up, for instance as a Brummie if I ended up going out of my way to get somewhere due to blocked paths, detours or the like I'd probably say something like 'yeah, sorry 'bout that, had to go right round the Wrekin to get anywhere', the Wrekin being a fairly large hill in Shropshire.

Something else to think about is Britain has a /lot/ of accent/dialect density, so not everyone even from the same street will speak exactly alike. Welsh tend to be more 'sing-song' when speaking or back of the throat growl and burr sort of sounds.

Scots and Irish have similarities, but emphasize things differently, so you'll hear them knocking off different letters as they speak compared to English people and even there, there's a good bit of north/south divide.

It might be worth while poking around for 'speak like <region>' lessons to have a listen to for some of the cadence to folks' speech.

Beyond the obvious big things like 'Semmesters', 'Chips' and 'Pants'. I think it matters not if you say 'gotta' or 'got to' because there is likely different places who say different things anyway. While the nuance of someone from Yorkshire dropping letters in words 'So they might pop down t' shops, or make a cup o' Tea' or a Scottish person occasionally saying things like 'wee' or 'cannae' can make a Fic feel really alive, unless you were fairly intimately aware of how the different regions all spoke it would be far too easy to fall into making everyone sound like a massive British stereotype.

Literally every professional author with a tutorial that I've ever seen (and I've read/seen a LOT of them) has said some variant on "Write. Fuck up. Learn from it. Write better."

I would say that getting reviews from wankers and the tact-challenged is just par for the course in bigger fandoms like this though, no matter the topic. If it's not British-ness, it's SPAG or canon or fanon or the proper way to make cheese or whatever else. And as unhelpful as it is to say, you should try to ignore those people.

*** As a counter point to your point about ‘a scottish person occasionally saying things like wee and cannae can make a fic feel really alive'

As a Scot, I would warn non-natives from writing like this for a multitude of reasons. Randomly throwing well known words into speech, isn't natural. The linguistic situation in Scotland is really complex, because you've got a multitude of influences. Gàidhlig and Scots have influenced my speech for instance, but it's really difficult to convey in text format. You speak in different registers to different people. I would talk to my Scots speaking friends and my mother in Scots but for my other wider friend group I would speak in Scottish Standard English.

I'm partially jaded, especially with written Scots because of the Scots Wikipedia fiasco.

I would advise authors to just say a character speaks with a specific accent and leave it at that, without attempting to try and include complicated localisms and dialects. Focus on the broad picture, the stuff everyone would hypothetically know.

Here is a list of stuff the twins actually got up to at Hogwarts according to the wiki:

1st Year: Nicked the Marauders Map from Filch's office

2nd Year: Nothing confirmed

3rd Year: Bewitching snowballs, nicking Percy's prefect badge

4th Year: Teasing Ginny, "escorting" Harry as the "Heir of Slytherin", taking the piss out of Percy

5th Year: Gave Harry the Map

6th Year: Started inventing joke items, tried (and failed) to get past the age line, flogged their joke items to fellow students

7th Year: Tried to test joke products on 1st years, shoved Montague into the vanishing cabinet, tried to piss off Umbridge as much as possible, last hurrah with fireworks.

​

None of this is the kind of school wide anarchy that fanfics appear to portray, other than the end of their 7th year, which is specifically designed to /undermine the authority of a Headmistress they hate/.

You mean Scones for breakfast? Personal choice but pretty rare. They tend to be more of a snacking thing (for younger people) or a social-sitting thing (if you're an older person).

Tea can vary. For some, it's the equivalent of coffee in high-flying busy city types. I have a friend who properly brews twelve cups a day, but she's regarded as quite mad for doing so and none of us have any idea where she finds the bloody time. For others, it can be a purely meal-time drink (and even then, sometimes it'll be just for Breakfast, others will have it with most meals). And for others, it's kind of the same tone as the 'having a beer and watching the game' thing. You might sit down in the evening to watch soaps (soap operas, like Coronation Street), then get up during the ad break to make tea (which is enough of a thing that our power companies and infrastructure actually boost inputs during that time). I wouldn't ever really say it's a replacement for Lunch, but it'd quite often be an accompaniment.

We have had Hurricanes, but we tend to call them 'Storm Whatever'. We also do occasionally get Wildfires (wikipedia says we had over a hundred in 2019, for example), but they're a lot less 'we risk killing an entire forest with this' than the US ones seem to be.

***** Indeed. The Redbricks are only really known to the people who actually care about that sort of thing, I'd say. I think the kind of historical precedence of those six unis is kind of our version of the prestige of the US ones - they like the high-flying moneyed aspect, we like the history and tradition aspect. I'd definitely agree Oxbridge is the direct UK version of the Ivy League though - the schools every overachiever wants to get into and all. :)

And yep. I only know because I have a bunch of friends who are mildly obsessed with walking through green belts and national parks and such. I also only know about the storms because I'm a worldbuilding nerd who goes way too deep into climatological details. :D

*** To expand upon other comments, in boarding schools "prep" is the work you do outside of class, but it is also the time officially set aside for that work to be completed.

In most boarding schools the school day will end, then you will have after-school activities, then a bit of free time, then dinner, then after dinner you will have prep - a supervised study period where students complete their homework.

There's no mention of prep in the books, but there is a hint of it in the movies - see the scene in GoF where Ron is asking Hermione about who she is taking to the ball and Snape is hitting Harry and Ron on the head with a book.

** One thing that always sticks out is when authors use grades to describe primary school classes, as in England it's School Years. Primary schooling goes from Year One to Year six (with nursery and reception for younger students). Hogwarts would start in Year 7, or the start of High School. There's no sophomore or junior or anything.

Schools go up to age 16, and Year 11, when students take their GCSE's. Then there's 2 years of Sixth Form which can also be called Years 12 and 13, where students take theirore specialised A-Levels in preparation for University.

This is the modern structure, exam names might have been different in the 90's. Also, I haven't mentioned Middle School, as they are regional, and the age of moving to Hogwarts is more on line with the Primary to High School system.

Field Trip tends to get used technically, as a contraction of ‘Fieldwork Trip', used in Geography and Archaeology. I had heard that the US doesn't do Geography as a subject like we do, whether that's true I couldn't say. Geography for us is learning about the natural environment like ‘River Landscapes', ‘Limestone Caves and Pavements', ‘Environmental Hazards' ‘Human Geography' and ‘Glaciation'.

Since I did Scottish Qualifications, we had to do two field trips, one on River Landscapes in Argyll, which involved standing Waist deep in a River in the middle of November. The second one was down in Yorkshire, going caving and measuring Footpath Erosion, that sort of thing.

*** Milk in tea can also depend on the type of tea. We've sorta got two broad types - fragrant flavoured stuff (Earl Grey, Green Tea, Peppermint, etc) and builder's brews (P.G. Tips). I've never heard of anyone putting milk in the Earl Grey type of Tea - it'd be something that makes people stop and go "Huh." at the very least. The Earl Grey type would probably go with some kind of fruit juice (I like it with lemon, personally) or a spice of some kind (cinnamon and the like).

There are some unique combinations and tastes out there though - I sometimes use it as a character trait to make them seem odder and more Byron-esque. For example, I knew one kid during my Sixth-form years that used to bring in a flask of Twinings Fruit-Herbal Tea that he'd apparently mixed with powdered spiced nuts. A very specific kind of nut, mind - he was very emphatic about it - though I forget exactly which. This was regarded as being quite mad when people found out and he got a lot of shit for it initially. I used that for an evil Vizier-type character in a D&D game once and the moment my players found out what was in his cup, they all concluded "Villain." :)

I second Toast - we don't really have half and half (I had to google it). Might be a thing in Marks and Spencers or Waitrose (they're our expensive middle-class shops), but I haven't been in one of those recently enough to recall. Sounds interesting though, I'm kind of curious what it's like.

In my Northern, working class upbringing, tea is almost always English Breakfast and it comes with milk and sometimes sugar. You wouldn't have lemon with it and definitely no cream. If you want something else, you would need to specify it.

In terms of milk, there are 3 types. You have full fat, semi skimmed and skimmed. These are often referred to as blue top, green top and red top. Milk comes in bottles, not jugs. It's generally measured in pints, but you wouldn't say you had 10oz of milk. That wouldn't make sense. You'd say half or a quarter of a pint, or talk in millilitres (spelt re at the end).

Imperial measurements are different to American measurements. Even if we're saying the same word, we might mean a different thing entirely. However, the metric system has been in use for decades now.
