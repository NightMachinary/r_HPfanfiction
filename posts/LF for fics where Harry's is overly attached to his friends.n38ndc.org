Dursley's raising of Harry makes him wanting to have friends and seek for affection. He befriends Ron and Hermione and wants them to focus on him and don't want leave to him. This becomes worse until where Harry does anything to keep their attention on him even manipulating them and seeking more attention. I couldn't explain what I want to express. Hope you get what I am trying to say


** Canon. I'm pretty sure that he's at least overly attached to Ron. Ron did some pretty shitty things as a friend, and Harry always seemed to just accept Ron back again. I mean i'm not bashing him here, teenagers in general can be little shits, but Harry seemed too much of a door mat at times with regards to Ron in my personal opinion.

*** There are only two instances when Ron isn't that great to Harry. In the fourth year when his name comes out of the cup and he is jealous and in the seventh when under the influence of the horcrux he decides to leave them. Both this instances are also quite understandable considering that: 1) Ron was always the overlooked one and here was Harry get even more attention and well, he's 14 and 2) he felt the horcrux more than he others. On the other hand Ron is the friend that time and again stood up for and was generous to his friend. The list of which is too long but standing up on a broken leg against someone who he thought of was a murderer, going into a forest following spiders when he has severe arachnophobia are just a few. I am so sick of Ron bashing!

**** That's fine, and mostly accurate. I didn't write that to bash Ron, just give my view on the character. I know I was a little shit when I was younger myself. I like Ron as a character apart from the TWT one. Ron knows all the crap Harry has gone through, and that betrayal hit a little close to home for me. For the most part he has been a loyal and stead fast friend, but throw in fame, and money... yeah. He has to be pretty dense at that point if he even for one second believed Harry wanted that, even you can admit that much.

**** Yeah but if you consider it, in the Goblet of fire, Ron who is 14 and has hormones to deal with as well, is already feeling pretty sensitive. Harry has to buy him the ominoculars, his dress robes are horrendous etc etc. I don't think it is even that he is logically thinking about the fame and money or even thinking that is what Harry wants but it is a moment of feeling in the shadows again. And to be fair when Harry is talking to Sirius and Ron hears him he does look like he wants to apologise but well, he is stubborn. As for leaving Harry, that had more to do with self esteem issues and fear/worry for the rest of his family all amplified by the horcrux. I mean if you have low self esteem you already have a voice inside you that says that you aren't good enough and the horcrux just makes every instance proof of your worst fears
