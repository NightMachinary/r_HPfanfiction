  This is a Self Insert. He's a bit of a grouch and doesn't like people, but he also hasn't had any friends for a while so he might be willing to give it another go. He's never seen Harry Potter or read the books. But it's a children's series, so it'll probably be fine. His name is Art. Artorius Caecilius Crouch, to be exact. But don't call him that or he'll get sort of annoyed.

  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.

  I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor.(A realistic attempt at an SI fic, with absolutely zero Mary-Sue-ishness).

  What use is knowledge of the future when she can't bring herself to care? She owed this world nothing - this story would continue without her. Death took a chance, gambled on the wrong soul, and now she has to pay for it. No one ever said the Wizarding World would be all fun and games, especially not with a Dark Lord's imminent revival, a Headmasters penchant for manipulation, and a Boy-Who-Will-Die's stubborn tenacity. Not that it will matter soon, anyway.Semi-Realistic, Somewhat Dark SI/OC (more OC than SI).

  Being a Chosen One is hard work. The Dark Lord of your universe is out to get you, people you love definitely die, and you have to suffer a lot. In fiction, it makes for a compelling story. In real life not so much. She isn't sure how she boarded this particular train but she wants off. Self-Insert. SI-OC.

  Death was supposed to be the end but instead she found herself reincarnated, an orphan of the wrong race, wrong country, wrong time and the wrong universe. Though she yearns for death, she must breathe still - for what other purpose does she have being reborn as Lord Voldemort's twin sister, if not to change fate itself? Reincarnation. SI. OC Fic. AU

  You won't believe me when I tell you who I was reborn as, but I'll tell you anyway. There was no Harry James Potter. Instead, there was an Adaline Lily Potter. Yes, you read this right.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history.
