Most stories set during that time follow the scheme of:

- Harry is brooding

- Teenage angst

- Some realisation that he has to get better

- More Angst

- (Goblin/Lordship stuff)

- Training montage (with optional involvement of the Ministry 6)

And at some point, the love interest is inserted, usually a Mary Sue.

To be frank, I am sick of that scheme. So are there any stories which break that mould, stories like "Call Me" or "Life goes on" where the angst is quickly abandoned in favour of more interesting things?

Any female pairing for Harry is fine, fem!Harry is fine, just please no Death Eater whitewashing, Harry being assimilated into the Weasley family or m/m.


** linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic; A Boon for Bill) have no post ministry angst whatsoever that I remember.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.

*** Half-Blood Romantic is bound to have a whole shitstorm of angst once that infidelity thing gets resolved/exposed. And Boon was funny for the most part but fizzled out towards the end. Might have to reread it though since it was definitely good for a few laughs.

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; The Legacy by storytellerspw) Though in both of them has a Harry that realizes he needs to train to eventually win against Voldemort, there isn't any of the that same old cliche. There is something in the later (like in the 7th before the latest) chapters where Harry does train in a "trainy montage" but no-where near what the trope stupidly fest that usually happens with this scenario, in Eclipse. So that basically 800k words into the fic for a mini "training montage".

Neither pairing is a Mary Sue by a long fucking marging, both are stubborn as fuck, paranoid, angry and confused, nowhere near OP like sometimes happens, but usefull to the plot in a way that isn't boring. These 2 fics, together with Stages of Hope, Mind Arts and Grow Young with Me are my favourite 5 fics alltime.

There is something that could be considered these days as tropey in Legacy(involves the horcrux) but its done in a believable way and very very well. Also, it is a marriage contract, but its by far the best contract fic there is, with the fic Contractual Invalidation as a close second.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
