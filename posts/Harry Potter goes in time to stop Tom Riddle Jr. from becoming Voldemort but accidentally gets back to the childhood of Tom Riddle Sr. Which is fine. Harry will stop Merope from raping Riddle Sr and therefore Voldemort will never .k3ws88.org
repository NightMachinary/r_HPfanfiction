** "Well that makes my job easier. Hey, Tom. I used magic to come from the future to warn you that Merope Gaunt is planning to use a love potion on you. So watch out for that."

** So what was Riddle sr parents against sending him to Hogwarts or did he know about magic all along but didn't know about the love potion?

*** well I figured it was just unknown he was a wizard and they didn't recognize any magical mishaps around them as caused by Riddle Sr. but just weird thing that happened in the area. Harry would find a way to get someone to recognize he was a overlooked wizard and send him to hogwarts

#+begin_quote
  Merope's one wish was to be Cinderella for at least one night. To dance and see her fated prince, Tom Riddle Sr. once more. Sometimes wishes don't turn out like you thought they would. AU. One-shot.
