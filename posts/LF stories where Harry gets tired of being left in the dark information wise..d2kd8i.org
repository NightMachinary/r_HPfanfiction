** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/][His Mother's Love]] by White Squirrel, linkffn(10132530), fits perfectly:

- Proactive Harry forced answers out of Dumbledore during their private lesson in Year 6.
- No bashing
- No change in friends, in fact, his revelations stopped the Hermione and Ron fight.
- They took effective actions to finish off Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.
