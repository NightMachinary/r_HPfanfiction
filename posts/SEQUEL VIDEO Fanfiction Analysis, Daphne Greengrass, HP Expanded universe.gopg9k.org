Hello guys! I'm the chap who did the editorial on Daphne Greengrass about a week ago. Thank you so much for all the attention and feedback that got! I'm back with a pseudo-Part 2, this time talking more on the subject of Harry Potter fanfiction as a whole, why it's so popular and why I believe it's almost required reading to experience the franchise at its fullest. Fair want I roast JK a bit in it - if you're one of the few who tries to ignore her transphobia then do watch out for that.

Hope you guys enjoy this one too! If you do, please support the channel by chucking us a cheeky like and subscribe! I'm absolutely up for doing more on the topic if it proves recurring popularity! And same as last time, any chance feedback could be posted on the video and not this post? Really helps me out against the Youtube algorithm! Thank you again guys!

** What was the Founders series? I don't think I've heard of that one.
