I'm just looking for something that'll make me cry like a baby ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Would love it if it was Harry/Luna but that's not necessarily a requirement


** Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker)

Linkffn(Love and love again by foreverandnow; Stages of Hope)

None of them are Harry/Luna but they're good.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. Devilbiss

  Lily Potter is dead. No. Lily Potter should be dead.

  The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.

  (Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

#+begin_quote
  Lily and James survived Voldemort's attack, but their infant son was believed dead. Twelve years later, Harry Potter is found and brought home, but the real struggle has just begun. Ensemble fic about a family's recovery as old enemies return.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/457151][Stages of Hope]] - wow, that looks very intriguing (esp "Mad Hatter!Harry" tag), thanks for the rec

  ‚ÄúYour robes are...red,‚Äù Hermione finally said, strangely accusing.

  ‚ÄúBurgundy!‚Äù Severus protested. Red was tacky. Burgundy, however, had class.

  ‚ÄúAnd what did you do to your hair?‚Äù she asked in horrified fascination.

  Snape's hand rose to his scalp.

  ‚ÄúNothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAh, I see.‚Äù She nodded and stepped back. ‚ÄúAlternate dimension. It must be.‚Äù

** Survivor is one of the saddest and most tear-inducing stories I've ever read. It's Harmony from Ron's POV and it is absolutely heartbreaking.

Not necessarily Harry/Luna but they are still great friends.

The story IS WBWL and he doesn't meet Luna till later in the story but okay

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/81/][last chapter]] of the recently finished "The Granger Principle" is extremely depressing

As for a full length fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]] is quite depressing. Although it's not Harry/Luna, she's featured very prominently
