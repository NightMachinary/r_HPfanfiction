  She had fallen through the veil of death, unaware of the path she was doomed to walk. It all seemed like fun and games at the start - another chance. She'd never been so wrong. OOC. fem!Harry. Lovecraftian Horror. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, extreme violence, and mature topics.
