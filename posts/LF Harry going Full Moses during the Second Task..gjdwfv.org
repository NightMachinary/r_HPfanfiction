Stepping out, and parting the Black Lake either side of him, just casually walking through the mud that remains to get his Hostage before walking out.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), definitely, and Dumbledore is not pleased:

  "While that does explain Mr. Krum's unfortunate injury and your decision to take all three hostages -- destroying a merperson relic in the process -- I'm afraid I still don't understand what you did afterwards," Dumbledore said, looking very tired.

  This was a small improvement over the rest of the judges, who appeared livid.

  "It was a perfectly logical decision," I insisted. "The mermen were using their environmental advantage against me. So I took it from them."

  "You banished all the water in the lake. You truly don't consider that excessive?" Dumbledore asked.

  "Not at all. Besides, I figured the spectators would have a better time if they could actually watch the task. Really, I was doing you all a favor."

  Dumbledore said, "But the merpeople are unable to survive on air for more than a few minutes. You greatly endangered their lives, my boy."

*** You skipped the best part!

  Dumbledore sighed. "Could you return the lake water, now that the task is over?"

  "I would do that," I said, "except that I'm not entirely sure where I sent it."

  *Meanwhile, at Privet Drive*

  Petunia Dursley stood knee-deep in the flooded street, staring blankly at what was once her house. The front door had floated to the very end of her waterlogged lawn. Every window was broken, and what little she could see of her immaculate carpets and organized kitchen was entirely ruined. She didn't dare to think of what had happened to the garden.

  As she picked up a floating photograph of baby Dudley, Petunia wondered -- for a moment -- where her life had gone so wrong. But the answer was obvious:

  The moment she accepted Harry Potter into her life. This was all his fault. Things usually were.

  With a firm set to her mouth and her spindly fingers curled into a fist, Petunia trudged towards her home in the hope that some of her previous life was still salvageable.

  They were, she decided, moving.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?
