Like a gun and some C4.


** Starfox5 stories tend to have some of those.

In Linkffn(The Arithmancer), Hermione develops magic chemistry and creates a series of chemicals, including C4 for the war. She barely gets to use any and after the battle of Hogwarts is over there's this scene where she unpacks her magically expanded bag:

#+begin_quote
  "Magic-enhanced guns---Say, do you know if the Firearms Act specifies the method of propulsion for guns? Like, does it apply to air guns and stuff?"

  "I...don't know offhand, but I'd think it does," Dad said.

  "Well, this thing's illegal as hell, then."

  "Hermione!" Mum scolded.

  "Sorry, Mum. Being in a war, I've picked up some habits. Anyway, other weapons. You've seen Snickersnack, of course. Er...explosives. C-4, C-4, more C-4. Why did I make so much C-4?" she asked as she piled an alarming amount of plastic explosive on the floor like building blocks.

  "C-4?"

  She shrugged as if it weren't a big deal. "I was getting desperate. Anyway, hand grenades. Smoke grenade, tear gas, knockout gas, flashbang even though I didn't need it."

  "What's this one?" Dad picked up one she hadn't identified.

  "Nerve gas."

  "WHAT?"

  "Don't worry. I didn't use it." Though I might have if Bellatrix had given me the chance. "And I can decompose the molecules and make it safe. I just went a little crazy toward the end, throwing together anything I thought might be remotely useful."

  "You...you weren't kidding about the Hague Convention thing, were you?" he said faintly.

  "It wasn't as bad as you're probably thinking right now, Dad...But I admit I tested an awful lot of stuff. Like this one: chlorine trifluoride. Nasty stuff. It burns anything. Chews through sand like sawdust. And some sulfuric acid. I've got some rocket fuel here. And then there's my older stuff. My complete collection of elements leeched from the soil." She pulled a box with many chambers with small blocks of metals of various size in it.

  A flash of worry came over Dad's face, and he grew stern, standing over her. "Hermione, if you built a nuclear weapon---"

  "No, I never found any rich enough uranium deposits," she said casually.

** Petunia uses various guns in my story "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider". The Muggleborn Resistance members in my story "Divided and Entwined" use both guns and explosives extensively in addition to magic. An alternate Ron is the main Character in my story "The Granger Principle", and as a muggle, he uses guns. Guns and bombs are also used in my stories "Harry Potter and the Spygirl" and "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution".

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
