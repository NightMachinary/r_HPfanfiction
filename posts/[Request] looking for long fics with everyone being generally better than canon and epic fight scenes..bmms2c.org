I'm looking for fanfic that are fairly long and include the uplifting of most if not all canon characters. Especially looking for absolutely edge of my seat fight scene. Like the Harry vs Voldemort in A Black Comedy and the fight between Hermione and Bellatrix in The Annals of Arithmancy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): all three sides are cunning and ruthless, there are many brutal fights, the Final Battle is epic, and Voldemort almost pulls out a win despite being badly setup by Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The Hermione/Bellatrix fight was in Lady Archimedes, the second part of the trilogy, not Annals which is the third.

Anyways, here's a few:

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Epic fights involving the Black Phantom in the first Voldemort war. Mostly Regulus, Sirius, James and Lily, with some Dumbledore and Voldemort action.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Hermione is a guerilla war leader, Justin is her second in command and their muggle weapons supplier, Seamus is the bomb expert (cause he's the irish guy with relatives in the IRA), and together they deal with death eaters while the ministry does nothing. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron hunt Horcruxes with Dumbledore.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

After Voldemort's defeat, the elite purebloods try to stay in control by passing a marriage law. They all get killed by a very angry mob lead by Hermione and the DA. The governments of other magical countries get nervous.

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Harry dies after getting captured by death eaters before even finding out about magic. He wakes up on the morning before. Over the next few years he dies dozens of times and gets to repeat parts of his life over and over again until he's so powerful that he can just walk into the Voldemort controlled ministry and kill everyone.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Hermione gets framed for theft and expelled and seeks revenge. Dumbledore needs a thief for the order who can break into death eater homes and steal books about dark magic. Harry really wants to become an auror. What could go wrong? Mostly sneaky heist action with some battle scenes.

Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)

The first scene involves Petunia killing a sand drake with a rocket launcher. Do I need to say more?

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
