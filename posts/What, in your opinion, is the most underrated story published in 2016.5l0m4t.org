** Linkffn(11923164) - I've only seen it recommended once on this sub and the number of faves and reviews seem much too low for such a wonderful take on Luna, and how she could have had a huge impact on Snape. Canon compliant IIRC which I always enjoy, like seeing the secret backstory that's happening simultaneously as the HP books.

For being a FSN crossover that didn't make me quit in three chapters and want to pull my hair out.

I will admit that I rarely look for new fics, unless they are recommended here, or show up on spacebattles, so this is underrated, not the most underrated.

Edit: Here's a fun excerpt

--------------

“You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. I can help you there. You'll have much better things to do with your time than hang out with a Weasley.” Draco finished by gesturing towards Shirou.

“Weasley?” Shirou said. Iris also looked confused.

“Trying to deny it, Weasley?” Draco asked looking him over. “Red hair, and second hand clothes. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who you are. Or were you trying to pull some prank on me, as your brothers are famous for? If so, it was a rather poor attempt.”

Shirou stood from his seat to look Draco in the eye.

“Shirou Emiya.” He said, sticking out his hand. “First year at Hogwarts.”

** 'Black Luminary' linkffn(12125300) is one of my favorite large scale AU's. It's still in first year and there are a lot of questions unanswered but the set-up is fantastic and it has some very interesting characters.

Harry comes to school, still somewhat famous but not for defeating a Dark Lord but rather for forsaking his Light family name for the Blacks. It focuses on the divide between Light and Dark sided families after the Ministry went through large scale reforms after the war with Grindelwald. No Voldemort, no BWL but still plenty of political tension.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406][There's Always the Moon]] is a GREAT Draco/Harry fic that was written this year. It's technically slash but there is nothing graphic in the fic at all - IIRC not even a kiss. Without giving too much away is a canon compliant EWE mystery fic where Draco runs his own apothecary and on the full moon wakes up not knowing what happened the night before. He enlists Harry's help to figure things out. (It's not a Werewolf fic.) There are a bunch of cool twists and turns in this and the mystery is REALLY well done. Linkao3(6264406)

  Draco's life after the war is everything he wanted it to be: it's simple, and quiet, and predictable, and safe. But when a mysterious curse shatters the peace he'd worked so hard to build, there's only one person he can trust to help him. After all, Harry Potter has saved his life before. Now Draco has to believe that Potter will be able to do it one more time. (A remix of If the Sun Goes Black by pasdexcuses)
