I've noticed that there are very few fics with Ron in Slytherin. We have Harry in all four houses, Hermione in at least three (haven't seen Hufflepuff!Hermionie) and Hufflepuff!Ron, but no Slytherin!Ron or Ravenclaw!Ron.

Also, side note: Draco always gets sorted into Slytherin. Anything where he isn't there?

It's a series where the entire trio is in Slytherin. I have yet to see a fic with Ron in Ravenclaw, but I'd be down for it.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Fate have Slytherin Ron. Both are quite good, but just a warning, Prince is a dead fic so get invested at your own peril.

I remember reading a fic where Fred and George meddled with the sorting hat and Harry's year all got different sortings, with Draco and Harry being best friends in Hufflepuff. I think it was on Live Journal tho, so who knows where it is.

I also read a one shot of Draco being sorted into Hufflepuff and repeatedly trying to get expelled, but the name escapes me.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

*** the one where Fred and George meddle with the Sorting Hat might have been uploaded to Ao3? The Switchverse by Corvidae9 fits that description. Ron gets sorted into Ravenclaw

Don't know if the bot can link to series... linkao3(Switchverse by corvidae9)

It starts with the oneshot "Switch" linkao3(Switch by corvidae9). Currently spans Years 1-3 with some vignettes, all complete though haven't updated since 2007. Still worth a read imo

** Some Slytherin!Ron fics I've read on FFN that I remember:

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][Choices]] by random-fruitcake04. Seer!Ron fic.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/][Fate]] by TheTrueSpartan. Seer!Ron fic, gets dark as it progresses.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13308768/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magical-Guardian][Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian]] by Sursr. Good!Dursley's, Ron isn't part of the Golden Trio, Dumbledore!bashing. I recommended it to a user and they dropped it due to too helpful goblins, so heads up.

I also found some Ravenclaw!Ron fics:

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13735970/1/Imprisonment-Without-A-Home][Imprisonment Without A Home]] by Love Gems. A semi one-shot that's only one chapter but spans all 7 Years. More in-depth before and during First Year, kind-off simple, a bit bashy.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22859302/chapters/54635698][Harry Potter and The Year That Four 1st Years Solved The Inter-House Unity Problem]] by thefandomlife. This one has Gryffindor!Draco and Hufflepuff!Hermione. Ron has dyslexia.
