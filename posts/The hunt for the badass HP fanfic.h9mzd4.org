:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Fanfiction readers! Help me find a fanfic!

It's after the war. Ron has memory loss OR has had all his memory of magic erased and lives at a group home with Draco who is called D-somethig and a muggle girl, but neither wizard knows who the other are and so they become friends. Lots of trauma, and the girl's name starts with an L and she is suicidal and she and D become a couple

On the sidelines, the same thing has happened to Hermione and Harry, but at the end of the fanfic Hermione accidentally disapparates and regains her memory and something happens to Harry, and Ron also regains his memory along with Draco ans theu keep being friends

I read it either on ff. net or Ao3, and it is a completed fic.

I have googled everything I can think of but nope.

Anyone know what fic I'm looking for?
