** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/The-Resistance-of-Azkaban][Resistance of Azkaban]] is quite good. Voldemort wins the war and takes over the government, but remains of the Order of the Phoenix form a resistance group, based in Fortress Azkaban. It's finished, and there's a started sequel up, but it only has one chapter. Summary below:

#+begin_quote
  It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban

** I just caught up with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir]["The Black Heir"]] an amazing fic with dark Harry. It's on hiatus right now, but it and it's sequel are both very long. There is also slash I should add, if that's not your thing then avoid it.

**** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095379][Breeding Darkness]] is the only other one that comes to mind. It was great until the original author stopped writing. I don't really like the new author as much though.

** Is it that you're looking for stories with a tragic ending, or are you looking for stories where Harry starts at extreme disadvantage because the bad guys already won?

If the latter, I can recommend these two:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]] by Lorien829

- Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.\\

and

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]] by Clell65619

- Harry's world ends as everyone he loves is killed when the Death Eaters attack Bill and Fleur's wedding. Is there such a thing as a Second Chance? Various Ships. Dark world, Sexual situations, Slavery, Extremely AU. Very damaged people.

*** I am not looking to read something with a tragic ending, just things about the world after the Dark side wins, or set during the war with the Dark side winning.

I do not want to read stories that are focused on lightside characters.

** It hasn't been updated for a while, but check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7998381/1/The-Horcrux][The Horcrux]] when you get the chance. The first war ended with Voldemort and Dumbledore at a stalemate, leaving Britain divided like East and West Germany during the Cold War. It revolves around Harry who has recently escaped his life as Voldemort's horcrux-heir and is living undercover as a squib on the Light side of Britain.
