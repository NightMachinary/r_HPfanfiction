** I don't think people necessarily need to be taught this. As the book says, the result of bad writing is that the sentence /feels awkward/. It's not bad writing because it breaks an arbitrary rule, it's bad writing because it doesn't feel right when you read it.

So all a writer needs to do to avoid writing in this way is to read their own work in a thorough and critical way and be prepared to perform significant edits to those parts which do not read well. If all fanfic writers did this, then the quality of fanfic writing would shoot up (though of course, bad decisions about content would still persist). But I wouldn't hold my breath. Most fanfic writers will never try to improve their own work. They receive enough uncritical praise that they're happy to just pump out the same work.

*** Academically I agree with you. However, some people do not have the skillset to read in a critical way. And given that a lot of writing seems to be personal, many are defensive about their writing and are thus unwilling to see the critique as positive and make changes.

As a side note, I want to know what textbook this is from.

***** Not everyone is a native English speaker.

My high school English books had word lists and the grammar was more about verb conjugations, how to count and how to tell time (half seven is 7:30 in English, but it would be 6:30 in a lot of germanic countries).

Things like conditional verb forms, less vs fewer and a lot of other things I just had to figure out from reading books and then googling things I wondered about.

Strangely enough we were taught about who vs whom, even though it seems from my observation that most native English speakers have mostly stopped using 'whom' altogether.

*** I like to read well written fan fiction stories but what people need to realize is fan fiction authors aren't making money. Honestly, fan fiction authors don't get much out of committing to writing other than maybe some exposure in the community. 80% of the fan fiction out there isn't considered to be good writing. 20% is probably amazing to acceptable writing when it comes to plot, characterization, and grammar. However, I read stories from that 80% group because I like the pairing or the trope and I don't give 2 shit about the grammar.

Don't get me wrong bad grammar turns me off, especially stories that don't even have concise dialogues. I'm open to reading stories where author is explaining more than he is actually showing the reader through actions and dialogue.

If I don't like a story, I just skip it. There is over 100,000+ fan fiction stories so there is a lot to choose from. As a reader I can't complain about amateurs who have a hobby of writing stories based on the Harry Potter universe. People who want to read well written fan fiction that reads like novels from published authors should look at DLP library (I do so myself when I'm in the mood).

But if I was an author, I'd rather have 1,000 reviews praising my work than like a couple of guys ripping it apart as if I'm trying to be a published author.

I think the best way to encourage better fan fiction is for people like OP to reach out to authors with good stories and provide them with beta services. You want to improve someone else's writing? reach out to them and actually help them rather than reviewing their work under the lenses of some hotshot publishing editor.

**** Depends on the fandom. In one of my fandoms, it seems that the end game for at least 40% is to be published.

*** I don't think the book is presenting an arbitrary rule so much as revealing a pattern that many readers appreciate, on a subconscious level, but would otherwise be unable to name.

That is, you're obviously right that most fanfic is so neglected a second reading would pay enormous dividends. But I think you're overestimating the degree to which most people are capable of noticing and isolating sentence-level awkwardness without training or prompting. (Exhibit A: That collection of [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html][20 terrible Dan Brown sentences]] from a few years back. When I was teaching Intro to Creative Writing I'd have given him a C- and a long talk during office hours if he'd turned a final draft in with any of those, but 10 million people disagree with me very strongly, don't care, and/or don't notice.)

Good writing is even more difficult to grasp, which is almost the point; it gets out of its own way and keeps your focus on the story it's telling you. And while you certainly can't memorize or prescribe your way to it, you /can/ be taught to observe it more closely; as with birdwatching or baseball or anything else, you take in more information once you have a vocabulary and a set of concepts to bring to bear on what you're watching.

I would guess that somewhat less than half of fanfiction writers out there have ever even thought of "balance" as an idea that can apply to a sentence. They might like a balanced sentence more than an unbalanced one, but they probably couldn't tell you why.

To put it in more concrete terms: It's easier to perform a magic trick once somebody's A) told you it's a trick and B) showed you how it works.

** To build on Taure's comment, I would add that another issue is that a lot of fanfic authors haven't been exposed to good writing. Let's face it, a lot probably don't read that much, and what they do read is bad writing. So, when they do sit down to write, the model of "good writing" that they've built in their heads is actually not that great. That's why the best writers say that it's critical to be a prolific reader if you want to write - how can you recognize bad writing if you've rarely seen good writing?

*** I wholly agree with you. The first fanfiction I ever read was, to 13-year-old me, wonderfully written with perfect grammar. So much so that when I began writing my own 100+ page fic at 14, I used similar techniques in the fic I read.

It was only after being exposed to other works (fanfiction and fiction alike) that I realised my grammar was, well, not very good. I also realised that my poor grammar was due to my attempts at copying the author's writing. Needless to say, I wound up deleting my fic out of embarrassment.

The way we write and speak changes depending on what we read and hear. Someone who reads those poorly written fics is more likely to have poor writing skills, whereas someone who tends to read fics with proper grammar and spelling has a higher chance of developing better writing skills. The same also goes with published books. I'm willing to bet a rare Canadian penny that the writing style of someone who reads Twilight and 50 Shades is vastly different than the style of someone who reads Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings. What we experience always has a direct impact in how we develop and many young or new authors try to mimic the writing style of their favourite authors. What they don't realise is that some of these favourite authors have poor writing skills.

By Dumbledore's beard, I still can't get over how awful my first fic was.
