#+TITLE: A little bit of a weird request, but I would like something where Harry goes back in time to the Marauders Era and falls for Lily. And then has to deal with the moral dillema of her technically being his mother. I've heard there are supposed to be a lot of stories like that, but haven't seen any.

** Have you watched Dark on Netflix? A character goes back in time and accidentally becomes their own grandmother. What if Harry was actually his own father? Incest inception.

*** Dark was just... meh. It definitely had a nice concept and good execution, but the plot could've been resolved in like three episodes if the characters just /talked/. Especially Claudia, feels like her whole purpose was to be as cryptic and unhelpful as possible.

*** This reminds me of Longshot and Shatterstar (X-Factor). In Harry Potter terms it'd be something like...

James (Longshot) is a corrupted clone of Harry (hence the different eye colour) who's sent back in time where he eventually meets and falls in love with Lily (Dazzler) and thereby fathers his own father.

Of course, the straight Harry is his own father idea makes the POA scene foreshadowing.

*** So I have to ask (maybe you don't know)....but did they steal the plot point from futurama?

**** I don't know exactly either and I'm not sure if you have watched the series or not.

So I don't want to spoil things and thus my answer might raise more questions then answers - but to me Dark felt like a proper time-travel story, well though out from the beginning to the end, and every point (like someone becoming their own grandmother) comes from this plan. They haven't just thrown around a buntch of ideas every season to get the proper amount of episodes out, and so "stealing a plot point" seems a bit too strong. "influenced" could work, but as I havent watched futurama it is hard to tell if that is true.

Also futurama was not the first story where someone became their own ancestor. 2014 film Predestination features a similar concept, which was based on a novel from 1958.

Similar concepts are listed on the "See also" section of the novel I mentioned before (including the futurama episode): [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Zombies#See_also]]

***** That's fascinating - thanks for the information. Honestly it just made me chuckle because futurama is so ridiculous so the idea of the plot being taken seriously is quite interesting.
