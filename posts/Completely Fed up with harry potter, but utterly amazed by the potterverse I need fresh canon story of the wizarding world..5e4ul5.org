** A bit further afield:

linkffn(4508571) aka Für Das Größere Wohl by Pseudonym Sam

and

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - not canon, in that instead of Harry we have Jasmine, who gets sent back thousands of years and has to trudge her way back to the present. Try it out- it's most fun for the sections about times in the distant past. You'll love it and then curse my name for suggesting it, as it's still in-process and infrequently updated.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

There is also the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom on ff.net. linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

They're both a tad slow, and neither one holds a candle to the AQ series IMO, but they are OC's who have their own stories and don't bother visiting the HP stations of canon

**** Not exactly what you're after, but a lot of very AU stories are effectively exploring a new world (that happens to be called Britain, with a new school that happens to be called Hogwarts and a new wizard that happens to be called Harry Potter etc.)

linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is a good example of what I mean, and although it's a bit further from canon it could still conceivably be a foreign magical tradition, or something along those lines.
