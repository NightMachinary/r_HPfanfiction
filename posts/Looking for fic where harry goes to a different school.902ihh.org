So from what I remember. Harry starts to dabble in blood magic. Harry has to pass an test of sorts to get into the new school. Later they find out moody went to the same school. Harry is found to be a blood magic prodigy and skips a few years in blood magic. Harry is freinds/roomates with a vampire. The school has all sorts of creatures there learning too like werewolves, vampire, veela. Voldemort goes after the old vampire families later and thinks he wins before they show him they actually are powerfull and he made a mistake.

I do know it was on ffn.
