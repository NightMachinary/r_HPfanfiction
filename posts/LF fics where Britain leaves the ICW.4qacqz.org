/Maybe.../

But to be honest, I had contemplated an AU involving an isolated UK before I'd even heard of Brexit.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I've been working on something related to this for years, but I keep getting stuck in the middle. (It's about 70% done, but only the prologue is uploaded.) If only I'd known it was going to be so timely, maybe I could have finished it. linkffn(The Night of the Purification of Wizarding Britain)

  Britain isn't what Harry thought, or Wizarding Europe thinks. He and his friends aren't the figureheads they'd hoped to be. And if they can't discover what's going on tonight, locked inside the Wizarding League's headquarters, they'll see the purification of Wizarding Britain tomorrow morning. Diverges from canon the morning after Voldemort's death.
