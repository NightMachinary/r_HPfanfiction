:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I've been trying to find this fanfiction for the past week now that I've had more time to delve into old favorites. I've searched every single fanfiction site but have had no luck.

Here is what I think I remember:

-Based around the princess of the wizarding royal family going to her first year at Hogwarts -It didn't really have a romance interest but I have a feeling it leant towards draco or harry -It was posted on Quotev and Wattpad -The series was divided into books for each year - the first year book was complete and ranged between 75-100 pages (by Quotev count) -The second book was in progress (as of ~2018 I think??) - I think the cover had a castle in mist on it (I may be wrong on this) - I think the princess had some sort of birthday ball and received a gift from Draco (maybe??)

Anyway, I am going crazy atm because I REMEMBER reading this fic and it being really good and then when I stopped reading fanfiction for a few months I couldn't remember what it was called. When I came back to fanfic, that's when I made accounts and starting subscribing to works etc. If anyone has read this fic ( I think it was fairly popular) even if you can't find it, I'd love to know I'm not crazy :).

Thanks for the help!!
