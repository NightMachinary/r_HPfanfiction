***** They definitely know their Lovecraft, though. In fact, I'd go so far as to call this not an /HP/ fanfic with Lovecraft references but rather a Lovecraft fanfic that just happens to include /HP/ characters.

** Luna takes the boiling oil of the fries and splatters Lucius Malfoy with it.

"Don't you get it," Luna said daintily. "I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me."

The death eaters swarmed her with binding spells to lock her away.

"Thank god she hit Malfoy," a minor death eater said. "He was a dick."
