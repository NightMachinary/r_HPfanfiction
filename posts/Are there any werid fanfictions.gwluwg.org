***** wasnt there a fic where harry (if iirc) sent a letter to dumbledore pretending to be tom and it saying something about a rendezvous and dumbledore was like "oh tom" and "if it's to save the world" and then later on it's "all dark lords are the same!"

** Depends on what you call weird. Could be depraved weird, crossover weird (one of the funniest fanfiction I saw was a crossover between Avengers and Life is Strange), prompts weird, weird narration,..

You should really tell us what kind of weird you're looking for.

**** Wow... that sounds bit extreme :p. What are you most favorite universe for fanfiction ? I highly recommend Konosuba, Life is Strange, Potterverse, Buffyverse and Azeroth.
