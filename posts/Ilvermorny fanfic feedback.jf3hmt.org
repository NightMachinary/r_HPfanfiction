[[https://my.w.tt/Bn7TGk1FKab]] So I was writing a fanfiction based around Ilvermorny. I sorta lost interest but now I wanna continue and make it better. I just want some outside feedback and see what some internet strangers think needs some fixing. I tried to keep it far removed from the main areas where the canon story took place so that I could have a bit more creative freedoms. But, be harsh idrc I just feel like it's missing a bit of magic.


** I skimmed the first chapter- liked the sorting scene, had good descriptions and was easy for me to visualize. It's a promising start.

2 main areas to focus on: grammar/beginning a ton of sentences with “I”, and I don't get a strong sense of motivation from the characters.

The first is self explanatory- the second... For example, why not Horned Serpent? Same reasons as in Hogwarts (house of a dark lord/pure blood supremacists) or personal reasons? What does the dad do for a living (can we get a hint at what “job” would keep him away? Felt it was too little information given). We know that the MC wants their fathers affection and it is unreturned... perhaps Ilvermorny is a chance for him to prove himself?

I would tie aspects of the character that you've expressed - excitement for ilvermorny, fear of horned serpent, desire for paternal approval - to concrete experiences you show the reader. Eg, bully is from horned serpent or father badmouths it, (hatred of horned serpent) or maybe father keeps secret from son that he'll reveal when “he's a real wizard?” (To explain ilvermorny excitement)

Of course, further chapters are perfect for this, but I'd go back and edit to plant the seeds now.

It's hard to write first person- not bad so far, keep it up!

*** Thanks for the feedback. I have no idea why it wouldn't let me respond yesterday. I will try my best to work of the issues and make the story overall more enjoyable.

I also understand the grammatical issues. They haven't often been a problem but I know if I were to ever want to turn writing into a career it's best to fix them now. But in the meantime if you know of any programs or people who would go over them with me (preferably free) I'd appreciate it.

I'm glad that the story is coming across vividly and not over descriptive. I have trouble with that as well. I thank you again for your time.
