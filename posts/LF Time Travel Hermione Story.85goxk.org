I remember that Hermione gets thrown back in time and starts to kind of bond with Lily and some other girls. They go out and decide to get magical tattoos and her's is a Phenoix. She also might have a slight drinking problem. I don't remember much else, unfortunately. But if anyone remembers or recognizes the fic from that quick snip, you my friend are awesome.


** I think it might be The Lost Lupin by MaryRoyale
