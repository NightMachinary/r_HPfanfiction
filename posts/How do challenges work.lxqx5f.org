Challenges seem to be a big part of the fandom. There's whole tropes started by challenges like the Severitus's or the Marriage law challenge... And yet, after several years in the fandom I haven't seen a single new challenge posted, let alone one that spawns multiple fics. So I started wondering about them.

On the one hand, they're simply more detailed prompts with requirements. However, even the most upvoted prompts usually just result in no more than a short story for an answer. So, where are challenges usually posted? Are they a thing of the past, or still actively happening somewhere? How come people actually answer to them, and often with multiple long stories? And what are some other interesting tidbits about them?


** Just search for collections of them.

Some are a thing of the past, some never really catch on in the first place, but there are many out there. I'm currently working on two different ones, but they won't be done for a long time.

** I think it comes down to two things.\\
1. Community: Forums or other more centralized locations where a lot of people know each other pretty well. When someone posts a challenge, it's probably other people from the same internet community responding. Reddit doesn't seem to have the same sense of community. I think it's the population being so much bigger, while also lacking easily identifiable physical characteristics like avatars. Also sigs. On a forum, you can put a link to your challenge into your sig, and 4 months later, it's still there waiting for another author to pick it up. Here... a prompt comes and goes, usually within the day it's buried. Sure you have a few people pop back in when their reminder pings them a week or two later, but when they see nobody has posted a link to a story, they leave and never return. And you simply can't (or shouldn't) write more then a one shot with only a week of planning time.

1. For Authors BY Authors. Most challenges I have seen seem to be posted by people who have a fic or two under their belt already. As such, they tend to be at least a little developed already, with some actual meat to give other authors something to work with for a longer story. In comparison, most prompts seem to be made by people who have never written anything, and had a random idea that they spew out as 1 to 2 sentences. And most of the time there simply isn't enough meat to the prompt to actually fill a longer story. And some don't have even that.
