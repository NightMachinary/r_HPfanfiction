:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was about Harry being taken in by Snape to raise him after finding out about the Dursley abuse, except I think harry was on the younger side? Maybe 7 or something. In this particular fic, Snape tells Harry pretty early on about how he was a Death Eater, and Harry forgives him for it. Later on, they spend Christmases together, and the Aurors come to investigate Draco trying to kill Harry once. They live in Spinner's End together, by the way! And I think Bellatrix got involved at some point and tried to kidnap Harry. Harry throws a rock at her or something to get away.

I think Snape gave Harry a toy at some point and he didn't know what to do with it. He also told him to go hang out in the back garden and Remus was supposed to watch him but didn't. Oh yeah, Remus and Sirius were sort of involved too, and they did visit at least one Christmas.

Anyone know this fic, please? It was a really good Severus adopts Harry. Unlike all those weird ass ones which give off pedo vibes with the whole, "Spanking teenagers for every little punishment" shit.


** Maybe it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11599344][Snape's Promise]] linkao3(11599344)? There was definitely a Bellatrix subplot, but I don't remember if Sirius and Remus were involved.

*** Except I found out there's no Sirius or Remus stuff in this one, and no Christmas scene with them either, so I must have mixed in memories of ANOTHER fic into this one. Which sucks...because now I want to find that one!

**** Hm, the Christmas scene with Sirius and Remus sound familiar from some other fic. There was some passive-aggressiveness between them and Snape and stories of James involved?

It'd be great if you managed to find that one too.

** Is it the one where Harry has a magical pet snake that helps him through his panic attacks and everyone ends up being super gay?

Or the one where Harry loses his magic due to a bone marrow transplantation gone wrong?

**** Good, 'cause both of those started well, but began to meander severely. I invested entirely too much time in them before I just couldn't push through anymore.
