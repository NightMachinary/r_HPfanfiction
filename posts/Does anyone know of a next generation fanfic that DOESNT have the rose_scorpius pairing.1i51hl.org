Those pairings are everywhere and it kills me!


** Inverarity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is very good. It's a gen story with Teddy Lupin as central character. Inverarity is one of my favorite fanfiction writers; he makes good words.

Bad Mum's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199992/1/A-Strictly-Legal-Matter][A Strictly Legal Matter]] is Draco/Rose and works as a story better than it seems it ought to.

Deadwoodpecker's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][Backward With Purpose Part II: The Book of Albus]] is astonishingly good writing that centers on Albus Severus Potter. You probably should read BWP Part I to make sense of it, though. This is no real chore, as it's one of the best stories in the fandom. Ella (Deadwoodpecker) also makes very good words.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] also has several next-gen stories that don't feature that pairing.

*** Draco/Rose? Um... is Rose of legal age in that one?

Backward with Purpose - is it an Albus/Scorpius pairing, or no pairing?

** I know lots! With every kind of character and genre :) Would you like to be more specific, with genre or length?

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All The Abstract Nouns]] - Molly, Gen. Most relatable coming of age that I've read.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] - Victoire/Teddy/Molly, romance/drama. My favorite romantic drama, excellent characterization and Weasley family politics.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] Rose, gen. Another coming of age, also mostly focuses on the Weasley family.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]] Scorpius/Lucy, humor. Very British humor, light on the romance, heavy on the downtrodden.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] Albus/OC, romance/humor-parody. If you're more interested in a well-written romcom, but it's also pretty light on the romance too.

**** I'll give two more! And I also write next gens and just finished a [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][long novel]] myself.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][Morning Waffle]] is one of my favorite humor fic; it's incomplete, but totally readable anyway.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]] Something different from the rest - it's Lily II/Moody time travel :)
