I'm aware they're cheesy, the angst is forced and they're super cliche. I'm aware they aren't remotely compliant with how time travel works, and that any characters involved are OOC. But I can't get enough of them. I especially love the ones that try to get into the idea of how time travel works in fiction, and discusses it as more than a plot device. I trust your reccomendations, and there doesn't have to be any specific pairing. Just don't mention the ones everyone knows (Delenda Est, Pride of Time, etc.) And while Time travel can be a fun plot device like in Nightmares of Futures past, I'm really only interested in the angst and romance


** Time Travel romance?

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

***** Its spoiler-ish but its just that the op asked for a TT, implying back to the past. In this fic there is a bit of TT, but its actually to the future, which is rare. And really really not at all important, except for the last 2 or 3 chapters.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

*** I love this one, (Choices)I just finished it actually! It's pretty great how they travel to multiple time periods. Louis Weasley is my favorite character besides Rose. I love a lot of this authors stories in this arc, she's very good at capturing cannon personalities. Storm of Yesterday is one of my favorite Hermione time travel fics, along with One Hundred Sixty Nine. Actually I think I love all Hermione/Class of 1977 fics. Honestly the only one I haven't seen is Hermione/Peter for obvious reasons. Boy Who Lived is also a beautiful fic. I found out about it from this subreddit actually! I loved the aspect of the DoM having to study Harry, and that there were physical consequences to Time Travel. I also loved the idea that there was some inevitability to the actions of time.

** Oh boy, I'm allll about that time travel nonsense! Having just counted, my collection of stories tagged "Time Travel" has forty five entries, so while that's a bit much for a single post I'm gonna pick a few of my favorites that seem to be a bit lesser known. This doesn't include WIPs so if you're interested in those, let me know and I'll toss a few other links your way.

Ok, so to start, if you're wanting romance and angst Choosing Grey by betagyre is a pretty great TomxHermione time travel - and it's sequal is even better, shifting focus slightly from romance and angst to wizarding politics during the Cold War. linkffn(11722608)

To turn that around, Pygmalion by Colubrina is another TomxHermione that has Tom Riddle traveling forward in time to Our Heroes seventh year. Obviously it's AU as fuck and it also gets pretty dark by the end. linkffn(11248015)

For our final Hermione story (for now), Red Right Hand by Nautical Paramore is a HermionexCygnus Black pairing wherin post war, lost everyone Hermione travels back to adopt Tom Riddle as a baby to try to raise him in an environment suited to not becoming a dark lord. linkffn(12304702)

Moving on from Hermione, because as awesome as she is I know people like other characters too, Time Out Of Place by bananacosmicgirl is one of the first time travel stories I read so it's an oldie but goodie. Drarry, wherin Harry and Draco travel forward in time by a few years and are really fucking confused. linkffn(1143478)

For a some rare pair goodness, Past, Present, and Future by viv-heart is a short, very bittersweet Siriusxyoung!Minerva. It's definitely got that angst in spades. linkffn(12194597)

To cap off this round of suggestions, The Moment It Began by Sindie is a Snily fic where a dying Snape is given the opportunity to return to the scene of his biggest regret. I don't typically ship Snily, but I did enjoy this one. linkffn(3735743)
