Warning for slash, not sure if you're into that. Harry is actually something like 700 so whatever he publishes is realistic. As for Dumbledore, I wouldn't say he's bashed as bad as he is in other works but he isn't looked upon too favorably because of the past experience Harry has with him when they were close.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

This a pre-HBP sixth year story featuring H/Hr. At some point, on Flitwick's insistence, Harry publishes a paper about how hope, and not happiness, is the best emotion to use for a patronus charm.

It's a pretty good story, managing a tone that is very similar to canon and very good characterization for almost all characters. Unfortunately abandoned.

  Post-OotP-Ch57: Harry is calculating and exerts self-restraint, Moody visits, Harry gets some history on Voldemort's timing, Neville cheers up Harry just a bit, another sabbat is upon us and Snape pokes Harry, Harry gets a wild idea.

** Not entirely sure if this fits your criteria, but the story does have Harry writing in a newspaper. I found it really interesting and definitely worth a read! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]]
