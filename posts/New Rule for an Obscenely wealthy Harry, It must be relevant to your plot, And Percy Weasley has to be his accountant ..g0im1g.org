Bonus points if they have meetings when Percy Advises harry that the chocolate frog trading card allowance he gives Ron under the table ( since Hermione banned him from Spending anymore Of their money attempting to complete his collection) That the allowance is obscene in its amount. With harry just shaking his head in Resignation saying,” Percy , I know. But he's my best friend I can't abandon him. Not after everything.”

With Percy frustrated , he pinching the bridge of his nose before answering with, “ At least his collection is mostly complete this can't go on for much longer. Whats he need a Harpo the fowl or something?”

And harry just looking a little guilty, “ Actually it's Hermione's trading card. When she agreed to have her card made she made them enchant the Packaging So Ron could never get one.”

Percy just stares at Him in his belief before Cursing, “ You have got to be fucking kidding me.”

Edit: spelling


** "So why don't you get Hermione's card and trade it with Ron?"

"Hermione made me swear not to give him her card and the worst part is I cannot even tell him that."

"I sometimes wonder how they are still married. I can't believe you agreed to that."

"Me too."

There exists a certain type of Advisor called the 'Percy Advisor'. These Advisors are harassing an allowance (of the chocolate frog trading card type) that is given to Ron underneath a table. And if all this happens, then someone named 'Bonus' (probably a Roman bloke) gets up and points.

** Wait, they are charmed so Hermione won't show up if he opens one?

Couldn't he sell this super power?

"Oi! Malfoy! I can give you a hundred percent chance that Hermione won't show up!"\\
"Hurry up and take my money Bloodtraitor!"

Ron now does pureblooded parties, weddings, and bar mitzvahs. Easiest. High-paying job. Ever.
