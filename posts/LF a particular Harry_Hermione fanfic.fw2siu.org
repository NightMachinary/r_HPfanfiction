I think it was a collection of one story per chapter Ala 'Odd Ideas' or 'Wait What!?' and one of the stories involved (if I'm remembering right) Harry and Hermione looking after Teddy alongside Andromeda and she is questioning them about them dating but they deny it by claiming they are really good friend while looking extremely comfortable with each other until Luna comes (stepping out of some portal or something?) and casts a counter spell on the both of them and Harry and Hermione instantly start making out. I don't know why but I found that really funny. Thanks.


** You should probably post this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]]. They might know.

*** Thank you, adgnatum. Seriously, I've been looking for this for a week and was starting to wonder if I had imagined it or something. Thank you. :)
