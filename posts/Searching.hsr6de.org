I have been searching for a fan fiction where harry goes back in time, and befriends Severus Snape because he realizes, His dad is a prick (immature) , The Marauders are funny but overly mean, and Snape is the only intelligent and mature one here, in this f'd up journey. if you have any fic's like this, please list the name and sight, and any you recommend.


** There are a few but a lot are very poor writing and are slash D:
