#+begin_quote
  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

*** Damn this was bad. Don't get me wrong, the writing itself was decent, but the lack of proper punctuation- especially for dialogue- completely brutalizes any immersion.

**** No, sorry. I honestly don't know of any other good ones. There's linkffn(Renegade Cause) but that has serious Ron and Hermione bashing.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** lovely little harrry x bella x narcissa peice of work with a truely brutal harry (snaps hedwings wings and then neck when he decides to go evil and leave privet drive just to give u an idea) [[http://ficwad.com/story/10931]]

evil harry with harem/slave with gabby, cho, susan, narcissa, and others, my second fave evil smut in fandom

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=987]]

not concerned much with morality but has godlike seductive powers due to incubi heritage, lots of nice smut havent finished it yet but 0 non-con/rape / torture so far despite warnings (if you talk someone into sex via telepathically knowing there dreams/kinks how is that rape?)

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1061]]

starts super slow, more like a real fic(if you have low standards for prose) instead of just smut scenes with smattering of plot, that said builds to lots of smut and raises lovely philosophical questions like 'is it really incest if its a twin sister you conjure in your mind who takes the form of your dead mother that you found from a magical artifact?' and such things as 'are men culpable for acts they commit if under a veelas aura?, what if shes like 9 and she premeditated it?' and last but certainly not least 'would u fuk a pikachu?' [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=710]]

cant believe i forgot about this but enter the silver flame also starts slow but has a lovely tonks who descends from repressed purtian school girl to a kinky punishiment/submissve slut also it clocks in at 1.4 million words for just the first story in the series. that said it does involve hermione but shes just 1 of like 3/4 girls in main haerm (do dead people you conjure and have sex with in lleegmacily visions/mindscapes count as part of your harem?) [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=270]]

also know tons of non smut dark/evil harry fics but none with bella/narcissa/tonks

  This is a remake and rewriting of an old story. Its still Harry/Harem, but with more flair and life! Surprises around every corner, and new animangus forms to boot! R&R, no flames, enjoy, and leave long reviews!
