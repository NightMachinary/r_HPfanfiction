I've seen a lot of trans Harry posts about a trans Harry going up the girls staircase.

I want a story where Harry just doesn't care about their gender, like Draco says they look like a girl one day because of their long hair or something, and they pull a SpongeBob and ask, "am I a pretty girl?"

And imagine the stairs. They would break. Just imagine, Harry goes to climb the stairs, everyone watching for the ensuing slide show, only for him to get up a few steps before the stairs spazz out going from stairs to slide, stairs to slide, stairs to slide, over and over like a minecraft trapdoor hooked up to a redstone clock.

I love it.
