I once read a fic (that was, as far as I remember) abandoned. It had Harry in Slytherin and, different from many Slytherin!Harry fics, there was no pureblood behaviour he had to learn etc. They were just kids like every other 11 year old. And they were mobbed. They were Slytherins, so it was okay for older students to hex them in the corridors etc, and at one point, Oliver Wood saved them from an attack that would have been (unbeknownst to the attackers) be fatal. And he started to think about how the slytherins were treated. And I would very much like to read something along those lines again, so what I am looking for in a story:

- possible Slytherin Harry, but could also follow some other canon Slytherin
- No slytherin ettiquette, aristocracy, haughty behaviour etc (except if it is part of the character. But it isn't a slythering or pureblood trait.)
- the seventh graders were 6 when Voldemort disappeared - none of them "follow" him
- they are not all Death Eater children and not every Death Eater was a loyal follower but just stuck after making a wrong decision (if Voldemort handed out the crucio so freely then as he did later, I can't think that even the elitests had to have thoughts of having made a wrong decision..)
- Slytherins don't provoke fights in the hallways. They are supposed to be cunning. Almost nothing was cunning about canon Draco, and it isn't cunning to further antagonize people that are already inclined not to like you.
- The other houses think that it is okay to bully the slytherins, because they are "evil" and "dark". No matter how old they are. Because the Slytherins know that, there are rules like "don't go anywhere alone" etc for the younger students, trying to keep them protected.
- Of course, the fact that you are damned with 11 years due to your sorting, a lot of Slytherins /do/ get bitter and angry.
- Some individual(s) start to question the behaviour of 3/4th of the school (probably due to a an extreme event). This might lead to things changing, slowly.

If you know anything that roughly fits into that pattern, I would be grateful if you shared your knowledge with me :)


** linkffn(7659033) This seems to fit quite well. The Slytherins do occasionally hex other people but they make sure that they arent caught. The Slytherins are mostly blood purists but only a couple have Death Eater parents and I think none openly agree with Voldemort.

**** no, hes still mostly a jerk but Harry does justify his behavior in his head because Draco is his first real friend and later best friend. The Slytherins do mainly act like in canon but Harry is one of them and thats why none of them wants to support Voldemort. But Dracos personality is more fleshed out .

** Does canon actually feature any scenes where Slytherin students get mistreated? The only thing that comes to mind is Malfoy's annual hexing at the end of the train rides, after running his whore mouth.

Anyway, as for your request: linkffn(They shook hands by Dethryl). It's supposedly one of the better Slytherin!Harry series out there, with it's core tenet being what you're asking for (regular kids). It's pretty well written, though I only read the first two stories and that was a few years ago.

I don't think so, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't/couldn't or even doesn't happen. It could be happening but we just wouldn't know it because Harry doesn't. And from the way children /are/ it would be only logical if it were to happen. Children can be so damn cruel towards people they don't like for some reason, and add to that the abilities magic gives you.. and since Slytherins are evil by default, it just gives a justification.

Thanks for the recommendation. I think I read "They shook hands" somewhen, but never took it up again after I reached the "end" at that time, due to finding other things. So I'll put it up on my list to "read again to catch up"

*** With regards to Canon, they get hexed before quidditch games but they do give as good as they get. The three other houses also tend to cheer against them which can't be great for impressionable minds. The Weasley twins stick Vaisey(?) in the vanishing cabinet and leave him there but that was related to the Inquisitorial squad. With attitudes like Ron's and Hagrids not to mention Snape its easy to see how and us vs them mentality could emerge within Slytherin. Add in that the Sorting Hat doesn't sort on traits but perceived traits and wishes and you get people who believe they should be in Slytherin rather than what the house traits suggest. Its why Daphne Greengrass is a Fanon favourite. She can be everything Slytherins were lacking.

Really I don't think Slytherins get mistreated but rather they aren't punished when they get caught mistreating others. Snape protects them so when stuff like hexing Neville happens nobody bothers to follow up. (He was hit by a leg locker and hopped back to the Tower.) They abuse the free reign they get and people resent them for it. That resentment could lead to mistreatment in small ways.
