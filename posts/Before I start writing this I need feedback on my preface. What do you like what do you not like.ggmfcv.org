*** Thank you! I'm outlining for the first book now. Should I place Daphne in Slytherin or Gryffindor? I'm for both but with Joffrey and Ramsay being in Slytherin, I think Dany, Daphne, and half of Slytherin would be fed up with their crazy shit.

***** I also have Dumbeldore's, Snapes, Fudge, and Tywin's reaction to Joffrey ordering Ned Stark's death mapped out. Dumbeldore is going to be somewhat "manipulative" but good in this story but when this breaks out he's like WTF Robert, why couldn't you give the throne to Ned, instead of just drinking yourself to an early grave and causing another pittless nightmare for me.

** Wow this looks really cool!! Except that I'm kinda sad that Daenerys won't be a Targaryen. Do you have a specific reason for that? Or is it just because you don't want to cause conflict between her and Jon? Is Jon still a Targaryen? Are all people in Westeros wizards? If not do the muggles in Westeros know about magic? Also which magical school do wizards of Westeros go to? Can people leave Westeros freely? Will it be more developed I mean not set in "medieval" times? Also when I say Westeros I always mean all 3 countries you mentioned just forgot the name of the others.

Sorry for all the questions XD

*** 1. Yes there's a hidden reason for Dany's last name being Greengrass.
2. Jon is not a Targeryen (He and Arya are Lyanna and Sirius Black's kids).
3. All people in Westeros know magic and can perform it. Muggles do not know Westeros, Essos, and Sothrous exist.
4. Westerois kids can attend Hogwarts, Beuxobetens, Durmstang, and the American school.
5. It depends if they are in a war or not. Hint War of the Five Wizard Kings is incoming.
6. It will be a semi modern westerosi wizard society with elements of midevil aspects played into it.

Does this explain it better?
