:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I forgot to book mark the fic and now I can't find the title. Will really appreciate if anyone lets me know which fic it is.

So base on what I rmb the plot was an accidental time travel one where harry travels back in time and meet Tom Riddle. Things happened and they became husbands and made a magic bond and everything.

But Harry was pulled back to present time where his 60 year disappearance made Tom Riddle go insane and become Voldemort.

So Harry bought a yew branch to meet Voldemort and did a little ritual in a hope that their magic bond will help Voldemort regain his mind. Then there was a whole angst scene where Voldemort demands Harry to never kneel to him ever again.

Thats what I remember, if I'm not wrong this fic was on fanfiction.net as well.
