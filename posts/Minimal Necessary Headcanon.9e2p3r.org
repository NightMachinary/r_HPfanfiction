** This question seems to be closely related to [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/981un0/what_are_your_pillars_of_potter_how_far_can_an_au/][/What are your Pillars of Potter, how far can an AU go before its not Harry Potter anymore?/]], so you might want to look at the answers in that thread. However, that question focuses on personal opinions instead of the objective aspect.

Conveniently, I believe my subjective opinion aligns nicely with an objective viewpoint.

AUs can be divided into three types: Plot, Character, and Setting. They are frequently combined, and changing one likely has impacts on the others.

The easiest way to go AU is changing the plot, and it's also the most difficult way to go too far. It may actually be impossible. I don't think anyone here would disagree that Magical Britain and the cast is a Potter fanfic.

Characters can easily enhance the HP elements, but are not strictly necessary, e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][/Alexandra Quick/]].

Physical setting isn't necessary, but magic almost certainly is. It's the one thing (obviously) unique to Harry Potter. A story without magic stops feeling like Harry Potter and more like a different genre or a character study.

So you wouldn't consider muggle AUs as HP fics? There's a large amount of high school romance fics or Pride & Prejudice fics floating around the web that definitely feel HP-like to me in spite of the muggle setting.

** Well, as Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived shows, you don't even need magic. There are other stories that change canon event completely. I would say the biggest restrictions are the time periods.

Founding of Hogwarts, Grindlewald's War, Marauder's, canon, and Next-Gen are the most common, because you'll have a setting that you have some background for, but can change the cast a bit.

You only really need one or two familiar characters to establish that it is the HP universe, see fics where Harry's education/background/house change. All the other characters usually are OCs with canon names.

Honestly, what makes a fanfic a HP fanfic is just a hint of canon. You don't need to make to establish that you're generally in the same universe.

  What does an AU need to shed to slip over the border between HP fanfiction and, well, anything else?
#+end_quote

Voldemort has to be evil. His entire organisation was a ripoff of the SA/SS, his regime implemented their own NÃ¼rnberg laws and turned prisons into concentration camps for those he considered beneath him.

So any story trying to portray him as misunderstood good guy or hero against the evil Lord Dumbledore is an instant no. Same goes for the Death Eaters.

*** I'm curious why you consider that aspect of Voldemort essential.

I've read some well written AU fics in which circumstances/history/long experience shaped Voldemort to be a different person than he was in canon. Nature vs. Nurture, and what all. He could be shaped by a logical chain of events to /not/ turn out a barking-mad Hitler analogue.

Personally, I'm immediately turned off from any story in which Voldemort is not written as an intelligent psychopath, but psychopathy doesn't necessitate being a sadistic mass murder. Why is the Voldemort-as-Hitler aspect of canon so important to Harry Potter fanfiction?

It's not about Voldemort-is-Hitler, it is that his side is evil.

Otherwise, it would invalidate canon and especially Harry. His theme was all about fighting evil with the power of love, so saying that Voldemort was actually the good guy just ruins that image. He doesn't have to be Hitler-esque, but he needs to be evil. Dude went to murder a child due to some drunk ramblings. That is not the sign of a good person.

There are countless stories which make poor excuses (Muggleborn's are ruining the magical culture, it is only right to industrially murder them; they refuse to accept our way of life, therefore they have to die). Or make it that the Death Eaters are about preserving the unique magical culture who just want to get rid of the Muggleborns but they wouldn't leave peacefully.

Depicting Voldemort as a good guy just reads like one of those crazy "Hitler did nothing wrong" ramblings, especially due to the Third Reich parallels Rowling admitted to. But unlike with Hitler, there was no magical Versailles treaty, Rhineland occupation, decade of failed governments or great depression which would excuse the supporters of Voldemort or his ideology. They weren't the desperate people, they were the elite who wanted more power.

***** I agree that it makes sense for Voldemort's side to be "evil" in canon compliant fics. I'm asking why you would be opposed to AU fics in which Voldemort had a different childhood or different school life such that he never created the Death Eaters or his followers had rational goals that didn't revolve around genocide.

****** Because his existence as the villain is essential to the existence of the world as we know it. Without his there'd be no Order, no Harry as we know him.

******* I suppose that makes sense. If you consider the Order and Harry-as-chosen-one to be necessary components of Harry Potter fanfiction, then Voldemort-as-evil-archetype would be essential.

** I honestly worry about this type of question just turning into people's fic preferences. It kind of did on the 'Pillars of Potter' forum.

There are a lot of AUs that I don't like, but basically if the author views it as an AU I don't really feel the need to decide that it's not.
