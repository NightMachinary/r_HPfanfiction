Either because he was whisked off to another world, the Dursleys locked him in his room so he couldn't leave, he ran away and is now a scrappy gang-leader, Harry doesn't make it to Hogwarts with everyone else. Be it a day, a few months or years after when he should start, he finally shows up.

Bashing, dark!characters, Crossovers and slash are fine. Please no mpreg, harems, genderbending, romance/smut-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you.


** Too many to count, a few ones I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry was legally blind and couldn't attend Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Potters laid a trap and got in a lucky shot, and they ran off to the Continent with Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Sirius raised Harry, he never went to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Grindelwald killed the Durleys and raised Harry, he returned in Year 7.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8975202/1/Have-Chrome-Will-Travel][Have Chrome, Will Travel]], linkffn(8975202): Entered Hogwarts in Year 4 when the Goblet spit out his name.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy kicked Dumbledore out of Britain after Halloween 1981, so Harry, Neville, and all Weasleys went to Beauxbaton. Dumbledore began his revenge after Ginny finally graduated.

** Damn this is the third time I've recommended this story in this sub in as many days, so I'll just copy my original review ---

linkffn(4062601)

I really can't recommend /The Wise One/ trilogy enough. It is complete, and has a total series word length of around 450k. Harry is "kidnapped" by Sirius when he is seven. Sirius takes him out of the country and they travel around the world. Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore thinks Sirius must've killed Harry and raises Neville up to be the chosen one of the prophecy, even though Neville isn't entirely up for it.

The first book takes place mostly outside Britain, though we do get scenes of what's going on at Hogwarts from time to time. Harry and Sirius return to Britain at the end of the first book */for Harry's fifth year/*. Harry in this is fairly competent, proactive and confident.

The series features one of the best Harry/Hermione romances I've read (though it isn't central to the story) and doesn't bash anyone, though it may seem like /mild/ Ron and Dumbledore bashing for a short while. Everyone is pretty much in character and honestly, I can't find anything to complain about it. I'd actually say it's better than canon in many ways.

**** Ok so I disagree with the other comment. In this story she suffered a highly traumatic event [[/spoiler][(she was raped by Viktor Krum)]]. As a result, she is a lot more subdued and quiet than in canon. That doesn't mean she's a damsel in distress or a pushover --- when Harry fucks up, she temporarily breaks up with him. She certainly doesn't go along with whatever he wants her to do. Nor does Harry have to educate her about how the world works or anything of that kind. She is very competent in this fic and plays perhaps even more of a vital role in defeating the death eaters than she did in canon. She just goes through a very depressed phase [[/spoiler][and has intimacy issues]] , that's all.

************ Long story short, a spirit of a sorcerer attacks people that led to its arrest, causing them to go insane or catatonic for a time, the first one you see is a male police officer who's out of his mind after his soul(not being poetic) and mind are tortured and ravaged by this thing. A second officer( a main female protagonist) is also attacked by the spirit, and it is likened to rape, as both attacked parties were completely taken by this creature and their sense of control and power were damaged.

The characters in the series are all very well done, all main characters are well balanced and not clichéd.
