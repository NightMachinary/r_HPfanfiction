I have this scene in my mind where Harry uses the horcrux in his scar (I believe it was described as a sharp or jagged piece of soul) to hurt and maybe kill dementors. I remember reading about it but have forgotten which story it comes from.


** I recall it too, it had a scene from Snape's pov when he woke up while Harry was terrormurdering the Dementors.

*** I think there was something about how the scar horcrux was more or less an accident, so it was this broken section of soul. Harry basically wears down the soul portion by killing a bunch of dementors so that all that is left is the shell of the horcrux or something like that.

**** I also remember the scene you're talking about, but I can't remember what fic it's from.

Something about Harry nearly getting his soul sucked out, he latches on to the scar horcrux and pulls on it to toss it behind him to save his own soul, he later ends up using it as a weapon or something.

***** You're amazing, I like that all three of us had scenes imprinted in our heads. Geryon remembered the Snape wake up scene and you remembered that he was in a soul tug-of-war and kicked it away to save himself.

Somehow I thought this was part of a longer story, but you found it as part of a collection. Amazing!
