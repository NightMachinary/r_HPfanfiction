#+TITLE: Due to an accident, Harry goes years back in time, returning to the point when Hogwarts was established. In this bygone era, Harry has a mission to complete no matter - maintain the family tree. Any breaks in the family tree leading to the time traveller's birth would cause a world-ending paradox.

** Impossible task there. Even if the same people get together, there's no guarantee they'd have the same offspring, at the same time they're meant to. Best you can do is get the hell out of dodge.

***** Even then im pretty sure him being added to the timeline already splits the time stream because him having one conversation with even just one random person no matter how unimportant will change that person's future interactions ever so slightly resulting in a lot of compounding changes.

For instance harry may ask a villager for a piece of bread or something that villager taking the 1 minute it would take to give harry bread could result in him leaving town 1 minute later resulting in him not being in the right location at the right time to meet and speak to the wife he would've had in the original timeline resulting in an entire family line changing.
