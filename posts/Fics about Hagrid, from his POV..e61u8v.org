Hagrid is unquestionably the best character in the HP universe; that is 100% agreed upon by everybody.

So where are the fics?


** It's not from Hagrid's POV, but it's the only one I know that features him more prominently.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** Here's a fairly short fic about Hagrid after the war that you might enjoy. It's about half written from Hagrid's point of view and the other half from Harry's:

** Not so sure about your premise but that's a good question ðŸ¤” I've never seen any Hagrid fics or heard people talk about them... I guess although many people like Hagrid he is not someone most people would ship with someone else, so that might be a reason for fewer stories. He's also generally a happy person and I think a lot of people like to improve their fav characters lives... with Hagrid I'm not even sure if he would change much for himself if he could go to the past so there also isn't quite as much plot material to write about him ðŸ¤”

*** Hagrid is, well, /simple,/ but he has depth!

He has moments of intense frustration, he has immense passion for his work and compassion for others, he's an outcast from society because of his heritage and because he's unfortunately pretty dim... there's a compelling story there!

** Uhhhh, hate to say it, but that is Not the truth.... I don't much care for Hagrid, so your statement of 100% is a mite overblown.
