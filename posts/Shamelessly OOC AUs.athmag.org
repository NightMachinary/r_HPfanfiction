How do you feel about this type of story? Where Harry's personality tilts a different direction, or where Draco and his cronies aren't clueless bullies, or where the author basically just used canon names and places to tell a completely different kind of story from canon?


** I was having a lengthy discussion about the fic which shall not be named, and one of the complaints of my interlocutor was that it so thoroughly ignored canon to do its own thing.

â€‹

To me, this is a selling point. I personally love different takes on characters or the world, basically live in OOC-land, but now I wonder if I'm the exception.

So, what do y'all think about taking canon and basically ignoring it when writing a fic? Yea, or nay?

*** I definitely agree with you; I love when the characters go in a completely different direction, because I love the world more than the characters (I don't know if that's heresy or not). JK has built this wonderful world of mystery and magic, but there are a lot of areas where this world could be developed more than it is and the characters are either underdeveloped or unrealistic. Fanfiction allows for the exploration of this world and the ways that it will affect the characters when they are thrown into different circumstances to cannon.

*** I feel the same way. AUs and OOC is a selling point for me too, otherwise I would just stick to re-reading the original content. The more unique the better, thats why is fanfiction in the first place.

*** My problem with You Know What Fic is how condescending the tone is. 'Let me spoon feed you this, because clearly you don't have a child's grasp of science and the English language.'

Although, to be fair... I was a child when I first read it... and as a child I enjoyed it.

But I'm entitled to my misery, let me revel in it!

** I like it if it's done in a self-aware and cognizant manner. I don't like OOC characters if they are just a tool of a delusional author who's trying to shoehorn their personal impression of a character into the story.

For example...

#+begin_quote
  or where Draco and his cronies aren't clueless bullies,
#+end_quote

This is a huge change and should result in a huge AU. If you just write some bullshit justifications why Draco is /secretly/ not a clueless bully, but has to act like one, while keeping everything going on the canon plot rails it's a really dumb exercise.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

So yeah, I agree, if it's actually a different story and not just canon apologia.

#+end_quote

Totally cool with that. Obviously we all have different aspects of canon that we like or don't like. Personally I don't like most of canon past OotP so I'm quite happy with it being tossed out.

** I'm not a fan of stories where it's obvious that it's only character's name that is left unchanged. But then again, while reading a time travel romance where Hermione travelled back to marauders era, I kept wondering what she would do, since in canon she was determined to keep the time line unchanged. I realised then that she most probably would be focused on getting back and would want to avoid any kind of romance. So I might end up sounding like a hypocrite, since I enjoyed the story. However, I wouldn't like Draco not being a bully if it appears out of nowhere. If the author spends enough time developing him, then that's fine. But if he/she just decides that Draco isn't a bully for no reason, then I would be tempted to suggest the author should write a story about an original character. I do have to say, though, that some stories are so Au, that it's impossible to guess how the characters might react. On the other hand, I've seen canon compliant stories where characters react in a way I could never see them reacting in canon, so it doesn't have to be AU for characters to be OOC.

Out of curiosity, how would you feel about the AU Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]]? In the alternate universe of the fic he still has the same family and friends, but their backgrounds and personalities are all completely different due to the topsy-turvy history of that world. He's probably my favorite version of Draco because the author develops his personality and backstory so well.

**** I might read such story out of curiosity, but I think it would be very strange to see Draco on the side of the good. I'd expect him to throw a nasty remark at any moment. But I think it has more to do with the fact that I like canon books whereas people here love AUs. For example, I was irritated by a fic where the author wrote a canon pairing but couldn't fit a couple events into canon so the story diverged slightly.But I wouldn't hate Draco in that story because the whole world there is different.

** I'm perfectly ok with OOC characters if it's part of the premise. For example, if a fanfiction is starting with "what if Hermione summoned demons" I'm okay with a very different Hermione because that's the point of the story.

** Hate them. I don't mind situational AUs where the characters still feel like themselves, but if I wanted something original, I'd read a book. I'm reading fanfic to go on a journey with characters I know and want more of.

** I've said this before, I think, but honestly the only thing that I really can't accept in a fic is bad writing. As long as it's well thought out and well written, I can suspend my disbelief as far as I need to.

Generally when characters are super OOC it's because the story is a complete AU where it's acceptable for anything and everything to be different imo, or it's set post-Hogwarts where everyone has grown up and presumably have "reasons" for changing, or it's a situation where the whole point of the story is "how would canon events have changed if this character was totally different in xx way?" All of that would fall under the AU category to a certain degree, and I'm happy with any of it. It seriously comes down to the writing. I'd be much happier with a very well written a/b/o HPLV mpreg AU than I would be with a poorly written story where no one is really OOC at all.

** For me, it must be either AU or OOC (unless it's a canon divergent AU). Either you stay true to the world and experiment with the characters or show how canon characters would believably react to the new circumstances.

A good story is a good story, but sometimes it comes to the point where it doesn't feel like HP universe anymore, and the characters share only names with their canon counterparts, and that's just not what I'm not reading fanfiction for. This is the reason why I mostly avoid crossovers.
