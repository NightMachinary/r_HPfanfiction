Both alternate times where Harry grows up in Voldemort s Britain or fugitive Harry is fine

Because I need even worse gloom and doom in my quarantine

It could be any pairing including slash(as long as it does not have mpreg), no fem!Harry

Bonus points if Harry dwells into some specific more obscure magic branch, such as necromancy, divination, mind/ soul magics astral walking or anything

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead.

**** The fic starts slow, and it may be difficult to feel invested in the characters in the beginning, since the plot basically launches after a lot of import backstory has taken place that you don't learn about until later.

Personally, I'd say the story starts to get really interesting at the end of chapter 4, and the suspense stays pretty intense from then on.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
