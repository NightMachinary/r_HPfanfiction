Just something I find myself thinking about; the Weasley family as a whole are Harry's closest friends, with Ron in particular being by Harry's side through the entire series (except for a three-and-a-bit-week period of not speaking to him during the Triwizard Tournament and later being controlled by one of the horcruxes), and their helping to get Harry out of numerous scrapes.

I know there's quite a few fics which have Harry leaving with Hermione for whatever reason, like not wanting to deal with the prophecy, or being tired of slander from the Ministry, or et-cetera, but are there any 'Harry leaves Britain' fics where he brings the Weasleys with him?


** linkffn(Mutant Storm) has a mass-exodus from Wizarding Britain after the Ministry refuses to change after Voldemort is killed for good. The Weasleys are one of the main architects of the exodus on the wizards' side.

*** Hmm...I gave it a look over, but Ron doesn't seem to be very fairly represented in the first chapter. And Harry seems a bit...obnoxious. I think Bobmin's work might just not be for me.

** Huh, I honestly don't think I've ever seen this done. All the fics I can think of where Harry leaves the country come with a side order of Evil! or GreaterGood!Dumbledore and Evil! or Sycophant!Weasleys.

*** Mm, that reminds me, I was also wondering about a Good!Dumbledore who follows Harry, but tells him that the prophecy is only relevant because Voldemort believes it's true (as per canon), that Voldemort will probably never stop chasing Harry, and offers to do whatever he can to help relocate Harry and/or keep him safe from unwelcome pursuers.

That also also reminds me, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On An Island In The Sun]] has a well-meaning fair Dumbledore, and it has Harry eventually leaving Britain...
