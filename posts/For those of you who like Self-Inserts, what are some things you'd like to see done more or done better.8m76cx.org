** The SI should have their own motivations. I can't be bothered to read stories where the SI devotes their entire life to helping solve canon and fixing the problems of the books' main characters. Far too many writers seem to forget the main bloody premise of an SI which is that your protagonist has to LIVE in the HP world. Have some believable motivations! Where are the fics where the SI wants to pursue a good career, or help their own family, or save up for that trip abroad to some magical location. An SI should be their own person, not some weird lens through which to view and change canon.

Just once I want to read an SI where they go "you know what, I don't think my personality matches all that well with Harry or Hermione, I think I'd be far better friends with X random person here" rather than just basing all of their actions, plans and self worth off of their relations with the former main character of a book.

*** I agree! Let them have their own story for a bit without always being based around the main trio's reactions.

I sometimes wish for good SI that are with Malfoy or the Slytherins. I've seen a few fanfics that demonstrate how the main trio's can be annoying/overbearing for the character. However, they just befriend them anyway, for the sake of just helping with the Voldey situation.

** My main issue with most SI is that they all have roughly the same motivation - fix the HP Verse, stop people from dying, vanquish Voldemort as soon as possible... They become friends with the main cast, possibly relative, join in on the adventures and such...

How about a SI that, after dying in our world, became obsessed with /not/ dying and decides to make a Horcrux? Or a SI that is so captivated with magic that they don't really care what happens with the main plot - they just want to learn as much as they can. Or a SI that joins Voldemort for some reason?

  What use is knowledge of the future when she can't bring herself to care? She owed this world nothing - this story would continue without her. Death took a chance, gambled on the wrong soul, and now she has to pay for it. No one ever said the Wizarding World would be all fun and games. Semi-Realistic SI/OC

** An SI who steamrolls the Universe in a believable way. No, the SI will not beat Voldemort in a duel or have Goblins suck his dick because he remembered their name. But getting a few Muggleborns to defend Hogwarts with an arsenal of modern weapons World War 1 style? Blowing Voldemort's graveyard cauldron up with a well placed handgrenade?

Getting rid of Snape/Umbridge/Malfoy? You are not going to 1 v 1 them, but a point blank stunner from behind would do.

But most importantly, no fucking TEENAGE DRAMA. You've already been through puberty once. You will not suddenly lose all your adult wisdom and turn into a fucking moron who doesn't know what to do when a girl/woman is attracted to you. And remember, You're here to fuck Voldemort up, not have a sordid affair with a Death Eater or werewolf. Honestly, I doubt that anyone here would be a good match for one of the main characters, but there's plenty of fish in the sea. Getting Demelza Robins or Leanne to fall for you is wayyy more believable than Hermione or Luna.

*** Hiya!

Alright, I am going to piggyback off your post for a little bit, which I hope is alright with you. It does relate to what you have asked and I hope that I'm not just leeching off you.

Anyway, I am currently drafting a side project (I call it this because I have far too many going on right now) that related to what you have asked, at least in some sense. I did debate about writing a self-insert fic, as it's something I have never done. Of course, I would have to change it a bit so people don't read about a depressed and anxious wreck, but that's half the battle.

[[/u/B_mod]] mentioned something about creating a Horcrux, which is, arguably, something I would do if I was ever in Harry Potter. I have a few scenarios planned, but as I have never written this genre, I was hoping to fish some dos and don'ts.

Romance wouldn't be a massive part as I am, as much as I hate to say it, a homosexual male and have zero experience dealing with females romantically. But, yeah. I could use some pointers that are not on this thread. :)

** I want a SI who gets a crap hand dealt to them. They aren't the heir of a noble house. They are the kid of an under-employed, over-educated woman who is facing homelessness because there is no job market. Maybe they read the books their mom has, but maybe the books have to be sold before they are finished.

And when they get a Hogwarts letter, they are ticked off because they are preparing for making money to help with their new family's suffering and the Wizarding World won't help with that.

If they don't know that they are in a book series for years, what knowledge they had will be gone. The connections they made in the interim will become more important than the connections to the characters.

Who cares what happens to Harry if your parents are going to be miserable no matter who wins? Finding a way to exploit the economy would become more important than helping Harry, even if helping Harry was a necessary step towards it.
