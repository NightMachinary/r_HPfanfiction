In fanfiction, Luna is often portrayed like some sort of alien, without regular human feelings or motivations. She's 100% quirky 100% of the time --- a shallow "lolsorandom" caricature of a person.

When a fanfiction writer does try to give Luna depth, they often do it by making her a secret genius; her conspiracy ramblings become wise and prophetic. In fanfiction, Luna doesn't have bad social skills --- she's simply risen above the superficial trappings of social discourse and doesn't actually want any friends anyway.

Some people might find that portrayal cute or endearing, but I'm getting a little sick of it. It's shallow, and it goes against cannon. Luna might be weird, but she's not insane. She's insightful, but not particularly wise. She isn't a secret genius, and most of the crazy things she believes aren't real. And, most importantly, she has more than one emotion. She's not in a perpetual state of dreamy aloofness. She gets offended, amused and hurt, just like any other person.

Take a look at this passage from OotP:

#+begin_quote
  “Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.

  “Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer, “The Quibbler's rubbish, everyone knows that.”

  “Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. “My father's the editor.”

  “I --- oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it's got some interesting . . . I mean, it's quite . . .”

  “I'll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry's hands.
#+end_quote

How often does something like this happen in fanfiction? If this was fanfiction-Luna, then she'd just smile knowingly and wink at the audience, before saying something cryptic like "the brightest Nargles make their home in rubbish," or some other fortune cookie bullshit. Hermione would then smile and give a resigned sigh, and Harry would chuckle to himself. /"Classic Luna."/

I know that this rant must come across as pedantic, but it's a shame just how reliably shallow Luna is in fanfiction. In canon, Luna doesn't make any jokes, and anytime she's funny it's because people are laughing /at/ her, not /with/ her. In fanfiction, she's never the butt of a joke. It's like reverse-bashing. It shouldn't frustrate me, but it does, because I know that the authors writing Luna this way probably love her as a character, but I don't think they're doing her any favors.

In canon, Luna was proud. She laughed too hard at stupid jokes. She was /wrong/ about almost everything she believed in. She was lonely, but couldn't make any friends without sacrificing her beliefs. But despite all of that, she was still brave, kind, and insightful. The Trio learned to see past her quirks and flaws and accept her for who she was. Fanfiction writers see /only/ her quirks, and they pretend her flaws don't exist.

I dunno. I'm just venting here, so don't take any of my whining too seriously.

Another thing that pisses me off is that it's always Nargles, Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or Wackspurts. That's all Luna ever talks about in fanfiction. The Quibbler must have published thousands of crazy conspiracy theories and cryptozoology nonsense over the years, so why doesn't Luna ever mention any of it? Luna believed that Sirius Black was a secret singing sensation. She believed Fudge cooked Goblins into pies. I imagine Rowling had a lot of fun thinking up those amusing conspiracy theories, yet in fanfiction it's always Nargles, Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Wackspurts, over and over again. I'm sick of it. Luna only brought those things up because she thought they were appropriate in the context of her conversation, and in a different context she'd have mentioned something else. If you're going to write Luna then at least have some fun and do something creative and new.

I'm sure there are fics that do Luna justice, and if you know any please share them.


** This is such a good point. I've read a couple where she doesn't get portrayed like that, but can't remember them right now except for one. I can't find it right now, but it's on ao3 and everyone goes to a bar post-hogwarts and luna loves the spinach dip

** Given that Luna just spouted her dad's stories, I'd like a bit more focus on him, and just how insane he was.

Personally I like the idea of the Quibbler starting as a sort of Potterwatch, only everything being coded. After all, despite the Rotfang Conspiracy being utter rot, that might have been a way of saying that the Auror faction was rotten with Death Eater sympathizers who would seriously weaken the Ministry during a take over.

And presumably Xeno was slightly sane and didn't tell his daughter that. Of course, that lead to her thinking it was all real, but perhaps his wife's death unhinged him and he got lost in delusions, or didn't realise how seriously she took them. Maybe he lost himself in printing absolute rubbish purely for fun, and taking his daughter on nonsense hunts to help distract her from her trauma.

I mean, if I saw my mum die, I'd rather spend my holidays looking for fairies, or yeti, or bunyips, instead of staying at home and knowing she'd never be there again.

*** I actually read a fic once where the Quibbler was used to distribute information to members of the french Mob.

It had the most amazing fourth year plot with 2 champions teaming up per school and Fleur being the daughter of the French Mob Boss.

Unfortunately it died fairly early, I loved it mostly because Fleur was fuckign amazing in it and i was sick of all the veela focused Harry/Fleur stories, where Harry saves her life in some ridiculous manner despite the fact that Fleur is supposed to be the cream of the crop of one of Europe's top three schools.

Still, it had a really cool Luna and the Quibbler idea /was/ fairly awesome.

I don't quite recall the name but as i said it died in the early staged and reading it just made me sad because there was so little of it...

Yeah, the harems bother me on a deep level. I lost my affection for shipping ages ago (the creative writing "exercise" of pretending to have fought in actual wars of character shipping aside), but I never shipped Luna with anyone.

We never see her expressing romantic interest, let alone actively dating anyone in canon.

And personally, I have a hard time seeing Luna as anything other than the eccentric little teenager we saw in the books. I don't know if I can picture her actually dating.

I can. But none of the cast of Harry Potter characters in the books. I know people in real life just as quirky as Luna who date/have relationships. But in every case, they seem to wind up with someone who shares there quirks. And nobody from the books fits with Luna at all; the only way to ship her is to change who she is, and make her be someone else. And that's the problem.

One of my favorite fics, and one of my favorite Lunas. Her eccentricities are more pronounced than in canon, but are balanced through the incorporation of her compassion. She tells the little stories as a way to both summarize the events that have transpired and give hope for a happy ending.

It's a defense mechanism, and she and Neville and Harry and Hermione all rely desperately on it. But it's also the best way she can comfort those she loves.

There's a sports drama type fanfiction that I'm a big fan of, not sure if it gets recommended around here a lot or not. Basically post-book 7 where Harry is a divorced quidditch player, and eventually reconnects with Luna. After her dad dies, she researches all the quibbler stuff more in depth and becomes more "normal", but depressed. I'm not selling it well but they're really realistic characters with faults, and I really like this story.

** I agree with this point completely. It's why I avoid Harry/Luna pairings, even though I have nothing against it. I never saw Luna as this mystical, wise oracle above the rest of her peers. I saw her as a disturbed child who went through the traumatic experience of losing a parent at a young age. She had 2 years after he mother died to spend with her father before she went off to Hogwarts, and I'm almost positive that Xenophilius wasn't going to comfort her or give her adequate time and attention. She wasn't able to socialize well with others and never stopped talking about conspiracy theories and fanciful creatures.

She's just a really hard character to write. In the beginning, fanfic authors just gave up and got rid of her ramblings and head-in-the-clouds attitude and made her a normal person hiding behind a persona to protect herself. Now they make her wiser than anybody in the series, and alll the shit she talks about is real.

But what really gets me is that they use her as a deux ex machina /constantly/. She's always the one that sees through lies and deceit and disguises without even trying. Harry traveled to a different dimension? Luna knows and understands this by looking at him for one second. Harry is in a disguise that fools his closest friends? Luna doesn't even realize that he's under a disguise. Some magical mystery to be solved? Luna has the answer, of course.

I don't think I've seen a single fanfic where the author does her justice.

** One of my favorite Lunas I've seen in fanfic is in Protection from Nargles by Arpad Hrunta. She can still be a little dreamy at times but you can still see her as the teenager she is. She can be very smart and insightful but underneath shes a lonely and awkward teenage girl who has a crush. I think the first chapter sets a pretty good tone for what to expect from the fic.

** This is a great post, and something I've thought about a lot. I both agree and disagree with you. On one hand, I agree with most of what you've written, but I don't think reverse bashing is the right term.

Bashing is primarily motivated by an emotional desire to see a character that someone doesn't like shown in a negative light. That could potentially be done well, but laziness and bad writing generally make it a poor tactic.

I think what you are describing is similar but in reverse. I think this "reverse bashing" is primarily due to Luna being a difficult character to write (and laziness) and secondarily due to people wanting to portray her in a good light.

I'll be (similarly) lazy and just post my response to a similar thread.

*/"Why is Luna associated with pudding in so many fanfics?"/*

#+begin_quote
  The short answer is that a few of the popular early Luna fics featured pudding heavily and this has trickled through the fandom like any popular trope.

  The long answer is that Luna is very difficult to get right. She is a very strange girl who often hides her true thoughts and emotions behind seeming gibberish, but is actually intelligent, insightful and witty if you read between the lines.

  She constantly switches between subtly and bluntness, elegance and (actual) gibberish, shyness and boisterousness, and brilliance and credulity. Writing her is a constant balancing act between an odd, confused little girl and quirky, thoughtful young woman.

  To make matters even more difficult, she actually doesn't have that many lines in canon. In fact, her name is only mentioned 356 times in the entire series (27th behind Percy at 426).

  This means that people who don't do sufficient research are trying to reproduce Luna's unique personality from just a few, scattered, poorly remembered lines within a 7 book series. Most of what is fresh in their memory are characterizations from fanfiction, most of which are similarly flawed.

  Furthermore, it's unclear how Luna might (or might not) mature into adulthood. As the fandom ages, we see a lot of interpretations of Luna in her 20s or 30s, and its difficult to try to take her canon personality and extrapolate that out by 10 or 20 years.

  In preparation of my Luna fic, I spent weeks reading every one of her scenes in canon, and exploring my favorite interpretations of her in fanfiction (both as a major and minor character). Then I figured out how I wanted her personality to grow and change in the next 5-7 years based on her circumstance.

  I wrote the first chapter, scrapped most of her part, then rewrote, revised, asked for second and third opinions, and revised some more. It took me months to come up with something I was proud of that I thought represented her characterization well.

  Some very few people seem to have a knack for writing Luna and can get into her head space easily. For the rest of us, writing Luna well is a long, arduous process.

  It's a lot easier to just make her an insane, nymphomaniacal, seer that is obsessed with pudding and talks about crumple horned snorkacks constantly.

** Let me give you an alternative or two.

(Copy/paste from earlier comment)\\
Ana Luthor's series of one-shots is great. Works as one big story, but it's not clearly stated.\\
In that order:\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2424442/1/Sitting-on-a-tree]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2562998/1/Asking-her-before-someone-else-does]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2792477/1/Dancing-When-the-Stars-Go-Blue]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2817179/1/Words-fail-you]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3075049/1/When-a-Hero-Falls]])\\
I'm gonna take a chance and call it complete.\\
And another series of (this time officially connected) one-shots, also great, also in that order:\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487457/1/A-Boy-a-Girl-an-Owl-and-a-Train-Compartment]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12499983/1/Somehow-You-ll-Just-Know]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12504864/1/Flower-and-Serpent]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12518962/1/Moments-in-Bed-with-Harry-and-Luna-A-Sketchbook]])\\
On-going as far as I can tell.\\
In those two, Luna is really true to canon.

And if you want some crack:\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5136938/3/Innocence-and-Roses]])\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins]])\\
Each has a different take on Luna compared to the usual fanon. Both are hilarious. The first one is pure crazy awesome.

I do prefer Luna not to be a seer. I like her to be really smart and perceptive, though. I find it adds depth to the character. Also, when you have such an unpredictable character, you need to do something with it, more than just a few quirky dialogues and scenes for the lulz.

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

** I like writing Luna, but I also like writing her as being a person (not just the lol random character or the super space airhead). Writing Luna well is about as challenging as writing Snape well, largely because both of them are fairly multifaceted.

While Luna/Harry isn't my OTP, I do enjoy writing them together when requested.

It works very well if you use suggestions rather than descriptions ('You are comfortably sitting in the grass, maybe you can see the sun high in the sky, or maybe it's the light breeze, but you feel very good that afternoon' rather than 'It was a nice afternoon, I was sitting comfortably in the sun. It felt good' you find in the first person POV).

** Not insane? Well, I beg to differ - why? Because IMHO Luna is a troubled/damaged little girl who badly needs therapy (ok: That can be said for MOST of the HP-Characters, including Harry (Dursley-Baggage, not to mention seeing people die for him several times), Dumbledore (Ariana-Baggage), Sirius (Azkaban damage) etc. etc.)!

She might not be dangerous to herself and others, but she's not all there either! Her damned creatures and conspiracies aren't endearing or anything, they are stupid (maybe a defense mechanism, maybe inspired by her father who also could not deal with the death of her mother/his wife and therefore couldn't help Luna (who was a little kid at that time!) deal with it either! In fact her father also needs therapy and is, IMHO, an unfit guardian!) and kind of mad/delusional (then again: People with delusions (we call them religions!) roam the earth far and wide and most of them aren't dangerous!)....

I think Luna needs a friend, a good friend (no: Even Harry is not that, after all he doesn't clean house with the bullies in Ravenclaw...I'd sick Flitwick on them if I couldn't do it myself!), someone who is willing to argue with her for her own good (telling her to snap out of her delusions and use that mind of her's, she's not a Ravenclaw for nothing, is she?) and will not accept stuff she says just to not offend her!

*** /Not insane?/

Luna is not insane, which using the Webster definition is defined thusly:

"exhibiting a severely disordered state of mind : affected with mental illness (2) law : affected with insanity"

Luna is socially awkward, and does not appear to hold to several social norms, but this appears to be more ignorance or indifference rather than an inability to comprehend

#+begin_quote
  Because IMHO Luna is a troubled/damaged little girl who badly needs therapy
#+end_quote

We're never given any indication that Luna didn't receive some sort of help.

#+begin_quote
  Her damned creatures and conspiracies aren't endearing or anything, they are stupid
#+end_quote

As I've mentioned to you before, the only creatures that Luna ever actually thinks may be in the room with her are Wrackspurts and Nargles. Wrackspurts, going by Luna's description, appear to be some sort of tiny insect that buzz in peoples' ears and cause disorientation. And in a universe where Billywigs exist--/electric blue wasps/ that cause people to *float* when stung, the Wrackspurts sound remarkably plausible

And with the amount of corruption that went on at the Ministry, are Luna's conspiracies really that far out of line?

#+begin_quote
  maybe a defense mechanism, maybe inspired by her father who also could not deal with the death of her mother/his wife and therefore couldn't help
#+end_quote

And maybe Luna genuinely believes that the eyewitnesses are telling the truth, or is at least willing to listen.

As for Xenophilius, while it is apparent that he is emotionally dependent on his daughter, that's a far cry from say he couldn't deal with the death of his wife, or couldn't help Luna

Luna, may I remind you, is far more at peace with the idea of death, and believes in the afterlife. She believes she'll see her mother again, and as we know from the very existence of the Resurrection Stone, there is an afterlife in the Harry Potter Universe

#+begin_quote
  In fact her father also needs therapy and is, IMHO, an unfit guardian!
#+end_quote

Under what definition do you consider a guardian to be "fit" or "unfit"? By what they provide their child? Luna has enough to eat and has clothes to wear, and is clearly loved by her father.

#+begin_quote
  and kind of mad/delusional (then again: People with delusions (we call them religions!) roam the earth far and wide and most of them aren't dangerous!).

#+begin_quote
  I think Luna needs a friend, a good friend (no: Even Harry is not that, after all he doesn't clean house with the bullies in Ravenclaw

So, a friend is someone who responds violently to bullies? Okay, where do you draw the line?

#+begin_quote
  I'd sick Flitwick on them if I couldn't do it myself!
#+end_quote

I assume you mean Flitwick the Professor, because if this is Flitwick the Dueling Champion against school-children that are not using physical force, then I'd argue you crossed the line into being a bully

#+begin_quote
  someone who is willing to argue with her for her own good (telling her to snap out of her delusions and use that mind of her's, she's not a Ravenclaw for nothing, is she
#+end_quote

That someone better be willing to actually consider Luna's arguments, because otherwise they're no better than any other bully. Paraphrasing what C.S. Lewis said, the most oppressive of tyrants are those who act in the name of "for their own good."

And have you ever considered that as a Ravenclaw, perhaps Luna has considered the possibilities?

#+begin_quote
  nd will not accept stuff she says just to not offend her!

Clearly, you've never heard the term "Agree to disagree."

** linkao3(On the Continuity of Consciousness) is probably one of the better Luna depictions I've seen. Luna's character is deep, brilliant, lonely and confused and those very same character traits reinforce and interplay against each other in a fascinating way. Downside is that, while inspired by canon, it's definitely not canon Luna (well, I don't think this is a downside but some might) and the story doesn't focus too much on Luna's crypto-zoology (I think we only hear of crumple-horned snorkaks). [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lovegoods-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-hp-oc-si-ish.388120/]] Luna doesn't feature too heavily in this, It's mostly about an OC who's luna's brother, but its really good.
