** uh... turning out like he did after growing up as he had /is/ him growing up to be different. if you make him an asshole then he's just another asshole because he had a bad childhood. that's like the most common reason to be an asshole.

**** Well, it's hard to discuss a story when all you have is this. Maybe expand more on what your plot will be, how you want to characterize, etc.

Also a couple grammatical mistakes here and there:

It was so easily expected and taken for granted that Harry /would/ have morals, that he /would/ sacrifice himself for others, it was expected of him. Did no one even /think/ for /a/ minute that a boy growing /up/ in /an/ abusive, neglected and unloved world /would/ be different? This is the story of /a/ Harry Potter who would push someone as /a/ shield before him from /an/ oncoming killing curse. Who told you he was a hero?

Corrections italicized.

I may have missed a couple, but grammar aside, to me it doesn't flow very well. You may wish to grab a beta. Not trying to be rude or push you away or anything, just typing out what I saw.

****** Can't even be bothered to promote the story via a fully-written chapter?

What are we supposed to do with a summary full of errors? I mean, that could at least be fixed by learning from your mistakes or even getting a beta to read through it.

Don't think your shitty attitude can be fixed though.
