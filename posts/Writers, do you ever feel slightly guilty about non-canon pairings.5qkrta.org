For example Harry/Fleur is popular but I often feel a little bad for Bill who by all accounts was a great person and made Fleur happy. It might not be every pairing for example I never really feel that Harry and Ginny had a great relationship in the book so I never really care if they aren't together and I do my best to pretend the epilogue was never written. So you ever feel bad for being a fictional home wrecker?


** Fanfiction would get boring pretty fast if you just stuck to canon the whole time, so no, i dont feel guilty.

** Not at all. That's why fanfic is so great. We get to explore everything the books didn't. I love non-canon pairings.

*** Not to mention Tonks and Remus. I think Tonks was a 7th year when Harry was a 1st year...doing the math..carry the 1...lol. They are a 13 year difference? But hey, whatever works.

**** Also there's the hazy knowledge that the Wizarding community is far smaller than normal society's population. Thus marriages across greater age spans is probably normal due to the smaller population.

** I'm not really a writer(a dozen deleted drafts, no time to get good), but I'm usually less okay with a pairing if the relationship in canon was there, but significantly different(different dynamic). If two characters weren't that close/ mostly ambivalent, I am okay with the pairing. Harry/Hermione for instance I don't like much, because they had a great relationship in canon, and the pairing feels meh. Same goes for ones like Harry/Draco Harry/Snape etc.

This is why I like ones like Hermione/Tonks, because there's chances for new developments.

Obviously, this depends on the fic, how the characters evolve, and if AU, none of this counts.

**** I've only tried searching on ffn, nowhere else. found six fics, two readable, one complete.

The two crossovers I haven't tried, because I haven't heard of Carmilla.

This second one is being updated, but I haven't read it yet. Leery of the tags, tbh.

** That depends. How AU is the story? Because if characters have different experiences, then a new pairing makes sense. Second, do you have to use OOC or bashing to make it work? If you do, no thanks. The only character that needs more bashing is umbridge.

** I did write a Sirius/Severus slash one shot for a challenge which makes me feel rather uneasy these days, though the relationship wasn't really the point of the story. I am in two minds about changing or deleting it. But there are bits of it I like so I probably won't.
