Found this fanfic by Draco664, one of the premier Harry Potter fanfic writers from the 2000s. It is quite good, but from what I read, his fanfics have not really aged well, and I think this is an example of that: assassin satellites that track magic is something that I simply cannot believe in, considering that in the real world, assassin satellites are still just fiction. Thus, while the Fanfic is good, I would not really call it the best. What do you think of the fanfic? Does it stand the test of time, or belongs in the junk folder with other once-popular fanfics of the time that has now been regarded as utter trash? Here is the link to the fanfic: [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_End/The_End/]]


** Well, I read it. So it's readable.

It's not all that much of a fic, more like a worldbuilding concept with in-universe justifications described in fic form...you know, like I sometimes do.

What plot it has can basically be summed up as "muggles were afraid of wizards and wiped them out, peace didn't work because Fudge is a moron". Sort of.

The thing about it being world-building, though, is that it makes me think. What happens when genetic mutations bring magic around in the far future once again? How did people react to the literal 'witch-hunt' for people with magical genes? Or to having high-precision kill satellites surrounding the earth?

And, can horcruxes survive and continue to function even with the complete lack of other magical life supplying magic to the world? What if Voldemort survived? Or other dark lords who were never truly killed? Would they continue to float around, possessing and corrupting muggles like some sort of Sigma Virus?

Ooh! Or, magical-kind have access to time travel; what if they fled into the future or the past? Now that has potential, a multi-way time war between human muggles trying to exterminate magic, wizards/witches trying to subjugate muggles, a mixed faction of peacemakers trying to deescalate things, and magical monsters/dark lords who just want to consume everything while their opponents are divided and distracted.

*** Yeah, that is one thing that bothered me about the fic, that it never fully explored it's premise. For example, I doubt people will really be comfortable having killer satellites in space, for they could be used to target political leaders once the wizards and witches are dead, probably resulting in war that might usher in Fallout (I mean, the fanfic did mention nuclear weapons). Plus, it is actually illegal to put weapons in space.

Might have worked better as a premise for another fic, as one reviewer pointed out.

**** Mm-hmm. Don't forget that even with a genetic test for magic, nothing's stopping people from being afraid that they'll be framed as witches/wizards for dissident political opinions...especially if some government or other actually does do that.

And there's also the question of what happens if some countries elect not to try and wipe out magic; do the other countries invade them to force the extermination of magicalkind, or do those countries become sole havens for magic, or what?

...Actually, you know what I'm thinking? In the not-so-distant future, the world is recovering from a sweeping wave of hysteria which saw thousands if not millions of people murdered for 'sorcery'. With killer satellites hanging in the air, waiting to execute anyone who shows signs of being 'undesirable', the populace at large lives in a state of fear.

But the sorcerers were real, and one of the darkest of them, long since dead, left behind an experiment; a kind of dark spirit, invisible to non-magical beings, that feeds on and is created by fear and suffering.

Muggles beware; the Dementors are breeding.
