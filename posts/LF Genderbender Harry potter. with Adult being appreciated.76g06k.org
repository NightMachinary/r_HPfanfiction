honestly, I'm wanting to start a club for well written, mostly complete or complete Genderbender stories. whether that be by Spell/potion/birth it really doesn't matter. help on this would be welcome!


** It's going to be a small club, especially with the "complete or mostly complete" requirement.

Probably the only decently written genderbender fic is linkffn(11862560). It still has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6n3ahl/transharry/dk6lm39/][many flaws]] in the direction the fic took but at least the writing is consistently competent.

*** So angsty :( I had to stop reading this one after reading about Melantha calling herself stupid and silly for the thousandth time.

I think it was this fic where the dialogue was paced... not well, with large paragraphs placed between so many single lines of dialogue. But I'm not sure. I haven't read it in a while.

Author kinda had a [[/r/Iamverysmart]] thing going on too.

It's a shame. It does some things well.

** linkffn(7613196) is a fantastic series with fem!Harry, and it's very well written, albeit very AU. It is not completed as a series, but there are already three full, completed books that are 200-400k words each, as well a currently updating fourth book, so that's around as mostly complete as I can think of.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
