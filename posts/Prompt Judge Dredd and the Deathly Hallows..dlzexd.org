During the opening of Deathly Hallows, Voldemort starts to give his speech when, suddenly, Dredd comes bursting through the dining room door announcing to the room, "Good evening, citizens! Crime Blitz!" What happens?


** Dredd is instantly held in place by Voldemort's magic.

Voldemort, seeing his... unusual attire, enters his mind and tears through his memories, and if he doesn't stop once he discovers that Dredd is a filthy muggle, he discards most of what he sees as muggle nonsense.

After this, Dredd gets a killing curse to the face and drops dead, Nagini gets a meal, and the dining room gets a new animated armor set sporting plasma weapons.

The End.

*** Pretty much. Voldemort might be curious about a traveler from the future. Do they know about magic? What weapons do they have?

But probably not.
