Wouldn't they be able to stun the animal romove what they need and the regrow what they took with a combination of spells and potions and then when the animal is healed wake it up and send it on its way none the wiser?


** For great amount of additional cost where breeding new animals and then feeding them would most probably be cheaper than using 10 different potions on something that will die anyway

*** I doubt they do it for everything, after all wasn't one of the Detentions Neville got harvesting rat or toad spleens?(pretty sure it was Toad because Snape was a Bastard like that and Ron was the one Snape gave the Rat harvesting detention to).

But for some it could be worth it.(especially if you can use the potions to harvest more ingredients to make the harvesting potions)

** I mean technically they probably could, magic is a wonderful tool after all, but it would come down to a cost vs benefits ratio in the end I imagine.

The time and effort that would need to be put in in order to brew the potions, stun the animal, do a surgical procedure(magically of course) and then feed the animal the potions would be insane. You cqnt have any large farm because while magic can heal most wounds it takes time and that's alot of animals to care for. Like when Harry takes all night regrouping his bones in his arm, imagine if he had to regrow all the muscle, fat and skin too.

The mental toll of repeatedly butchering and and essentially torturing an animal, even if its asleep and cant feel it would take its toll on someone aswell.

In the end it would be expensive aswell, majority of the ingredients we see used in Harry Potter are brought from an Apothecary, it is unlikely that someone could grow even a majority of the ingredients needed let alone, manage a farm, brew the potions, butcher the animals, heal the animals and care for the animals as they recover so either they are just going to buy the potions ready made for a premium or pay for other people to do the labour which would both cost them.

It's a nice idea, and it's probably a good plot point if someone really wanted to morally justify eating meat with them not actually killing the animals but it is unlikely to work considering the enormous effort that would need to be put in.

*** Pretty much the only reason It was even on my mind was, the Terrible trope of the Killing Curse being a Misunderstood farming or medical spell.

This is pretty much as far from the Killing curse is just a farming skill as I could get.

I think you could do it as something like transfiguration and not even need the healing.and then the animal could put the weight back on over time.

**** I'm wondering if the ingredients the necessary potions would need to regenerate lost tissue would require the deaths of other animals anyway, so it wouldn't really even out in the end if your purpose was to harvest meat without killing anything.

If the potions didn't need those types of ingredients, I could see there maybe being a niche market for "vegan" cuts of meat that were ethically sourced in the way you describe. Some people are willing to pay premium prices for specialty foods.

***** I don't think Hagrid,Newt or Charlie would be OK with Dragon products if there was not a way to get them without harming the Dragon.(remembering Hagrid's Dragon stake from fifth year).

I imagine it would also be useful for getting Dragon heartstrings without killing the Dragons which would be useful for Wand makers like Ollivander.(and didn't slug horn say how much Dragon blood costs at the start of sixth year and that the price had gone up, how much extra dragon blood would a Dragon friendly Blood replenishing potion let you get?)

I doubt they do it for everything but for More magical,longer lived and endangered(or all three) creatures it would be cost effective.

****** I don't think potions or healing spells would necessarily work on a dragon though. Maybe a non magical animal, but remember that the reason things like dragon hide is so prized for boots and robes and things is it has a degree of resistance to magic being cast on it. Same thing with Hagrid himself. Being half giant, he's kind of impervious to a lot of spells. Which might also be why he has to resort to treatments like holding a dragon steak on his swelled up face to get the bruising down. We never see him actually seek treatment from Madam Pomfrey for any of his injuries. Maybe it's because they won't work on him.

** I always head canon magic as 'everything has its price'. For most every day use, it just tires you out a bit, but for lifechanging things like regenerating large amounts of flesh is very difficult and 'costly' in some way, so farming is just easier. Also I don't think it was ever suggested that magical medicine was that good. While Harry was able to regrow his bones in book 2, the only other examples of large wounds are Moody, Peter and Fred, which are all left, although there may be other justifications for this.

*** Yeah that is a headcanon I just can't agree with(but to each their own). And I am Pretty sure it was established that Moody's and Fred's ear were caused by dark magic(or magic were the creator went out of there way to make it so you can only reverse it with a specific magical counter spell or potion.after all from memory Molly thinks she could just regrow Fred's ear and is very upset and shocked when she finds out she can't but Snape was able to fix Draco up just fine after Harry hits in with the same spell in the Bathroom during sixth year)

** I mean, it might be technically possible, although even that is dubious, there is some canonical evidence that when a limb or organ is removed entirely it's gone and you can't grow it back.

(Peter's hand and finger, Fred's ear, Moody's everything).

Would anyone actually do that? I can't see it happening. Potions are canonically expensive and difficult to make and Harry Potter magic seems to struggle doing anything at large scales.

Farming and butchery meanwhile is easily scaled up to meet demand using the traditional techniques humans have known about for hundreds of years.

Raising and killing animals the normal way seems like it would involve vastly less effort, therefore it would be cheaper, therefore that's what would be the norm.

*** Peter choose to get a new "better" hand from Voldemort, Fred's ear was cut off with dark magic, which we know can be healed with the right conter magic, after all We saw Snape heal Draco.(Molly was upset that she couldn't heal it rember, if that was normal there would be no reason for her to even try or be shocked when it dosnt heal) and Moody's wounds are established to be from dark magic which we know can't be healed the same way normal wounds can be.

**** Sure it can be argued either way. But as I say dubious. the original care of magical creatures professor is also implied to have missing limbs, Peter never healed his finger which was described as being cut off.

But you're missing the point. Even if we take as a given that magic CAN heal lost limbs and organs It's highly unlikely to be easier than traditional farming and butchery of animals.

***** Doing thing the non-magical way also leads to a lower quality product.In both the long and short term.(non-magical=quantity, magical=quality) the magical world can't do thing on the same scale as the muggle world so they have to make up for it in other ways.

****** So there are a few things to unpack here.

First you can use no doubt use magic to aid with mundane farming and butchery in rather more practical ways than stunning and harvesting parts from potentially highly magic resistant magical beasts then healing them up with more magic.

Second, while including magic in a production process can potentially lead to a superior product (for example Hagrid and his pumpkins of unusual size) it's far from guaranteed.\\
And I don't think the magical harvesting you outlined would automatically improve quality.\\
Whether you kill the dragon and harvest its heart strings or harvest the heartstrings from a still living dragon then grow them back with magic the result seems like it would be the same.

******* Part of the quality improvement would happen over time, by being able to harvest without killing thing it would better help with selective breeding.or at least that is one of the ways I think it would help. But yeah I don't think every one. Would do it but someone like Newt that cares about magical creatures and animals, but also understands that their ingredients are necessary might go out of their way to create it.

And it not like magic in the Harry Potter world is stagnant it gets improved over time.

**** Not as far as I'm aware. If anyone who knows the books could cite a passage saying so, then I'd appreciate it. The story I'm writing right now is different anyway. I kept Gamp's exceptions, but I did away with the time/power limitations on transfiguration. If you can change it, then it's changed. Period. Until someone changes it to something else. Likewise if you duplicate something, it's a true duplicate, and only an examination of it's magical essence would reveal it as a duplicate. I headcanon that your tastebuds and nutritional requirements don't care, though.
