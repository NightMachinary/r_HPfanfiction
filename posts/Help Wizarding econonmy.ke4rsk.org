I had an idea for a fic, and just like always I started writing it, not sure if I'll finish it but anyway I'm stuck. I'm having Harry work as a proffesor at Hogwarts but not sure how much his salary should be, I tried figuring out on my own but only succeeded on confusing my self more. I started thinking of the salary then houses then clothes then food and so on. So I have some questions if you can answer them, or if you tell me what you think of their economy. Thank you!

1) Is the wizarding world More or less expensive than the muggle world? 2) 1 Galleon =?? Pound 3) Do you think wizarding salaries are more or less than muggle salaries? 4) How much do you think should a Hogwarts Teacher salary be?

*Those are the ones I can think of now, thank you! *Maybe I shouldn just ignore the money part? That will make it so much easier


** IG is 5 pounds I believe

The salary will not be very high as 1) all expenses are provided but won't be low either it will be a middle to upper middle class salary

The magical world is different from the muggle world I would say that even if the headline number is a bit lower or higher wizards will have a higher standard of living or purchasing power, after all a lot of jobs become redundant due to magic, or at the very least take much less money. A team of 10 wizards could build a decent house from scratch in a forest in a day I believe so many cost will be lower as something similar by muggles will take more time effort and people

Also the existence of apparation means daily commute cost should be low, a big chuck of household expenses

** Question, does it matter?

Even if money is a central part of the plot, not going into details is usually a better way of achieving a consistent world and telling a good story than doing Tolkien levels of world building that your readers will never see.

Just ask yourself how well off you want a professor to be in terms of purchasing power for the story you want to tell and write scenes, describe characters and plot things out with that in mind.

Professors are poor means they drink the cheap drinks, tend to have side hustles, wear second hand clothes and so forth.

Professors are rich means they travel for holidays each year, have expensive toys, costly vices, etc.

Well off is probably somewhere in between.

consider the following snippet, it tells the reader plenty about Harry's financial situation without going into details on exchange rates or salary's:

/Harry hurried through the swirling snow shivering slightly despite his warming charm. He kept meaning to set aside enough money for a new cloak, but each winter his old, threadbare coat was once again pressed into service./\\
/At least the Hogs Head would have a hot toddy on offer and Harry had just enough coin in his pockets to get one and maybe some dinner.../

** I always thought that the wizarding world was more expensive but that's my opinion. A galleon is about 5 pounds. I think that if the wizarding world is more expensive than salaries sound be higher to compensate for the high prices. I'm not sure tbh about your last question but I hope I helped!

** I think that salaries are lower in the wizarding world - yes, the Weasleys are supported on one income, but they've also got just one gold galleon in their vault (plus some small change). Purchasing things second hand, they manage to buy books for 5 of their children. This is even though Lockhart sets several books.

On the other hand, I think the wizarding world is far more skill dependent. So, Molly Weasley is great at cooking and food related magic (Ron believes she can conjure it). Quite possible she makes ends meet by increasing food quantities.

On the flipside, we have Tonks who can't even fold a pair of socks.

In the muggle world, yes the available electronics might be (much) better and a very small minority have extraordinarily thrift skills that lead them to look down on those who struggle on benefits but electronics is more of a leveller.

It's also my suspicion that the gap between the rich and poor is wider, with higher levels of deprivation in the wizarding world compared with Britain at the time.

Quite possibly, Hogwarts pay includes board - if it was truly excellent pay, then there would be less trouble recruiting DADA teachers for just under a year.

*** Your point for the weasleys is a good one, however I feel the need to point out that even if they only had around 5 pound, the books would be cheaper than in the muggle world. Let me explain. It would be easier for wizards to produce books on a large scale for really cheap because of magic. Books in the muggle world are likely more expensive because making the books is more expensive. Other than that I believe you have some very good points.

**** Ah, I'd meant to put "including books". Even with magic (and based on what Harry spends) £5 is cheap for what they get. (Without a doubt cheaper than the muggle world - or they'd have turned up bookless.)

I agree most elements of book printing would be cheaper, but companies things for peanuts in Chinese factories and then charge high prices so its not a given. Especially since Hogwarts books are essentially a closed market - you can't get an alternative guide (just outdated ones) and there's very little else in the way of education available.

I am unsure that the raw material costs would be much less; I think transfigured parchment could run the risk of being untranfigured, something most good printing presses would want to avoid (especially if selling books for rambunctious teenagers).

Even with magic, it could be more hassle to keep animals for parchment compared with growing trees.

Plus, goods can't be THAT cheap or else there wouldn't be a thriving second hand market.

It's my belief that living costs are low, but luxury goods are steeper.

** Well Fred and George were able to finance thier startup through a 1000 galleons. Granted, that they did sell stuff to students and make a profit, but I believe it was to let people at Hogwarts know that they sell cool stuff( and for testing).

** 1. Pick some conversion ratio. Yes, 1G = £5 (used in the books) is probably wrong (because she has discalculia), so pick whichever you want and stick to it, but it really doesn't matter which one you choose, just stick to it.

2. Then try to approximate based on UK prices, because there must be at least some correlation, otherwise (if we assume at least partially rational behaviour) arbitrage would be a big deal.

3. Therefore, Muggle prices are pretty good foundation of what can be expected. So, when [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/_build/html/04_meet_parents.html#id1][I need to establish]] how much Potter family owes Weasley family for taking care of Rose Potter (aka Ginny Weasley, who is actually Harry's sister) for fourteen years, I have found governmental rates in 1990s for foster care family in rural England was £125 weekly (£219 in London), so that makes 25G/week for rural Devon, and you can make your calculations from there.

4. When we have prices which don't have Muggle equivalent (e.g., cost of building serious permanent wards around The Burrow), I just played it by the ear. There are some permanent protective enchantments (aka wards, but the term is never used in the books) around The Malfoy Manor House, but apparently nothing around The Burrow, so I had to find some price which was out of reach for Weasleys and still not completely ridiculous, and I had to invent some back story why something which could be just couple of waves of wand costs so much. So, the wards in my story must be custom designed by specialist for every location (taking into consideration shape of the plot, geological and magical structure of the soil, etc.), and some very special runic stones (only found in one quarry in the northern Norway) must be used. So, in the end they cost around 10-15 thousand Galleons, which fortunately the Potters vault can carry (and they owe to Weasleys that much money anyway; with above calculations for the foster care of Rose, I came with something like 20,000G).

** The best exchange rate is 1 gallon = £50.

That puts 1 sickle at about £3 and a knut at £0.1

Arthur and Molly support a family of 7 on 1 salary so I'd assume the cost of living is significantly cheaper.

It would follow that salaries are lower in general as a response.

Unless you feel that salary details add to the plot it'd be easier to handwave past it.

** ​

1. Generally in smaller communities, things are more expensive as there is less room for specialisation and economies of scale. However you have to take into consideration how magic affects this: for instance, if you are able to transfigure robes, then its price will likely be lower. If magic is used for agriculture, then food prices may be cheaper. Equally, it may be the case that if there is one food supplier, then prices are exorbitantly high. Again, context is very important.
2. In my opinion, you shouldn't worry too much about the exchange rate unless it is of importance that the plot crosses between the muggle and magical world. An exchange only warrants discussion in a fanfic if there is significant cross-world interaction. For instance, are there regulations to stop you melting down the gold and flooding the muggle economy, which would cause an investigation and threaten the SoS. Perhaps the ministry and Gringotts has a fixed exchange rate. If there isn't enough demand on either side, then exchange rates will likely be unofficial between private individuals, with the rates fluctuating wildly.
3. Again, this depends on context. With the presence of house elves (slave/free labour), who appear to actually be very motivated in their jobs, this likely means that the lower ranks of society are undercut far more than in the muggle world. For instance, Filch is easily replaceable, and thus would likely have a much poorer salary compared to a muggle equivalent. Equally, it appears many, if not all students are capable, at least to some degree, of charms, transfiguration and potions, meaning that these industries and their workers are likely to be squeezed. However, specialised positions hard to replace are likely to command extremely high wages, given that only a small proportion of an already small wizarding population would fit in those roles.
4. I would believe that a Hogwarts professor would command an extremely high wage. This is because, at least from what we are given, the role demands high qualifications. Snape, who is the potions master, was a child prodigy, modifying potions as a student. Mcgonagall demonstrates the ability to turn into an animagus, a supposedly rare feat, and on a tangential note was able to produce 3 patronuses (which I think is BS but is canon), suggesting she is extremely powerful and competent. However, keep in mind those are the /core subjects/, and similar to in the real world, professors of other subjects such as muggle studies may receive far less.

The most important thing in writing any fic is to make it internally consistent. This is something, which most economists would tell you, JK seems to completely mess up. The grand prize for the Daily Prophet prize is 700 galleons. A trip on the Knight Bus costs eleven sickles, meaning the prize could fund around 1000 trips. In the UK in 1994, the First National Lottery Draw had a grand prize of around 6 million pounds. Around that time, a bus ticket cost around 40 pence (15 million trips), an economy concorde ticket cost around a thousand pounds (rough calculation using approximation of 1500 usd with 1994 exchange rate median, 4000 trips). By this estimation, the Knight Bus would be considered a luxury transport. It's not, and if you consider the fact that apparation is extremely common, and other avenues of transport such as portkey, floo, broomstick or hippogriff (if you have the power of main character) then you'd expect prices to be lower than natural. A meat pie costs 2 galleons, while a soup costs anywhere from 3 to 5 sickles, meaning that around 8.5 soups is a pie, which seems quite high imo (keeping in mind this is bar food)

I think the best approach is to sprinkle this worldbuilding in as JK did. If it isn't absurd (or even if it is), you can get away with it if it isn't the focus of your fic. Talking in relative terms. For instance, Malfoy might mock Potter for his 'pittance of a salary', or we might see that Harry has to be frugal. Don't focus so much on the money aspects, but rather the implications on character actions and behaviors.

** 1) The magical economy looks very different depending on the limits the author puts on magic. Dumbledore conjures comfy armchairs with a wave of his wand, so furniture is probably ridiculously cheap...unless conjured items fade over time, or conjugation is power intensive. Overall, anything made with raw materials should be cheap and anything made with skill and/or labor should be expensive.

2) Check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/43qv9c/lets_talk_wizard_money_a_look_through_everything/][this thread]] for a list of what everything costs and an estimate of galleons to dollars. Converting that into pounds, one galleon is about £20.

3) I'd guess about the same, maybe a little lower for magical salaries. A Hogwarts professor should earn less than that, though, because room and board is included as part of their salary. In the US at least, a balanced budget has rent as about a third of your income. So whatever salary you decide a teacher should earn, multiply that number by 0.67 to see what a Hogwarts teacher should earn.

4) They should earn enough to live comfortably but not lavishly. Harry never comments that Snape's clothes are ratty (which, he comments on Snape's hygiene all the time) and we know Snape didn't have any money or decent clothes from his parents. So Snape's salary must be enough to put him in at least average clothing. Likewise, the only professor we see living in luxury, Slughorn, tells Harry that his luxuries are gifts. He doesn't buy excessive extras with his salary/pension.

** my thoughts.

1. 1 gallon equals about five British Pounds. IN the 1990s So, this is about 8 or so $ if your America. But. -Does Not Matter- which my next points will show.
2. I'd say Less. With hog warts Paying about 100-1000 G a year. depending on how you write it. (which gasp seems low. He said that's 8 Grand! but ill explain)

I feel the wizard society as a whole Does not have a lot of inflation our Normal worlds do for many reasons. Also the cost of living is a lot cheaper than most think.

1. as [[/u/Southdelhiboi][u/Southdelhiboi]] said many jobs become redundant with magic.and as [[/u/AnkitMishraGr8][u/AnkitMishraGr8]] mentioned 1000g was enough to start a Buisness. also [[/u/Luna-shovegood][u/Luna-shovegood]] mentioned that the weasleys a rather large family lived off 1 salary ( mind you very tightly but still 1 salary)
2. following gamphs laws you can't create food from scratch you can extend it, and even make it taste better. but you can't create it. we are never told the other 4 laws. but this means you can create -alot- of what you need from magic
3. think of the adult's mindsets/time frames. wizards age slower. so many of them still have older beliefs about money.
4. finally they still have Houses. which makes me think of old lords and such.

My theory is the wizard world is alot acheaper in terms of whats spent, but you also make a lot less. 1 gaellon is a good sized amount of money. but you cant cross it over to our terms. they also Don't need the money as much to live. Magic can warmth, clothes, make cheap food better. outside your few things your pretty much living well off a lesser wage.

** 1. I'd say everything is cheaper. and I have two listings of prices for things in the wizarding world: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/43qv9c/lets_talk_wizard_money_a_look_through_everything/]] is something I found a long time ago but I also have a list for a lot of things that was listed on Pottermore when it was a video game: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOzE6ih7ZrEJtCoGs_CF2_K0g5f3bSW0hHoOjiUc_L8/edit?usp=sharing]]
2. This can help you figure out the currency value per any date starting this exact moment that your read this and the current moment as it continues all the way into the past of when people kept track of the currency. It is based off a bank value converter of British Pounds and they assume that a Galleon is always 5 Pounds.
3. I'd say it is the same but it is likely that it is less. Most things are valued at substantially cheaper prices than the human world. Therefore it is likely the job payments are less too.
4. However, if you base it on difficulty I think it should be the same as a muggle teacher since they have to deal with potentially life threatening hazards on a daily basis. Snape was the only teacher who didn't have a kid die or get killed in his potions class. Cauldrons tend to go boom. The Creatures Class had at least one incident with malfoy and many with burn wounds thanks to the Blast Ended Skrewts.

** In one of my fics harry gets smart and uses his knowledge of the muggle world to do an end-run around the stupid wizarding economy. He gets paid in galleons from his wizarding job, melts the galleons down into ingots (Gringott's ingots. Heh heh.) and then sells the ingots in the muggle world for thousands of pounds, then invests that money. That way he has an investment portfolio that insures he'll never have to work, he just lives off the interest.
