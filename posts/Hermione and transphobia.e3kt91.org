Probably controversial, but I was wondering, given JKR's following of noted transphobes, how you think Hermione would handle the concept of transgender individuals given that she's kinda JKR's avatar. I'm writing about trans!Rose and Hermione's attempts at understanding him, if that helps give context, but I also want to discuss this more generally.

We all know Hermione's into social justice (SPEW). In a lot of fics I've read with a trans protagonist, the author interprets that detail to mean she's their biggest advocate, somehow connected to the muggle LGBT world as a preteen in the 90's.

But according to JKR, the wizarding world is far more tolerant than the muggle one when it comes to LGBT issues, so I feel like that's kinda backwards? The wizarding world would have far more effective transitioning strategies, so wizards would probably be more accepting, at least 20 years ago back when being trans wasn't as talked about. Maybe this is the one issue Hermione doesn't understand?

Or, fanon also likes to see Hermione as a feminist, an interpretation I agree with. Maybe this translates to her not understanding /why/ someone would transition and adopting a "TERF" mindset, much like the British feminists JKR follows? Or she believes firmly in the idea that being a trans man means that you're "giving up" on being a woman and falling into gender stereotypes.

TLDR I'm trying to write a more realistic interpretation of how Hermione would react to trans people. As a trans dude, I've always felt that the reactions I've read feel unrealistic for the time period.


** Hmm. Good question. There might be several answers... the canon story doesn't go into trans issues at all, much less what Hermione might think of it. Well, she did once take Polyjuice Potion to adopt a male form (she was one of the seven Harry Potters in DH) and didn't seem to have a problem with temporarily being a boy, but of course that was a disguise and probably doesn't say anything about what she might think of transpeople.

If I'm to speculate, though... I don't think Hermione would go full-on TERF. That's not to say I think she would immediately be on-board and accepting, like some fanfics portray her as. Hermione is overall a kindly individual who at least WANTS to be inclusive and accepting, and when she sees people who need help, her immediate instinct is to help them... but she sometimes has her own ideas about what the best thing to help them would be, and she has an unfortunate habit of TELLING you what you need, rather than LISTENING to what what need. So it's not at all a given that she would immediately understand the trans person's wants and needs, because they are different from what she's used to. Hermione isn't very good at recognizing when people have different wants and needs than she does.

I kind of think Hermione's immediate reaction to a transperson, or hearing about a transperson, would be "oh, don't be silly" and change the subject. I doubt she'd take a very strong stance for or against the issue, at least not on the same level as, say, house-elf rights or blood bigotry. Partly because she doesn't quite get it (and she has a long history of either ignoring or dismissing things she doesn't get) and partly because I doubt she'd have any sort of insight into trans rights or even realize there was a problem.

If a person she just vaguely knew came out as trans, I think she'd largely just ignore it. Maybe she'd make a couple of dismissive or even slightly disdainful comments if they were brought up. She wouldn't rally against them or anything; she'd probably be polite to the person's face, even using their preferred pronouns when talking about them, just as a courtesy... but she wouldn't go out of her way to be an ally either.

If, however, a close friend or family member came out as trans, that would force her to take a stance and get more involved. After her first "don't be silly" reaction, her SECOND reaction would probably be more like "are you sure?" and then "but why?"

Eventually, I think she would land on the decision that this person has a problem, and if someone she loves has a problem it's her job to help solve that problem. It's a little up in the air what exactly she might end up believing the problem IS and what the best way to deal with it would be, mind... she'd definitely want to do a lot of research and read a lot of books on the subject, so here it would depend a lot on exactly what books she managed to get her hands on and what they said.

Worst-case scenario, she might just decide that your problem is that you suffer from some kind of delusion and/or have problems accepting yourself for who you are, and as such she might try to solve the problem by "making you see the truth about yourself," trying to get you to accept that you ARE the gender you were born as and that's perfectly okay, because it's fine for a girl to have masculine interests or dislike makeup, that doesn't mean you're a boy, you don't have to conform to gender stereotypes... and so on, and so forth. If she is set on this path, then it's going to be very hard to get her to change her mind. She won't be mean about it or anything, and she'll definitely be sympathetic, but she will probably get frustrated that you just won't see what's best for you, and won't follow her advice when she knows best.

Best-case scenario, she comes to the conclusion that the problem is with your body and not your mind... and probably with society at large. If the sees examples of transphobia and discrimination against transpeople, she'll be disgusted at it and very likely she'll become a strong advocate for trans rights, protesting against transphobia and discrimination and INSISTING that everyone treats you with respect. She'll be one of your most stalwart allies and defenders, though she MAY end up getting carried away in fighting your battles, being more vigorous about the entire thing than you really want her to be.

Hermione means well, but she doesn't always make the right choices. She certainly doesn't always know the right things to say. While I can certainly buy her as being ultimately accepting and supporting of transpeople, turning her into the "perfect ally" who handles the issue with the skill and grace of a trained therapist seems to go a little overboard.

** An interesting question, that as a cis straight white male I am not qualified at all to answer.

One thing to keep in mind is, despite the fact that Hermione is based on Rowling in ways, they definitely aren't the same person. Hermione loves arithmancy, Rowling doesn't understand math, like at all. Taking any glance at the economic worldbuilding will give any economist a seizure, none of it makes any sense.

So, in essence, Hermione's views don't have to mirror Rowlings.

Hermione does seem like the type to do plenty of research, so might find studies on gender dysphoria? I honestly don't know though.

*** I feel at the same time though Hermione also doesn't really understand things that don't fit her world view (her relationship with Luna, divination) and I feel like the concept of being trans might qualify under the umbrella of things she doesn't get.

I mostly asked this question because she's a school girl in the 90's and it seems off that she would be as instantly accepting (or at least, as knowledgeable) as she is in most trans! fics. She might do research and eventually come around, like you said, but it would take time.

You have to keep in mind that Luna is the magical equivalent of a conspiracy theorist, and not just cute stuff like obscure animals. She genuinely believes in secret Ministry armies of demonic creatures, a sports league rigged through sabotage and torture, a government conspiracy of biological warfare and so on.

I mean, I like Luna for how insightful she can be, but she is also a total nutjob. Basically a "secret Nazi moonbase", Chemtrail and "Lizard people" believer. Hermione not believing a single word and even dismissing her is probably how most of us would react to Luna if we were exposed to her directly.

Which is the reason Luna does not work as a main character unless you rewrite those parts of her character, but that's another debate.

***** A lot of people do associate being trans with those type of things though. They genuinely believe identifying as a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth is more ludicrous than a faked moon landing. I'm not saying Hermione would be the same, just that in canon she's prone to not truly accepting things she doesn't understand.

****** That might or might not be the case, but citing Luna as proof that Hermione isn't accepting of other stuff isn't a good argument because her theories are simply stupid. And divination tends to be rather self-fulfilling all things considered. She was rude to Lavender throughout the series, but that is a different story and due to lacking social graces.

However, keep in mind that Hermione was the only one who took issue about the enslavement of another sapient species. She certainly has the ability to see and caring to stand against injustice.

******** I think that if you were to add in a transgender character into the 1990s, Hermione probably wouldn't understand, because all things said she does have a slightly narrow view of the world. I think that because in that time there hadn't been anything big in the media, she'd lack the comprehension she would need. As we can see from divination, she is cynical of anything she doesn't immediately understand, as you've pointed out.

However, since the transgender character you want to introduce is Rose, and I'm going to guess that she won't transition to a he until at least the age of 8 or 9, possibly later (I may be wrong though), Hermione would have a much better understanding of LGBT issues by that point. Considering that this would be in the mid 2010s by this point, and I can't imagine Hermione ignoring muggle media, she would be a lot less cynical, and at least try to be understanding, or supportive even if she can't understand it.

********** I think Hermione can be a very confusing character, because you can see that she's very stubborn in certain beliefs, while clearly open to others (the existence of magic, for example).

I think this can mostly be attributed to how much the individual things that she is trying to understand explain about the world. For example, I'm sure that Hermione had noticed some unexplainable things in her childhood, which magic offered an explanation to, but divination never clears anything up.

With this in mind, having rethought, I think that Hermione would be initially confused by Rose's behaviour (before transformation), and become frustrated with her, possibly causing pain to Rose, but once Rose is able to make it clear that she, or now he, is transgender, then for Hermione it would explain everything. I think the fact that Hermione would now have a reason for her (former) daughter's strange behaviour would make her accept it, and embrace it. Even if she doesn't fully understand it, she would try, and it would probably lead to frustration with herself.

I don't know if you're interested in how Ron would react, but unless you've written him as abusive or in other ways a bad person (which I hope you haven't), then I think he'd be initially shocked at the change, not having foreseen it at all, in a very Ron-like fashion, but after getting over the shock I think he'd just get on with life and accept that he now has two sons. However, I also think Ron would advise rushing into anything like gender reassignment surgery, before Rose is 100% sure that s/he wants to go through with it.

*********** In my fic outline, Ron gave up on his auror career to take care of the kids (& George/the joke shop) and has always been the emotional centre of the family compared to the kinda high-strung/ambitious Hermione. He became more mellow after becoming a stay-at-home dad. And like you said, he accepts everything rather quickly even if it takes him a bit longer to understand exactly what it means. I like the idea of him being so encouraging it ends up becoming additional pressure. I hadn't thought of that and it fits my interpretation of Ron so well.

**** Omg, this!

I went to school during the 90's- 2000's and most of the world was blatantly homophobic until like the mid 2000s. Imho, Hermione might have a lot of struggles with Rose being trans, but this would force her to not be so rigid in how she views other people since it now hits closer to home. And luckily for all of us, people CAN change from their toxic beliefs for the sake of their loved ones, so even if you make Hermione struggle, there can be a possibility for her to change for her child's sake.

Op I'd love to read your fic once it goes up.

It's the '90s, but Hermione loves the downtrodden. However, she's also doesn't necessarily empathize with them.

I dislike fics that outright ignore the allegorical elements of Harry Potter in favor of saying it outright, if that makes sense.

Her stance doesn't really need to be known, but look at her stance on house-elves, or any other disparaged being.

** I want to clarify that I don't agree with the below position, I am just trying to provide the explanation OP asked for.

From a TERF perspective, they spent so many years carving out women-only spaces for themselves and fighting to have places to go where they did not feel vulnerable or second best to men. Added to that, they spent many years fighting against gender norms and the suggestion that if they didn't love all things twee and pink and wanted to be an obedient housewife that there was something wrong with them. They fought for butch lesbians to be accepted as women, and they fought to be allowed to enjoy and be good at things traditionally thought to be purely the realm of men. They have had YEARS of trying to get people to understand that gender is a social construct influenced by society, and that men and women are socially conditioned into gender conforming roles.

TERFS struggle to wrap their heads around moving from that to individuals genuinely and strongly feeling that their gender doesn't match their body. They cherry pick suggestions from trans individuals and organisations that would appear, at shallow glance, to suggest that gender non-conforming people must be trans. They find individuals, like Robert Webb, who point out that they were gender non-conforming as children, but now feel secure in the sex they were assigned with.

For someone like Hermione, who might have grown up reading old school feminist books, she might be extremely confident in her assertion that gender doesn't really exist, and that Ron might simply be a gay or gender non-conforming man. She might mean well saying "well of course you can wear a dress of you want!" But feel uncomfortable with his assertion that she is a woman, because she doesn't feel that Ron can ever understand that lived experience, or that she is entitled to be part of the space that generations of feminists fought for.

Edit: misread Rose as Ron, but my point still stands!

**** Gender is this amalgam of ideas, roles, norms, etc. that are socially constructed and are assigned to people at birth based on what their body looks like. So part of that social construction includes ideas about the physical characteristics that people of that gender are "supposed" to have. A transgender person is someone who does not identify as the gender they were assigned, often, but not always, from a young age. It is consistent and having the gender they don't identify with forced on them causes distress. Not all trans people experience body dysphoria, and those that do don't all experience it with the same intensity. Not all trans people feel compelled to medically transition.

** Well, Rose is her child so I think Hermione will love him/ her/ it no matter what. A more interesting point would be Hermione's reaction to an unrelated third party- say she comes across a girl being bullied/ harassed/ beaten in Diagon Alley and helps her, only to find out it's a boy. And anyway I don't like mixing fiction with politics. I read fiction to get away from all the crap that is broadcasted daily on the news.

*** If ony parents did "just love their kids no matter what." Being someone's child doesn't mean you're loved or cared about. Sometimes it just means you're an attachment they can use to hurt and spit at to make themselves feel good. Those words have no inherent positive meaning to them. The relationship is only as good as the person wants it to be.

As for your Hermione question, in canon, she seems to dismiss the idea that centaurs and humans can mate and accepts things that fit her worldview. I think she'd try to talk with Rose about social aspects of and try to understand her change, but come off rude when questioning the magical aspects, if you create those that is.

You specifically brought up the political aspects of this topic in your post when enumerating what you want to discuss "more generally". If that's not something you want to discuss, then you should probably clarify your OP to say otherwise.

Your words:

#+begin_quote
  We all know Hermione's *into social justice* (SPEW). In a lot of fics I've read with a trans protagonist, the author interprets that detail to mean she's their *biggest advocate*, somehow connected to the muggle LGBT world as a preteen in the 90's.

  (...)

  Or, fanon also likes to see Hermione as a *feminist*, an interpretation I agree with. Maybe this translates to her not understanding why someone would transition and adopting a *"TERF"* mindset, much like the *British feminists* JKR follows?

Well, I'm not too familiar with Britain in the 90s, but by the time Rose goes to school, it would be some time in the 2010s wouldn't it? An adult Hermione in today's Britain would probably be reasonably progressive. I also don't think JK Rowling's views should matter at all when writing Hermione, just extrapolate from the Hermione of the canon HP books.

  The wizarding world would have far more effective transitioning strategies, so wizards would probably be more accepting, at least 20 years ago back when being trans wasn't as talked about.
#+end_quote

It's possible, but not necessarily the only way the wizarding world could deal with trans people. Maybe the traditional way they're treated is to use mind magic/legilimancy/something to simply go into a person's mind and eliminate their gender dysphoria. Perhaps that could be a potential point of conflict for your story--Hermione/Ron could want to take Rose to a mind healer, but Rose doesn't want to, and would consider that to be changing who they really are.

I'm not sure I buy JK Rowling's line about the wizarding world being more accepting of LGBT people. With how obsessed purebloods are with bloodlines and heirs it seems more likely to me that they'd find some spell or potion to 'fix' gay people rather than just accepting that their kids won't have blood heirs.

**** My fic has time travel, so I'm looking for opinions on all eras of Hermione, if that makes sense. I think your idea of legilimancy is interesting --- I've seen it in a fic before and think it could be interesting to explore it more, even if it doesn't make it into this fic

** I imagine it depends on Hermione's relationship to Rose (you mentioned time-travel, so Hermione wouldn't simply be a mother). She might become a rah-rah ally, maybe obnoxious at times, but really into history of transgender wizards, ready to recite it at any point Rose's gender was questioned. Hermione loves history, and our real world gender identity is so dynamic through the ages and interesting to study that I'd assume its magical counterpart be similar.

I can easily see older Hermione changing, losing her passion for justice in favor of her career (being the best is important to her), and letting her reputation dictate more of what she believes. I don't think JK's position is that important, ultimately - she is inconsistent, you are the author of your fanfic, so if I were you I would study Hermione's character in the scenes I find relevant and ignore what Rowling writes/endorses beyond the published books.

She understands legal protections and what not, would work with a trans coworker, etc. She just doesn't understand why /her/ child is trans.

*** The books and movies depict traditional gender roles as still being relevant in the Harry Potter universe (women are depicted as homemakers instead of men for instance, and "purebloods" obviously care about continuing on their family lines via intermarriage), so in fact identifying as male or female would have a noticeable impact on the shape of a character's life.

**** Yes. But continuing bloodlines is something you just do because that's your history. Not doing it would be a loss to the world. It doesn't imply anything about gender roles although it might be easier when people don't have to feel and just do things according to convention.

Mrs Weasley is a homemaker though, of course.
