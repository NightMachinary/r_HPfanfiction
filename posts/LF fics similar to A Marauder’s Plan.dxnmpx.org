As the title says, I'm looking for well-written, complete (100k+ words) or regularly updated fics with similar aspects to A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool.

What I'm looking for specifically:

-Awesome, on-top-of-things Sirius raising Harry (doesn't matter if it's immediately after the Potters' death or when he canonically appears)

-Politics!! Ancient and Noble Houses, Lords and Ladies, Wizengamot, that sort of thing.

-Powerful/Super! Harry.

Bashing (as long as it's not Harry or Sirius) doesn't bother me, if it's there it's thereü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è All ships are welcome regardless of gender, as well as all ratings and host websites. I just wanna read more about my two favorite boys taking the world by storm.

Thank you guys in advance!


** I liked Sirius in Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Harry is pretty skilled but not super.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** I'd agree that that one's the best Sirius-raising-Harry fic I know of; doesn't really fit the request, though. There's more /Auror/ politics than Wizengamot politics, and as you say, Harry is fairly ordinary.

Although I suppose the Malfoys conditioning Draco to become more suitable for Gryffindor, because they have a second son to go to Slytherin and they want an "in" with Harry in case defeating Voldemort means that he's destined for great things might count as politics. Also quite chilling.
