Unusually in this sub, I usually love a good canon rehash or fics that focus on characters ... but I've got an itch. And that itch is for a fic that depart from canon in some way, preferably around fifth year but that's by no means a hard and fast rule.

Criteria:

- Good SPaG (I'm not overly pedantic but basic paragraphing and punctuation is a must).

  - I can forgive who's/whose but you're on thin ice!

- Liberal use of the word 'said'.

  - My pet peeve in fanfiction: every character 'thundering,' 'stating' or, worst of all, 'smirking.'

- Judicious use of adverbs.
- Departs from canon in some way.
- Harry-centric.

Preferably:

- No fem!Harry. No shade on anyone who writes it; just not my cup of tea.
- No slash, but I'm willing to make exceptions.

  - If it's not Drarry, Snarry or Tomarry, I'll give it a go.

- Some love for Ron Weasley; that boy deserves more.

Thanks all!

#+begin_quote
  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, then the war. Harry now guides the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. Canon loyal, not dark. Adventure, not angst.

** These have tolerable to great SPaG - punctuation around dialogue is a pet peeve of mine, and iirc there's only one or two here that manage to screw it up. Two are crossovers - one with Star Trek Voyager, and one with Jurassic Park. The JP one is pretty cracky as is Grimdark in its own way. Grimdark also isn't nice to Ron, but iirc it's the only one to actively bash him.

And yes: Voldemort is part of the finale of the star trek one.

Apologies if you've already read these.

where he /nopes out of the tournament/ - Lawyers against the cup, The power of the press, extradition escape.

where /something changes about the third task/ - Grimdark (don't read chapter 26, your brain might catch on fire), Pack

*Fifth year AUs* - Fall of the house of potter, Hell eyes, The Merging, Rise Above, Me without my tardis, the voyage home

#+begin_quote
  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him.

** The Like None Other series diverges from canon at the start of the sixth year. It's Harry focused, Mentor Snape, and Draco has a big role too. There are a few issues with Ron but they get resolved (it's not bashing). There's no slash. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

**** Ron isn't supportive of Harry coming to want Snape to be his guardian and mentor at first and says a few rude things about Snape. Eventually Ron comes around resumes his friendship with Harry.

***** That's not bashing tho.

Canon ron wouldn't be supportive of snape as anyone's guardian let alone his friend. I haven't read the fic but that seems to fit his original character.

****** I know, which is why I said it wasn't bashing, but I wanted to include that there were issues with Ron since the OP said they wanted a Ron friendly story.
