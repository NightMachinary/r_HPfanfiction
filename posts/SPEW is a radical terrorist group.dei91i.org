** Played straight, but Hermione takes things way too far as usual and is constitutionally incapable of seeing the reactions to it as anything other than proof that she must be doing the right thing if people are trying so hard to stop or discredit her.

Hermione keeps finding ways around attempts to stop her through the Wizengamot and the Ministry so a blustering Fudge goes to the muggle government with a "you've got to /do/ something, we can't stop her" speech then runs off with a "well, that's settled then" before clearing things up enough, so the British government ends up thinking it's a dangerous muggle-magical terrorist organization.

They track her down, she's waiting for them in a boardroom in her lair and turns around Dr. Evil style while holding Crookshanks. Hermione is too sure of herself to realize that the agents think she's a /terrorist/ terrorist, and not some inconvenient activist they're out to silence. Banter happens, the agents foil her plan this time but she escapes as the base self-destructs.

Back at Hogwarts for the next year, the house elves are scandalized by the knit beanies and rainbow toe socks scattered around the dorms, and she's somehow gotten S.P.E.W. posters up throughout the castle. The elves don't take them down because they're too happy cleaning up the messes some of the students and staff make trying to do it. Fudge gets chased out of office over his inability to stop one schoolgirl from constantly owling leaflets to everyone.

** The wards flared a warning in Malfoy manor one dark night, interrupting the Death Eaters' fun (they were torturing Charity Burbage to the glee of many, taunting her with the perfunctory "lessons" in Muggle facts betwixt bouts of the Cruciatus). With unspoken direction from the Dark Lord, more of a warning look, Lucius nodded and stood to see what the disturbance was. The rest of their merry band hardly noticed anything amiss. Can't keep the cabal from their stress release, can we?

Now alone, Lucius was free to mentally inspect what the wards were telling him. A small group, no more than a dozen, were encircling the manor. The Order? That was bold of them, attacking directly, knowing the Dark Lord was likely present. Then, Lucius got an inkling. Dobby's antics a few years prior had inspired him to erect another set of wards, specifically keyed to watch for house elf magic. He had learned the hard way the mischief one elf could cause, and Potter's friends were disgustingly friendly to those... /creatures/. Lucius Malfoy may be biased, but he wasn't stupid.

Lucius waved his wand, calling on the protective magic, and his heart sank.

"What is it, Lucius?" Lucius nearly jumped. He'd neither seen nor heard the Dark Lord approach him. "Is it the Order? Quite brazen of them. I shall alert the others. Remember, if Potter is with them, he's /mine/."

But Lucius didn't speak. His heart was in his throat. There were /dozens/ of pings. They moved preternaturally fast. His wards were falling in quick succession, much faster than even the most skilled curse-breakers could ever achieve. No.... Impossible! How could there be so many!?

"Lucius. Speak!" the Dark Lord commanded.

"It's... It's not the Order, master."

"What then? What do you dare fear more than *me*?"

"They... They call themselves S.P.E.W., master."

The Dark Lord cackled. "/SPEW!?/ That house elf welfare group? Hah! I never knew you for a comedian, Lucius."

"Sire..." Lucius was practically begging for the Dark Lord to take him seriously. "The 'W' no longer stands for 'Welfare,' my Lord."

Lucius sank in an apologetic low bow, and the Dark Lord's countenance shifted from amused, to understanding, to enraged faster than a /Metamorphmagus/ transformation.

Commander Dobby, Dobby the Daring, as his fellow elves liked to call him, stood triumphant on the dais overlooking the defeated Death Eaters. Dobby wore his trademark Hogwarts Christmas stocking as armor, bespeckled in several smaller socks, or "pins," noting his high rank in the Social Pact of Elvish Warriors. Dobby also wore a pink sock on his left arm as a shield, a polka-dotted sock tied to his waste as a scabbard, an over sized green sock for a helmet, a bright red sock on his left foot (that some claimed was originally white and only stained red from the blood of his enemies), and his first ever gifted sock on his right foot.

"How goes the hunt, General Hermione Granger, missus?" Dobby saluted his mast--no, general. It took a while for Dobby to stop calling the wizards in their band "master," and nearly all the other elves still clung to the habit, but there was no breaking any of them of their inflected speech pattern.

"We have Malfoy in custody, Commander. Good work," his general reported. Dobby beamed. "Your knowledge of the manor and its wards was instrumental in the success of this mission, Dobby. I'd say you have earned a promotion." She pinned a tiny golden sock to his stocking and saluted. "Carry on, Major Dobby."

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had escaped them by using Fiendfyre as a distraction (the Killing Curse was quite ineffectual to the elves who simply apparated out of the way every time), but the majority of his followers were now dead or captured. It would only be a matter of time before they hunted him down.

Wizards were very slow to see radical change rising up through their culture. Centuries ago, wizards would have taken S.P.E.W. much more seriously, but they had forgotten, or maybe just ignored, the fact that elves had a talent for mischief and were far more skilled than the average wizard in the Art. The rise of the House Elves, a movement that started with the personal crusade of one fourth-year Gryffindor, had shaken magical society to the core. No one suspects the House Elves until they are bearing down on you, using their unique magic, culinary skills, and cleaning arts to wipe the dirt of bad witches and wizards off the face of the planet.

**** Thanks!

I imagine Hermione's movement started just like in the books, but without the support of her friends, she doubles down and just keeps going at it. Harry and Ron aren't seeing eye to eye at this time, so they are each trying to help, solve, or dissuade her from continuing separately.

Harry, tired from his Tri-Wizard Tournament endeavors, makes the suggestion to "give the Elves a purpose. That's all they really want. Freedom to them is like a purposeless life to us," hoping it keep Hermione busy and not so... acerbic. Hermione doesn't always see the forest for the trees, and he /wants/ to help, but she's going about it all wrong.

Ron, seeing that Hermione has some minor success with Harry's suggestion, off-handedly remarks that "elves would make great soldiers, you know. Their magic isn't like ours, so most wards don't really affect them."

Once the ball gets rolling, it's really hard to stop.
