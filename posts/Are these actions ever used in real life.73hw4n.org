** Definitely holding up the hand or a finger, especially during heated conversations. The finger on the lips while less common, I have done, but only with my husband. I would hold up my hand to my manager, but finger on the lips? No.

** As someone who's done both in the past, the latter can be either a hand or a single finger held up, and I usually accompany it with a Mayes-ian phrase ("but wait, there's more") when someone expresses a strong emotion during a story I'm telling, while the former I've used primarily in very intimate situations to soothe a partner who is distraught, the best example being when they tried to apologise for "making" me "put up with" them in the aftermath an anxiety attack, and is usually accompanied by words of comfort.

** I'll hold up a hand, maybe just one finger (which finger depends on the situation) to get someone to shut up while I finish something. I'd never touch someone else's lips. Who knows where their lips have been?

** u/TheVoteMote:

#+end_quote

Very common I think. Just lifting the hand up in a gesture to wait, hold on, give me a minute. Something like that.

#+begin_quote
  She laid her finger on my lips to silence me
#+end_quote

I'm sure it happens but that's pretty dang intimate and uncommon.

Going on a little tangent here, I feel like I see "she put a finger under my chin" in the context of making him look at her. I've definitely never seen someone do that in real life, I feel like it comes off as rather patronizing.

*** I think the patronizing nature really depends on the situation. Lifting someones chin with a finger could be a gesture that says "chin up high, nothing to be ashamed of" in a friendly, supportive manner. It could also be used to ascertain authority / dominance by directing the line of sight of someone. All depends on context.

*** I've only seen the finger (or hand) under the chin thing done to children. My parents stopped doing it to me when I was around eleven. I think that's the reason why it comes off as patronizing.

Yeah definitely seen that.

#+begin_quote
  "She laid her finger on my lips to silence me"
#+end_quote

That reads like a plot device to deliver sexual tension.

** hand up : definitely. pretty much can do this for anyone you feel the need to interrupt.

touching someone else's face, especially a sensitive area such as the lips : only if you have a close relationship with the person and only then if it's the kind of relationship where it wouldn't be odd. if you wouldn't feel comfortable holding their hand to lead them somewhere then you wouldn't do this either as an example. i've done it before to a female friend, she licked my finger in reply, but she's the only person ever that i'd have done that too. wasn't a girlfriend but we'd hung out for years already.

** The hand is pretty common, but the finger on the lips is either super rude or something you would just do with a significant other who would hopefully know you were kidding.
