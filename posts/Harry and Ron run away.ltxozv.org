When it comes to "Harry wises up to the fact that the danger he is in and flees the country", it is usually an OOC of character independent Harry (boo!), Or someone decides he doesn't deserve this and they run away together.

Often (but not always) a romance for those running, it is very common for Hermione to be the one. Either in response to Harry's unwilling drafting into the triwizard, or his forced isolation the following summer.

So the question is: Any fics that do this with Ron?

Ron is just as capable of stepping up during the ootp part. His characterization in GoF makes this hard but not impossible:

  "You know, I think someone is trying to kill you mate", Ron said apologeticly to Harry.

  "Figured it out have you?" Harry responded bitterly.

  Suddenly Ron was forced to process this had been exactly what Harry was claiming the whole time

  "But..." He stuttered "... Then why are you still here?"

  Harry's shoulders sagged. "Where else would I be Ron?"

  The silence between them lasted only a moment, but seemed to stretch out an eternity. Untill...

  "Look Harry, I'm sorry, I've been a crummy friend." Stated Ron. "I should have been there supporting you. You deserved that from your friend" He paused to gather his thoughts, then continued. "I don't know if you still want it, but I would be there for the rest. I miss what we had.

  A broad smile errupted upon Harry's face. There was little he wanted more than to recover his connection with his first real friend.

  "Look" said Ron, "I know it is going to be chaos for a bit, but can we talk tomorrow? Privately? Maybe after class? I have something I want to discuss"...

Sure, Hermione can be the plot device for why Harry looks up wizarding contract law or knows wizard extradition law. But Ron grew up in the magic world. Things that would have to be discovered or established can simply be known by him. He can know, for instance, that the delegations have sovernity so Harry can just go to one and request asylum. Ie that the punishment for breaking a magical contract isn't a big deal. Or that France/England/Germany are in Kahoots so if you want to run you need to go America/Japan/Egypt.

Can be a trio fic I suppose, as long as Ron is part of the drive for leaving.

I would prefer not Harry/Ron romance. Partially because I don't see them as compatible characters, but mostly because you shouldn't have to be romantically interested to save a friend.

On that note, if anyone knows any good "H&H run away where they are not interested in each other. Like they run away together, maybe adopt each other as siblings, I would like those too. I have read a few time travel fics with that dynamic, bit never a flee canon one.


** I like this idea a lot! After all, Ron's place in the trio was designed to give them the cultural knowledge. Hermione's was for /Hogwarts, A History\/* and general research purposes.

*JKR even said that the boys never read it. I like stories that touch on this: sometimes they have a bet as to who can go the longest without reading it, sometimes Harry reads it but won't admit to it.

**** I don't really see this. Ron may not be an idiot, like some people like to portray him, but he's no intellectual. I like to imagine that he, in fact, hides some of his knowledge and "plays dumb" a bit in their arguments. She likes to show off her knowledge and he, growing up with the twins and Molly, possibly sees the arguments as normal familial communication.

****** You said that he reads in order to have more complex arguments. That implies reading as an intellectual exercise, not reading for pleasure.

One thing to note is that unlike the rest of the Trio, Ron is tied to Britain. His family is there, and much of their sustenance comes from the land they own and the patriarch's job at the Ministry. It's not something they can afford to just drop - they are rooted there, and Ron leaving could have negative repercussions on his family.

We see a small glimpse of that in DH: Ron has to be replaced by a disguised Ghoul and said to suffer from a virulent illness in order to avoid overt repercussions of being associated with Undesirable Number One.

Which is why I'd like for Ron to provide direction, but remain behind, using the 'falling out' to be clear of suspicion. After all, compartively, Harry and Hermione can move much easier. Hermione's parents can get a job anywhere with people, Harry has nothing to tie him down.

One of the fics I've been trying to track down for some time had a scene where Dumbledore'sSpy!Ron came across HHr duo preparing to leg it, and siggested Hermione obliviate him, knowing she'd never tried it before and that he'd probably end up with leaky brains. He did it, because he wanted to help them, but Manipulative Dumbledore would read his memories and withdraw support the Weasleys were depending on to survive if he did- and his role was Dumbledore calling that favor in.

*** Eh, sure, but that mostly applies later. If it happens around GOF his exposure is not that different than Hermione.

And he has magical contracts in other countries. "Running away to his brothers in Egypt/Romania would be a fine structure, esp with a younger flight where it is less believable 15 year olds can pull it off without help.

You probably wouldn't see any of "the parents are in on it" like you do with some Harry Hermione run away fics.

Plus they don't necessarily have to be successful in running away for it to make a good story. Ron is a but more... Impulsive than Hermione so going off half cocked is more reasonable...
