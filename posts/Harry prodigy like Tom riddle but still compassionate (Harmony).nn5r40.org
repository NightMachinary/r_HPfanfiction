I want a smart and/or prodigy Harry with harmony as the pairing which is Harry/Hermione, even better if it's without Ron bashing. That's it.


** Imlike Harmony if it's done right. As in Hermione isn't some goddess of knowledge, and perfect in every way. I am sad to say I have not found such a fic yet. Good luck.
