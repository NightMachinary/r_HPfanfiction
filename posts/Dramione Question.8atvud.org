hey all-

so I've been looking around for ages for a couple of works by everythursday (sage). Does anyone know where I can get a copy of Elephant Walk or Finders?

for that matter, can anyone direct me to some well-written novel-length dramione fics that aren't easily found on Fanfiction.net or ao3? I've been searching for lost/hard to find fics ever since I read a pdf copy of "Cruel and Beautiful World" (which is, actually, one of my favorite fics of all time)

Thanks!

** Could you link the fic pdf you have by any chance! I'd love to read it... I'm not great with finding lost fics, sadly. I wish I'd saved some things years ago :(

** Check out the lostdhrfics tumblr for Sage's works and dramioneasks tumblr for fic recs

Also, HPFF is going down at the end of April and the dramioneasks tumblr has a list of most popular Dramione fics from there that aren't found on other sites
