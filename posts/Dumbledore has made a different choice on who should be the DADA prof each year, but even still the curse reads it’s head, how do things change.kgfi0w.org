Assuming that the title plot of each book stays the same, insert a different DADA professor from the rest of the cast and explore how the curse tosses them out.

1- Voldemort was very glad that he didn't kill James Potter, because he was close by enough to possess when his first body got exploded. With the Dark Lord riding around in his head, James has searched the world for a way to get the snakey git off of him, and finally a solution arises at Hogwarts. The problem is that it is also Harry's first year in attendance. (Does Harry kill his Dad? Or perhaps the protection works different for him)

2- Not to be out done as a parent, Lucius Malfoy takes up the DADA post. Surprisingly he is worse than Lockhart and is not so secretly gleeful that the Heir is petrifying students.

3- Dumbledore had a lot more faith in his Order and less power over the Wizengamot, so when renowned murderer Sirius Black escapes Azkaban he is offered the post at Hogwarts. Professor Padfoot fails to clear his name, Ron's rat escapes and Snape threatens to out him rather than suffer another year with the convict on staff.

4- Bill Weasley is good at curse breaking and international relations. Unfortunately, he fails to break the DADA curse when he and Fleur go public.

5- Rufus Scrimgeor is the head of the Auror Department but somehow also has the time to teach at Hogwarts. The trio suspect a double act but all of their investigations are blocked by the rest of the staff. Everyone is shocked when Scrimgeor ends his teaching career by going on maternity leave.

6- Lily Potter awoke from a coma 15 years after she defeated Voldemort. In order to spend as much time with her son as possible she takes up the potions teacher position at Hogwarts. Can she and Harry rediscover the memories that will unlock the method of killing Voldemort? And how will this affect DADA prof Snape.

7- I have no clue what this means for the DADA role cause there's not really a plot here.


** In year 7, Voldemort takes up the job he wanted so badly.

We know how that year ends for him.

*** In Dumbledore's will:

"Tom, you are now Dada teacher for life."

Ecstatic at achieving tenure this early in his second career, Voldemort fails to question the blatant absenteeism of the Golden Trio during his classes, since hiding from Death Eaters is actually on the books as a valid excuse for missing classes. Well, that and being a fugitive.

He turns out to be an impressive teacher, best-in-a-generation material to those with the balls to turn up to class (mainly muggleborn, much to his confusion, though that confusion vanishes when one of them tells him their parents won't accept 'but it's a class being taught by magic Hitler' as an excuse for bad grades).

This also means that his Death Eaters lose control of the school over time as Voldemort does too good a job teaching his students how to defend themselves. Which in turn causes a fracturing in the Death Eaters' ranks as some start to recognise that their Lord is unfit for that whole leadership thing and start shopping around for a replacement.

Which... And so on and so forth.

And then the Battle of Hogwarts happens and Voldemort dies, having ultimately proven unable to live up to Riddle's level back in the 1950s. He takes the curse with him upon death and has a surprising number of muggleborn willing to swear up and down that he was actually a good professor, honest.

** Second year: a Muggleborn professor for Defence against the Dark Arts. During the Chamber of Secrets fiasco he is murdered. Ron and Harry go to chamber alone without help. Ron tried to use a spell with his wand but it backfired causing the explosion.

In year 3, an auror say Williamson is the DADA professor. When Sirius first comes to Hogwarts Remus is called and asked to stay for added protection. Remus finds the marauder's map and goes to the shrieking shack. The auror goes to the Forbidden Forest on hearing werewolf howls and goes there and is killed.

In reality, it was Barty Crouch Jr who taught DADA in fourth year. In this one, they never go to attack Alastor Moody. On the other hand, it is Bartemius Crouch Senior whom Barry Crouch Jr pretends to be.

In fifth year Umbridge sends someone else as terrible as her to Hogwarts. She does everything Unbridge does and in the end Voldy shows himself so she is ousted.

In sixth year, Remus is DADA professor. Snape is Potions professor for 1st to 5th years and Slughorn is for NEWT students. At the end of the year, Voldemort takes charge. As he is a known member of the OOTP. So he is forced to leave.

In last year, some other death eater is DADA professor and we all know what happens in the end.
