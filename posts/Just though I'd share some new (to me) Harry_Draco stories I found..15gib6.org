First off, because it's early morning and things are way funnier to me than they should be, I preset you with this [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=8754&chapter=1][crackfic]].

Secondly, I recommend [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=2226][A Thousand Beautiful Things]] and its sequal [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=8337][Delicate Sound of Thunder]].

All stories are by the author [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=157][Duinn Fionn]], who has absolutely ruined my ambitions of getting any really work done over the Holidays.

Let me know what you think! I'm new to the Harry/Draco ship, and I'd love a req for your favorite story.


** My favorites (which can be found on The Hex Files, an all Drarry site) are:

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3598][Big Dick, Come Quick]], a smutfest which is actually fairly amusing and quite enjoyable.

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=7363][Silver and Gold]], which is a lovely, heartfelt story.

If you're new to the Drarry world, I encourage to surf around The Hex Files. Most of the stories are old and haven't been updated in a while, but you can still find some finished gold in there.
