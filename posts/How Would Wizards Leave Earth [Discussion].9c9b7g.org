Even though they would probably easily beat Muggles if they put the effort into it (and ditched ethics), if for whatever reason wizards just decided to pack things up and leave earth, how would they do it?

My best guess is to arrange a bunch of Portkeys (I'm assuming they don't have a range limit, since they're the solution to manageable intercontinental travel) to a planet they can terraform (maybe Astronomy was actually good for something).


** When it comes to wizard space travel mechanics, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), has done a great job. For example:

- Experiments with portkeys failed as they couldn't get farther than the Moon
- Constructed a relatively small spaceship in real size, but used Expansion Charms to create sufficient living space for THOUSANDS of magical beings
- Interstellar travel was achieved using stars as heat source for Floo jumps
- Portkeys and Apparitions were used for easy travels between the spaceship in orbit and planetary surface
- Rune stones provided permanent shield charms that protected them against cosmic radiations and physical hazards

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

**** The thing with /Starship/ is that everyone is an unlikable moron, but the worldbuilding is great (though not necessarily canon-consistent).

** It's magic. I assume a variety of Portkey would work. But it'd be boring if it was just a normal Portkey. I think we'd have heard of it in Canon if someone made a Portkey to outer space.

With apparition you have to have been to a certain place to travel there again. However, you can get Portkeys to a place you have not been, these are arranged to take you to /very/ specific locations, suggesting that there is a fixed co-ordinate that they link to and appear at when activated.

If I was to write a story with this being part of it, I would boil it down to how magical artefacts store their co-ordinates. Apparition I would imagine is personal, Portkeys are impersonal. For apparition you need to put yourself off balance and deeply visualise encompassing the space you wish to appear at. Portkeys don't have minds, so it must be possible for someone to translate /their/ personal understanding of a particular location and bewitch an object into a Portkey that travels to that location.

I think the space travel can occur via either stealing the memories of astronauts who have travelled to space and apparating or Portkeying there, or through the creation of a craft that can jump through space like the Knight Bus, only much, /much/ more powerful.

** Space expanded lead lined block, a few wands built in to allow for banishing charms for thrust, draught of living death for stasis, and some house elves to wake someone up every now and then for course confirmation.

** Depends on how they work, and where the power for magic comes from.

**** You didn't ask "how would wizards go to another planet", you asked, "How would wizards leave earth".
