What the title says, basically. No smut-driven stories or slash/harem pairings. I'd prefer it if they were on FFN or AO3 and were completed.

**** He creates wands on two separate occasions. But it's well over 100k words before he creates a true wand. If you're looking for a super action story this might not be for you. At no point in the story up to this point does Harry just roflstomp middle earth because he has magic and they don't. The closest it comes to that is in the last chapter that was released and it's a well exaggerated story told from father to son for a couple hundred years before we hear it's telling.

He does also eventually regain his old features so he isn't stuck looking like Gollum the whole story.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is my favorite technically crossover fic, which is with Dungeons and Dragons. But there's no need to know anything about the game (other than some of the very basics, I guess - like it's a fantasy RPG that uses a 20 sided dice), even if some of the jokes/references get funnier if you know them. I'd heartily recommend this one - it's probably my favorite HP fic overall.

Another that I remember being funny (in a crack fic sort of way) was the linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens) set of fics - where Harry gets whisked away for a time to WH40K's universe before returning completely changed. All you need to know there (at least, all I knew going into that one) was that WH40K was insanely warlike, and that most humans have almost fanatical worship of the dying God-Emperor. But it's been a long time since I read this, so take it with an asterisk.

Finding Home - Avengers. To be honest, I suspect that all MCU crossovers can be read without actually watching the films - I certainly read a LOT of them before sitting down with the movies. I will say though that watching Iron Man first will make you understand why people don't murder Tony Stark, however. MoD!Harry

A Child Avenged - Avengers, MoD!Harry oneshot.

The Elvenqueen - Tolkien (general). The events of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are relatively minor parts of this story, and twisted in an interesting way such that knowledge of canon doesn't matter in the slightest. Hermione centric, rebirth fic. The first couple chapters are odd but give it a shot and it'll pay off in the end.

Incendio - The Hobbit. A retelling of the Hobbit, you don't need to have read the book or watched the monstrosity of a movie first. Harry is a dragon.

Through the Wormhole - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I suspect that you can get away without having watched the TV show, as it more or less follows it along. However - if you have the slightest interest in Sci-Fi, I'd suggest picking up a "watch these essential episodes" guide for DS9 and watching it. It's aged /much/ better than it's counterpart Babylon 5.

Gods Among Us - Battlestar Galactica. I've never watched the series, and I muddled through this fic just fine. It explains things, and it helps that Harry and Hermione have no idea WTF is going on either.

  Harry Potter was unhappy with his life in Post-Voldemort Great Britain. Tired of the threats and expectations, he agrees to go through the Veil to help the DOM learn more about it. And there he meets the Prophets. They send him back to DS9 with the Sisko. He has a lot to learn about where he ended up. Now finished with Year One of DS9.

** Not on FFN or AO3, but [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6214/Mhalachai+Inevitable.htm][this one]] is my favorite. It is an Anita Blake crossover that is honestly better than any of the Anita Blake novels (they are not especially well written but have some cool worldbuilding ideas). It is complete and all pairings involved are minor subplots.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][This one]] also works. Again, it is not on FFN or AO3, it is complete, and all pairings are minor subplots. I will admit that I am so intimately familiar with the other setting I have a hard time telling what knowledge is crucial, but it is written from the perspective of Ginny so I feel like the author does a decent job of explaining everything important.

** im tired so will put a link in later but the pureblood pretence fits perfectly! it's a crossover with Alana the lioness (i think that's the name) - i haven't read it & the fic is one of my favourites so you don't need any knowledge of it:) the first few books are complete and the current one is being updated slowly - i know you said you'd rather they be complete but it's definitely worth reading even though it isn't yet!

on a similar note, if you do enjoy reading the pureblood pretence there's a fanfic series of it which is a m a z i n g - from america with love. it's less of a crossover but i would definitely reccomend it! again ill put a link in later

#+begin_quote
  A new fanfic that follows a young assassin known to few as Rogue and to fewer as Harry James Potter who fights for innocent lives in the shadows. A massive crossover with mainly Assassin's Creed, Harry Potter and Percy Jackson themes. And some small Witcher connections. WRITING GETS BETTER FURTHER IN. Please enjoy. Rated t for language and safety.

First it quickly goes through the HP-arc; where the fem!Harry builds her support base.

Then it goes to it's /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/ Crossover, where fem!Harry&co interact with that story...

Much of the story is about the old guard being led by Corrupt, Incompetent and/or mentally sick^{due to age} and the MCs going 'whyy' and working (competently) around/against the old guard.

the HP portion is Complete, Hitman portion also has completed an arc (ring-battle) so I feel like you get 1-3 complete stories from this fic before it hits its current chapter. (nor I don't feel like calling it dead )

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
