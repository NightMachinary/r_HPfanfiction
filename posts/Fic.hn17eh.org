So why did Hermione not get in trouble for attacking ron i want fics that she gets in trouble


** Plus quite frankly an "easy out" for Hermione would be "Professor McGonagall I was in an empty classroom practicing the Oppugno charm when Ron burst in and startled me and I lost control of it". Since you never saw the teachers in canon asking for memories to determine what happened in previous disagreements between students it's doubtful that would happen here.

So I can't see Hermione getting in trouble for that at all.

** Because the adults in the series are incompetent and the wizarding world seems to thrive on child endangerment?

While that certainly wouldn't fly in any modern educational institution, it is really not even remotely close to the most outrageous items that should have been taken care of by the adults.

Of course, how could a teenager save the world if everyone was actually tasking care of their shit?

** Of course, who wants to bash Hermione always finds a stick (hint: she is sixteen, we all did stupid things when we were sixteen, if we should be expelled for each of them, half of the human population would have unfinished education).

Despite my persuasion above, there is a story (which I cannot locate now) with heavy Hermione bashing, where everybody makes super-big fuss about the scene with Ron. Perhaps linkao3(Golden Bullets by CescaLR)?

*** Honestly, by the standards of this fandom this is relatively light bashing. Like, unlike 99% of bashed characters, she actually had some character growth :O.
