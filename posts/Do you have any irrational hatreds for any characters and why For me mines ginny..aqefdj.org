** People will hate me for this and I will probs receive many downvotes but... Luna. Not even because of the books but so many fics made me just dislike her so much. For whatever reason Luna becomes in fics this weirdly all-knowing girl with super wisdom. And there's barely a fic in which she doesn't make an appearance, tagged or no. Romance? Luna is there.

There's not a ton of character development and most of what she says is actually fantastical. It's sweet that she cares so deeply for her friends but she also seems weirdly disassociative, like when Hermione is tortured.

I find her quirky/annoying rather than quirky/charming.

***** I don't have too much of an issue with either of them being essentially "introduced" fully formed (though I'd argue Ginny was developed into what she ultimately became) as far as the story goes. After all, its from Harry's POV so it makes sense for him to suddenly notice Luna and Ginny.

I /do/ take issue with people knocking Ginny for lack of development or coming out of nowhere but don't take even greater issue with Luna coming out of nowhere and lacking development.

He wasn't there for Harry, wanted to run out on his kid and kept his mouth shut about Sirius being an animagus which in the end was a good decision but if Sirius WAS guilty, he had information that could have led to his capture. He's self-hating and makes bad choices sometimes, why not explore that instead of canonize him?

** I wouldn't say /hatred/ but... Hermione. Just a little. Please don't kill me. It's not that I hate her, it's just that fanon!Hermione can often times be so good and perfect and smart, and it's very frustrating when I liked canon!Hermione and all her faults. Her faults define her as much as her many virtues, and they make her a much more interesting character.

That said, it's also irrational because I tend to stay the hell away from any fics that she stars in, and almost automatically click out if she's a drivijg force in the plot and gets too perfect for me. I really should give it more of a chance +especially given my lenience with other characters+ but it's very frustrating for me.

If you're considering new looks at Ginny, I'd suggest stepping away from fanfic for a while and rereading some of the canon again.

While I sympathize with this position in principle (I for instance despise Romilda Vane), with due respect, from my perspective, Ginny stops being a fangirl halfway through /Chamber of Secrets./

When Malfoy antagonizes Harry as a fame seeker in Flourish and Blotts, Ginny rushes to Harry's defense--but she doesn't say that Malfoy is just jealous, as Colin Creevey would do. Ginny snaps that Harry didn't what Lockhart making a fuss over him--she recognizes that Harry doesn't want to be famous. He wants to be Just Harry.

While she is still shy around him throughout much of the next two books, I felt it read a lot more like a little girl crushing on her brother's friend than it does fawning over the Boy Who Lived. And by the time we get to Goblet, Ginny is having casual conversations with Harry--and isn't afraid to tell him off when she thinks he's being rude.

****** Ginny can't even look him in the eyes, stay in the same room, or speak to him without turning bright red. She routinely drops things or lets out abrupt squeaks when he enters the room.

Hermione starts telling him about the books that he's in, but then orders him and Ron to get dressed. Ron's pretty impressed, but has a normal conversation otherwise, and he even seems almost as interested in being raised by Muggles as the whole 'Vanquisher of the Dark Lord' bit. The Twins, again, are casually impressed, but hardly awestruck.

I'm not on the Ginny hate train - the character development saves her - but suggesting that they're on the same level is disingenuous.

This is during the period when, as was said above, she is "a little girl crushing on her brother's friend", during /CoS/; so what you're citing to me is after her reaction to him changed significantly. I wasn't being disingenuous, I was simply comparing Ginny's reactions to Harry during /PS/ to those of the other characters. They were indeed all excited to see him, they simply showed it in different ways, consistent with their normal personalities (and Ginny was ten at this point, so it shouldn't be surprising that she was less mature).

**** IMO read her core canon scenes, and read some fics where she's a strong, active character. She's far from a /great/ character in canon, certainly, but she also has strong points that you shouldn't overlook for the fanon banshee/fangirl caricature you see in some fanfics. "The Changeling" is popular, as is "The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond." Strangers at Drakeshaugh is more slice-of-life, but she's a fairly important character there. And there are plenty of fics where she's a fun background character- Prince of Slytherin gives her some nice moments in Book 2.

So you let yourself be influenced by bash fanfics? At least you are honest about it.

I personally will NEVER let fanfics affect my perception of canon characters, including the Movies, although I might like or hate them in particular fics.

--------------

The only character that I absolutely hate in both literary sense and in-story behaviors is Voldemort. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

But even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. He got killed while trying to take back a high school!

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

And we should respect this pathetic character?

Hogwarts, presented as the greatest magical fortress in the series. Defended by everyone in Britain willing to fight. IIRC, Voldemort was going to win if he didn't have another woopsy trying to kill Harry, which was again caused by magic that basically nobody knows anything about. And Harry still would've died if Rowling didn't decide that a blood infused simulacrum should count as a budget a Horcrux.

Did he, though? He tries to jinx Harry during Quidditch first year, but that was pretty obviously a target of opportunity without planning. He's just after the Stone, and doesn't particularly care about Harry until he literally butts into the Stone's final resting place.

Second year, he does nothing.

Third year, he does nothing.

Fourth year, he again goes after Harry, but only because he wants the blood protection nullified and that was the best time to do it.

Fifth year, he's actually after the prophecy and Harry is more of a means to that end, since only Harry or LV could take the orb.

Sixth year, he's targeting Dumbledore.

And, I mean, seventh year, yeah, that's all Harry, but who else was there at that point?

******** The entire first year is a definite /im/pulsive move, so, 'kay. But if he really didn't care about Harry, he wouldn't have tried to kill him until /after/ he came back.

Main-part Voldy may not have been targeting Harry second year (probably too busy thinking over the blood protection), but Tom sure was after Ginny brought him up.

Forth year, Wormtail even says they could use literally anyone else, but Voldemort just dismisses it for the sake of bypassing the protection (hey, other than the convoluted, metaphor-inducing plot, it was actually sound to use Harry)

Fifth year, he focused on the prophecy, sure, but did he /really/ have to use Harry to do it? Means to an end, yeah, but it was obviously also a "two birds, one stone" plot: get the kid to get the orb, kill him when the opportunity arises. If he succeeds in killing Harry, the prophecy is redundant and can make for light entertainment with dinner.

Third and Sixth year, I'll give you those entirely. But he /must/ have been plotting behind the scenes of Two and Three.

But that's my take, and I'm not one to believe he spent 10 years reinacting "Springtime for Hitler."

BTW, if it seems like I'm taking this way too seriously, no way, I'm just having fun talking about this kind of stuff.
