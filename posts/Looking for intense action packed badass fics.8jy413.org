Looking for FanFiction with long intense battles, no slash and a sarcastic Harry who is so overpowered it's a joke (guilty pleasure) and is over 100k and complete.


** Sounds a lot like the Denarian Series. linkffn(3473224), his character is a bit unlikeable because of it and the battle scenes are different but common as well. Even as strong as Harry (and Meciel) are, they still have real opposition and conflict.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

*** I like this story, it was great although I wish I had never read it so I could experience it like the first time again.

** I'm just re-starting A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast Its a marvel crossover that deals with his Voldie years in Chapter 1. It does have slash, but its also got a good amount of action, a ridiculously OP Harry, and its currently sitting at 1.5 million words.

*** It's a great one, with regular updates every 2 months or so, even as overpowered as he is the Harry in that faces enough competition to keep the story interesting

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
