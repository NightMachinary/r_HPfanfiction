I got this fic recommended to me on reddit and it was about a Harry who obliviated up to Halloween 1981 due to Lockhart in the Chamber. Harry was very unemotional and Sirius was somehow free. I think it was mentor Snape but don't take me at my word. It was on AO3 and everyone and their mother was gay somehow. I dropped it because I had loads of other stuff to read, but I've run dry. So if anyone could tell me the title if they know it, that would be great. Thanks!

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
