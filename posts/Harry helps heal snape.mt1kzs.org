This is bothering me. Harry tries to heal snape... something about wormwood? Snape meets the marauders in the afterlife, they forgive him, tell him he needs to go back. He jumps into this lake and dives down and the merfolk put some sort of paste on him, removes his scars.. Something about the mark, though I may be wrong on that. Thats as far as I got. Any help would be apretiated.
