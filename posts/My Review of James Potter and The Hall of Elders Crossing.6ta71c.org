As my first book review, I did the first book of James Potter: [[https://agamermagazine.com/james-potter-hall-of-elders-crossing-review/]]

And I was wondering, seeing that this is the very first book in the James Potter series did anyone else enjoyed it? Or did anyone enjoy the James Potter series overall?

I've read three out of the five books and I liked it! Some parts was crazy, but it was good. I felt like this series was more on the detective side than Harry Potter was


** ...

There's a James Potter series?

  The crazy thing, is that this book almost didn't get publish. JK Rowling threaten to sue.

Past tense, my dude.

** I started reading them a few years ago, but never finished the first book. They're okay and probably a US reader could fit them into the existing world decently enough, but as a UK reader they broke immersion for me a few times (OC American characters inserted and central just because being one main example). I can see how for US readers that might be fanservice of a kind though, making the stories more accessible instead of being doubly foreign (British AND a fantasy world).

They had some ambitious and interesting ideas, though. I don't judge them too harshly because the author wrote them up as adaptations of stories he made up for his kids to continue the series after it finished and they wanted more. I feel like a lot of other fanfics are deliberately developed with a 'What If X?' premise in mind and worldbuilding to explore that, not just as entertainment for a specific young audience.

** I liked it a lot, except I thought thr ending was poorly plotted.

I kept reading and I think I gave up at about halfway through book 3? The quality of the characters just kept going downhill.

It is the book that introduced me to fanfiction, though.

*** Funny thing about it, I had this book saved on my harddrive sense 2012. Never dived into reading it until earlier this year. I got into other fanfics like Gears of War, but never got into Harry Potter fanfics

Yeah, I think the ending was a cop out. I wanted to see more about the group that was trying to say that Voldermolt was made up.
