** Many of Northumbrians' fics that focus on MIT (Muggle Interface Team) / Harry and his friends as Aurors are pretty good.

Apart from that I would recommend HP and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst and Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo as great mystery-catch the bad guy-who the f murdered Ginny fics. In both fics Harry is older with grown-up children and he, the Weasleys and the next generation of Weasleys must figure out what is going on and save their world once again.

"Fate" is slash, "Conspiracy" het/gen .

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.
