Most fics have this disclaimer. Never on FFN have I started a fic thinking "Oh, this might be from JK Rowling", and then be disappointed (Cursed Child maybe?). That being said, does anyone really invoke copyright protections on "FAN""FICTION"?

I started readings fics only a year ago, so I am not sure if this was a thing before?


** It comes from the early early days of fanfiction.net/livejournal when popular literary authors (/cough/ Anne Rice /cough/) were regularly sending cease and desist letters and claiming fanfiction was copyright infringement. Fair Use copyright laws were established in 1994, but at the time the nature of fanfiction wasn't quite as common place as it was now, and there were big debates on whether fanfiction was plagiarism or not (check out the Cassandra Clare debacle if you want to know more about this). So authors would put disclaimers as a way of saying “hey I'm not passing this off as my own, it's not plagiarism, I'm not making money off this, this is a transformative work allowed under Fair Use.” And now it's just something that has stuck around from the early 2000s.

This is a really simplistic & ramble-y way to explain early fandom history, but I hope that clears it up at least a little bit!

**** Whenever Terry Pratchett responded to critics, he'd type "{annericemode = OFF}" before the comment, so people knew he was communicating in good faith and not flying off the handle or dismissing any criticism. (Until someone made fun of him for implying that a woman could pass herself off as a man in a situation he had taken directly from documented history, where he started his comment as "{annericemode = ON}")

Rice used to throw multiple fits in the amazon review sections for her books and I seem to remember her straight-up doxxing a critical reviewer and refusing to apologize while also campaigning to end anonymous amazon reviews because they're "bullying."

****** It was Monstrous Regiment, a parody of the Mulan/Polly Oliver-type of story where a girl disguises herself as a boy to join the army. In this case, said girl slowly realizes that her entire regiment is composed of girls hiding the fact that they're girls for various reasons (except the slightly effeminate Lieutenant, who is indeed the only male). They collectively find out that their badass, experienced, and secretly female sergeant has been recruiting crossdressing girls as soldiers ever since SHE was a new recruit, without ever telling any of them about her own gender or the genders of any of the others she recruited, and while a few of them discovered a few of the others, what had actually happened was that the girls who were used to being driven twice as hard as male soldiers for half the results and having to use their heads to make up for their lack of muscle wound up comprising almost 1/3 of the country's high command.

The context was that a user on a Terry Pratchett fangroup was discussing how implausible all of this was, that NOBODY would have noticed, and that high command wouldn't have noticed A) their fellow women, B) the women serving under them, and C) the male high command noticing that anything was amiss, citing that they would have /eventually/ given it away. From the context, I suspect that it wasn't that it had happened in a comedy story, but that people insisted that it had basis in real life.

Except that they were immediately lambasted with fans sharing historical evidence of women in both rank-and-file and high command positions who either concealed their gender until they retired or until they were killed and it was discovered. There was indeed a crossdressing Dutch sergeant who purposely recruited female soldiers disguised as males. All of this completely IRL.

I do know her neighbors hated her back then, but I always assumed it was because of fans.

There was a big webring on tripod full of fansites that banded together to figure out how to clean it up and tell Warner to bugger off.

It's to avoid a copyright suit from the people who do own HP, by indicating that the fan author is making no attempts to assert ownership of the characters and situations, has no intent to profit from or present their work as an officially licensed product, and would greatly appreciate not being sued. I don't think there have been lawsuits over copyright infringement for fanfiction for over a decade, but it was once a genuine concern. (Hat tip here to the OTW and other fan activists who have worked hard to clarify the legal standing of fanworks.)
