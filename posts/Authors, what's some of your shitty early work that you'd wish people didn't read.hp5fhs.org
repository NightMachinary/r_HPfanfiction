I think a lot of new writers get quite dispirited when they first try their hand at writing and the material on the page doesn't live up to what they had in their head.

It might be encouraging for authors who are popular/well received today to share some of their earlier work that is maybe not so good, with the aim of demonstrating that writing is a skill that must be developed, not something that just drops out of the sky as a natural talent.


** Seems folks are chickening out here. Well, I'm game.

I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/][Steelbadger]], I started writing in ~2013. I have some fairly well-regarded works under my belt these days, but back then I was just some idiot who'd trawled through an ocean of fanfiction and who thought they could do it better. Many people have the excuse of 'I started writing fanfiction when I was 8' or other such completely understandable reasons for sucking. I wasn't 8. I was 25, and was /supposed/ to be completing my dissertation at Uni.

I posted the first few bits of my first beautiful story to DLP in January of 2014: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/peradventure.25433/][Peradventure]].(That's in DarkLordPotter's Work by Author section which requires sign-in to see. So, for the sake of transparency, here's the working doc of the whole thing in it's unedited glory: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PbxXxuzNvlDPrX_ftHyq_zuV95JgGZg5LxDxFqdcblg/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Version]]).

Given the quality, DLP went remarkably easy on me, which meant I went away and decided to try again with something different, which ended up being, quite possibly, worse: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/seconds-different.25774/][Seconds Different]] (Again, that's DLP WbA, so here's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSiJpOsn1XznIvMUY-s0bVUVN1uHxsVNuFejbO3iYu8/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Prologue]] and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RRQOj38RH-Rd2Lm8q1BeamW9Nzqb3TNsQ2jloc4KOSo/edit?usp=sharing][GDocs Chapter 1]]).

This also did not survive long, despite many nice things being said of it.

I then decided to forgo DLP, and started writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10659456/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Queen][Harry Potter and the Sun Queen]] directly to FFN. It is an improvement over my previous attempts and has a small following even to this day, but still obviously hamfisted.

Then it was time for my 'popular debut': [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power he Knows Not]] was still pretty clumsy, but it ended up being fairly popular for what it was (basically, canon fixit + Harry + small twist ending).

After that was complete, I started [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] which saw a level of popularity I could never have expected. I still consider it flawed, but when I compare what I was writing in 2015 to what I was able to muster in 2014, it's not hard to see the progression.

Hopefully that has laid down the gauntlet. All ye writers out there reading this. Show me your moves.

** Back pre 2003 before Order if the Phoenix was released. Me being less than 14 years old. I wrote a book 5 fic called Harry Potter and the Battle of Dundonnell Forest. I cant remember much about it but I do remember that Harry went out with Cho, Voldemort had an Army and was attacking Hogwarts. Neville died and then Dumbledore said something about Harry being a descendant of Godric Gryffindor.

I dont have the fic anywhere anymore. But I did find some old ones on the old Mugglenet Forums I wrote years and years ago.

EDIT: Found them...

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=127655][My Beautiful Girl]]- An old Lupin/Tonk fic... and I wasn't even that much of a Lupin/Tonks shipper back then.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=130286][Harry Potter and the Shard of Solace]]- Not sure what I was trying to do with this one. Not complete but... cool title I guess?

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=124790][A Day in the Life of Voldemort]]- Because these were kind of cool at one point? Weren't they?

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=102677][Harry Potter and the Shattered Soul]]- I like shattering things I guess. This one was a book 7 fic I wrote before DH was released. I remember I set myself a challenge of writing a bunch of Chapter Titles and then trying to come up with a fic to match it. I remember I did actually write one of the chapters much later on in this fic where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna arrived back at Hogsmeade station to see Fred and George and told them that Nevil had died... I think it was supposed to be Chapter 25 'The Platform.'

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=122223][Harry Potter and the Shattered Window]]- Now this I do remember. This was a remake of a fic that I wrote a long time ago. Before HBP came out but after OotP. This was a fic where apparently there was a window that opened up into the realm of the dead. But the realm of the dead was just a place where everyone who had ever died was literally just locked up in a jail cell and there were Dementors flying around. I remember HRH spent most of the year trying to figure out where it was going to appear and only Harry could go through for reasons I can't remember. But I do remember that when he returned to Hogwarts, Wormtail was there on a Hippogriff and had Kidnapped Hermione and Ron. The sequel to this fic started with Harry rescuing Ron and Hermione and then finding a Magical Gauntlet that did some crazy stuff I can't even remember. The end of the book would have ended (I didn't finish it and probably thank God I didn't with what I wrote) with Voldemort dying because a cabinet fell on top of him. I shit you not. No idea what I was smoking back then. I kinda wish, and don't wish oh my God no, that I had the original fic to show you.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=115183][Start Again]]- This is kind of a primer to a fic I'm going to show later. But HRH back in Hogwarts after defeating Voldemort. I had some plans with Draco here which I remember liking, even if I can't remember what I wanted to do with it.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=105853][The art of Supremacy]]- Another fic that was set up to be something amazing but with only one chapter written... even calling it a chapter is a bit generous tbh.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=96007][Ernous Elia]]- Another book 7 fic. This one has a few chapters under it's belt. I remember this was when I was going through a 'Malfoy is going to be a badass next book' phase, despite all evidence to the contrary. I probably had an idea what Ernous Elia was at the time of writing but god knows if I remember it now.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=108335][The Serpent Master]]- The Serpent Master was a fic I started to write about three days after after DH was released. This is probably my favourite fic I've ever written, favourite terrible fic anyway or the one I had most fun writing. It was planned to be a huge seven book series based on three unknown OC's set a couple of years after the epilogue. I had plans for each book, I had detailed character plans. I knew what the characters were going to do when they finished at Hogwarts. I knew that Neville would eventually become headmaster, I knew what O.W.L and N.E.W.T grades each character would get.I had a hell of a lot of detail. And this is actually a fic I finished writing. Aside from The Shattered Window above, probably one of my few finished fics. I had made good progress on it's sequel as well, (linked below) before I left it and moved on. A few years later I started to rewrite it, I had the basis of the original story but expanded a bit, names were changed around and just generally rewritten. But I didn't finish it, in fact I barely scratched the surface. Sometimes I'd like to go back and finish it off but I'm much more interested in writing my own work than fanfiction these days.

[[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=127679][The Golden Wand]]-Sequel to The Serpent Master

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11811142/1/The-Serpent-Master][Serpent Master rewrite]]- Rewrite

So thanks for the blast from the past...I did just notice that it does say popular writers... that's not me... I'd even hesitate to call myself well written these days but whatever I've spent too much time reading through this.

I do see my own writing skills improving, but it comes with constant and never ending practice. Keep at it people, you can do whatever you want!

** I would be so grateful if any authors shared an older work that highlights their development!

I'm only just trying my hand at writing in the last few months. To be honest, when I started I realised a huge discrepancy between the quality of fics I would consume and the quality I can produce. It's painful, and I accept that this is part of growth when developing a new skill, but I'd love to see how other authors have grown over time! I'm most curious about time management and writing at this point. Anything worth reading that I produce right now takes hours of consideration and revision. I'm in awe of some people's output of high quality writing.

Do you have any old work you wish people didn't read OP?

** Mine was a fem harry fanfiction on wattpad that i deleted out of shame when i rediscovered it for the first time. What I remember about it is that her name was Ivy, she looked just like lily and she was the biggest fucking mary sue. I was 13 so i'm sure the grammer and writing was awful. She also wasn't friends with ron but ginny instead. All three were big fucking mary sues actually. I basically re-hashed the whole series but changing some things here in there. I think she got togethor with neville in the end. I remember around the 6th book i started rushing the ending and crammed some of the elements of the 7th book in and she killed voldemort with her awsome powers. It was very bad and when i reread it i wanted to die on the spot.

Edit: I also just remembered that I fucking advertised it on this very sub and when some of y'all told me it was bad i told them to fuck off. If this was anybody reading this i'm so sorry lmao

I referenced it in a lot of other chapters and crawling through a few hundred thousand words to try and change conversations and scenes I wrote years ago just does not seem worth it.

I started writing when I was 12. And because I'm unable to let projects go, instead of deleting the first attempt, I carried on writing that story in the following 7 years. People still read it now, which boggles my mind. The last chapters I'm quite happy with, but I can't believe people are willing to pay the price and suffer through the beginning. It is kind of nice to see, but there's also no erasing of my earliest attempts at writing and they're still out there in plain sight, haunting me.

It is though.

As long as you speak German, my very first work is still up today, and I like it as much as I did 13 years ago. It's a mood piece, where I tried my hand at creating atmosphere, and I was very pleased with how it came out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3434706/1/Das-Geheimnis]]

Also, I dunno that it always gets better, the older you get or the longer you write. When I read some of my oldest longer stories, e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4236163/1/By-That-Last-Candle-s-Light][BtLCL]], I always have the depressing feeling that I couldn't write like that even if I wanted to today. I've eclipsed myself.

.

That said, in terms of stuff that's shit, everyone has this. But if you're self-aware enough, that doesn't even make it past the plotting stage. I have folders full of crap. Ridiculous ideas, dumb characterisations, boring plots ... I'd share, but it's all in notes, because I never even bothered to write it. There was this one time I thought it might be cool if Harry could walk through walls (it's not), to write a parody of DH with lots of camping before it came out (turns out the actual DH /did/ involve lots of camping), some Indy!Harry shit (I had just read RossWrock) ... I think the only time I genuinely did write crap was back when OotP came out, back in 2003, and I had been shipping Harry/Cho hard since PoA (that's where he notices Cho for the first time). Their romance was, of course, a mess, and I wrote a thoroughly sappy fix-it scene as anger management. Never published it, though, as it wasn't even a full story, and it vanished into the digital nirvana when my first computer died.
