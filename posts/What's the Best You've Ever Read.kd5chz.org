I'm looking for something new to read, does anyone have any suggestions?

Probably my favourite I've read so far is NOFP (which is controversial, as I understand it), so if anyone knows of anything of a similar style, I'd appreciate it!

Ideally I'd like something that's nice and long to keep me busy, if it's complete that's a bonus.
