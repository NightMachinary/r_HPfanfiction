*** I thought she was a narrative until she showed up, crushed my hopes and dreams. Like what is the use of her? Oh noes will she stop the Dark Lord? Spoiler alert; no.

  Nope. We only hear of Dumbledore, who actually did something.
#+end_quote

Are you confusing Grindelwald and Voldemort? What exactly did Dumbledore do against Voldemort prior to the books except unsuccessfully leading a secret organization that got curb-stomped? That girl in the fan-film has to suck pretty hard to be even less notable than Dumbledore.

[The only way that Dumbledore actually could have done something of worth against Voldemort is if he got the Potters killed on purpose... I hope you're not suggesting that]

  Nah. It's pretty heavily implied that Dumbledore
#+end_quote

Implied by what... By the respect they offer towards Dumbledore? By the same society that heavily implies that Harry is a deluded moron who maybe killed his own classmate? By the same society who elects a bumbling moron like Fudge? I'm not going to give much credence to that. I prefer to look at the facts: The Order of the Phoenix was a complete failure (lots of good people dead, all the inner circle death eaters still alive) and it was only noteworthy because their biggest defeat (murder of the Potters) miraculously resulted in a win.

How many Death Eaters has Dumbledore caught and incarcerated? Which strategically succesful operations did he conduct as a leader of the order? How and when has he ever fought Voldemort prior to the books (spoiler alert: Since people aren't shy about their love towards the man I'd expect them to shout these events from high heaven, they can't shut up about him fighting Grindelwald, so it's probably a big fat zero). All indications are that he didn't do any of that (he's a headmaster, he doesn't have the time) and as a hobby on the side completely failed at being a general leading an unsuccessful campaign.

**** Well, what's the point of watching his rise to power if we already know how it's going to end as well? (Spoiler alert; with him dying).

***** This was my initial question. But then I realized, if the thing operates within the rules of the world it would be neat to see the time frame the trailer discussed.
