I don't normally read fem Harry but I want one where he is turned into a girl, not starts as a girl. And there has to be a reason for it! For example linkffn(the archeologist) is pretty good in this respect. I'm not fussed about what sort of plot, just that Harry is powerful and female with a reason

Edit: thank you all for the suggestions!!


** I really loved [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-29179/MistofRainbows+Harry+Potter+and+the+echo+of+the+White+Witch.htm][Harry Potter and the Echo of the White Witch]], hope you enjoy it.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

*** Is this the one with Robin? I liked it but I agree with you about the smut and I also think the main ship was a little... idk maybe immature is the right word? Both parties did so much stupid overdramatic shit.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
