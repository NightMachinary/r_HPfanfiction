So, I was at work today, and was reminded of a fic I read once, but I barely remember anything about it. What I do remember, is that it was a fourth year fic. I recall thinking it was really slow going, so I went and took a peek at the last published chapter, and the author was not yet past the first task. After 430.000 words. Sheesh.

I wanted to ask a question. Do any of you recall fics that had huge word counts, but not much happened? And if so, what is the name of the fic and, your problem with it? Let's not keep it limited to HP. Perhaps you disagree with people's opinions, so by all means, debate.

I'll go first. There are two fics that come to mind.

Heart and Soul, by Silimaure. One of, if not my all time favourite fic. I love it! However, it's unnecessarily long. It's well over 700k words long, but could have been 500k. It's just long winded, and page after page of introspection.

Drifting by AlphaDelta1001. A massive Naruto fic. 1101k words ling. For the first 400k words or so, it's everything you'd want from a story in any medium. It has good pacing, great world building, interesting characters, which progress well, and the big fights are great. It's just an all round fantastic story.

And then the author spends 300k words going through the second part of the Chunin exam. Everything that was good about the fic comes to a stuttering halt, and it becomes a slog of looooooooooong, super detailed fights. I mean 20k words for a single fight? That is truly excessive. Needless to say, I gave up.

Anyway, what is your take on this?


** A Marauder's Plan.

If you cut it down by half it'll still be too much. Every move was analyzed by every character. It's also a great example of kids being kids, but going too far by showing the full scope of teenage behavior.

** Order of the Phoenix. Longest book by far at 260k words, yet it can be summed up with "Umbridge was an arsehole and there was a short fight at the end"

** I don't know the name of the fic, but I ranted last month about it. It started sometime soon after the CoS kerfuffle, and took 133 chapters to cover up to 19th July the same year.

I might have stuck around if I'd enjoyed it, but the story wasn't interesting enough to be worth the effort.

There was another story a few months ago, 480k words and still hadn't covered the full school year. A Wizenmaggot sesh took four chapters, and the following 4 days took nine chapters. Bloody ridiculous.

** The Marriage Stone. Not the original but the part that was continued by Lynne. Everyone was so polite and considerate.. I could have cut down her addition by 1/3 if everyone wasn't so nice.

** The Gray series and Sacrifices arc are both 3.1M words over 7 years - that's 440K words a year! Pureblood Pretense is around 400k words a year, but it's not that bloated comparatively. Prince of Slytherin is also around that 400k/year mark.

*** Yeah, Pureblood Pretense isn't bloated IMO, it's great. Harry just has very busy summers...

*** I only read Prince of Slytherin, so I can't comment on the other stories, but I don't think it's quite fits the criterias of this post. While it's definitely long, there is also a lot of interesting stuff going on
