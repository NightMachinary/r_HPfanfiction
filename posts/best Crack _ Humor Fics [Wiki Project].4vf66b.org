  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** /Make a Wish/

*Link:* linkffn(2318355)

*Premise:* Harry learns the prophecy and interprets it as a death sentence. Instead having to be abused at the Dursley's, he goes around Europe under the pseudonym Mr. Black and many Forrest Gump-esque coincidences and events lead him through a comedic-journey of action and adventure.

*Status:* Complete, with sequels

*Thoughts About It:* It's pretty humorous. Other people disagree, but I think it's fine. It's not supposed to be serious, so I think it is fine.

** *Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake*

*Link:* linkffn(11982933)

*Status:* oneshot

*Thoughts:* A thoroughly amusing account of Harry and Ginny meeting the Marge and the rest of the Dursleys after the war. There is some liberty taken in characterisation (Ginny's inherited her father's love for muggle objects in this), but this is intended as a humor story, so that's okay. Ginny's snappy comebacks are great, and the Dursleys' well deserved fate is immensely cathartic.
