So I'm writing a long fic at the moment that has a lot of readers who're usually into Lord Potter or indy!Harry stuff - it's not what I'm writing, but I appreciate why people would read both.

The only thing is that I'm getting into the Second War in the AU, and I just woke up to several reviews decrying "Dumbles" and how nasty and manipulative he is. This isn't the first time I've had a silly comment ("When is Harry going to claim the Potter Lordship and inheritance?"), but this is the first time it's thrown me for a loop.

I want to write Albus as a man trying to accomplish his best, despite having a lot of complicated odds to battle against, and I actually write two POVs with very different opinions of him in order to better present that. I find he's a very challenging character to present accurately, because he's so intelligent and has such an unenviable role, but when I get a swathe of reviews reducing him to a "manipulative" cardboard cut-out of a character, it becomes very disheartening.

I'm so grateful to have so many readers, but when I get comments like this it just feels like I'm falling down in my characterisation and fucking up quite majorly, or that they're not reading it at all.

Does anybody have any advice for working past these sorts of feelings?


** Reader's assumptions are just that and not anything you have to pander to. You have a story you want to tell, so tell it. It sounds like you have a good idea for DD, so keep with it and don't feel like you have to change it because of a comment from someone. It's up to you if you want to respond via PMs, but I wouldn't. That would make it seem like you are chasing reviews or seeking approval, neither of which you should have to do.

Readers gonna read or not. It's up to them to trust you on the journey you're taking them on.

*** Thanks so much, this was really helpful, genuinely!

I reply to reviews now and then, but I always try to keep stuff vague as I don't want it to come across as either me desperately wanting to please or, alternatively, me going like, "Oh, well I'm the author and I think this, therefore my word is law," because that would just come across as awfully obnoxious, you know?

**** I'm glad you found it helpful! And yes, you always want to take constructive criticism and not be high and mighty because that's definitely a turn off. But, there's a difference between "That's an interesting choice you made for Dumbledore's motivations for turning Harry into a frog." and "OMG that's so stupid! Manipulative!Dumbledore would never turn Harry into a frog! UR dum!" One invites conversation, one invites derision.

** I think it's okay to challenge the readers perceptions in a PM. It might lead to an interesting discussion or a new perspective that may intrigue you. Of course, you may not get that sort of discourse from the average FF.net reviewer. In that case, let it go and just continue to write the story you want to tell.

*** That's the worry, honestly! FFnet can be an awkward site to talk to people and challenge their expectations, given that people can be so abruptly hostile, you know? And I know the people who dislike Dumbledore and genuinely see him as like, a bad guy are unlikely to be dissuaded.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11896247/1/The-Serpent-s-Gaze]]) is the fic.

**** Thanks! And I agree with your assessment of Dumbledore. I struggle with fics that portray Dumbledore as a “bad guy” because I think it ignores the really difficult choices he made in his attempt at protecting the wizarding world and ensuring safe access to education for all. He had a long life and I certainly don't agree with all of his moves but the manipulative Dumbledore trope takes it too far.

***** Yeah!

Like, don't get me wrong, I totally think Dumbledore is manipulative and I really do want people to feel that whether he's right or wrong is up for debate, you know? I don't feel there should necessarily be a very obviously "right" or "wrong" reading of his choices, given that he's struggling with a very complex series of events, and I want that narrative ambiguity to be present across all the characters.

I think that a lot of the time, even with dark!Harry fics, there's this idea that the reader has to agree with what the protagonists are doing and so you need to narratively justify their actions, but I wanted to explore something a little more complex with this and make it clear that there's no right or wrong answers, just difficult questions.

And given that some of my other characters are people like Severus Snape and Narcissa Malfoy, I guess it's just a surprise to me that the one character people seem to hate most is Dumbledore!

****** One possible interpretation I've thought of is that Dumbledore /hates/ manipulation, because Grindelwald used his feelings to manipulate him.

#+begin_quote
  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, platonic H&Hr duo, assorted ships. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no bashing - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, no manipulative!Dumbledore, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted (with extra content) to Ao3.

** Simply tell the readers - I answer all reviews in PMs - that this is an AU and that Dumbledore is neither his (suffering from plot-induced stupidity so kids can be the heroes) canon self, nor the "manipulative old coot" of some fics.

** Linkffn(Weres Harry) has a very good portrayal of Dumbledore as being defined by the trope Miles to Go Before I Sleep. He is doing the jobs of three younger men, and has an inability to say no to responsibility.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
