Hi everyone, I'm looking for some great Tom/Harry slash fics!

Preferably medium length (under 100k, but will take any length if the other criteria fit), featuring the handsome Tom Riddle (or LV looking like an older version of how Tom is described, so not the noseless creepy canon version of LV haha). While time travel is fine, I think I've read enough "Harry travels back in time and raises Tom"-fics, so maybe not that scenario. Dark!Harry is fine!

No rape, mpreg or crack fics, please.

I really appreciate any recommendations! Thanks in advance


** There will likely be ones in here you have read, but these are all ones I enjoyed or found interesting/unique (and some I don't remember reading but bookmarked anyway).

some complete and wips (that are likely abandoned :/) linkao3(1007306; 2766491; 7498137; 3906334; 930330) linkao3(2296544; 5937535; 7837393; 5649331)

these ones are wips linkao3(5893567; 8691067; 7925314; 7040089; 9075358) linkao3(7189349; 294722; 7664782; 4728995; 11653353)

linkffn(10311215; 5356546) - Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] and any other works by that author.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4728995/chapters/10806773][Gilgamesh]] that i linked below is another really good one. It's not too long and has a currently updating sequel.

  He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by an icy statement that caused the hairs on his entire body to stand erect. "I know what you are, Harry Potter... Death will never touch you." SLASH, HP/LV. Darkly disturbing and all sorts of twisted- a tale of abduction, possession, and manic obsession. A 'Voldemort kidnaps Harry when he finds out he is a horcrux' story, only to turn into something far more convoluted. Sequel Posted: 'Hauntingly'

  Major AU! SLASH LV/HP: Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned.

  It started as a game. When two highborn lords come looking for a distraction from boredom, they merge the worlds of the highest class with those of the lowest class. A careless invitation sets things in motion that were supposed to stay locked away.Because a kingdom on the verge of collapse, a noble without a past and a circus performer with a secret are not a good combination.

  Hundreds of years after the Final Battle, Voldemort is finally the Emperor to his own Empire. He has a rising revolution at his back and the reappearance of an enemy thought to be extinguished. The traitors of the dark search for the missing piece to end the reign of the Dark Lord, but what can they do when Voldemort has their savior's body and the soul is lost? SLASH. VERY DARK. Major OC alert, but mostly focuses on Tom and Harry.

  Harry first meets Tom the summer of his eleventh birthday, just before they're both due to begin at Hogwarts.   Tom sat up, still panting, and crawled over to the other boy. If he was correct, Harry had just used wandless magic. Not to turn the page of a book, or lift a feather, like most people's first time, but the powerful kind. He'd saved Tom's life. Tom stared down at Harry's face, as pale as his own, dripping wet, with long black hair plastered to his scalp and beginning to freeze into tendrils. Who was Harry Potter?

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

#+begin_quote
  The arrival of his nemesis is the least of Harry Potter's problems. Now that the war is over, he finds himself drifting away from all that held him together in the past, trying to find a new purpose in his life. Being framed for murder forces Harry to be on the run and this time the only company he takes with him is Tom Riddle. The young Dark Lord faces a future he did not expect, meets an oddity who killed everything he strived to be. And yet he finds himself obsessed with his murderer, a determined man searching for answers and reaching for the sky once more. Harry Potter's purpose and Tom Riddle's destiny, seemingly entwined. They say change is overrated. But choice is everything.

  AU - Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal inspired. After recent events in his life, Hermione refers Harry to the renowned psychiatrist, Doctor. T. Riddle. He is unlike anything Harry ever expected or imagined, and soon proves to be a great help against the very shadows and name that haunts his waking hours. If only it remained that simple.

Ron and Hermione are concerned with Harry's apathy to live. And Death is constantly amused by it all, offering Harry a choice to rewrite parts of his life. He returns back to the past as a war veteran and is determined to prevent a pointless war. But nothing is what it seems. Older, Harry is confronted with the follies of his mentors, the motivations of the Dark Lord, and eventually travels back in time far more than he had bargained for. A story about Death, the Hallows and the War.Warnings: Dub-con, mind manipulation, and heavy inferences on depression/PTSD throughout the series. Also, partial time traveling and mentions of WW2

** edit: redid the linking down below, since there were too many.

Some of these are non-magical AUs. Some fics are way longer than 100k, but fit your requirements, so I'll link them. There are some one shots, but they otherwise fit the reqs. The list is organized by writers who've written multiple relevant fics, and then other/misc. After finishing it, I realised that it probably has too many links, so you've been forewarned. It's a bit of a whammy.

--------------

Epic Solemnity writes a lot of long LV/HP, like Death of Today, Dreams and Darkness Colide, and New Way to Bleed linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9098202/1/New-Way-to-Bleed]]).

--------------

cheryl bites writes nice LV/HP as well. Okay, their fics are rather dark, so probably not nice. Some are pretty short (around 2k or 10k), some are longer, all are under 100k. Their fics are pretty good, though kind of odd, I guess. How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love Lord V is /kinda/ cracky, but it's not exactly a crackfic, it's just....well, it's something. Death In Love, Ghost In The Cell, and The Gardener Repents are oneshots. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3439784/1/Voldie-s-Book-Club]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3234179/1/Twisted]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3238349/1/Death-In-Love]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3252862/1/Ghost-In-The-Cell]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3295094/1/The-Gardener-Repents]]).

--------------

RenderedReversed writes a lot of Tom/Harry oneshots, as well as some longer fics. Some are really /very/ fluffy, some...well, aren't. 'skip right to the end' is part of a [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/580627][series of fluffy fantasy one-shots]], which is actually 59k words overall. There are a lot more than what I've linked (they've written 55 things for Harry Potter, after all), but I think linking that many would be excessive. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1155472]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1364638]]; 8482429; 11243451; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1810903]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/804100]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/736283]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12061524]]).

--------------

MayMarlow has mostly fics for Tom/Harry or LV/HP. If Them's the Rules is the Harry-goes-back-to-raise-Tom thing, so I won't link that, but I will link the others. The Pyrrhic Victories features, predictably, a Pyrrhic victory. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/549220]]).

--------------

Lithium is a pretty recent fic, and grayclouds also has a few others: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2296544]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11291187]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6760735]]).

--------------

The Fictionist has quite a few, e.g. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172646/1/Butterfly-Heart]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9670732/1/Love-s-Loathing]]).

--------------

By Amelinda: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11929344]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12064272]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11078301]]). Unfortunately rather short, but nonetheless.

--------------

By Batsutousai: Stand Against the Moon, Xerosis, Abandon, etc. Lots more stuff on their account, too. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/380762]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209535]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/380847]]).

--------------

There's October, which is Tom/Harry, although it is mostly unfulfilled. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215]]). A story that /isn't quite/ a slash fic (so I won't link it with the bot), but is a nice and tragic friendship fic, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/][The Unwinding Golden Thread.]]

/in death we seek devotion/ is ...more LV/HP, I guess, and is rather unfortunate. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7911124]])

Reparablis, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846548/1/Reparabilis]]).

Athey's already been mentioned, so I won't do the whole linking shebang, but here's a second rec for it nonetheless.

A Soulless Solace, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5813358/1/A-Soulless-Solace]])

  ...But all of my denials are blown away as he walks in, looking every bit right at home here... His eyes don't look around the club at all---no, they go straight for me and as my vision is stuck on blue, I'm left completely, utterly breathless... Or, in which Harry steps outside his comfort zone to write a thrilling romance with a cheesy title, Tom is an actor chosen to play in the upcoming film adaption, and it's a shame that they're not in love, otherwise it'd make a kind of sweet love story. A threeshot filled with misses, hits, but mostly misses--and the one time they score the same sweet spot.

He expected eventual success, a lot of hard work, and several painstaking seasons of the "outsider" reputation... but no one ever mentioned falling in love with a god. A life story told purely in 100 word snippets, dedicated to those who enjoy the complexity found in simplicity. Now complete!

  This life was his chance--his single, given chance to fulfill his promise. And Harry knew that he wouldn't give it up for anything in the world, even if it was for his beloved parents. "Then, owl me for my signature on the disinheritance papers," he said calmly, gaze never wavering once despite their shocked looks."Why?" Why him?"Because I'll follow Tom past the ends of the world," Harry replied, smiling wryly, "and, well, even on to the next. I made a promise, after all, and it's only right to keep it. So I'll follow him through thick and thin, just like he followed me."Summary subject to change. Slash is eventual TMR-LV/HP. Dedicated to those who love their relationship, of any kind!, with a slight lean towards the more intimate side... because we all know they're two halves of a whole.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Voldemort is a day old when he realizes those blasted muggles had named him “Tom.” And he's a day old when it fully sinks in that yes, being reborn, legitimately, instead of from an experimental ritual, sucked. Because he has no idea where he is, what time he is in, who these people are... and he can't control who he is born with. Namely, some other brat who would take the title of his twin... his brother.He is a year old when it sinks in who his twin could possibly be.Because his twin might, possibly, probably be Harry Potter.
