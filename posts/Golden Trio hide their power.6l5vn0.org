Ok, there are a lot of fics where only Harry (or Hermione or Ron) is secretly trained or just has super powers. And he hides it from his friends and everyone.

But I want the whole Trio to get upgrade. I don't know though if I want them to hide it. I remember series of fics 'Amulet of Time' (there was also Ginny with them), it was pretty good.

But please no fics with fem!Harry.


** Hmm...well, the Lightning Speaker series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1927254/AntaresTheEighthPleiade][AntaresTheEighthPleiade]], as I recall, features Harry and others forming a secret group to train and oppose an epically-evil Dumbledore.

And S'TarKan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] features a time-travelling Harry helping to train his friends up, and he ends up sharing a big secret with them, so that might count too.

Unfortunately, neither fic/series is finished, or updated for a while.

Funny thing, I'm wondering now; what if you had a fic where /everyone/ was hiding their true power? Everyone has a special power like Parselmagic or Metamorphmagi or a Magical Animagus form or can see the future or is just really good at some area of magic or another, but they're hiding it to not stand out or because they're afraid of being kidnapped by Unspeakables or so on and so forth.

*** Sorry, I don't like Nightmares and right now I'm not looking forward to read someone's bashing, maybe later.

But thank you for your reply :)

** linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) is exactly about that, though it hasn't updated since 2014.

Do be aware the Dumbledore in this story is a disgusting piece of shit who I legitimately hope dies. He is one of the most manipulative Dumbledores I have ever read.
