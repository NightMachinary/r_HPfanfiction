Hello! Was wondering if anyone had any GOOD Snily recommendations that happened after the first Wizarding War. An AU where James died and Lily didn't and get a Severus get together? Preferably a slow burn romance. Thank you!

This fits exactly what you're looking for, James dies but lily and Harry are alive and Snape and lily are a slow burn, the sequel is still ongoing. The writing is very good and I loved the story I think you might like this.

linkao3(Come Once Again and Love Me by Laventadorn)

This one has only lily and Snape time travelling back and this one definitely was slow burn. The story is fantastic and this is my all time fave snily fic.

  AU: Halloween, 1981. Marked for death, Lily and Harry escape with the aid of Dark magic. Sirius vows to find Harry and track down Severus Snape, his mother's alleged murderer. The prophecy has divided; destiny writes on a blank page. M rating for violence/language.Originally posted on HPFF in 2008, the sequel Rowan and Phoenix is a WIP again! (8/2019)

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but for what?
