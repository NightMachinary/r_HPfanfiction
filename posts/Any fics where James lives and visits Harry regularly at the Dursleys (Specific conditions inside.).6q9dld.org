To be precise, any fics where:

a) The attack on Godric's Hollow happens as usual, with Lily sacrificing herself to save Harry from Voldemort's curse, but,

b) James lives? And presumably, reveals Peter was the secret keeper all along? And,

c) Harry still goes to live with the Dursleys, for the reason of blood wards (Lily Evans to Petunia Dursley) and also because James isn't comfortable being a single father, but,

d) James still regularly visits the Dursleys to help care for his son and Dudley?

e) With no shenanigans like Evil Lord Potter or obnoxious Wrong Boy Who Lived?


** If James lived, Harry would have never been place to Dursley's. No, Dumbledore wasn't such idiot to force him to do so. Even if Dumbledore was idiot enough to do so, James would have never agreed. Any premise where James lives and Harry still places to Dursley's by default as logical as any WBWL/neglected brother of BWL. Makes zero senses.

** There was one like this where Lily was driven insane or something instead of dies, and James spent full time on helping her so offloaded Harry. It wasn't very good though, so I don't have it bookmarked or anything.
