** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce by imagitory) is one that I couldn't really get into, but I know plenty of people liked it.

And there are a ton of fics that play up Harry's ability to cook, and plenty where he opens some sort of restaurant, but it's usually just there for Harry to impress his love interest once or twice, and not really an important part of the story.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

** linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten). Harry cooks meals for several people, wants to become a cook/baker. Despite the name, there's still a lot of magic involved.

linkffn(Café by Pleasedial123). Harry gets emancipated, buys a house, starts baking for neighbors.

linkffn(At Jacques' by The Ghostly Minion). Harry is chef at a high-end restaurant.

linkffn(Blackdog by Atlantis Sinatra). Fem!Harry "retires" to NYC and opens a coffee shop. Cross with Avengers. Not much more than a start.

linkffn(Early Retirement by Secondary Luminescence). Fem!Harry runs a café in NYC. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Wanderer by cywsaphyre). Immortal!MoD!Harry opens a coffee shop in California. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Heroes Assemble by Stargon1). Harry leaves Britain after winning, eventually opens "cafe-restaurant-pub kind of thing" in NYC. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Magic of the Force by Vimesenthusiast). Star Wars cross. Jedi Padawan Harry has cooking as a hobby.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Love by Rorschach's Blot). Crack. Harry joins Hermione's Home Ec club at Hogwarts.

linkffn(What Witches Want by Almost Anonymous). Crack. Not cooking, per se, but producing food.

There's another crack one-shot that fits, but I can't find it at the moment. I suspect it's a single chapter out of someone's one-shots collection. Harry makes desserts so wonderful that any witch who eats one becomes devoted to him.

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years.
