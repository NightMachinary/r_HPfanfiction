Does anyone know if there is a sequel to summer of change linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/#]])

I loved the book but it ended rather abruptly and I was wondering if anyone wrote a sequel.

** None that I'm aware of, mostly because the author was explicit about his desire for no one else to write a sequel for it. I seem to remember someone making an attempt a few years ago, but they were shouted down from continuing it by some fans of the original.
