Hi everyone! I've never posted anything here so I hope I'm doing it right. I was just listening to the third audiobook where Fred and George present Harry with the Marauders map and I was wondering if there are any fics about the twins finding out that Lupin is Moony, or Sirius, Padfoot etc. Or generally the connection between the weasleys and the marauders (scabbers etc). Thank you in advance :D


** It's been a while since I've read it, but I think linkffn(Crossing Lines) has a similar premise.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
