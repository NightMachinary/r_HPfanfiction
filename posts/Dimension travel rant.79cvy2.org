Why oh why is it that in every fic where Harry ends up in a universe where his parents are alive, that he ALWAYS has to go emo? In every fic of this kind that i have found so far, he just HAS to go back to his own universe asap, because only he can kill voldy, and/or refuses to recognise his parents as his own, its always woe is me my parents are dead and you are alternative harrys parents so you cant be mine.

I know most Harry's are portrayed as selfsacrificing, but really, throw him in a universe where his parents are alive, and he doesnt have to fight voldy? No way is he just going to give that up to go back to dead parents and a war he is undertrained for.

Why can we never have a freaking good endning where Harry goes "parents? No prophecy? Im staying!"


** Because he has emotional attachments to the people and places he left behind.

That said, once everything is done and over with in the original dimension, yeah fuck all that angsty shit. Be sad for the friends you left behind, but roll with the damn punches, Harry. Like you've done every time since you started school.

*** Sure that is the biggest argument, but you can also argue that he could make new friends, and since he is in a new universe, its no longer his problem, plus Parents! Why should he care about the old universe? Or not plan to go back, fetch friends, then return to new universe? Hell, the way the wizarding wold has treated Harry, i just have a very hard time seeing why he would chose to go back and save them.

*** True, it is the whole angst part that is the problem here. I mean with Harry's depest desire (mirror of erised) is being with his parents, and he suddenly has them back, i just dont see him pushing them away in his oh so noble selfsacrificing ways. I think a more realistic harry would be a antentionseeking clingy cuddlebear with his parents, and go "find a way to dimension travel back to my home universe? Fuck that, im staying right here and you can't make me leave!"

**** No, Harry would definitely be trying to get home, especially so if Voldemort hadn't been defeated. There is absolutely zero chance of Harry abandoning his friends if he has a choice in the matter. As for how Harry would interact with James and Lily, I'll say that he would want to know them, but wouldn't treat them as his own parents. Which is accurate, and in character.

***** I simply dont see this as realistic, and without basis from canon you cant deem it accurate and in character, we dont know from cannon how he would react, but with his upbringing it is more realistic he would be very attention craving from his new parents and seek positive reinforcements from them.

****** We do know. Harry has several parental figures in his life, he doesn't behave like this with any of them. Also when I said that's accurate I meant my statement that the alternate James and Lily wouldn't be his parents, just a very passable copy of them. Therefore Harry would want to know them he wouldn't treat them as his own parents. He wouldn't call them his parents, or address them as such.

****** That´s a really annoying assessment, it is not more realistic if he´s attention craving with his parents, it is definitely a plausible possibility, but not something that is closest to canon or closest to realistic behavior and don´t bring up the Dursley´s abuse, which even in the tamest reading is horrifying, people are shaped differently by abuse. Let´s say we have the scenario that everyone knows what´s up and Harry meets his parents, possible first reactions would be, him embracing them, running away, having a mental breakdown, cautiously assessing the situation... after that they may fall into "normal" familiar patterns, he can´t get over the fact that they aren´t his real parents, he may feel guilty about being happy with them, because the originals sacrificed their lives for him(this might not be logical, but very much plausible behavior), maybe he just cannot take being near them, maybe they have just a very awkward relationship, maybe he feels nothing for them. Then there is the question if he can choose to go back or not, if he can canon!Harry would take it in a heartbeat, because however much heartbreak awaits him, there are people that he deeply cares about, people he formed a connection with through many hardships and even if they exist in the other world they´re not the same, they might as well be strangers to him, of course should he be whisked away at any point before joining Hogwarts, sure there is no reason to stay for him, because he has no emotional attachments to anyone, if he was brought into the other world at a later point and he cannot get back, adjustment will be hard and he would take years to really appreciate a peaceful world with his parents alive, there are so many possible issues, survivor guilt, he may wastes years trying to find a way back, coming to terms with the fact that he cannot get back, being unable to form attachments to the people in the new world, getting depression, maybe even suicidal. He sure as hell won´t just accept it right away and make new friends as if he´s replacing some piece of furniture.

** The probalem with things not being somehow terrible is that there is little to write about form the perspective of most people.

Now I personally vehemently disagree with this, and the best stories I've ever read are ones where shit is not somehow forced to be fucked but things just are and I get to live it, but a lot of people see it that way.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/][The World as We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Harry was very happy to stay in this dimension at first. But he was still picking a fight with the local Voldemort, under abyssal operational security. Later Voldemort made a key breakthrough and seriously fucked them over, Harry had no choice but to limp back to his home dimension.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

** Well, there's the fic, Too Far from Home, where Harry is sent to an alternate dimension and basically decides he wants to stay there with his alternate family. It's well written, but the alternate potters are so terrible and emotionally/physically abusive that it sort of cancels out.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*
