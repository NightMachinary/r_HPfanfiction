:END:
Spacefaring people unseal harry potter floating through space.

I think it was on webnovel or fanfiction

I can't remember the name. I remember he was fairly ruthless, older, and used magic on an enemy spaceship later in the chapters.

Help!

EDIT: Oh and it's not a crossover


** I think it's The Star Empire by RahXephon. The author pulled the original and tried to revise it as The Star Hegemony, but then pulled that one, too.
