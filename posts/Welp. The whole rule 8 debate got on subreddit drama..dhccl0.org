[[https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/dh39vh/rhpfanfiction_attempts_to_argue_about_the_sharing/][The link.]] One effect of that is that some new people are trying to stir up some more drama in those threads.


** It's depressingly typical to see how many people in that sub jumped on the drama bandwagon without actually reading the linked threads. They mostly assumed that the discussions here were about banning vs. allowing paedo content when really it was more about whether fics with a few consensual scenes of 16-17 year olds should be treated the same as the fics that are more blatantly against the rules.

I'm also disappointed to see that some members of this sub jumped in to share specific usernames of people here in an attempt to instigate more drama.

That thread's comments were pretty tame, to be fair. Given how much that sub usually likes to circlejerk and feel morally superior about shit they have superficial understanding about at best.

#+begin_quote
  /(+200 karma)/ r/HPfanfiction has 2 kinds of users

  1.beholden to canon and is very afraid to write characters that aren't like they are in canon and will regualrly worry about writing AUs that still make sense for the characters.

  2.Fuck canon I wanna watch Harry and Draco fuck.

  the sub is very hypocritcla about slash to the point that [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] was created so people could.discuss, write and look for slash without the shitty people.

  The point about slash hypocrisy stands.
#+end_quote

There are two separate phenomena that you're likely referring to: 1) instances when members of this sub specifically request recommendation to not be slash, 2) instances when members of this sub downvote recommendations that are slash.

I think the motivation varies from #1 to #2, and that for either case the use of the word "hypocrisy" would be an inaccurate buzzword:

For #1, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/atule7/question_why_does_this_sub_not_like_slash/][these]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7guaha/what_makes_slash_so_unreadable/][two]] discussions / comments --- I think they cover the issue well enough. I'll just add that having personal preferences about the main characters' sexuality is neither hypocritical nor homophobic since it's just that --- personal preferences.

For #2, as far as I've seen, the slash stories that are disliked on this sub are disliked not because they are slash, but because they feature low writing quality ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8dj2lg/ive_always_avoided_slash_fics_what_are_the_best/][example 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xkt9v/whats_behind_the_antislash_sentiment_on_this_sub/cy5huv3/][example 2]]). Common examples of such low quality are out-of-character / inconsistent characters (e.g. Voldemort behaving like a teenage girl in love) and boring / inconsistent plot (e.g. Death Eaters being completely fine with Voldemort behaving like a teenager in love and organising balls for him and Harry to dance at). Whatever slash stories /do/ manage to maintain their writing quality, also get recommended rather frequently and without any problems (e.g. Sacrifices Arc). And again, there is nothing hypocritical about disliking badly written stories.
