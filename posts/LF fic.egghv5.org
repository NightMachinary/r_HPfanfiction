I'm trying to find a fic where Harry is adopted by Voldemort, but is trained by Barty Jr, and they essentially become brothers. Barty has a Raven animagus, and he disguised himself as Harry's familiar.


** Was the raven called Rune? I read something like this, but I think the raven in the one I'm thinking of was actually Regulus, so I'm not sure if it's the same one. - linkffn (11868509)?

*** Hm. Bot seems to be down. Or I'm doing something wrong. Don't use it much.

**** Looks like the problem was that you left a space in front of your first parenthesis.

  Voldemort kidnapped Harry that fateful Hallowe'en night and raised him up as his assassin. Years later, Harry is sent on a mission that will change the Wizarding World forever. Treachery and ambition go hand-in-hand, and no one is safe. Beset on all sides, Harry must fight to survive and carve his name on the face of history with a legacy of fire and blood.. DARK!Harry.

***** I typed it that way first. Nothing came up, so I figured I'd try with a gap since there seems to be one on the sidebar. Ah well. :)
