:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I don't really remember what's the fiction about, but I do remember that Tonks sent Harry a pair of her panties (I think, or was it a thong, don't remember) in mail and she was a teacher, I think, read this so long ago, don't know if it exists any more.....


** 2 things:

First, you're using the wrong tag, Request is for when you want a genre or trope fic with several suggestions of that choosing. Like Timetravel Marauder's Era with Hermione Centric. You should be using "What's that fic".

Second, the closest thing I can remember to this scenario is a fic where Harry is studying to be an Auror and they are dating, its a post-war(obviously) in which Tonks never ended up together with Lupin, so no Teddy and she didn't die following Lupin. Its quite smut heavy though, so keep it in mind. linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus)

** Harry is in Hogwarts. They are either married/engaged or simply boyfriend and girlfriend. I don't remember why, but (I think it was on Valentine's Day) she sends him either simply panties, a thong or stockings (they were gold, I think). Harry did not know what was in the mail so when he took them out, Seamus (some Gryffindor in Harry's year wolf-whistled)....

** Might be Nymphadora's Beau. About halfway through she's a Teacher and gives Harry her knickers before he boards the train. Wouldn't be surprised if she also sent him more in other chapters (been a while since I've read it and a quick Google search listed this one.)

  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. / No updates, on hold.
