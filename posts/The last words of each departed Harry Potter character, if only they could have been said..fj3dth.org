** Hmm. I don't think I've ever read through a 77 chapter story in under five minutes before. I kept clicking because a couple of them were quite funny. Agree about the speech patterns though.

** I've read through it and it feels cheap and like someone else said, low effort. The mimicry of character speech patterns feels superficial and cheap. It makes the fic feel off. Having to click multiple times to read four sentences is also simply inconvenient. Not to mention that reading 5 or so chapters is enough to have read the whole story because there is no plot.

** So either most people here are emotionally stunted or just numbed by the billions of lordship fics they all seem to like, but this was like a punch in the gut at some points.

People, what's written itself isn't the point. The situation and impact and message of the words is. I pity those who don't understand this.

** It's pretty good. I like it. It does feel a little low effort though.
