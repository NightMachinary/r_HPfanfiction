I wanted to test my style of writing duels, as I am writing a longer fanfic and wanted to see how my fights would be received by the fans. The battle is very different than the Canon one, especially because I hint at a lot of stuff that's a plot point in my longer fic.

English is not my first language, and this is only the third fanfiction I've written, so please be extra hard about any spelling, grammatical or punctuation errors you see, so that I can work at solving them :D

This is the link to the fic:

Thanks for reading the post BTW ;)
