Based on systems of magic people used to believe in, for example druidism or similar religious beliefs. As long as it doesn't contradict HP canon, it's all good.


** Myself, I've been reading about the Egyptian view of magic, called Heka. They have a pretty interesting view of the soul, which is divided into 5 parts:

- the spark of life,

- the heart which governs thoughts and emotions,

- the shadow, which is the influence you have over the world,

- the name

- that what makes you unique.

This is especially interesting if coupled with the Horcruxes and the popular (canon?) idea that they're Egyptian in origin.

So my idea is to make a Horcrux, you seal away some part of these aspects, like one of his horcruxes contains the name Tom Riddle, etc. By doing so he left himself with only his Ka, the spark of life, and took the other aspects from his victims. This is extra horrifying because if so his victims never could move on to the afterlife.

*** Egyptian origin is definitely not canon. The only info we have is that JK stated in an interview Herpo the Foul (Greek wizard who also bred the first Basilisk) created the first Horcrux.

** Voodoo is always fun,forming personal connections and using them to cause pain over distance. This could be kind of connected to Harry and Voldemort's scar connection.

Then Native American shamanistic practices using alteration of the mind and connection to nature. Animagus transformation could certainly be connected to this.

Then you could have taboos from Irish mythology, which is not quite the same as magic, but could be incorporated easily enough. It is the practice of forbidding actions. If you break a taboo then you will be cursed, but if you obey a taboo then you gain power. Unfortunately there is no cannon support of this.

O-fuda is interesting as it is the use of spiritual tags in order to ward of evil and disease. For the most part anything involving runic arrays being magical is not-canon in Harry Potter.
