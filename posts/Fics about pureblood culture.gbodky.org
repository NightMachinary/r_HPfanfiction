I'm looking for fics that are mainly set with the background of pureblood culture. I want the glamorous lifestyle, aristocratic traditions and customs, weird little niches, and preferably with a pairing.

But nothing that's too cringe worthy along the lines of “I'm a pureblood princess that only cares about my jewels”. There has to be a plot of course.

I'm also ok with the political aspect of the society.

If anyone has fics like this please recommend! Thank you :))

**** It's sane Voldemort using some old law to get custody of Harry, think head of the family situation. Voldy takes his seat in wizengamot, they know he is (or was) voldy but he makes them belive he was not in control of his actions. After that it's quite a lot of politics and social change with some Harry & Voldemort on the side. Voldy and the gang are the "good guys" here, at least as good as a "former" dark lord can be.

It's a long read but if you like politics and the maintaing of wizarding traditions I would recomend it.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/][The Saving Connor Series]] it's very long and very wonderful. The author intricately weaves original Wizarding customs down to minute detail. Its eventual Drarry, but not overbearing. Its main focus is magic and a Slytherin!Harry.

** I would highly reccomend the Black Sheep Dog series by Izzythehutt, which is an ongoing series in which Regulus survives the cave and Sirius has to deal with/reconcile with his family. The pureblood culture in this AU is very heavily based on aspects of British aristocracy and judging by your description I think you'd really enjoy it. It also features Sirius paired with an OC French witch from the same background. Genuinely a brilliant read. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611]]

On a similar note, I am currently writing a story that very closely follows this setting, The Dog Days of Summer, which centres around a summer holiday at the Black family country estate when Sirius is ten. I hope you might enjoy that too :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]
