Because I always have wondered what would happen if Petunia joined an anti magic organization given her hatred towards all things magic.


** Petunia probably would go to prison, livelong since it's murder.

Dudley and Harry would have never been born.

Neville would have been the Boy-Who-Lived. Because Neville is the only potential candidate and since it's a selffulfilling prophecy he would somehow survived.

Alice and Frank Longbottom would be dead.

James would probably made it past 21.

Sirius would never gone to Askaban.

Remus wouldn't be lonely for so many years.

Peter would still be a deatheater but probably not living with the Weasleys - he either would have gotten caught much earlier because there are three people alive who knows his secret oder died because I don't see James, Remus und Sirius be so ready to forgive as Harry was.

Snape would still be a deatheater and even more miserable and never turned spy. He would probably end up in Askaban.

The Lestranges never torture the Longbottoms but probably would be thrown to Askaban anyway (it wasn't like that were their only crime - it was only their most famous one)

Barty Crouch Jr. isn't with the Lestranges so probably he doesn't get sent to Askaban.

Dumbledore doesn't have a spy.

There maybe would be a competent Potions Master who doesn't hate children.

Barty Crouch Senior probably becomes Minister without the scandal around his son.

Umbridge probably doesn't become Undersecretary without Fudge.

Hermione probably gets killed by a troll.

Dumbledore would probably have caught Quirrell since without Harry he couldn't reach the stone (and Neville was set against going there).

Ginny probably dies in the chamber of secret. Hogwarts probably gets closed. Tom Riddle gets a body. Dumbledore doesn't find out about Horcruxes.

Since there is also no Pettigrew original Voldemort stays in Albania.

Riddle would build his Powerbase and tries to steal the prophecy at the end of year three.

Death Eater reunion at the Worldcup isn't interrupted by a Dark Mark.

Finally: Diary-Voldemort would probably win because if Dumbledore figures out the thing with the Horcruxes without the diary and without a spy, it's probably to late.
