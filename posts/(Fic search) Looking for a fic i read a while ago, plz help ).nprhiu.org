(I originally posted this on [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction][r/harrypotterfanfiction]]

Hi, im new to posting so please be patient. I read this fic a while ago. It was post war, Hinny pairing, and it detailed Ginny's pregnancy with James. Harry and Ginny lived with Teddy in a mansion/large house in a muggle neighborhood. There was this (local resident, neighbour? Not sure) who i think either had many siblings with flowery names, or had many kids with flowery names.

It was complete, im pretty sure it was on FanFic but could have been AO3. It wass really well written (i cant stand fics with bad grammar), and was a pretty decent length.

If anyone knows this fic or one similar, please tell me in the comments. Thanks for your time :)
