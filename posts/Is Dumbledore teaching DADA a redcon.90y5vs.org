** Tom Riddle is born on the 31 Dec 1926, he is therefore 11y/o on the 31 Dec 1937 and enters Hogwarts in September 1938. At the time of HagridGate, where Dumbledore is quoted as being the transfiguration teacher, Riddle is in 7th, year (he is Headboy), therefore, Dumbledore teaches Transfiguration in 1944.

Now I can't remember 100% if Dumbledore tells Riddle that he is the transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts when he visits the orphanage, but I'm pretty sure he does, so we can assume he teaches transfiguration in 1937

Newt Scamander is born on the 24 feb 1897, He is therefore 11y/o on the 24 feb 1908 and enters Hogwarts in september 1908. According to the events in PoA, students learn about Boggarts in their 3rd year. It is entirely possible that the subject would be studied at a different time in the past, and given that it is rather hard to believe that the students in the shot are 13, we can assume that the lesson takes place somewhere around [1911-1914] (4th to 7th year).

Albus Dumbledore is born in Summer 1881. During this lesson, he is therefore [30-33]. Rather on the youngish side compared to what we expect of a Hogwarts teacher.

It is entirely possible that Dumbledore began his career filling in as a professor of DADA and even an assistant of some sort. Before becoming head of the transfiguration department somewhere between 1914 and 1937/44 (20-30 years to evolve in one's career seems like sufficient wiggle room for this to be canon).

And we know that such ‘minor' teaching posts do exists (or have existed) at Hogwarts, at least according to Pottermore canon:

“She sent an owl to Hogwarts, asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore.” r/[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/professor-mcgonagall]]

So really... there is no problem. And it might even be addressed in the film with a line like “blahblahblah my real passion is transfiguration but hey I enjoy teaching so it's all good blahblahblah”. Or we can even hear about the fact that he became a transfiguration teacher or something.

*TL;DR: DON'T PANIC, IS OKAY.*

*** Great answer! Dumbledore visits the orphanage in Ch13 of HBP and doesn't mention what he teaches, but I don't think that undermines anything you said.

/“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school --- your new school, if you would like to come.”.../

/“...I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts."/

As an aside, it's always bothered me that he then lets Tom go off to Diagon Alley alone to get his school things.

**** Ah yes, thanks for clarifying that, I didn't have the book on hand to reference.

Your point about Dumbledore letting Tom go alone is very true. I always kind of justify it by the fact that Albus has always been a rather brilliant and independant child himself, and has had to be responsible very early, loosing his father, then his mother and sister. In thruth, perhaps Dumbledore never really had a very good track record in terms of being able to relate with children easily...

There is also the time-period to consider, and back in the 30s-40s, children going around alone was more common, I even think child labor was still a pretty common thing at the time...

So, prehaps a combination of those two factors, then.

*** This is a great analysis, but "Hagridgate" is amazing (if anacronistic).

Also to supplement your point; it's possible Transfiguration has much higher standards to teach, since there's a lot more that could go wrong. So Dumbledore taught DADA to get that teaching experience before moving to Transfiguration.

I wonder if Dumbledore was an animagus?

** Yes, Dumbledore should have been teaching Transfiguration speels:

#+begin_quote
  “Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did...
#+end_quote

Let's just say that Professor Merrythought was ill and Dumbledore was covering his class.

*** This happens 30 years after the "newt's boggart" lesson. He could litteraly have left his post as DADA teacher/assistant, gone to raise llamas in Peru for 5 years, have a considerable stint in prison, followed a circus for a few month, apprenticed under Flamel for a few years, published a book about transfiguration, made an appearance as an extra in a silent film, and still come back in time to be a transfiguration teacher at this time.

******* What, like the order the Potter parents come out of the /Priori Incantatem/? Bah, that hardly counts as a retcon. I mean, technically it /is/, but it's ultimately an irrelevant detail where the new version replacing the new isn't going to break anyone's heart because they liked the old version better. Something like Dumbledore's /job for several years/ is much more important.

** Riddikulus is a spell closely related to Transfiguration as well so I see no problem if it's, in fact, a transfiguration lesson. Or he's just substituting or didn't trach transfiguration until later on in his career. I don't see what all this fuss is about, to no honest.
