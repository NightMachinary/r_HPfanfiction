In the fic Harry is a "weapon" at the beginning, then I think he gets declared guilty of murder or some such, and goes through the veil. Might be a crossover, can't remember.


** It could be linkffn(5102870), although he is sent to prison and not through the veil. There was another story with a similar beginning called "The King", where he really went through the veil, but I think it was deleted
