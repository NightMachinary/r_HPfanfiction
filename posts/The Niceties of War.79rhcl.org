War of Magic and Muggle.

Okay, so lots of fics have been written about this topic; here I'm hoping to simply assess some factual elements underpinning any form of warfare. First, let's list the factors favoring and opposing each force.

Mundanes have a lot going for them. Besides the advantage of numbers, they also have high technology; spy satellites, planes, submarines, and of course, nuclear weapons. They can potentially identify magical locations by flagging anomalous geographic features. Does the satellite skip over one particular area? Then that spot is a likely location of magical peoples. The downside is fairly extreme though: they don't have magic. This means they may not be able to interact with magical attacks: does tank armor stop a Killing Curse? Can infrared cameras see through the Disillusionment charm? While it might be possible to address these issues from a mundane perspective given time, they are potential problems from a muggle perspective.

Wizards have several assets, of which magic is only the largest. Secrecy is a massive boon to any battle; the muggles can't nuke what they can't see, after all. In addition, magic lends itself to all forms of infiltration and espionage; the generals in charge of the nukes can be [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Confundus_Charm][confunded]] by wizards in invisibility cloaks into bombing their own forces. Imperius curse, Polyjuice potion, secrecy and disguise abound within the magical world. However, all such methods are merely tools to be used, and if the wizards don't know what nukes are, or who the general to be confunded is, then these tricks will be of little help. In addition, the wizarding population is relatively tiny. Estimates range from as much as 60,000 to as little as 6,000 in magical Britain; about 3 orders of magnitude less than the mundane population.

This is all very abstract and theoretical; there are a lot of small factors that could effectively tip the outcome of any hypothetical war very severely. Maybe Arthur Weasley is actually representative of only a small portion of muggle-liason wizards; the Auror office might have a team of trained wizards on standby who are well versed in mundane legal processes and the non-magical world in general. The average wizard might be almost entirely ignorant, but that doesn't mean they /all/ are.

In a similar vein, perhaps magical concealment is almost perfect; making a piece of land Unplottable doesn't just make it impossible to put on a map, but conceptually proofed against any mechanism of determining its location. Maybe Invisibility cloaks make a wizard transparent to all forms of radiation, including ultraviolet, infrared, radio wave, x-rays, gravity waves, ionizing... Certainly that seems perhaps a little unlikely, but it is magic, after all.

Then again, maybe the muggles are actually very well prepared. The Prime Minister might have a difficult time convincing his Generals that magic exists, but simply asking them to scan the Scottish Highlands for unusual topography wouldn't raise too many suspicions. In the same way that they have nukes pre-targeted to major foreign capitals, they have a few aimed at that one odd bit of loch with a decrepit castle that no one can quite seem to reach by jeep.

This is all kind of moot thought. As previously stated, it is up to guess work for the most part. There are a few things we can nail down though.

First, man to man combat. A wizard's wand is generally comparable to a gun. Accuracy over distance may be an issue; most targets in spell casting are fairly close, on the order of 10-20m. To be fair, this is the same for most gun fights. Snipers do exist, but that takes training and dedication. Just because guns have longer range, doesn't mean that a soldier can /shoot/ them at that range. However, in a pure combat sense wands offer a degree of versatility that the average soldier cannot match. Besides wide-area hexes to turn the ground underfoot slippery or similar, even a well-trained school child might be able to summon attack dogs or aggressive swarms of birds to harass and distract. Muggles would find this difficult to counter, though probably not impossible.

Can body armor stop a cutting hex? Maybe. Can a shield charm block a bullet? Almost certainly. A shield can block things like conjured projectiles, so it can probably block a bullet too, though this does raise the question of if magical shields have a â€˜capacity'. If you throw enough bullets at a shield, will it gradually lose energy until it collapses? What about lasers? What about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolaser][LIPC]]s?

Second, army vs army. Here mundanes would seem to have the advantage. Artillery, tanks, incendiary bombs, massed troops with bullets flying thick as rain into the wizarding battle lines. Then again, a bludger is a solid mass of steel capable of flying fast enough to break bones. Release a few dozen of those and all of the foot soldiers the muggles could muster would be incapacitated or pinned down. Similarly, while they might not have cannons wizards do have [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bombarda_Maxima][blasting hexes]], which can likely do a similar level of damage. It seems somewhat unlikely that wizards have invented chemical weapons (intentionally), but a Bubblehead charm can protect you about as well as a gasmask from most of them.

Last, mass strikes against civilian targets. This means [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon][nukes]] for the muggles, and potentially [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fiendfyre][Fiendfyre]] for the wizards. The questions are simple. Can a shield charm like the one protecting Hogwarts withstand a nuclear strike? Can it block the ionizing radiation left over? Do wizards know what that is, and can magical medicine heal a purely mundane ailment like that regardless of whether they know what the problem is?

What powers Fiendfyre? Will it stop without intervention? Can it burn any mundane substance? It seems to be halted by the walls of the Room of Requirement, but maybe the magic of the room aids in that. Can you stop it with a large enough fire break? Can you smother it with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_fire_suppression][chemical fire suppressants]]? How about water? The issue is further complicated by the intertwining of the magical and mundane worlds. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_Road][Charing Cross road]], home of the Leaky Cauldron and gateway to Diagon Alley, is right in the middle of London. Even if the folded space it occupies isn't protected from the outside world, justifying a bombing run on a densely populated civilian target is going to be hard. This problem is decreased, but not eliminated, for wizards. The Ministry for Magic and [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries][St Mungo's]] are both in central London as well; mass incineration of the surrounding muggle infrastructure could well threaten their own concerns.

Are there any WoG on this?

Recommended Reading: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]]; one of the DADA professors has a dim vim of the ability of even a well prepared muggle force to threaten wizards given the magical ability for surgical strikes against the heads of government and the military.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]] ; Wizards do not understand radiation or why it kills them.

Can't find it; one where Voldemort tries to force nuclear reactors to meltdown because it makes magic stronger?


** You (and a lot of others) forget one big weakness of the Muggle side: Infrastructure.

Wizards can take down the power grid rather easy (in fact, a few cutting curses to some High-Capcity lines would be enough).

Take down some important internet-nodes like DE-CIX, and the internet simply won't work properly anymore

They could also sink a few cargo ships on which the economy relies. Cripple Airports by destroying the ATC Towers.

.

This would be devastating for the Muggle way of life. No electricity means no computers, no fuel for cars, no food at the supermarket, no working food distribution. No hospitals quickly. No public transport.

What infrastructure would the Muggles attack? The Ministry of Magic that is located right below /London/? MACUSA, that is right in the Middle of New York. The floo network? Apparation?

Magical Infrastructure is much less centralized and much more robust.

Good luck attacking that. Sure, they might attack Hogwarts. Have fun explaining the world that the best target you have gotten so far was a school of innocent children.

The issue of "How would they know such things?" is also trivial. Simply grab any general, and then: "/Imperio./ Answer me: How could the magical world with the abilities A, B, C cripple the Muggles best?"

But that all is rather theoretical. Wizards can take out the entire chain of commands very quickly if they want to. Grab a random soldier. "Who is above and below you in command and how do I get to them?" -> Kill person, go to next higher up in chain of command. In only 10-15 steps you are pretty much at the top and can work down from there. Within a day and a team of only 50 wizards you could probably cripple the US Army.

Magicals fight dirty. They always did, they obliviated since hundreds of years. They would not fight fair.

Why fight a war when the structure of the Muggles is so fragile?

*** That's a very good point. Wizards are not devoid of those sorts of vulnerabilities, but they are certainly rarer and less critical. If a potion supplier gets bombed, that isn't going to mean a bunch of wizards starve to death.

I would say that your method of crippling the army requires a heretofore undisplayed level of pragmatism amongst the genpop of wizards though. Not even Voldemort is actually that sensible.

Isn't he? He managed to take over the Ministry of Magic - who have better defenses against Obliviation, ... than muggles - two months after Dumbledore died, and it was a silent coup.

And that's not even talking about the Light; Lucius Malfoy was a known Death Eater and DUMBeldore didn't just murder him when it was convenient and pass it off as an accident.

Don't do that, this makes you look like an idiot. But back to the point:

#+begin_quote
  didn't just murder him when it was convenient and pass it off as an accident.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is scared of simply killing. He was in love with a guy who wanted to take over the world and subdue billions of people by murdering others. And the other dude, that he loved and supported thought he was /right/. Heck, Dumbledore himself believed that!

Isn't it so hard to get that Dumbledore doesn't trust himself? That he doesn't /want/ to decide who gets to live and to die, especially after the war is over - he /had to/ believe in justice, because he can't trust himself.

Would you trust yourself after literally /loving/ Wizard-Hitler?

And while he didn't go around and kill Malfoy, but neither did /anyone else/ in the community. Not a grieving parent who's children were murdered. Not an Auror who lost his friends to him. No, the entire wizarding world did nothing.

And he, as headmaster and /maybe/ the equivalent of "Speaker of the House" of the wizarding parliament should do it? Not his job. He's not judge, jury and executioner - and he doesn't /want/ to be, which is his fucking right.

And after the 2nd wizarding war started? He had a more important mission: Harry, protecting the innocent, and - most importantly - Horcruxes. Because without destroying them Voldemort would be immortal.

#+begin_quote
  because he wanted more info on a prophecy which wouldn't have directly affected his plans anyway
#+end_quote

Could Voldemort know that? All Voldemort knew is that Dumbledore /hired/ who gave the prophecy to protect it and heavily protected both subjects of the prophecy - subjects who were the sons of the few people who actually defied him. He's scared of the prophecy, that's why he doesn't act.

#+begin_quote
  It was implied he could have done all of that for the entirety of Harry's fifth year and didn't
#+end_quote

It was implied that he wielded a great deal of influence the whole time, but not that he could simply take over.

*** What about booby traps? It's well within the military's ability to set up motion sensors attached to automated guns. Easy enough to set up a forbidden zone in the courtyard and enact a curfew. If a wizard apparates in there, they'll get lit up faster than they can react. Modern technology is good enough that the shimmer of dissillusionment would be very identifiable, and invis cloaks don't cover sound, though there are spells for that. However, apparation is very loud. Would not be hard to triangulate that noise with mics and pinpoint where they arrived, assuming they arrived in a closed location.

Flying is a whole other dimension, but they had better be cloaked or skeet does not even begin to define.

In an infantry battle a shield charm will stop bullets, but there are a lot of infantry from a lot of angles, with a lot of bullets being fired for suppressive purposes. That shield charm had better be up all the time or things will get messy. Wizards would probably work best in pairs, with one always shielding. However, shield charms only stop physical objects, and are one directional. Grenades will absolutely shred wizards if they don't see one thrown behind them, and flash bangs can generate enough light and sound to incapacitate wizards, especially if thrown en masse. Bombs can literally pulverize wizards behind shields by sheer pressure. And let's not forget mortars.

To wit, wizards are the ultimate guerilla force, but if they get caught out they are proper fucked.

**** I think that all scenarios where muggles can reasonably be expected to win would require prep time. Like your automated gun turrets; if they know the wizards are coming, they can set up defenses, they can start decentralizing the chain of command, they can launch preemptive strikes. In any other scenario, I would tend to favor wizards though. There are definitely things (like sheild charm durability) which might start tipping the odds against them, but... Wizards have, effectively, autonomous, self replicating weapons.

***** One other thing I thought of is traitors to the cause. More than a few muggleborns would side with muggles. More than a few could be threatened into being double agents. This could prove a stumbling block in critical operations.

Also, if any military got wind of Imperius use, setting up simple cell operations would shut down any progress on the wizard's side flat out. You can't Imperius your way up the chain of command if the commanding officer never meets you face to face.

Logistics was a good point from someone else, but the muggle world is a juggernaut. Unless wizards blitzkrieg the chain of command in the first minutes of the war and gain control of nukes, they will quite simply get attritioned to death. Muggle militaries don't even have to be effective, they just have to be lucky every so often and the numbers will still turn in their favor.

****** But the truth is, all it would take is one wizard with enough knowledge of Muggle government structures to end almost all of the governments. If you know where the president or prime minister lives, all it would take is finding when they are relatively unguarded, apparating in close enough, then Muggle-repellant and then Imperius. You don't really need to Imperius up the chain of command, you can just start at the top. And there isn't any good way for Muggles to stop wizards, who can appear anywhere, from disrupting a critical resource. They can't guard every pipeline of water, or every cable line. Important cables between continents would be trivial to destroy. Transportation is disrupted by landslides. Apparating to some important building's bathroom, walking out, then finding some way to collapse it wouldn't be too hard. All of this can be done by just one wizard. A hundred more, and it's even worse. And the wizarding world definitely has more than a hundred people who would gladly do this.

** First, we don't know how magic interacts with electricity. We know it hampers technology of the electrical sort, but at the same time, we don't know the mechanics of it. For all we know, the Department of Mysteries has discovered how to turn Muggle technology into powerful weapons.

How wizards would fight, if they had to fight, is largely a more advanced version of guerilla warfare. In terms of pure firing power, Muggles far exceed wizards. Magic in Harry Potter has show to be rather small-scale, except perhaps Fiendfyre and the occasional enormous transfiguration that may be possible.

But moving on. The truth is, just one decently powerful and cunning wizard could easily bring the entire world of muggles to its knees. A wizard can destroy critical infrastructure at will. Governments can be puppeted with just some potions, memory charms, and Imperius curses. With the existence of the Fidelius charm, there is proof that magic can affect everyone's knowledge. A brilliant wizard like Voldemort could have twisted it into something sinister, using it to mislead the Muggle populace with ease. Thus, any story where the Muggles win has to have wizards as very irrational, ignorant actors, otherwise any "advantage" Muggles have essentially would also belong to magicals.
