Looking for a Harry that doesn't want to simply be normal. He tries harder to become better with magic and perhaps gets involved in political side of the Wizarding world.

Much preferred if he isn't easily manipulated.


** That was the one thing that distressed me most about canon!HP - his desire to be normal.

Which is rather ironic, because of all the books I ever read as a child, HP was the one that most convinced me that normality is, at best, overrated.

*** It's not unreasonable that Harry would want to be 'normal.' People want what they don't have and a normal life is something Harry has never really had a chance to experience. He doesn't want normality the same way the Dursleys do. What they want is more akin to being unremarkable. Harry's deepest desire is family, his fame has always been a negative for him, and the magical world he hoped he would find acceptance in has been fickle and cruel. It's no surprise that he would just want to avoid the spotlight and settle down in a nice peaceful home rather than go do something more adventurous.

*** Normality is something Dursleys would strive for.

**** But Harry doesn't see the Dursley's as normal, he sees Arthur and Molly as normal, they work a normal job,come home, have dinner and love each other. They don't lock children in broom cupboards or force a 11 year old to cook them breakfast.

*** Eh. He didn't really want to be normal. We learn in HBP that not only does he desire Voldemort's death, he wants to personally be the one to do it. That is not normal. "Just Harry" barely halfway through book 1.

***** And even there, "Just Harry" wasn't what he WANTED to be, it was what he thought he WAS. "I can't be a wizard, I'm just Harry." He was pretty thrilled to find out that he was wrong.

** I think of [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Jeconais's Hogwarts Dawn]] sort of fits.\\
Plot: There were many ways that Harry could choose to deal with being forcibly entered into the Twi-Wizard Tournament. As everyone knows, the best way to deal with a problem, is to hire expert help. And who better than Fred and George to show Harry the best way to survive?
