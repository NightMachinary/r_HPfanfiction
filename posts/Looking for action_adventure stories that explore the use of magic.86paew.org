I've been reading a lot of character based fics recently and I'm looking for a change of pace. Specifically, something with more action that shows how magic is actually used, instead of it being a side element in a story about characters.

Examples I have liked in the past are:

The Lie I've Lived; The dueling in this fic is what keeps me coming back to it. There's a bit of super!harry which I try to avoid as much as possible, but it fits well.

A Black Comedy: Hands down my favorite fic because of the hilarity of the characters, but also because of how the author explores the limits of magic in Harry and Sirius's duels with Voldemort and their various breaking and enterings. Again, some super!harry, but he gets his ass kicked often enough for it to balance out.

Promises Unbroken Trilogy: The gritty look at the wizarding war was excellent. Again, the dueling was what kept me reading.

Obviously a common element in these three fics are the marauders era characters, who I absolutely adore. So points if anything you can think of involve them. As with anyone on this subreddit, other desirable factors are longer fics that have some form of ending. For anyone who hasn't read the above three, I highly recommend them!

Thanks!


** I have a couple that could fit what you're looking for. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12489418/1/Hourglass][Hourglass]] is a Marauder's Era time travel fic in which Hermione travels back in time accidentally. It explores time travel among other things, and has a ton of dueling later on. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12415305/1/Metaphysicka][Metaphysicka]] doesn't have as much action, but it is a Draco/Hermione fic where the plot is based around researching Potions, Alchemy, and Charms and figuring out how it works. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12458581/1/There-Was-A-Time][There Was a Time]] is a Draco/Hermione fic that is set post Hogwarts. Hermione and Theo Nott work together in the Department of Mysteries Time Room, attempting to reconstruct time turners from old plans. Draco turns up with an old prototype that they've never seen and they have to basically reverse-engineer it.

Hope this helped a little!
