What are some solid stories where Peter Pettigrew, for one reason or another, doesn't sell his soul to Voldemort?

Anything goes, longer fics preferred..


** Bit of a spoiler in both cases, but...

Peter is a main character in the first of these.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** !linkffn(The odds were never in my favor)

Since Alexandra is excluded from the prophecy by being a girl, Neville is the BWL. James ends up fulfilling the role that Sirius had in canon (fake secret keeper), and while Peter is involved with various dark forces, he is not in league with Voldemort and has saved Alexandra's life once so far.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  What if during one of their full moon adventures a horrible mistake was made and James Potter was bitten? What if he became a werewolf too? Non-canon Seventh Year of the Marauders. James/Lily.
