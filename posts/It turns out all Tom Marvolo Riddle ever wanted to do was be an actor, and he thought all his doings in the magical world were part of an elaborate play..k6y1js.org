"yes, tom-"

** I'm having a terrible time finding it again, but there's a story (I think on FFN) where Tom Riddle never existed and is actually the stage name of a long-running act put on by some random OC muggleborn who was into stage magic, which just grew into an ever-larger hoax, and later felt he had to keep it up after Hogwarts because it gave him a chance to sabotage the radical purebloods by acting like his idiot canon self while sending tips to the aurors and firechicken brigade. Don't want to spoil too much beyond that, it's pretty good, hopefully someone else remembers the title.

** When I first read HP I thought Voldemort wasn't really real. Like there was actually something else doing bad things and Voldemort was just a cover. Because in the first three books the ones you thought were the villains never actually turn out to be the bad guys. So I thought that was the same case with Voldemort. üòå But GoF happened and my initial theory was crushed hahaha.

**** Teenage me was so shocked to read about Voldemort being in his father's house. Like he was never a "person" to me up until that point, because in the first book he was just a wraith; in the second one a Horcrux... I just thought he was some evil spectre and whoever he was before Voldemort didn't matter. üò≥

***** I get what you mean, I remember reading HBP for the first time and found myself surprised that we were introduced to Voldemort's mum and her family; it just wasn't something I expected to read about. Glad we did though, HBP helped flesh out why Voldemort is so fucked up, for me at least.
