:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a while ago but I recall a fic where Hermione and Percy met up years after the war, and they got together. What I remember about it was that Percy was covered in tattoos and piercings and was very dominant, which was a (happy) surprise to Hermione, but no one else understood why she would date him...it's really bothering me that I can't find it, but I swear I read it somewhere.
