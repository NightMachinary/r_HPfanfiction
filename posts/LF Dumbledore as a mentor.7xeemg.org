Hello guys

I am searching for fanfiction where Dumbledore mentors Harry in one way or another.

thanks


** linkffn(12740667) has this a little. Fairly new story still, it might expand upon it later.

*** Have you read this further? Is the almost stupid adherence to canon events an early hiccup, or is it going to be like this the entirety of the fic?

I'm at Chapter 2 and a Ravenclaw!Harry becoming the Ravenclaw seeker in the exact same way as in canon, /and/ him being entered into the same duel by Daphne instead of Ron... It just seems like a waste of time, given that I could just read the original books at this point.

**** It's closing in on the end of year three right now, and it does seem to be finally moving towards larger divergences, but it's not quite gotten to the impact of the divergences yet.

Spoilers:

[[#spoiler][Sirius apparently went suicidal after the war ended which is why Harry went to the Dursleys, and its known that Peter was the one who betrayed the Potters.]]

[[#spoiler][Also the Tri Wizard is still happening, but it'll be taking place at Beauxbatons instead]]

I skimmed through it really quick to reply, as it's been a while since I'd actually read the fic properly, so I may have missed some things.

Edit: So far imo, it's a decent time-waster, but it hasn't done anything particularly impressive yet. That said, summary does say Major Divergences starting Third Year, so I'll probably keep up with it for a little bit to see if it goes anywhere interesting.

***** Thanks for the info. I think I'll skip it, though. The divergences in the spoilers don't feel like they would make it worth reading through another troll-in-the-bathroom scene.

****** I read it all the way through to the end of the current update, and if you enjoyed Santi's HP and the Boy Who Lived fanfic, you will definitely enjoy this one. It does start out close to cannon, but it quickly diverges, and honestly, the most interesting parts of it is HOW this new version of harry and the other characters--because HP does impact others--interact and react and act. The writer did a pretty good job of writing this, and I think you're doing yourself a disservice. Skim the first 3 chapters or so, and it gets much better quite quickly.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Cannon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

****** I think it will be a VERY SLOW burn. Daphne is clearly interested but Harry is much more interested in magic than girls, and clearly has low EQ when it comes to his own emotions and is suffering from some level of social retardation from his early isolation. It is very interesting to read.
