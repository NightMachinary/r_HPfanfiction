With the revelation that Lily was adopted by the Evans family, and has no living blood relatives to take in Harry, the blood wards never come into play and Dumbledore has to scramble to find someone who is both willing to take in an orphaned toddler and able to protect him as he grows up.


** I always wanted to see a Series of Unfortunate Events style fic where the Dursleys died as well and Dumbledore just desperately bounces Harry from prospective parent to prospective parent as stuff keeps happening to them that means they can no longer take care of Harry (Harry's incredible Hogwarts-era bad luck, coming in regularly).

*** Count Olaf is actually a squib and when he hears that Harry Potter is in need of a guardian, he convinces Dumbledore he would be the best for the job... but obviously he just wants Harry's money and magic to help him in his illegal activities.

**** I mean, I think it'd be funnier if he was a Muggle and got in anyway. Link in those "A muggle actor has gotten really far into the Wizarding world and doesn't know what to do" prompts. But, he is to Magical things what Arthur is to Muggle things.

"Ah yes, Harry. Transgifure that thing already and lets go."

"Actually, Count Olaf, it's Transfigure and-"

"No, it's Trans-JIF-fer. Test failed, tiny magical person. Test failed."

And, since he insists on being referred to as Count, there could be a whole lot of lampshading of Lordship tropes.

"Of course Magical Lords dress like this. I am a Magical Count and this is my Giant Fur Cape!"

"You mean you don't wear family rings passed down from generation to generation through your family? Why, I remember the day Great Aunt... Great Aunt..." /clicks fingers at troupe member/ "What was her name?"

"Meltadora"

"Yes! Great Aunt Meltadora. Such a shame how she went. Strangled to death by a passing Emu. Deadly things, you know. The jailbirds down in New Zealand lost a war to them."

"Australia."

"Same thing. Deadly things, funny accents, lots of sheep, who cares."

And so on and so forth. :D

****** In an abstract sense, yes. I currently have 14 WIPs to finish and another 92 ideas-for-fics (and yes, I keep count), so it really depends on when I get my current batch done, which could take awhile. Or possibly not, given how much free time half the world has now. :D

I will definitely write it at some point though, even if someone else takes the idea from here first. I plan to post some 'Self-promotion' threads whenever I start writing for HP, so I'll definitely let people know when I take a thwack at things. :)

They're not HP fics, those 14 WIPS, in case you were about to ask - they're for Life is Strange.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

**** I haven't read that one. It's by The Eyes guy though, so I'll definitely be giving it a go. Is Voldemort involved as a parental figure and if so is Harry a Dark Harry/Slytherin Harry type? No complaints if he is, I just like to know a little about what I'm getting into. :)

*** Oh god! Now I'm with this scene In my head where a very drunk Dumbledore stops his battle with Voldemort at the ministry to try convincing him to take Harry in during the summer to protect him from Voldemort. Voldemort's questioning Dumbledore's sanity, Dumbledore is doing the whole condescending grandfather routine while ignoring how illogical it actually is and Harry going all “Meh, he can't be worst than living with the Dursley's” and is all for it.

And after the battle both Harry and Dumbledore start sending letters to Voldemort about Harry living with him, them grow tired of being ignored and Harry just starts to ramdomly crashing in Voldemort's bases, all the while a progressively more incredulous Voldemort tries to shake him of his tail.
