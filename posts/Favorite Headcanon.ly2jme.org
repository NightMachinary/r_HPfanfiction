Slytherin 100% would have been freaked out by the world he lived in and a strong anti-Muggle stance would have been pretty sensible for the day and age he was in.

*** Just technical comment: if Hogwarts were found around the year 1000 in order to protect magical kids from Muggle attacks, some serious divination had to be involved. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt][Witch-hunts]] started in Europe seriously in the middle of *fifteenth* century, so *four hundred and fifty years later* (that's the time distance like from us to the middle sixteenth century!). The official position of the Church until at least fourteenth century was that witches don't exist and magic is just superstition. Even Joan of Arc (✝ 1431) wasn't burnt at stake strictly speaking as a witch, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Joan_of_Arc#Abjuration][for the voices she heard and for wearing male clothes]] (hey, she could become the patron saint of transsexuals! Except, she most likely wear male clothes for practical purposes, I don't think there is any evidence she felt like a male locked in a female body).

** This will annoy people, but mine is that Harry Potter and Smallville are the same universe. (HP and DC are both Warner Bros.) There is no evidence they are not, as the meteor shower that brings Kal El to earth happens while Harry is nine, so is not mentioned in HP, and the entire series (minus epilogue) happens before the Smallville series starts, so would be old, foreign news to Smallville teens, so is not mentioned. This has no effect on either series, I just think it's funny that they could be, and no one would know.

​

Also, if anyone knows of any fanfics that take use of this, or want to write one, please let me know. I want to read them. Post Hogwarts Harry could move to Smallville seeking "A quiet life where nobody knows who The-Boy-Who-Lived is"

Or since Lionel Luthor was semi active in Smallville when Kal El arrived, the Dursleys (and Harry) could have taken a trip there to try and sell him some drills. LuthorCorp made farming equipment (among other things) so could need drill bits for cnc machines, or maybe they add a construction subdivision. Kents adopt two kids instead of one. Clark doesn't really show powers till post Hogwarts, so wouldn't change things much, but Harry would have a happy home life and be a somewhat different person. Things wouldn't really change until Harry interferes with the events of Smallville.

Asteria and her friend Demetra Nott found the Ford Anglia in the Forbidden Forest. Antares eventually married Albus Potter (her best friend) and Scorpius married Rose Granger-Weasley.

Marius Black and the other disowned Blacks formed their own family in the muggle world considering Grimmauld place was surrounded by muggles.

Molly at least was instructed to be outside the barrier to let Harry know how to get in.

Oliver had a reason for being quidditch obsessed other than being an athlete wanting to go pro.

Harry wasn't being awkward because Albus Severus and Scorpius could end up being a thing or the whole sorting thing. I think that there just was not a lot of good family dynamics and it's easy to pile it all on The character with the twisted upbringing

Hufflepuff outlived the other founders to become the first “headmaster” with Slytherin leaving, Ravenclaw likely dying of grief and Gryffindor being brash and short fused.

The golden trio were put into Gryffindor not because they represent another house but they are tied for the other three

Hermione: Ambitious, Intelligent, Hardworking

Ron: ambition to outshine brothers, excels in specific fields of knowledge and activities only if motivated

Harry: wants to escape the Dursley's and blend in socially and intellectually (Slytherin) is loyal to his friends and holds strong values of fair play (Hufflepuff) he sets his mind to what he wants to learn not what he's told to learn and was also smart enough to survive all that time with the Dursley's and his witty comebacks (Ravenclaw)
