It is getting to the point now where three quarters of a new fics search is taken up by the accounts of the serial plagiarist.

I would (and have) report them, but FFN's mods really don't moderate at all. It takes them a month to accomplish anything. Plus every time the spammer loses an account, they create three alts and start spamming again, since there is no verification process on FFN and no IP banning.

To that end, does anyone know a good filter to exclude these stories? Should I be using Scryer? App settings?

Alternately, is there anything new on AO3 that's worth reading?


** Set the filter to updated/published within the past week/month and sort by favourites. You get to see the new stuff but since the plagiat guy doesn't get much favs, he won't show up until you're deep into the results.

Alternatively, use Scryer and filter out authors.

That's actually really clever, nice. Could lead to new fics getting buried, but shit happens.

Honestly, I think this whole situation is just kinda sad in a way. I mean, a person's life is so pathetic that this is how they need to get their rocks off? By spending a /lot/ of time creating new accounts, reposting plagiarized fics that we can report easily and ignore even easier.

**** I figure it's like this: they're so pathetic that they need others' acclaim to feel like people, but they don't have it in them to actually write stuff so they plagiarise. Only doing that doesn't get them acclaim, and so the wheel rolls down the hill ...

**** The saddest part is that this has been going on since at least 2010 and it's very likely to still be the same single individual. Almost a decade of religiously copying and reposting others. Certainly time consuming and almost never with a positive response past the first five comments. It's actually incredibly sickening.

** I would have understand it if he precised that it was a repost, and only wanted to make it discover to people because the original was deleted or not available anymore (I mean I already discovered some good fics thanks to a Plagiat guy) but making it as if it was his own work is pathetic.

** On AO3, if you liked /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/, give the /Girl in Red/ series (starting with linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red), with one story per year) a try. It updates quickly and reliably, has well-developped characters and worldbuilding, it's really great.

** Any more, I just ignore the plagiarists. They tend to copy from the best stories in the fandom and it's hardly a secret that they aren't the original authors.

Also, since fanfiction.net is a global thing, it's worth remembering that other countries and cultures have much different perspectives on copying of others' intellectual property.
