  Starts the summer Post GoF and is a Character and Relationship focused story.Don't really know how to summarize without spoiling stuff.Up until this point everything has pretty much been as canon with only one small exception. Cho Chang wasn't Harry's only crush during Goblet of Fire and it has repercussions on who he becomes as a person.

  Harry's day improves quickly after Dumbledore drops him off at the Burrow with the help of Tonks, despite Fleur's best efforts. Tonks' day improves too, though perhaps mostly due to Fleur's best efforts.Fleur's allure doesn't turn Harry into a drooling mess, but he definitely feels its effects. Tonks, as Harry soon discovers, begins to enjoy those effects greatly.
