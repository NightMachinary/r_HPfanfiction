:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fanfic is told in third person but from Ginny's point of view, in which she witnesses Harry/Hermione's interactions after the end of the war. I remember that Harry and Hermione weren't dating yet but everyone could tell that they would be soon, and there was a scene where Harry and Hermione were making a sandwich(?) and joking about never going camping again. I also remember that Ginny once woke up after Hermione had a nightmare and tried to comfort her, but Hermione said she needed a glass of water and went down to sleep in Harry and Ron's room instead. The fic is a oneshot and it's canon compliant until Voldemort's death, with the only difference being that Harry never got back together with Ginny afterwards. Thanks in advance!
