** *Alexandra Quick* is exactly this, and is one of the really high-quality fanfic series out there. It follows an 11-year-old American witch as she attends a wizarding school in a fantastically developed American wizarding society. The writing and execution is arguably professional-level and the story is incredible, quite a bit darker, grayer, and more mature than canon but somewhat in the same spirit.

There are five complete novel-length books (out of seven) and the sixth is about halfway done and probably will begin posting around late 2021/early 2022 if Inverarity continues his current rate of writing. The books are written in full before being posted.

I've linked it on FFN and AO3 below, and you can also download ebooks from [[https://inverarity.livejournal.com][the author's LiveJournal.]] There is also a subreddit, [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]], and we're usually quite happy to answer questions if you're reading the series for the first time. But some spoilers do slip through in the post titles, so be careful if you go on.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
