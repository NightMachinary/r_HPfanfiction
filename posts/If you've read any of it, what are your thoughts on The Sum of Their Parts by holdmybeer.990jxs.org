I just finished it tonight and I was very impressed with it. It was nice to see a Dark Harry that made sense and fit with the characters.

I'd have liked to see more of what happened later, but I understand why the author chose not to do that. The story was more about the changes to Harry, Hermione, Ron, George, etc. that led to Harry's rise than it was to Harry's rule itself.


** I loved it. Ending was a bit sudden-but as you say it was about his development not his reign.

The only thing is I don't really consider it a 'Dark Harry' story. He didn't really get that dark in my opinion. I was almost dissapointed, that is, if I didn't dislike the idea of Dark Harry anyway.

**** Exactly, the Harry in the story is pretty much the same as canon Harry.

Which is kind of my problem with it, it's more that Harry's decided to direct his attention towards wizarding world injustices than actually being a Dark Lord as the story purports.

*** I agree. My only contention with the story was that he made some sort of conscious decision to be "a Dark Lord" as if it was a position to fill like Minister for Magic.

Real life is rarely like that. People who are evil or tyrants rarely think of themselves that way. Many feel that they're on the right track and fighting for what they believe in while losing perspective of who they are.

**** I enjoyed the world-building in the story. But you're exactly right and it's exactly why I was almost dissapointed. Harry doesn't fight for the cause and slowly become the very thing he hated.

** Amazing fic. Only gripe i had was that there isn't a sequel that explores his reign, but thats just me being greedy. I loved how the unforgivables were described as feeling amazing, and addictive etc

** It's great, however the ending is awful. I understand the author achieved what they desired in the scope of the story, but it left me with a sour impression.

Another thing I disliked as well, is the scene where Auror . DMLE turn up at Harry's house and he incinerates them etc. I think that was just outright silly, though it served the story as needed.

** I read it for the Trio dynamic and the only disappointing thing -- a mild thing, mind you -- is Ron's quietness. But it's overall awesome! I wish it's longer but it's likely to meant to end /just there/ and stretching it might probably ruin the story.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I'll quote myself from elsewhere:

#+begin_quote
  It has some major problems. First off, I thought that the prose, while serviceable, was rather plebian. Maybe I was spoiled by reading Circular Reasoning early in my fanfic days, but this lacked this X factor that would draw me in. I thought that the author wanted to paint a particular picture of a fairly crooked, bleak reality, but lacked the words to do it. The writing ties into the second issue.

  The big moments, when they happen, have no oomph. There are fics that left me feeling like I've just been punched in the face and it was awesome. There's none of that here. Oh, Harry's killing people now? Okay, I guess. Ah, his big Dark Lord coming out. Yaaawn. Something's missing. I believe that a part of getting across the impact of those "big" moments is setting up the atmosphere of the story's environment and, like I said, the author didn't succeed in that.

  The author had some cool ideas, but once they were introduced, they were handled badly, though not all. Walburga's portrait was a horcrux? AWESOME.

  But becoming a Dark Lord was run into the ground. Same with Occlumency. Harry can't learn it because of "Black madness". Cool. And then repeatedly "well I'm not super mad, but I got the recklessness". Things like Dark Lord being an actual legal thing, the stiff adherence to Hogwarts House stereotypes ("Gryffindor-Slytherin Dark Lord", oh for heaven's sake) made my blood boil every time they were brought up for ruining what had seemed in the beginning like a potentially good fic. I won't elaborate on the Ministry full of idiots and bigots, because there's no more juice to squeeze out of that nugget. Just blergh.

  I confess that I skipped chapters 9 and 10 because I was bored out of my skull and wanted to know if Harry's Dark Lord career ever gets anywhere. The finale in the Ministry was skippable. And then the timeskip happened.

  This, I think, is this fic's biggest fault. The author had an interesting idea for a story, but wrote all the wrong scenes. The story that should have been written is in that timeskip. How did things go from "grrrr, burn everything" to Harry being the Dark Lord of Britain? Everything interesting was skipped over. In effect, the story feels incomplete. There should have been another 100k words between "BURN THEM ALL" and the epilogue. Overall, terribly disappointing.
