I'm looking for fics that are both Severitus and Drarry fics. Any good suggestions? I already read all fics that I found, looking for good plots please.


** I know a few. Not sure what you've already read though.

*Chaos Theory*

*Cunning and Ambition Series*

*Family Means More than Blood*

*For the Price of a Soul*

*Inter Vivos*

*Leo Inter Serpentes Series* - Though most of the Severitus happens in the story for Third Year and later, I think.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

**** Thank you guys! I already read Chaos Theory, Family Means More than Blood (<3) and Inter Vivos, I saw Cunning and Ambition, but how the author abandoned the fic I didn't start it (do you guys think it is worth reading? Even if it's incomplete?). Leo Inter Serpentes was also without an update for a while when I first saw, but I checked now and she just updated it, so I'll probably start this one. And For the Price of a Siul is new (for me), I never heard about it, I'll take a look on it! Thanks again!

***** Honestly, Cunning and Ambition is not really all that big of a deal since it's basically a straight canon retelling with Draco and Pansy as part of the Golden Trio instead of Ron & Hermione. It isn't a terrible read, though - it just has an uninspired plot, IMO. The author didn't write the 6th & 7th years because they likely couldn't/didn't want to think of an original plot to go with Death Eater Draco and Snape that appeared in book 6. Years 1-5 are complete though.

Leo Inter Serpentes was more original than Cunning and Ambition but it was still a canon rehash. Years 3 and especially 5 have the Severitus aspect.

*** I want those, please! No problem, I like when he takes a mentor/parental role in the fic, but it's difficult to find fics that are also slash/drarry.

**** Chaos Theory was one I was going to rec and has already been said below. [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]] by Vorabiza also has a Severitus plot line with a Snape/Lupin pairing.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966][Azoth]] and [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On The Last Day of our World]] are not really severitus but they do both have a strong mentor-mentee relationship between Snape and Harry and both have a Drarry pairing.
