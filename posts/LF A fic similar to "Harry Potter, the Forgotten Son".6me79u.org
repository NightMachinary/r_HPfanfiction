More specifically a WBWL/Non-BWL, intelligent Harry in which the fic doesn't shy away from adult themes.

The overprotectiveness of his sibling is something I'm impartial to, but would preferably like to avoid.

Thanks, and if you have any questions just reply below and I'll reply back!


** What's with all these fics where Harry is neglected by Lilly and James? There seem to be tons of them, and it's always ridiculous.

*** It's a guilty pleasure read for me. They're all, generally, over the top but good writing can make them a fun read.

Given that most fanfiction writers are in their rebellious teen years the idea is appealing to them. That would be my assumption, at least.

*** Don't you remember being in your teen years and feeling full of rage towards your parents for slights real or imagined? Well these fics is how some people deal with it.

*** Yeah. Like, we're shown these two people are loving and caring parents, up to the point where Lily willingly sacrificed herself for Harry in canon, and we're supposed to believe they'll just shove Harry off to Petunia or emotionally abuse him or whatever? I have never been able to read a WBWL fic because of that.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

*** Deprived and Rise from Dust appear incomplete/abandoned. Is this true, or was I mis-skimming? (I don't like to read into it too carefully lest I spoil it for myself.)
