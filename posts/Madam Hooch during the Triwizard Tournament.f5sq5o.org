So, when Dumbledore decided to save work of somebody who had nothing to do with the tournament (at least there is no trace of her in whole book) by eliminating Quidditch and thus not helping at all those who actually worked on it, Madam Hooch found after the first year flying classes ended somewhere in the end of September, early October, that she has effectively paid sabbatical for the rest of the year.

What did she do?


** Madam Hooch doesn't have the title of Professor, and I don't imagine she works at Hogwarts full-time. It's probably something she does on the side, teach a few classes for the first year, the beginning of every year, and referee the school quidditch matches.

If she gets a bit of money for her work, it's probably more of a nice bonus, and I think in the year of the world cup, anyone in Britian with experience in Quidditch will have found an alternative source of income.

Hosting flying competitions for foreign children for the Ministry, refereeing a smaller professional match, being point of contact for one or more foreign teams, instructing personell on Quidditch, ... - there's loads of things you can do behind or in front of the scenes.

*** OK, then Dumbledore eliminated her part time job for no reason whatsoever. That's nice too.

There's no quidditch. That's no reason? Should she stand on an empty pitch, whistling into the wind?

I presume she still teaches classes. I assume she makes more of that than of refereeing 6 matches over the course of a year. Referees in soccer in europe make, for a regional game, between 20 and 50 Euros per match. So, over the course of a /year/, at worst, she'd lose about 300 bucks, or 25 euros a month. For the americans, that's less than 30 dollars. And that's a full worst-case compensation.

That is, if she's not doing it for free. I can totally see an alumnus doing the referring for free, there ought to be enough former quidditch players that'd spend a couple of saturdays helping their alma mater.

But even if she is actually paid, she can probably earn them back at a better rate during the world cup. As I said.

I mean, I get hating Dumbledore [1], but for /this/? Like, what was he supposed to do?

[1] that's a lie, i find this fandom's hate-boner rather stupid and childish.

***** When I said “no reason”, I meant I didn't see any reason for eliminating Quidditch that year. Certainly three half-day tasks (and don't let me start on the Second and Third task from the point of view of spectators) were not that time-consuming, that all students of the school have to loose their only entertainment opportunity. And I wonder how many unplanned pregnancies happened that year, that youth energy has to go somewhere. ;)

I don't hate Dumbledore, and I completely understand JKR's true reasons for eliminating Quidditch that year (she admitted that writing Quidditch matches was the most difficult thing to do, so she always found any pretext not to do it), but from inside of the universe it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

I'm not sure. Quidditch matches seem to take Organization and Man-Power, both were probably hard to come by in the 1994/1995 school year. You not only have to host a quidditch match, but host a quidditch match for three schools -- without them feeling left out.

Two of the teams lost their seeker, who would presumably have little time to play that year, and you want the TWT to be /the/ talk of the year, as well.

I can see plent of reasons, and we're never really privy to much behind the scenes content, so I think it's a bit much to just assume that everyone's stupid.

And instead of blaming it on the author, I much prefer finding in-universe reasons -- it's much more fun, and you can discuss beyond "Well, JKR probably wanted it that way."

** Surely flying would still be taught for the first years, even if there was no quidditch, though that only keeps her occupied for a couple of weeks at start of first time I expect.
