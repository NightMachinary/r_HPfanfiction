** So many remindme's... I don't think I've ever read any Harry/anyMalfoy (with the exception of Narcissa) but there is one Neville/ocSisterMalfoy that its actually really good. Also really long, some lemons in it, good plot, really heartwrenching indecisions and general angst of being in love with the "squib blood traitor". She's called Graces Malfoy btw (not Grace.) The only issue is. I don't remember the fucking name. I know its over 600k words, so that should make it pretty easy to find. Imma take a look, just a sec.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
