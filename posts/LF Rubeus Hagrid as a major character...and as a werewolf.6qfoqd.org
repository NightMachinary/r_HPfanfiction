I can see it now; Hagrid might have been expelled from Hogwarts, but he's still darn tough, able to join the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War and survive to the end, handle an entire nest of Acromantulae to take the body of their leader, sneak a giant bigger than he is through France all the way back to the U.K....

But, he's also nice, too, and he loves magical creatures...sometimes loves them too much to see their dangers, but still. And being in the Order of the Phoenix, he naturally would have encountered Remus Lupin.

Now, let's assume! Let's assume that Hagrid, being something of an expert on all creatures great and small, recognises that Remus is a werewolf, but is nice enough and aware enough to keep his secret.

The two of them become friends, with Hagrid helping to mind Lupin during full moons. Through Remus, Hagrid gets to know James and Lily, and later their son, Harry.

Of course, things go a little wonky; James and Lily die, leaving Harry behind, and one full moon night Lupin escapes from captivity; Hagrid's strength is enough to restrain the werewolf and stop him from escaping to slaughter dozens of innocent muggles, but it comes at a cost, for Hagrid gets bitten, not badly, but enough.

Fast forward a few years. Hagrid was even closer to the Potters than in canon, so when he finally meets Harry again at 11, he has so many stories to tell, about animagi and the Fidelius and what Harry was like as a baby, what they did in the Order of the Phoenix, the first war, and all kinds of fascinating tales about the creatures that make up the magical world.

Of course, it's not all flowers and sunshine, as every three days, once a month, Hagrid disappears someplace or other, and often comes back looking worse for wear.

...Incidentally, how dangerous would a half-giant werewolf be? Would they be bigger and nastier and an overall walking disaster zone?


** I dont think that half a giant could turn into a werewolf...sorry. Because we know that Hagrid isn't affected by the stunning spells so that leads me to think that he might not become a werewolf because of the giant blood in his veins.

*** Now you mention it, I haven't seen any mention in all of Harry Potter (fanon or canon) about werewolves of other races. They're always human, and werewolves exclusively target humans. Not goblins, not house-elves, not giants, not centaurs, certainly not transformed animagi or actual animals. Just humans. Not even veela.

Which is funny, since a bunch of those races can cross-breed with humans just fine. Look at Hagrid, and Flitwick. Heck, look at Fluer Delacour, she's a quarter-Veela so that means that at least that crossbreed is fertile.

...In any case though, given that giants apparently have similar enough genetics and/or magic to crossbreed with humans, why would a half-giant be impervious to the notoriously incurable, impossible-to-fight-off-without-wolfsbane-potion disease of lycanthropy?

**** Is it a disease or is it a curse? That might make all the difference, if it originally began as a curse.

**** My headcanon is that it doesn't affect Hagrid totally but still does partially because he's only half giant. Maybe he gains a Jebus massive wolf animagus form or something?

** Wouldn't a giant's (well: Half-Giant's) resistance to magic cancel out the werewolf curse?

Hell, maybe he does get stronger or something, but outright transforming? I don't really know :(
