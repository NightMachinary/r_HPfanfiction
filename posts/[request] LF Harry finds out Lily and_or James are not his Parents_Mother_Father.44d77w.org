I think the title says it all. Preferably not Snape as father as I feel I read a lot of Severitus already. :)

Or , if Snape is his father than Lily ISN'T his mother also!

Just, somehow he finds out about his different parentage pretty please OH and preferably not romance heavy, but thats secondary. (Though any and all pairings and sexual preferences are welcome, he)

Cheers :)


** It's not finished but it's a very enjoyable read.

This is a genre I typically avoid but I have read some very good fics with this them or something similar. I'll comment again if I can think of anything.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9733866/1/Fields-of-Thyme]])

Fields of Thyme is a fic where HiNO spends about 90% of the book not having james and lilly as parents. I havnt got a clue why I liked this fic but if you decide to give it a try, skim through the first two chapters.

  Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange new symptoms while taking part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could these two things possibly be connected?

  James made a mistake. Lily got even. In the wake of Voldemort's resurrection, the consequences catch up to Harry, and from there it's demons, dark wizards, and devil hunters. Let's rock! HP/DMC crossover, fifth year AU.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
