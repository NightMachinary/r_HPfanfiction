It was a post on here that piqued my interest in May for a Tomione fic. From there, I delved into Bellatrix and Voldemort, Bellatrix and Rodolphus, and Lucius and Narcissa. I'm probably late to the party, but all the darker fics I've encountered before featured a protagonist going OOC and dark, or were otherwise uninteresting because they got too intense with the evil.

I didn't realize until today what a darkish reading theme I've been on. These aren't, for the most part, extra violent or anything---more like morally ambiguous, and I LOVED THEM. They were all so well written, with nuanced looks into the dark antagonist psyche. Very sophisticated and real.

My black heart loves seeing couples we would consider villains (because of actions or beliefs) really be devoted to each other in a twisty way. If you have any dark but still shippable romances please lmk. I'm loving these and am looking for more.

At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

  Bellatrix falls asleep in Azkaban Prison in 1982 and awakens in the Slytherin girls' dormitory in 1944. Convinced that she has been sent through time, age, and space to warn her lord and master of the doom in his future, Bellatrix intersects with Tom Riddle. But when she becomes comfortable in her new existence, Lord Voldemort's path to power shifts and warps. Novel-length COMPLETE

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right."

  The war is over, the good guys have won, and Hermione Granger goes to sleep in her lovely flat only to wake up in 1953 in the bed of someone she'd really much rather were dead. "I'm working on the 'kill Lord Voldemort now, work out the temporal paradox issues later' plan," she tells him. He laughs. Tomione. COMPLETE

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...
