#+begin_quote
  Trelawney gives an assignment at the beginning of fifth year. This leads to the revelation of a power that Harry didn't know he had. A power that no one expected. Least of all the Dark Lord. A power he knew not. Harry decides to change everything with his new book. Being able to shape the future to how you want took a lot of vision. No one could have predicted this. A/N: SLASH*Voldemort/Harry.Harry is powerful but mindful of it.
