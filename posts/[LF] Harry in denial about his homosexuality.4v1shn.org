I'm looking for fanfictions where Harry is in denial about his homosexuality or really struggles to accept it, and keeps it a secret from everyone.

I would prefer it to be as close to canon as possible, so it's all good if he's dating / married to Ginny.

I'm ok with him developing a relationship with any male character, but I don't want typical slash where he just realizes he's gay because he has fallen in love with the guy and they kiss and have sex and it's perfect and they become a couple and everyone accept it. I want Harry to feel ashamed and disgusted by himself, guilty if he's dumping Ginny, and extremely lonely because he can't tell anybody about it.

Thanks a lot !

tl;dr: I want to read a story focusing on Harry's struggle with his sexuality in an homophobic wizarding world.

** Really recommend Fate is a Four Letter Word linkao3(4267422). There are some parts of it that I feel are too explain-y (I can't think of a real word for this right now, haha), but overall it's a brilliant mystery/romance fic. I loved it so much I wrote a promotion post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4n91m5/promotion_fate_is_a_four_letter_word_by_philo/][here]]

The Apple Tree by the same author doesn't fit your criteria (definitely not in denial here), and there's a part of it that a lot of people have found conflicting (YMMV), but I'll just add it in in case you like the first one. linkao3(4241040)

  Dumbledore was gay and nobody cared about it.
#+end_quote

Did anyone even know? After all, the only reason readers know that Dumbledore was gay is because Rowling said so at a book signing. It's not made explicit anywhere in the text. If it were common knowledge in Magical Britain that Dumbledore is gay, one would expect that it would've come up at some point. For example, Skeeter's posthumous biography of Dumbledore makes big mention of his connection to Grindelwald. If she knew that Dumbledore was in love with Grindelwald, why wouldn't she say anything? It would be quite scandalous, not because it's a same-gender relationship, but because being in love with wizard Hitler is a scandalous thing.

Of course, it could very well be that Skeeter simply didn't know this. There's no indication that Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship ever went beyond Dumbledore's secret feelings. But Dumbledore doesn't seem to have been in any other romantic relationship, so how would witches and wizards know his sexual orientation? (Cf. Rowling's comments [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more/][here]].)

It seems like if no one in the wizarding world cared that Dumbledore was gay, it's because they didn't know. And of course, there's a strong argument to be made that a society with no openly gay people is a deeply homophobic society...

**** You don't need a homophobic wizarding world to get Harry struggling Sith homophobia. Vernon was kinda racist, it's not farfetched to think he's a homophobe.

You can have a Harry that listened to Vernon's rants about 'fags' and 'poofs' his entire life, and therefore is afraid to be one. He lives in a dorm with 5 boys. Teenagers think the word fat is an insult. They might not even realise what they're doing. You can have Harry struggling with his sexuality because it's mean he's have no kids, and maybe feels guilty about not continuing his line, maybe he wonders what his parents would think.

I rarely read slash, but most of the ones I read are terrible. Ron turns on Harry, becoming an asshole on par with Malfoy. Most fanfic writers have no subtlety, that's why they make the Dursleys beat up and molest Harry, and have evilDumbles! steal Harry's money.

I'm on my phone, so I can't search for any fics that don't have one of the guys turn into a submissive duds, but I'll look into it tomorrow. Your best net of you're looking for slash, is to look for pairings with Cedric.

There's a site I don't remember the name of, but I think it's something like mujira know it all, mujira.kia.net. Not too sure about the mujira but, but it's a site with all types of pairings, gay and straight

****** Harry's deepest desire is to have a family. A huge family, that surrounds and loves him. On top of that, he feels an incredibly strong connection to his family, especially his father, and being the last of the line of a family that goes back to the peverells is probably going to resonate strongly with hi.. To me, this means that harry probably wants to be a dad and he probably wants to have lots of kids and he probably wants them to look like him (so he'd prefer biological kids rather than adoption). Although I can totally see Harry adopting kids out of shitty situations too, now that I think about it.

******** I tried very hard to be sensitive to what I was saying in my original argument, because I know that any permutation of "he'll want to father children rather than adopting" is going to ruffle some feathers. And really, one of the central themes of cannon is that blood â‰  family. Hagrid and Hermione and the Weasleys (et al) are family and the dursleys are decidedly not. But some people (like myself) have a preference to fathering (or bearing) children rather than adopting, for various reasons.

Here's a longer version of my second premise.

Throughout the books, Harry (like lots of orphaned kids) wants to meet his family very, very badly. We see that in Harry's mirror. I want to point out here that Harry's vision in the mirror is very specific. It doesn't show him surrounded by generic people who love and adore him (which it could have). It specifically shows him his biological family. And that's what Harry pulls out of it too: look! that man's hair looks just like mine! That woman's eyes! That man's knees! He's never met person with hair like his, or eyes like his, or knees like his. He doesn't like anything about his own appearance at all, except for his scar. So seeing a man with his hair (which was a sticking point through the entire first act of SS) is a confirmation to Harry that he has a history and a place in this new world he's stumbled into.

This segues nicely into another place I think this desire reveals itself, his relationship with his father. He wants to meet and see and speak to his father so badly that despite his father's death before the start of the story we see (or think we see) James in five of the seven books (I don't think we see James in CoS or HBP, someone correct me if I'm wrong). Harry worries constantly about how his father would want him to behave or act, whether he's living up to the bar set by James's behavior, etc. etc. Harry feels CRUSHED when Lupin accuses of not living up to those expectations. And when James doesn't meet his, Harry's, standard of behavior in OotP, it's Harry's turn to be crushed. Now, I think this preoccupation (as well as some other hints, like his reaction to meeting Teddy) shows that harry is, like me, someone that wants to not only have children, but father them.

So that's a much longer and more filled in version of my original argument. I thought I was reasonably clear in my original, but I wanted to be 100% crystal clear that that's I'm not suggesting that adopted children aren't real family. If Harry couldn't, for whatever reason, father children (maybe those damn avada kadavras, one after the other?) he would 100% adopt, just like I would, and would love his children, just like I would. And, like I indicated above, I think a fic about Harry adopting kids generally, or adopting kids out of shitty situations like the one he grew up in specifically would be a GREAT. But given his choice, I'm pretty sure he'd choose to father kids.

Let me know if you disagree with my argument in any way or if there's a place I could be clearer.

I don't know, cannon never mentions it. So does that mean that it's not a big deal because no one bothers mentioning it . . . Or that it's such a big deal it's a secret? Hard to say from cannon.

Anyway, I'm not saying any of this is canon. If someone requests a Harry/Hermione fanfiction, it doesn't mean they claims the pairing is canon, right ?

(Also nobody seemed to know about Dumbledore's sexuality, so it's doesn't contradict any theory about homophobia in the wizarding world)

*** I always wonder what people who say things like this think the process of realizing you're gay is like. I'm sure some people reach puberty and immediately know they're gay and the idea of dating the opposite sex never crosses their mind, but for me I was firmly convinced I was straight, crushed on several boys, and had several "what was it like?" "...wet" kisses & sexual experiences before I started identifying first as bisexual and then as gay. I think its entirely possible for canon Harry to have started identifying less straight after the end of Deathly Hollows without it being AU.
