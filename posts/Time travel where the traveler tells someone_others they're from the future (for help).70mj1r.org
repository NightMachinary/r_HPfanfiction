Hello all-! I was hoping someone could help me find a particular kind of time travel fic. The traveler can be anyone who purposefully chooses to tell at least one other person (it can be more) that they're from the future. No trying to go it alone to achieve their objectives while everyone else wonders if that character is crazy/a Seer/etc. Preferably the protagonist already knew they were going to reveal themselves to a particular person (i.e. Harry knew he was going to go back and tell Dumbledore all the pertinent info) All pairings are fine, I'd prefer the first or second Voldemort eras (IOW not as far back at Marauder school days), and a hardline /no/ bashing, please.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** I did start reading this sometime ago, but I couldn't continue after Ginny attempted to "give Harry his present" and he was kicked out of the Burrow. I've continued to see this recommended by others, though, and I'm wondering if there was something to the story that I've missed by stopping. Still, thanks for the recommendation. :)

*** I second this. It's really a great fic and it fucked me up for a week. Couldn't think straight. It does get angsty at times, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Don't get intimidated by the number of sequels, the first part is really all you need. linkffn(4101650)

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. COMPLETE.
