Generally speaking, I find the idea of "love potions" to be extremely interesting, but criminally under-utilized and only explored in a very shallow way. Yes, fanfiction is /full/ of love potion use, but usually only as a mechanism for character bashing, or as a way for /love potions themselves/ to be bashed. How many stories feature cackling Weasleys, churning out love potions only to be caught red-handed and called out as date rapists or worse?

This is about as far as I've seen fanfiction go in exploring potions, and I think it completely misses two very interesting kinds of storylines that could be told.

*Love Potion Addiction*

#+begin_quote
  Harry scrutinized [Ron] suspiciously. “You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?”

  ...he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed, and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll...

  "...they're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they're all spiked with love potion!”

  But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.

  “Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry --- do you know her? Can you introduce me?"
#+end_quote

Even some of the "best" HP fanfiction invovlving love potions will often show the victim (the one dosed with the love potion) discovering that they've been dosed and getting clean of their own will. Just off of the top of my head as an example, Bungle in the Jungle features Harry wising up and running away when he discovers that he's being slipped love potions "keyed" to Hermione.

But as /Half-Blood Prince/ shows, that doesn't have to be the way things go. Love Potions themselves can inebriate you, and make it hard-to-impossible for you to realize that you've been dosed. Your judgement is impaired or altered by definition, and even if you /do/ figure out that you're on love potions, will you be able to hold a grudge against the person who dosed you? You /do/ love them, after all...

It's not hard to imagine that our hero might need nothing short of an /intervention/ against their will in order to get clean.

*Consensual Love Potion Use*

#+begin_quote
  "Powerful infatuations can be induced by the skilful potioneer, but never yet has anyone managed to create the truly unbreakable, eternal, unconditional attachment that alone can be called Love."
#+end_quote

We know as readers that even "love potions" can't produce /love itself/, whatever that may be in the Harry Potter universe. But how does deep love come about? If two people start out infatuated but spend time together and grow more intimate even as the infatuation fades, does it matter if their initial infatuation comes from a bottle rather than from a natural crush?

In a Potterverse with a lot of fanon elements like marriage contracts and noble houses, it's not hard to imagine a culture of casual and generally-consensual love potion use. Why bother getting upset that you're in an arranged marriage, when you can take potions and be just as happy there as elsewhere? If nothing else, you can just go on potions /consistently/ and never let the glow of infatuation die down.

The same ideas apply even for /traditional/ romances. A treatment for a dead bedroom or a lapse of passion may only be a drink away, and love potions may go on the shelf right next to conventional marriage counseling.


** I like your idea with the love potions - I mean, I could definitely see the use in a potion that...doesn't necessarily make you /fall in love/ but maybe smooths the edges a bit? Like, you're really fond of hubby but if he leaves the goddamn toilet seat up /one more time/ you're going to Azkaban and there's not a woman in the world who'd blame you, so you sneak a sip of potion and suddenly you find everything about him slightly more adorable. And he takes some to make the way you chew your toast less annoying.

I did read one fic that was quite interesting and dealt with the idea of overdosing on Amortentia, which leads to a neverending obsession with the target which can't be cured. I'll get back to you if I remember the name...

Though now I wonder, have any fanfics had a reverse-love-potion-defence for that cliche charge of Line Theft? As in, the one being accused was brainwashed into doing it via a potion?

Imagine that; an obnoxious Lord Potter brings charges against Ginny Weasley (and Molly, and Ron) for attempted Line Theft, but after a few days in custody Ginny claims that Harry potioned /her/, which combined with Harry's antagonistic behaviour after becoming a Lord leads the entire Weasley family and a few friends to try and prove that "Harry" is in fact a doppelganger who kidnapped the real Boy-Who-Lived, but with Susan and Amelia Bones thinking the Weasleys have been Imperius'd, but with Neville thinking that the Malfoys bribed the Bones'...

**** I can agree with your point, but it was the only one I could think of at the moment. Your idea is interesting and I would certainly read that story.

  Post-DH. The line between politics and family is razor-thin, especially when you're a daughter of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Following the Battle of Hogwarts, Andromeda Tonks receives a condolence note from a surprising source.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
