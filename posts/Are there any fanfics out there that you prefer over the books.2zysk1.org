It can be individual books, or the whole series. I was just curious as to whether or not there are any fics that (in your opinion) approach, or even surpass the quality (writing, story, etc.) of the Harry Potter books.

Even if they're from another fandom, feel free to post them.

** Since you invited other fandoms--probably my all-time favorite fic is [[http://rosa-acicularis.livejournal.com/30916.html][The Anatomist]], a BBC Sherlock fic that I rec by calling it better than canon. Would've made for such a good S2.

  James Joseph Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976. His birth certificate no longer exists.

  If it did, it would list his father's name (Dr. Joseph Arthur), his mother's (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne), and his birth weight (2.7kg). It would not tell you that his eyes were blue, or that he entered this world as he will leave it -- howling.

  It would not tell you that five minutes later his mother (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne) gave birth to a daughter, his sister. His twin. The records of her birth burned with his, but if they hadn't, you would know her name.

  Mary Elizabeth Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976.

  They will call her Molly.

Also, while it does the whole lordship thing way more tastefully (and more believable) than most, I still cringe whenever it trails off into the proverbial tall grass of aristocracy.

** There have definitely been fic authors I've stumbled upon that I prefer their writing style over JKR's. That's not to mean they are better than she is, but because they have their own writing qualities that I really like. They just really have a knack for writing drama or comedy or suspense, and it makes their stories so much better for it. They are authors who I stop midway through their fic and think "shit, I'd buy their books if they had them. I love how they write!"

But that doesn't mean I'd give up the original books for those fic or choose their fic over the books, because no way. It's one thing to write fic based on someone else's characters and world, but another thing completely to create those said characters and world from scratch. It doesn't matter how good someone's fic is, I'll still prefer the books over them. Since, without the books, there wouldn't have been any fics to begin with.

Moreover, you appear not to have read much fanfiction if you lump it all together as substandard, unimaginative dross. Any objective reading of the best fanfiction indicates that the form allows just as much imaginative creation and expression as original fiction. Also, as many fanfiction writers have published original fiction professionally as well (I can think of at least a dozen, including myself), your claims that we are all not "inventive enough for an original plot" ring hollow at best.

Shakespeare and T. H. White penned what would be called fanfiction were it written today. It's not unreasonable to wonder what of today's fanfiction may be held up generations from now as literary classics.

For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866813/1/A-Whiff-of-Competition][A Whiff of Competition]] has an amazing and unique structure for the world of professional Quidditch. I won't say it's better than the original series, but it measures up certainly.

I'm not totally sure what you mean by other fandom, but I did randomly stumble upon a fanfiction that is better than/fixes the abusive relationship in Twilight. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6555315/1/Leaves-of-Grass][Leaves of Grass]] is mind-blowing. Essentially, Bella begins questioning the nature of her relationship with Edward and his control and ends up being transported to 1862 Texas where she meets Jasper as a human. The writer manages to make Bella a developed character and give her a healthy relationship, two things Stephenie Meyer fails to do. Even if you don't care much for Twilight/have only a passing familiarity, this story is worth it for the US Civil War alone.

*** Twilight fanfic is inexplicably good. I think it's because the stories/characterization is bad rather than in spite of. Basically it's a ready-made set of characters to convert into humans and throw into any situation you chose.

My personal favorite is Hydraulic Level 5, in which Edward and Bella are childhood friends and high school sweethearts who got married just out of college. The story picks up when they're both 30, and she's still trying to understand what drove him to abruptly divorce her a year into the marriage. It's incredibly moving and wonderful from start to finish. Other gems include There Will Be Blood (Edward is the neurotic son of a mob family and Bella is a college freshman who gets in too deep), This is Not My Life (Bella is kidnapped along with Edward's 5-year-old daughter and Bella does her best to keep them both alive/sane), The Cullen Campaign (Edward and Bella are members of rival DC political families who exchange sharp political barbs in between fucking each other senseless), Faking It (Edward is a scandal-plagued actor, Bella is the fresh-faced lead singer who needs to raise her profile, and they enter into a mutually beneficial fake celebrity relationship). Not to mention the whole genre of high school all-human fics with lots of ennui and underage drinking.

I lost track of the number of fics that disappeared because the author had turned it into an actual novel. Which is a "problem" in a lot of fandoms, but Twilight was particularly prone to it because all you really had to do was do find-and-replace on the names and because a lot of the writers were older (read: "twimoms") would could competently write adult relationships.

** It's dated now, and I would no longer think so having seen the series (and its larger themes) through the eyes of my son as I read him the books when he was very young, but for years I'd have preferred Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] to canon's book 6. No Horcruxes, Harry moves up (plausibly) in the power stakes, factions in the Goblin world, the economic implications of a world with a Philosopher's Stone, believable Harry/Ginny romance, and arguably the best Harry/Dumbledore duel in fanfiction.

Of course, this isn't what the /Harry Potter/ series was about at all, but it might have been had JKR been a more formulaic (and less romantic) genre writer. For example, Jim Butcher of /Dresden Files/ fame or Patrick Rothfuss, author of /Name of the Wind/, would have written /Harry Potter/ as a series of magical and character-building plus-ups leading ultimately to protags who could go toe-to-toe with the Big Bads while pulling off a crowning moment or two of awesome. JKR was more Tolkein-esque in her grounding her novels in family and love, not power and theatrics.

I also probably enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity's]] exceptional (and oft-linked) /Alexandra Quick/ series nearly as much as I did Harry Potter canon.

** For Harry Potter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging The Sword]] gets my vote. It takes the series to a slightly darker place and it does it well. Harry Potter and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][The Forests of Valbone]] is an interesting one as well.

Wastelands of Time and Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived are both worth mentioning, but are so drastically different from canon, it's almost original fiction.

For Buffy: I'm very fond of anything by [[http://liz-marcs.livejournal.com/239724.html][Liz Marcs]] and I think her view of life past Season 7 is superior to the comics. [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120429044006/http://www.echonyc.com/%7Estax/Buffy/nwhepcat/index.htm][Nwhepcat]] is also an excellent writer.

For Pokemon: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][Game of Champions]] is easily one of the best fanfictions around. For another good read, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5808527/1/Regret][Regret]].

For EVA: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470043/1/Evangelion-Genocide-Extended][Evangelion Genocide]]. Highly enjoyable and manages to keep the tone and pain of the original series. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4140913/1/Orchestrating-the-Silence][Orchestrating The Silence]] is another story that works well here.

For The Hunger Games: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10256002/1/These-Are-The-Names][These Are The Names]] acts as a prequel to the books and does a damn good job of fleshing out Haymitch and Effie beyond the books.

***** Seconding /The Asking Price./ I didn't particularly enjoy the Hunger Games books (the third one, especially, I had major problems with), but this is an excellent story. The writing quality is at a level you don't often see in fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8466693/1/Traveler][If you haven't read it try Traveller. It's in my top 10 fanfiction of all time. Basically Ash's story done right, he starts with a Nidoran and...just the entire thing is done infinitely better than the manga or anime. Also it's insanely, stupidly, wonderfully long.]]

** The *Promises*-trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/22909/Robin4][Robin4]] - /Promises Unbroken/ - /Promises Remembered/ - /Promises Defended/

It's a story about The Marauders. Harry is merely a side character. It's a tale about how Sirius remained the Secret Keeper, was kidnapped and tortured by Voldemort and everyone thinks he's dead -until he reappears. The most amazing thing in this fic is that it takes Peter Pettigrew and makes it an actual person, not just a one dimensional bad guy.

** No. It's apples and oranges. Fanfiction - to me - is nothing like published fiction. I look at it as something that helps me get better at a hobby I enjoy: writing. Like practicing a tennis serve or a golf swing. Nothing more than that.

Professionally written and published literature is entirely different. If I want to go read Finnegan's Wake I'll go read it. Same with the original series of HP books.

** The Snape Chronicles of course! Love it to death. I'm not sure if I would consider them better than the HP books but the Alexandra Quick series are very well-written as well.

*** I think The Snape Chronicles make Snape too good a person. The wonderful thing about him is the dark past that he overcomes and the shades of grey in everything he does. TSC makes it more a mildly shady past he has to overcome and there's shades of beige in everything he does.

*** Oh, absolutely AQ is better. It's so similar to JKR's writing style, but the plotline is better constructed, and it's far less sanitised than the HP series ever was.

** [[http://fanfiction.net/u/4314892/]] - Colubrina (Author page)

The Die (and it's polyamorous alternate ending, After The Sea) are likely OOC, but I find myself drawn to Hermione dealing with the post-war, particularly with in a Harmony or Dramione ship.

Also, Vera Rozalsky's Amends, Or Truth and Reconciliation.

I don't think they SURPASS JKR, but I like that they try to world-build (Vera) or deal with the consequences of the DA as traumatized child soldiers (Vera's reprisals, Colubrina and her treatment if the Trio as triggering for each other) in a way that JKR seemed to handwave with the epilogue.

Also, both authors are aggressively well-read. I don't actually think Draco and Hermione would quote Edna St. Vincent Millay to each other in bed, but the sheer amount of references both back in just tickles the history and literature majors I've buried in my heart.
