James and Lily Potter, at the moment of their deaths in Godrics Hollow, have their minds shunted across time and space into alternate versions of themselves.

Their research on their surroundings is tentative as they slowly try to piece together where they are, what happened and if they are dead or not.

Their conclusions:

â–ªï¸Ž A decade has passed

â–ªï¸Ž They have twin boys, one of them their Harry and another who is attributed with defeating Voldemort all those years ago

â–ªï¸Ž Both of their kids have just left for their first year at Hogwarts

And, most importantly/agregiously,

â–ªï¸Ž The version of Lily and James who raised the twins were terrible parents.

A James and Lily, placed in a WBWL story as they desperately try to clean up the mess the other James and Lily made. Appalled at the blatant favouring of one child over the other, the fame/glory seeking of their counterparts, the neglect (and abuse) levied on their baby boy and the bridges they'd burned by doing all this...


** This would be really interesting. Poor Harry would be so confused, maybe even paranoid.

** I've seen a similar premise before, with a good Dumbledore taking the place of a manipulative Dumbledore(one who's manipulative actions would ultimately cause the world to be destroyed) which people seem to particularly dislike, because of the bashing of the manipulative Dumbledore, who despite causing the end of the world through his actions, had good intentions.

*** It's called /Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure/ which unfortunately seems to be on a hiatus.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
