Every fic on here is vetted by me, mystictutor, and has been carefully selected from the wheat of Harry Potter fanfiction. If you have questions or are looking for a specific kind of fic, I'd be happy to point you to which one meets your specifications.

I'm going to leave the links in a comment because my post isn't getting through the mods for some reason. I hope there isn't a minimum word count.
