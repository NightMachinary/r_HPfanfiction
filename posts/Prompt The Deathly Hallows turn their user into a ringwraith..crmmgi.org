Extensive use of the Deathly Hallows causes Harry to fade into a state between life and death, transforming him into a wraith. Basically Nazgul!Harry


** Similar idea-- using horcrux turns wizards into dementors

*** That's actually a really good idea though I think it would work better with the use of the unforgivables and powerful dark magic instead considering there are far to many dementors for it to apply to only horcruxes.

**** Not necissarily, they were invented in ancient greece during a time when sacrificial rituals weren't uncommon. It could be that the sheer number of dementors are the result of it becoming popular as a 'True Immortality for the cost of a Slave' sort of ritual that slowly transforms the caster. Give a three or four centuries and suddenly the place is full of evil creatures, it gets traced back to horcruxes and thus a destruction of all forms of information to do with horcruxes.

2000~3000 years later the dementors are still around, with an occasional one joining them as someone finds and uses the ritual over the centuries.

It's kind of believable too, as Toms physical appearance had changed to the point where he could be turning into one.

  It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.\\
