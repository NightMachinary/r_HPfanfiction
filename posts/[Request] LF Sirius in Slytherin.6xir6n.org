Are there any AU fic or even time travel fic that explore Sirius being sorted into Slytherin.

Edit to add: I know stages of Hope, Im more interested in following Sirius through years 1-7.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** Thanks, I fixed my OP as I know stages of hope, Im more interested in following Sirius through years 1-7 than only the aftermath.

** Check out linkao3(73 Aberdeen). It explores the consequences of Sirius having been in Slytherin and includes snippets from his school years. A pretty good infrequently recommended fic.

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.
