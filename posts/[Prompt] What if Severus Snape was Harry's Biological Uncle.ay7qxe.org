Let's say that Lily and Petunia's parents were murdered by Death Eaters when Lily was fourteen and Eileen Snape nee Prince decided to blood-adopt her, making her and Severus siblings.

No romantic feelings between the two anymore, Lily doesn't give up on him because of "the incident", and Severus Snape joins Voldemort to spy from the beginning.
