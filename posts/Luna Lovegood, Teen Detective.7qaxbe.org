In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7q7grw/just_a_thought/][this thread]], the illustrious [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] made the following statement in response to a comment of mine:

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood solving "mysteries" at Hogwarts would be a hilarious crack fic. I'm pretty sure most of her investigations would end with everyone either thoroughly confused or lifelong /Quibbler/ subscribers.
#+end_quote

So now I beseech the rest of the /HP/ fanfic community: please help me find this if it does in fact exist. I really really want to see Luna cast in a Nancy Drew / Veronica Mars-type role, and despite what OP said, it doesn't even have to be a crackfic. If Hermione, Ginny, and/or any other girls are helping her solve mysteries, that'd also be cool. (For whatever reason, Luna/Hannah seems like it would be a pretty fun team-up.)

To quote the Cromulon floating head from /Rick & Morty/: *Show me what you got. I want to see what you got.*


** "So what are we going to do tonight, Luna?" Sue Li asked, bouncing up to her friend in the Ravenclaw common room.

"The same thing we do everynight, Su," Luna answered, still reading her copy of the Quibbler upsidedown. "Try to take over the world!"

"Really?" Su asked. "When did we start trying to do that?"

"I don't know, but tonight just seems the sort of night for taking over the world, don't you think?" Luna remarked.

Sue thought about it, then shrugged. "Would that mean we get a new teacher in History of Magic?"

Luna set her copy of the Quibbler down, tapping her chin thoughtfully. "I don't know. I don't think the Ghost Union would allow us to replace Binns even if we did rule the world."

"The Ghost Union? Is that how Binn's has kept his job even though he's the most rubbish teacher in all of existence? And I'm even counting when Snape was a teacher. He might be a hero now but he was a complete tosser," Sue declared.

"That's it!" Luna declared, standing up. "We'll discover why the Ghost Union is so invested in keeping Binn's as a teacher!"

"Oh boy! A mystery! I love mysteries. Will we get to be like Marvin the Mad Muggle?" Sue asked as she followed Luna towards the common room door.

"Of course not. We'll be like Mystery Inc," Luna declared. "We'll just need to find a talking animal of some sort to be our side kick."

"Well, I don't know of any talking animals around at the moment," Sue observed. "And the only animagus around is the Headmistress."

Luna nodded seriously. "It's settled then. We'll start our investigation at the Headmistress' office."

The two 7th year students wandered through the castle, having to take several detours. The castle was still being repaired from the Battle of Hogwarts the year before, where no one the Death Eaters and other characters the author doesn't feel like including had died, because this is a comedy AU and I said so.

To Be Continued... (Maybe)

***** The first time (to my knowledge) that I've ever inspired a fanfic - or maybe not, since you're the one who suggested it to me in the first place. Thanks a ton.
