** Oh I am so glad you asked! I read this one on and off over the weekend and it has been super addictive, I finished it this morning and I'm kinda sad it's over!

It's mature, over 20 chapters and Harry is definitely a bad bad bad guy.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
