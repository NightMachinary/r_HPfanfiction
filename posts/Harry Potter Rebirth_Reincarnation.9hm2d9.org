Does anyone know any Good Fics that have Harry being a reincarnation or being reincarnated?

If it is, Like he is being born into his own body again, I don't mind that either.

Crossovers and Slash are cool as well.

As long as it is Long, well written and not too explicit, then it is good in my books!

Something like (Time To Put Your Galleon Where Your Mouth is, His Twenty Eighth Life, Dodging Prison And Stealing Witches - Revenge is best served Raw)

If you want the links tell me! :)

Bonus Points If Harry is the Master Of Death! I love that.


** linkffn(Rebirth by Athy), although linkffn(Again and Again) by Athy is more similar to His Twenty Eigth life if you're looking for something like that. I haven't read Dodging Prison or Time to Put Your Galleon, despite them being classics. Oh, and linkffn(Xerosis) if you haven't read that yet.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** Thank you so much! btw Time to put your galleon is an amazing fic, if you ever want to read it, anything by Tsume Yuki is Awesome.

I think I read Rebirth but I am not sure? It sounds really familiar, either way I am due for a re-read anyways.

I just started Xerosis, actually! So far so good.

Again and Again is on my reading list but i have never started it for some reason, i am just too scared of seeing dark Harry, and how that will ruin my mental image? i quite like Slytherin Harry, cunning and ambition is my thing. Nut is Harry on the verge of being not likeable? I mean like OOC? or is he just jaded?

**** honestly, it's been a while since I've read Again and Again. From what I remember, I'm pretty sure it's more Politician!Harry than Dark!Harry. The Harry in Xerosis is more dark than the one in Again and Again, so if that hasn't bothered you so far, you should be fine. The only thing that would make the Harry in Again and Again dark, I think, would be that he's anti-muggle. But there's not torture scenes or anything like that, as far as I remember.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

Wait, What. i don't think I understand.

Uh, correct me if I am wrong, but Harry will be an House elf? like physically? or Magically or like, Mentally?

this sounds /so amazing/, but i don't want to get excited then be disappointed.
