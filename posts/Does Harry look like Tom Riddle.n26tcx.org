Or is that only fanon?

I suppose Riddle wouldn't have green eyes, nor messy hair, but otherwise...

I've seen some fanarts where Harry's skin is kinda dark, and I can't see Tom looking similar.


** Kinda and Tom believes they do. In CoS he says "We even /look/ something alike."

** Yes and no? In CoS, Tom Riddle mentions, among other similarities that even look a bit alike. But it's not like they are clone of each other and even Tom talk less of their physical ressemblance than their mental one (smart, ambitious, a little disregard for rules . . .).

I think they only look alike because they are both attractive boy with a similar shade of hair. Someone looking for it may find some similarities between them, but it's not like they could be mistaken as brother or something like that.

As for Harry's skin color, a part of the fandom like to consider Harry of Indian descent (just like some think Hermione is Black). Rowling never clearly said that Harry was white, so I guess it's open to interpretation. I personally belive that Harry and Hermione are white (Rowling always specified it when a character was from a minority, which make me thinks than any character with an unspecified skin color is white), and even a bit pale at that, there can't be that much sun in Scotland.

** The Tumblr/AO3 side of the fandom thinks the series isn't diverse enough so they tend to convert harry to being Indian, which is why hes occasionally portrayed that way in tumblr-influenced fan art.

Horcrux Riddle in Chamber of Secrets does remark that there's remarkable similarities between the two of them, including that they even look a bit alike.

** I think it's mostly fanon.

I guess when they say they look alike, it probably means something like they've got the same hair color shade.

Young Tom Riddle's eyes were described as dark brown, which is very far from Harry's own green eyes.

I don't think they look that much alike, even their personalities are so different, don't believe what fanon tells you. ðŸ˜­

I still get confused what's fanon and what isn't. ðŸ’€

*** Sorry but where does it say Tom Riddle's eyes are described as dark brown? I don't remember that showing up in the books.

**** I think it was seen through the flashbacks in the CoS and HBP. He was described as tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. Here's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort#Outward_appearance][link]] to the wikipedia page that describes Voldemort's appearance.

And also in chapter 20 in the Half Blood Prince, his eyes were described as dark.

/Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes./

Anyway, even if it wasn't dark brown, it's still dark compared to Harry's green eyes. So either way, their eyes wouldn't have looked alike.

***** His eyes are described as dark which don't necessarily have to be brown. They could be any colour since this description could be a mere figure of speech.

****** Well, I don't know, we simply don't have enough information. Feel free to interpret it how you want to, literal or metaphorical. This [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort#Outward_appearance][link]] and this [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Tom_Marvolo_Riddle][one]] are both wikis that describe Tom Riddle's eye color as dark. I could send you 3 links that are also talking about this eye color topic but there's no definite confirmed answer.

JKR needs to end these discussions and give us a proper answer lmao. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
