:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I'm new to this subreddit so forgive me for formatting or if this is the wrong place to post this.

I am looking for a fic I read a long time ago where Harry becomes a 'dark' lord and tries to fix the problems in the magical world. I think he makes Ron and Hermione put him under a magical oath or something so they can stop him if he gets out of control.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
