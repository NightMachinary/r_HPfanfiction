** "Get together" fics set in Hogwarts. Any pairing really but I'm partial to RL/SB because it's angsty and usually so exciting and sweet when they realize the other person feels the same way. A perfect example is Very Bad Things by Freudian Fuckup. This author has a bunch of other awesome MWPP too.

  The Weasley twin's latest invention, a glitter-bomb that causes the name of your crush to appear across your forehead, wrecks havoc among the students of Hogwarts. As usual, Harry's the one who bears the brunt of it.Excerpt: Malfoy's eyes narrow and he comes to a stop, only a few paces from Harry. ‘I wouldn't expect you to understand,' he spits. ‘After all, your whole face is one big spell-gone-wrong, isn't it, scarhead?'Harry ignores the insult, opting to change the topic instead. ‘So, whose name is it then, Malfoy?' He asks, and as soon as the question is out Malfoy's eyes slide from his and a glorious red blush creeps up his neck. ‘Someone embarrassing, I bet. McGonagall? Madam Pomfrey? Your Father?' That last one might have been going a little too far, Harry thinks, but really, he just couldn't resist.He's never been able to resist when it comes to Malfoy.

** Usually I'll dig up some old favorites, fics whose emotional beats and authorial attitudes I already know. There are a couple of Snarry fics that are totally OOC that I turn to because they manage certain emotional twists or make me laugh or just have that slightly awesome "I wish I'd written this" quality despite their lack of canon-compliance. Or I'll rustle up one of Delphi's fics. She has a range of Snape characterization, all of which push my buttons, so it depends what kind of depression we're talking about. For example, if I need a vicarious experience of angry, caged-animal depression, I'll read her Snape of St. Brutal's series. That scary, poignant, fucked-up boy puts my problems in perspective. If I want a portrait of a wasted life and catharsis and second chances, I'll probably prefer Father to the Man. There's also an Aberforth/Minerva/Severus fic by a different writer whose wit and pragmatism lighten my heart.

For purposes of distraction, I often turn to the femslash writers in my circle, because I like hanging out with the older witches.

** I read fics that will help me have a good cry, as I find it helps to get the sadness out. Sometimes I will read things that reflect the bad things going on in my life too, as it helps me to process them. Yesterday it was fics based on Les Miserables, for obvious reasons (I'm Scottish).

/Revealed, Gently/ by Sarkysue is one of the first fics that come to mind when I think of feel-good snarry. I remember enjoying it alot, but it as it's been years since I last read it I'm not sure how it would hold up to current standards.

ETA: As for drarry, the first thing that came to mind was saras_girl's /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879841][On a Clear Day]]./ I /adore/ that fic.

/[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=11729][What To Do With Your Life A.H.K.B.C.B.]]/ by oldenuf2nb is another fun fave (also drarry).

**** The question was about what you read when you're depressed... I think his stories are highly mediocre and one dimensional, but still fluff you can for some reason connect with. They were also one of the first fics a kid who had grown up on Harry Potter and didn't want to let it end just yet, found. So that is why I sometimes go back. We all have embarrassing moments from our youth.

Having said that, I do come here for recommendations and have found some great things here, and well to each their own.

Linkffn(summer of independence by redfrog), linkffn(time to live py loralee1), linkffn(poison pen by genkaifan) and linkffn(redefining summer by loralee1) are favorites. Or the time travel fix-it fics like linkffn(three to backstep).

Although my favorite for all moods is [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond by Keira Marcos]], though that is still a fair amount of wish fulfillment and reasonably low-conflict (Voldemort is already dead, at any rate). Actually, almost anything by that author, including other fandoms, if I'm in a bad mood.
