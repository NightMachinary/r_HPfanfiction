Brits and all those well-versed in British English, what period-appropriate slang, words and expressions should we use to make a fic more authentic and what to avoid in HP fics?

Some things are more obvious than others, like using 'mate' and not 'dude', but apparently teens in the 90's were extremely unlikely to use the word 'chit', despite what fanfiction made me believe for a long time.


** Yeah, chit is really archaic...

Random stuff I remember from being a British 90s kid:

Wicked= Good

Leg it= Run away

Slag= Slut

Snog= Kiss

Fit= Hot

Manky= Horrible

Minger= Ugly

Looks like you've been Tangoed= Bad fake tan (probably not particularly useful for HP fic lol, also comes from a Tango Advert, so not for wizard kids)

*** Fit is a HUGE one if you are writing any cutesy romance set in the 90s with teenagers.

Minger! Yes!

You've got them all queen, love it

** I can believe that people who write with quills would use archaic slang.

** some of this may be regional, i've weeded out some of my northern irish but my west country can be harder to tell. If some are still in use, I blame age.

​

rank = gross

all over the road = a real mess

decent = good looking

well good = very good

keener = geek, swot, someone who studies a lot or is liked by teachers

skive = to skip i.e. skiving off school for skipping school

minge = girls genitalia sometimes also an insult i.e. being a right minge

lush = good

tight = being less than generous with something such as money or ciggies, being a twat to someone

div = idiot

jammy = cheeky, getting away with something, lucky

chuffed = very happy, pleased

Faff = not really doing anything is to faff about

lurgy = unidentified illness, i.e. he's got the lurgy don't get too close

shirty = moody

cracking = awesome

cheers = thank you, now mostly heard around here when people are getting off the bus

gobby = mouthy, cheek, also usable in terms of 'gob' as mouth (shut your gob) or spitting (getting gobbed on/gobbng on someone)

​

I could go on but I recommend looking up local slang for where they're from, good bit of language diversity in it and they change less frequently.

**** I was a teenager in the late 90's so some of them, yes, probably. It is a little difficult to differentiate between the late 90's and early 2000's. Some of them are also used today and others go back to the 60's and 70's but maintained or regained popularity. Probably dependent more on region, age and social circle.

** The thing is that the Wizarding World is cut-off enough to have its own expressions and slang (i.e. “Merlin's beard! A mudblood!”). When any Muggle culture trickles down into the Wizarding World, it does so with a few decades' lateness, so if you want to include a few Muggle swears and coinages in the mouth of anyone but a Muggle-born, then they should be /1950's/ British slang --- 70's at the latest.

*** It's true for purebloods, but muggleborns and mugge-raised halfblood would have more up-to-date slang, at least until they are assimilated. I guess it would be interesting to see the subtle linguistic clash explored in some fic. Or not subtle. I remember this one crack fic where Harry was a chav and nobody could understand him.

Anyway, I didn't mean only 90's swears necessarily, more like particularly British turns of phrase to spice up the fic here and there that wouldn't feel out of place. And personally, I wouldn't be comfortable using 50's slang without a Britpicker (and I don't even have a beta!), because the possibility of me mangling it up is much much higher.

**** I agree that muggleborns and those with some foot in the muggle world would bring those phrases in... I sometimes think that there is a lack of muggle influence in the books because it needs to have a strict setting but in reality there could be more influence from the outside.

​

Like... wouldn't it be cool and flashy to know the slang of muggles?

** Listen to Parklife by Blur from 1994. A very british album and a fantastically well known one. Might give an insight into British culture at the time. At least around London.

*** I could see Snape with his "dunderhead" using it, it's about that level of old-fashioned, but I'm not sure if he uses gendered insults often or at all.
