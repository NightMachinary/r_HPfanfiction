Whether they thought they would be placed into a different house, or unsure of which trait of theirs is the strongest, they either didn't consider Slytherin at all or outright feared being sorted into the house due to its reputation. Perhaps they end up being a good example of the positive ideals behind Slytherin.

I find this subject a fascinating one, but not familiar enough with the FF scene to be aware of any that may have written on this.
