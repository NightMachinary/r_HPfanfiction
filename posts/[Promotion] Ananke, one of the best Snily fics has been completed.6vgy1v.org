Linkffn(4400517). This fic is special for me. I discovered it a few years ago, long before this reddit acount, just when I began reading fanfiction a long time ago. It was not even at the half of the story and I fell in love with it.

But then I lost it , couldn't find it anymore and I moved on, yet it never left me, the premise "Lily travels to the dystopia know as 1997 and finds Snape and together they try to make her go back". I found it again a few months ago when I became an active member of this sub and to my joy it was still being updated. Today it has ended.

Perhaps one of the most believable and in-character yet it avoids the usual tropes (for example Snape did in fact fuck around a lot and he isn't the typical 40years old virgin). I know many of you are opposed to snily some even by principle ("that git is evil why should he be happy") but if you are open minded to read it, you might be pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance.


** I thought the characterizations got progressively worse. Both Dumbledore and James were decently characterized in the beginning, but it fell off a cliff somewhere in the middle. I think I dropped it soon after Lily pretended to be a seer.

*** In defense of the 'seer' Lily, it's not like she would say that She was in the future for a while. 1) no one would believe her 2) that Knowledge is dangerous.

[[/spoiler][The asshole James didn't bother me a lot. I don't really like him and wouldn't blame him for being hateful "the girl who I thought I was gonna marry leaves me for FUCKING SNIVELUS". And IMHO the dumbledore is also likely, the war has beeing going for years, One death and the suffering of an spy is an adequate price to pay... For the Greater Good^{TM} don't you think?]]

** So I finished this. I've also been reading this for a long time. It started out great and the premise is fantastic however I think it lost the plot a bit halfway, [[/spoiler][when she comes back to her present and it lost it even more after the author came back from her hiatus. Young Snape also wasn't as interesting as older Snape and the ending was a bit lack-lustre in my opinion]]. The latter half also is heavy with the James and especially Dumbledore bashing.

The being said, it really is one of the better Snape/Lily fanfiction. The circumstances for Snape and Lily falling in love is convincing and it subverts a lot of cliches usually found in Snily. I think the strength is in the characterization of Snape and Lily, neither of whom are romanticized and are quite flawed.

The romance is steady and well-paced and I love, LOVE Lily in this. She's only 19 at the start and her teenage girl voice is bratty and endearing. There were a few times when she actually reminded me of Harry. The author describes this as a coming-of-age story for Lily and I quite agree; this is really more of Lily's story than Snape's and her evolution throughout the fic is portrayed well. I think the first half of the fic is undoubtedly better than the latter but it's still one of the best Snape/Lily fics. Laventadorn's Come Once Again And Love Me will always be my favourite Snape/Lily but this one is pretty special. I'd recommend it if you like the pairing.

*** That's another great snily. It's probably even better than my dear Ananke. Have you read the other fics from that author? They're about a Snape/Lupin and a femHarry/snape. In general those tropes are avoided by me on principle, yet if someone could made them believable would be Laventadorm. Have you read them? Are they. Good?

**** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) is absolutely amazing, it's my favorite fem Harry fic by far. I just love the way Harriet is characterized. You can still recognize Harry's personality in her, but it's also a bit subdued and feminized in a realistic way. Snapes characterizarion is also very good.

I know the description says it's future Snape Harriet pairing, but it's completely gen at the moment (and that is impressive considering how many words are already written) with no creepy or any romantic interest from Snape like you would think this fic would have. On Harriets end, the romance part is mostly a teenage crush that she kind of has to forget about for a while as Snape finds out about it and gets pissed off at her and starts avoiding her.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

**** The Never-ending Road is literally something I reread every week. It is so good. To be honest, there isn't any romance in it. It is frustratingly slow and you could basically read it as gen. The characterizations of Snape and Harry are amazing. Fem!Harry is so easy to get wrong but Harriet has enough of Harry's traits to still be considered Harry but she's also softer and more empathetic. I love Laventadorn's Snape. His internal monologues are priceless and he's one of my favourite Snapes to read about. The sequel, No Journey's End is starting to have some romantic tension. Anyway, I highly, highly recommend TNER.

Mount Unto The Stars- I really liked it but it's really slow paced. It's also primarily a mystery so it takes a while for anything to happen. It's quite different from TNER and COAALM in that it's a little sad, melancholic and you might find it boring. It's got a different tone from her other work but if you don't mind slash, you could try it.

I found out on Tumblr that Laventadorn actually started and wrote around 70,000 words of another Snily fic but didn't post it because Lily from Come Once Again And Love Me got such negative reactions. It's really annoying. Like, why read a pairing if you hate one half of it so much? You're only going to discourage the author . -.-

****** Indeed. It's quite good. If you want an active and well written snily both of you should read linkffn(12369512) its as good as come once again and love me. Snape returns to his sixth year and will try to change everything. The twist is that he won't try to woo Lily, if she's alive he'd be happy even if she's with Potter. life unfortunately disagrees in that. [[/u/orangedarkchocolate]]

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
