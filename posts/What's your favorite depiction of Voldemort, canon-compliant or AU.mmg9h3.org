I've been reading fics by local_doom_void recently and I'm a little in love with their very AU takes on Voldemort - all their stories have a slightly different flavor, but they generally cast him as an old, cranky misanthrope who doesn't quite understand human empathy/morality but who, now that he's resurrected, finds the idea of restarting the war to be exhausting and entirely too much effort when he could, instead, /not/ bother managing a bunch of people (ie Death Eaters) and just do whatever he wants by himself because he's got the power and resources?

This got me thinking about all the different ways I've seen Voldemort portrayed, so now I'd like examples from the community about what your favorite canon and/or AU depictions of Voldemort are!


** You've already seen local_doom_void and have a rec for eldritcher, which are great, so I'll throw in my faves for more old, ugly, tired, introspective Voldemort. It's sort of my favorite genre.

Metalomagnetic writes a fantastic Voldemort in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]], a popular fic here, but also check out their canon-reimagined [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30537870][Bellamort]] just posted today. One of two Delphini origin stories I can stomach as a positive thing. (The other being Eldritcher's in the Pandemic series)

There's this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24174838/chapters/58222408][mixed-media story]] by Leu about Tom as a student that totally captures his dynamic in the classroom---I say this as an instructor. It's a perfect encapsulation of why he‚Äòd be so obnoxious to teach, but also why he needed encouragement and empathy, not dismissal. Perhaps I should specify that this one makes me /feel/ old.

This [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22496587/chapters/53755393][one-chapter fic]] by handschuhmaus knocks me flat with its discussion of Voldemort's feelings about his mother and mental health

limeta writes a delightfully-absurd Voldemort in more fics than you can shake a stick at, but I'll put up their take on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24337414][Tom Riddle Sr.]] as a short introduction into why you should consider sorting through their author page to find what calls out to you.

kitsunerei88's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27053737][blessed]] is a gorgeous take on Severus Snape that includes the most compelling Tom-as-cult-leader depiction I've seen.

And okayantigone wrote a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26500750][one-shot]] that lets Voldemort have peace, and the final word against Dumbledore, in his death.

Finally, if I may put in a self-rec to close this out, practically all I do is write Voldemort. My latest fic involves him being a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30208026/chapters/74434125][retired, and a father]] (to Harry!), and I adore him.

*** As well I'd like to add Either must die at the hand of the either by Metalomagnetic (might as well complete the set of the their fics). linkao3(29356095)

It's one of my favourite Voldemort fics at the moment because you see such a different side of Voldemort where he's helpless yet at the same time, he's not. He's forced to recognize Harry's kindness at times and it's so interesting and beautifully written because Voldemort isn't necessarily an asshole, but he's not nice. He's exactly what you expect him to be (manipulative, lying, smug) because that's who he is, but he's also had everything taken from him so he can't be all that but he still is. I DONT KNOW how to explain it. Basically it's a really good depiction of in-character Voldemort but in a really out of character situation for him.

** This one has been a revelation to me after reading dozens Tomarry fics where it's all ‚Äúpoor Tom got bullied and was scared of the bombs and Dumbledore just judged him unfairly and that's why he got evil‚Äù (a trope that does have its merits if done well): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681]] A Dangerous Game by Cybrid We see mostly Diary!Tom but also some Voldemort.

** Canon shows Voldemort as an insane madman , but also shows how he was once a charismatic young man named Tom Riddle.

Canon is probably my second favorite Voldemort but my first favorite hands down is a Voldemort who is charismatic even with his Horcruxes and actually does something. In canon Voldemort does about 1 raid a day, he has so much other free time he could potentially use somewhere else. I enjoy fics where it is shown Voldemort recruits and actually teaches his followers rather than torturing them.

  ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù Professor Quirrell said in a voice so quiet it almost wasn't there, ‚Äúwhen this flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether there might be some other place, far away, where I should have been. I cannot seem to imagine what that place might be, and if I can't even imagine it then how can I believe it exists? And yet the universe is so very, very wide, and perhaps it might exist anyway? But the stars are so very, very far away. It would take a long, long time to get there, even if I knew the way. And I wonder what I would dream about, if I slept for a long, long time...‚Äù

Those are some motivations for a Voldemort that I can understand, and still be scared of!

***** Some parts of that fic made me really angry, but so far I've never found another with its scope and ambition. Both in terms of story, and perhaps also in terms of rewriting/deepening the world. I think some people really /do/ want more Harry Potter from reading fanfic, and others are just interested in seeing what crazy directions authors can spin take things in. I'm in the second category - I find fanon tropes and reinventions pretty interesting. Meanwhile, I can't imagine wanting to read fanfic for something like LotR which seems perfect as is. I like HP fanfiction so much because Rowling's world, heavy on details but light on coherence, feels like a sandbox.

I have the impression that "I like HPMoR" is still a bit of a controversial statement in HP fandom; am I right?

****** On this Reddit? Yes, very much so in my experience. I honestly really liked it, despite it obviously being written with HP as a convenient vessel for the author to explore his true passion of Rationality. Basically the opposite of most writers, which is probably where the hate comes from. Readers are looking for HP love and exploration
