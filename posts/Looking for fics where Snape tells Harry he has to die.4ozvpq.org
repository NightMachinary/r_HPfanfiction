I'm looking for any fics where Snape is not killed by Nagini, and so instead of giving Harry his memories he finds Harry to tell him the truth in person.


** I've read a fic in which Snape sends Harry a patronus with the information that he has to die. This worked because Harry obviously would recognize and trust the Silver Doe. linkffn(Miles to Go Before I Sleep by Rannaro)

When I reread DH, I wonder how Snape possibly thinks Harry will actually go to him and talk to him. But then again it was ridiculous for Dumbledore to expect Snape, who Harry hated, to successfully give him the crucial information

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

** Haven't run into that before - but I can't really see Harry believing him.

*** That's the point! Before Snape was killed, he asked Voldemort several times to let him find Harry, he actually looked desperate to find him. So I guess his original plan was to tell him everything himself, probably in Dumbledore's office so that his portrait could confirm his words.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
