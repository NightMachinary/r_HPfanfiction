****** It really was an amazing story about a genius old man explain just how smart he was and how... Unsmart Harry was in that situation. It was also very blatantly calling the writers idiots for this.

It reminds me of a psuedo quote. "If the author could write a character smart enough to take over the world, then the author would have taken over the world."

***** It was actually kind of badass. Maybe I just hate Indy!Harry stories, but Dumbledore just casually laying the verbal beat down on Harry was satisfying!
