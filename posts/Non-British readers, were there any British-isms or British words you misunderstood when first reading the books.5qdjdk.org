Or things the characters referred to that you were confused by or unfamiliar with.

I know some things don't always translate so well across cultures and its funny, as a reader in the UK, seeing what non-British fanfic writers put in their stories sometimes - maybe based on canon or what they imagined was going on in canon.

****** I think I'm pretty accurate in describing pudding as "a cheap kid's snack" or "retiree's snack," (something that is served in an "old folks home" because dentures and pudding requires no chewing) but I'm not sure if I speak for all Americans. I suppose recipes exist out there for pudding that is quite delicious, but I've only ever seen it served in [[https://www.walmart.com/ip/35505487?wmlspartner=wlpa&adid=22222222227023607941&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40891657952&wl4=pla-78821611352&wl5=9031326&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=35505487&wl13=&veh=sem][Snack Packs]].

Turkish delight is traditionally a small, flavoured cube of a firm jelly, usually flavoured with rosewater so it's quite perfume like in smell and taste. It is covered in powdered sugar, although I briefly worked in a traditional sweet shop and we also sold chocolate coated Turkish delight.

At first I was thinking it was cuddling or generally rubbing his face against it like a cat. Kiss seemed too tame for the reference and I think there was another reference that made it seem more lustful than just a kiss. Then I wondered if it was a polite way to refer to 'dry-humping'.

I couldn't for the life of poor 8 year old me understand how Harry interpreted that weird speech as Dumbledore being angry! I even checked the dictionary in case nitwit, oddment, blubber or tweak were curse words or something. I distinctly remember being so frustrated, I asked my parents, who gave unsatisfactory answers. It was only when I re-read years later that I realized "mad" could also mean "crazy." Oops!

On that point that's something I think loses nuance in fanfics. Are US readers aware of the class coding? Or does it blend into a mass of 'British?' For example Hermione is strongly coded as higher-class than Ron, which adds a level of irony to his familiarity with the wizarding world and her comparative unfamiliarity that she has trouble using pure book-knowledge to move past.

****** There probably is a strong element of class in that. Hermione is very /liberal middle class/. My head canon is that she comes from Oxford or one of the posh towns nearby like Witney or Abingdon. Her parents met at university and faithfully vote Lib-Dem despite living in a Tory heartland. They have friends and relatives who are academics, and who encouraged Hermione from a young age to aspire to going to Oxford herself; which would have happened if her genetics hadn't intervened.

To me though, the Weasley's don't come across as being lower-class than the Grangers. Less money for sure but class isn't about money. They seem to be a wizarding version of the /genteel poverty/ stereotype, this is - centuries of history, a huge rickety house that's freezing cold as they can't afford to heat it, with all activity centring around a massive, but disorganized, kitchen that smells of wet dogs and is dominated by a 60-year-old Aga.

*** That's so interesting! I love this kind of thing. I'm lucky enough to be able to read some other languages and in translation you lose meaning sometimes, even with a good translation.

EDIT: Yes, while reading it, that's one difference between the British and American editions of the books. Black characters are described by skin colour in the American editions, and aren't in the British editions. As that article points out,

#+begin_quote
  " This addition reflects this educational value of multiculturalism and conveys a positive message on equal opportunities as Dean is accepted into Gryffindor, the best (and Harry's) house of the school. It protects American children from the potential harm caused by the invisibility of a Black character who is never defined by his race in the original and whose name does not appear until Chapter 9.

  Anybody who has read both the American and British versions of 'Philosopher's Stone' will notice that Dean Thomas's appearance is not mentioned in the British book, whereas in the American one there is a line describing him (in the chapter 'The Sorting Hat'). *This was an editorial cut in the British version; my editor thought that chapter was too long and pruned everything that he thought was surplus to requirements.*

I've read a lot of fanfics by British authors, and so I've a better handle on British slang than many of my countrymen, and it's amusing seeing something and realizing that the author is American and not using a word correctly (I remember seeing a story where an OC was named Anita Quim. It was changed pretty shortly after the original post.).

The only other thing that's really happened due to reading the books (and fanfiction) so often is that I often alternate between American and British spellings. Pissed off more than a few teachers when I would spell one word a certain way (behavior) and then a different way in the next paragraph (behaviour).

Depending on the school one may also have to attend classes on Saturday, either for half a school day or for a full one. Also, the longest non-summer-vacation free from school period (“Golden Week”) starts about a month into the first trimester (the April one, that is) for which reason despite being free time it's treated as a part of the term which is why the students are positively buried in homework.
