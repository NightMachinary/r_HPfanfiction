I'm looking for fics where in Harry isn't entered into the Triwizard Tournament. This can be for any number of reasons (I'm fairly open) such as the Goblet refuses him entry, or he has a different name than the one submitted to the Goblet, or anything really.

I'm not a massive fan of slash but if the story is good enough I may be willing to overlook it. Other than that I'm pretty open. The thought just came to my mind while writing my own fic.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Linkffn(Magical Relations) has just the three canon champions sans Harry. Crouch doesn't end up impersonating Moody,so he can't influence the goblet. Honestly, Voldy's plan to get Harry in that fic makes way more sense.
