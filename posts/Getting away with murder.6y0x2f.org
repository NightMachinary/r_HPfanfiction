Lf a fic with a protagonist who is actually cunning and gets away with crossing lines (doesnt have to be murder, but some violence is never a bad thing)

There's this one shot I read a while ago where Harry is getting interrogated with veritaserum for the murder of Nott(?) and the twist at the end is that he's been obliviating himself every time he off another death eater or something. If you can find that it would be perfect for what you're looking for.

  Been a while since I read it but from what I remember there's some real creativity to get Voldemort and Harry through the French Border. There's some other stuff too but I don't really remember much of it. Hopefully it's what you're looking for.

  Again, been a while since I read this one but he gets away with /a lot/ here. Neville and Harry's roles are reversed. Neville isn't a spoiled little shit and Harry's single-minded focus on healing his parents is a little disturbing.

** Linkffn(too young to die) Great story, although it may not seem like it in the beginning. Harry is as amoral as they come but I wouldn't exactly call him cunning or even smart. He makes lots of stupid, childish decisions(well, he is a child). Actually the fact that the character is flawed is what made me like the fic. He gets away with a lot of stuff.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
