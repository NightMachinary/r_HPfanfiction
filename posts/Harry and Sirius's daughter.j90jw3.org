Any good fics with a romance between Harry and a daughter of Sirius? Would prefer there to be no Weasley bashing of possible, would especially love it if Ron is also actually included as a character and not just shoved out of sight.

** Oh God now I have this image of Sirius as the stereotypical sitcom dad. Harry and Sirius' daughter come home from a date just to find Sirius sitting there with his wand pointed at Harry. "So, what are your intentions toward my daughter? And don't play dumb, I knew your father."

**** "Ok your all set for your date don't do anything I wouldn't do." Sirius proceeds to hand Harry a box of condoms and Estella a contraceptive potion.

"DAD!" "Sirius!" they yell in unison causing him to chuckle

"Ok ok fine, none of that then," he took them back and smiled "I want Grandgodchildrenchildren anyway"

the two teens looked at each other with red faces before taking the offered contraceptives and leaving. Sirius' cackling laughter following behind them.

** Maybe Sirius doesn't know he has a daughter. She was raised by her mother while Sirius was in prison, and he only finds out about her once he's out of Azkaban. Meanwhile, Harry and the daughter have been dating at Hogwarts and getting frisky.

  Harry has always been good at languages. Like REALLY good at languages. He realised that when he learnt sparrow. Its fourth year, and GWL Iris potter's life is messed up. So when a multilingual young man, Ambassador Peverell enters her life, she isn't ready for the questions he brings. Why does he seem to hate the Potters? Who is that spirit, Isis? A WBWL tale with a unique spin.

** There is a recent ongoing that reverses this idea. Sirius' son meets a fem!Harry, and they are close by the time they go to Hogwarts.

The son, of course, is a reincarnated Tim Drake, or Robin from the Batman comics. But that just makes it a bit more interesting.

**** yeah they're an acquired taste for sure. I like â€˜reverse' harems better, but it's still only a particular mood I get once in a while.

I've been writing a bisexual harem, because there aren't any, and I thought it was an interesting challenge. it is honestly so hard to make them interesting.

I find that most people don't pull them off, even if that is what you want to read, so I don't blame anyone for not being into them
