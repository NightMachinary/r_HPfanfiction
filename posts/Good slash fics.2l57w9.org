I've occasionally been told that I'm missing out on lots of good fics by excluding slash. So, give me your best slash fic recommendations!

That is, fics which:

- Have a high standard of technical writing.
- Have a gripping plot to which any romance is secondary.
- Has characters acting and sounding like their canon selves.
- Maintains a mostly canonical magical world (eg no absurd Dursley abuse, no good Voldemort).
- No bashing.
- No angst, hurt-comfort or emotional melodrama in general.
- Harry centric.
- Progressive character development that makes sense with no sudden changes in characterisation (including Harry's realisation that he's gay)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1265079/Lomonaaeren][Check out Lomonaaeren]]

Browse through her work, she does mostly Harry/Draco and her writing is very clean. As for themes, depends on the fic... she has 328, the great majority of which are finished, and she varies from fluff because why no to deeply psychological stories. She also updates extremely regularly, though she has some fics that have stalled out she does address them in her bio. The major advantage to her writing besides how clean it is is that they all tend to be believable even if you don't find the pairing believable. She also has a couple of other pairings she has done (notably one Ginny/Luna). I promise you will find SOMETHING. This woman made me think cannibalism was completely reasonable in one fic and made me giggle madly in others.

I'm a fan of angst, so take the next two with a grain of salt if you wish:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/v_g_marks/OW.html][Oscillate Wildly]] is amazing. "After a particularly gruelling Occlumency session, Harry practically comes apart at the seams and finds himself living partway between two lives. One is his life at Hogwarts. In the other, he's been in a mental institution for the better part of six years. What happens when Harry realizes his whole life may be one elaborate fantasy? Harry/Draco, Partially AU" I read it a long time ago and just corrected a spelling error in the summary, but it is one that has really stuck with me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1318020/1/][Faith]] has an amazing plot *IF* you can slog through the first couple of chapters. I went to reread and the beginning hurt so bad, the first time I read it I was younger. But it DOES improve dramatically as far as the writing goes and it is another one that has haunted me. /I am honestly not positive of the quality/ anymore, but it pulls in Celtic mythology in a really beautiful way.

Hit me up if you want more Harry/Draco. That is really my ship and I am always reading more.

Though they might fail your 'romance secondary' requirement.

** Doesn't exactly fit all your criteria, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] by Athey is spectacular. One of my favorites.

** You might like (all Drarry):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1360492/1/][Eclipse]]

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]]

Even though it doesn't fit your criteria 100%, I also have to recommend [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]]. It has some "angst, hurt-comfort or emotional melodrama" but it was an excellent story.

** I read a lot of Drarry, so here's a few well written ones I read over and over. They may not meet all of your specs but they're really well done so i hope you give them a chance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985741/1/The-Descent-of-Magic][The Decent of Magic]], [[http://thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=16931][When it Alteration Finds]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]]. Also, I know you aren't looking for angst or h/c, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9471590/1/Kiss-the-Joy-Until-the-Sun-Rise][Kiss the Joy Until the Sun Rise]] meets your other standards. I don't like angst, but this story is so well done and I read it often.

** Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo

This is the best slash fic I've ever read. It's not on fanfiction.net, but it's still easily found with Google. Harry/Cedric

A Life More Ordinary by obsidianembrace

Also incredibly well written. Remus/Sirius but Harry is the main character
