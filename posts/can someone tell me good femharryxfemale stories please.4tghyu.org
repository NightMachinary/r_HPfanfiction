  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

** linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize), and its sequels is Jasmine/Hermione

linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by slygoddess) is Harriet/Ginny

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by the MadMadReviewer) - Jamie/Tonks

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) and sequels are Jen/Luna, though it takes a while to come about [[/spoiler][and doesn't look too likely to last much longer]]

Also, and I thank [[/u/oops_i_made_a_typi]] for mentioning it, my stories are primarily Holly/witches, though with prominent exceptions [[/spoiler][Harry in Holly Polter; Neville and several non-consensual encounters in Holly Evans]]

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Effects and Side Effects is about a Harry turned Fem!Harry, who is still a male in his mind, and likes females. Its a multi though (not sure if you care), but quite interesting and I highly recommend it. Not finished though, but also not abandoned (according to the author).
