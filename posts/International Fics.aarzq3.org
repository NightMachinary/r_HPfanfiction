Looking for recommendations for fics that have Wizarding Britain getting international help to form a military coalition (maybe via the ICW, maybe through muggle contacts). Alternatively, working together with several other magical species (though ideally not just with the goblins and elves, which are rather cliche at this point).

Something similar to Sunset/Sunrise over Britain by Bobmin or to the Zaxarus trilogy is what I'm thinking. The longer the better!


** linkffn(9401569) Admittedly, very unfinished, but what is there is pretty cool.

  A new threat enters the game and Harry finds himself surrounded and chased by all sides. The Order is scattered and Harry is on the run. He must rally all his wits to survive. Without the support Harry once relied on, he must find in himself the temper to fight back, alone if need be. Attempting an international thriller. Slow start. Eventually Harry/Fleur

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  Gabrielle writes a letter to Harry. Changes occur. Xeno saves the country. Massively AU, contains numerous memos. One-shot.
