I was just thinking. Most HP fanfiction I read seem to at least nominally be based on the books, but many of them are at least heavily influenced by the movies, or they incorporate aspects of the movieverse... for example, Hermione tends to be Movie-Hermione more often than Book-Hermione...but I was wondering. With the many minor and major differences between book-verse and mivie-verse, are there any fanfics that treat them as two separate alternate universes, and maybe have characters from one meet or cross over with characters from the other?

Or is that a stupid idea?


** All of the Marauders plus Snape: "Why are the movie characters twenty years older than us???"

Yeah, Tonks and Remus are supposed to have a thirteen year age difference, not twenty-one, as it was for the actors. Don't get me started on Alan Rickman (too old, not sallow and greasy enough, not angry and biting enough).

Book Snape: "You are playing me all wrong!!!"

Movie Snape: *drawls* "I don't know /what/ you are talking about..."

Book Snape: *screams*

Granted, I know a lot of people have made Alan Rickman into their Book Snape, so I'm probably alone on that one.

Anyway, I think if you dug into it, you could make that a very interesting fic. If no one has done it yet, or if you're not doing it, maybe I will...

*** I actually think Alan Rickman made for a really good Snape... it wasn't the same Snape as in the books, it was a much colder and subdued Snape, which actually made him more intimidating in several cases.

Still.... Book-Marauders and Snape meet Movie-Marauders and Snape could definitely be interesting.

You are not alone! I love Alan Rickman in everything else i've seen him in, but he is just NOT Snape. And even disregarding differences in portrayal, movie!Snape being that much older just doesn't make any sense. Do the movies imply that he had been a Death Eater for 20 years doing who knows what before turning to the good side?

"You stupid jerk! You actually insulted Hermione along with Snape instead of defending her!"

** It could be interesting, though you would have to really emphasize the differences, perhaps to caricatural levels, for the crossover to be of much interest. There are differences to be sure, but they tend to be fairly minor; I think the general philosophy of fans is to take the movies to be alternate, somewhat more fanciful accounts of the same events as the books, like two history books chronicling the same event, if you will. So this allows you to keep the books as the "main" canon, but borrow from the movies' additions as needed.

** It's my headcanon that the movies are very well researched movie adaptations of the historical events depicted in the books, created maybe a century after the end of the war. Because wizards will assimilate cinema in some form eventually, obviously.

A lot of people were very embarrassed when they came out.

*** So "book characters watch the movies" fic instead of the classic "book characters read the books" fic? Could work, long as it was kept light and not ALL "I/he/she would never say that!"

**** You know, I never actually thought of it that way. In the few "characters read the books" fics I've read, the books in question were always kind of prescient, describing future events that hadn't happened to the characters yet. Is that not normally how it goes? I might have to revisit this genre.

This would be more like in-universe historical RPF.

***** It would have to be done right though. A common flaw in "characters read the books" fics is having somebody make a snarky comment every other line, including during scenes where it is /absolutely not appropriate/- for example, having somebody make a sarcastic joke during the Graveyard scene. This usually happens because there is no plot to the story, just reaction shots of the characters during various scenes. It feels incredibly hollow.

Another flaw is making characters overreact for dramatic effect- for example, another common flaw is having Sirius screaming and borderline frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog when the Dursleys treatment of Harry comes to like. Yes, canon Sirius would be pissed, but canon Sirius would be more likely to pressure Dumbledore to let Harry live with Sirius instead of apparating off to murder the Dursleys.

The genre has a lot of potential if done right, but it needs to have realistic character responses and an overarching plot, which are things almost every single one I've seen lack.

****** Â¨That's a very good point. Or several very good points. Too many "characters read the books" fics are just excuses tor the author's fave characters telling the characters the author hates how much they suck... and the reactions tend to be extremely predictable after a while.

If it's a "book characters watch the movies" fic, that could be different though, since what the characters watch isn't exactly what happened in their lives... it's just some film director's interpretation of it, at least as far as they know. So I think at least that they would have more of a distance to the story as it unfolds, so I can see there being a bit of snark even at inapproptiate scenes... especially if Ron is one of the people watching.

Mmm... probably also a good idea to limit the number of characters watching... a lot of those fics have ALL the characters join in, or the entire school, or the entire Order, but that gets very muddled very fast because there are too many chars.Say we have an adult Harry, Ron and Hermione doing the watching of the movies, with perhaps a different guest character joining in for eavch movie.

I actually kind of want to write this now. :)
