So many stories that have Harry in a different house, tend to have him still be friends with either Ron and Hermione or with Draco; and I'm tired of it. I want him friends with different people. What if he's sorted into Ravenclaw and is friends with a Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw? What if he's friends with Muggleborns? What if they stray away from the trio and only have one friend, or four friends, et cetra?

What if he's sorted in Hufflepuff and becomes friends with a Ravenclaw and Gryffindor or something? What if he's friends with older students, instead of students his own age? What if he's friends with just Muggleborns and struggles with fitting into the Wizarding World, or is friends with just Purebloods/Halfbloods?

There's different things that they could do, but so often his go to friends seem to be Hermione and Ron or Draco. And I don't mind them, but I would like a variety when he's sorted into a different house.

Him being friends with a student that also has a rough childhood and can see that Harry's being mistreated, how different would that make things? Or just a variety of things that could happen.

Very little to no bashing, please, as I tend to not be able to stand bashing stories.
