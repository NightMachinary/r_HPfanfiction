Im looking for ones where Harry starts his own life. I don't mind what age he is or if any of the characters get bashed or if he is straight, bi or gay.


** I kind like this theme a lot. Here is my list:

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243): AU year 6, Voldemort forced Wizengamot to pass a marriage law with the goal to screw over Hermione and Harry, and AD sold Hermione out.

*Finding a Place to Call Home*, linkffn(9885609): one of the few, good Harry/Astoria fics

*My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(6160345): powerful Harry/Ginny left Hogwarts and took the war to Death Eaters directly

*Nobody's Hero*, linkffn(7806752): very fluffy Harry/Ginny runaway fic. First chapter required a little SOD, but otherwise quite nice.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): I'm not sure it qualifies as 'Harry running away', but definitely he meant 'go **** yourself, AD!'

*The Opposing Movement*, linkffn(12005632): new fic by [[/u/BigFatNo]], featuring Harry, Ginny, and Sirius on the run

*The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511): cute one-shot about Harry leaving magical world after the war and Hermione finally finding him after many years

*What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix*, linkffn(5265558): Harry didn't wait for the hearing, but fled immediately after being warned by the Ministry.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** Does anyone know the name of the fic where Harry leaves for America after the Dementor attack and winds up becoming an architect after visiting the ICW headquarters?

It includes:

- American Ministry
- Blowing up magical weapons held in the Department of Mysteries
- Polyjuicing as Dumbledore to get him kicked out as Supreme Mugwump.
- Charmed letters to show who's "been loyal" or who's passed their letter around to others.
- Interviews with reporters in other countries so they can't track him back home.
- Sirius gets asylum in America; lives there with Harry.
- ICW meeting room is basically a holodeck/Room of Requirement.

  My odd ideas file. Little snippets that don't quite merit their own stories. Some funny; some less so.

** Why is nobody mentioning linkffn(make a wish)

Harry does run away so that he might live at least a little before he dies. It's a crack fic to an extent, but it is still good.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
