Looking for stories centering around the lives of the founders. Preferably from their POVs, but I will take some time travel AUs if I have to. I really like the idea of someone doing a Founders era fic the way they do a lot of marauders era fics, with the fleshing out of the four founders as friends and enemies and heads of house.


** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I) should be exactly what you're looking for!

** In linkffn(Basiliskborn), Harry is sent back to Merlin's time and becomes Salazar Slytherin. He is unable to age until he gets back to 1995, so he travels the world, and eventually founds Hogwarts. However, most of the fic doesn't take place during the Founders' Era, so it's probably not what you're looking for.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
