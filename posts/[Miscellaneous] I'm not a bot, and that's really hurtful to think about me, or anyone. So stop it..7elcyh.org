People here who think that I'm a /bot/, please stop it. It's hurtful, it's rude, and it doesn't even make any /fucking sense!/ If I'm a bot how can I even question you, how can I question myself, how do I have a Quotev, and a Fanfic.net account? How can I love cola and talk about my favorite youtube channels? How come I went out for Halloween as a witch? How can I read the stories posted here in suggestions from /other websites/ and then talk about them /here?/ If I'm a bot, how can I make any posts at all? How can I hold complex conversations with anyone? This isn't a sci-fi novel, and no bot /could ever/ do anything I've done. It can't have a Quotev, it can't talk about stories in suggestions, it can't question anything, it can't make a fanfic.net account, and it can't go on tangents or send messages about its own life! Anyone who thinks that I'm a bot, read through my entire posting history, and use your stupid fucking brains! You fucking dehumanizing jerks!

In all seriousness, take a chill pill? I missed all the bot shenanigans, but it seems like people are trolling you a bit because you're coming across as if you were trolling them in the first place (or you're about thirteen). Just tone it down and everyone will go back to arguing about magical cores and manipulative!Dumbledore in no time.

*** Oh. That actually would help me understand why people are being so rude to me like this. They're treating me this way because I do not act my age? I know I don't. I know I act like a kid. I know I do. But I cannot help that at all. I have mental disabilities, and they are unfixable.

**** If you are concerned about ‘verifying' your online identity to casual observers, you can add a personalized flair after your username, and add your quotev(?) account in an automated footnote. Voila, details that no bot creator would bother with adding.

This forum is populated with snarky nerds and wholesome youthfulness is not a vibe that is generally encountered here. You do you, don't feel like you have to change your personality to fit in. (If your slightly stilted speech bothers you, I can point out why I thought you were an ESL speaker.)

Welcome, glad you're here.

*** *Simulated reality*

Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated --- for example by quantum computer simulation --- to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation. This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of virtual reality. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience.

** You know, a similar thought occurred to me the other day when I saw one of your posts, that you might be a troll account or something similar. And I had really hoped you weren't because the posts you write are genuinely nice things and you sound like a genuinely nice person. So I'm glad to see this post even while I'm sad that it was necessary, and I hope you don't let those comments go to your heart. You are a wonderful person and I want you to know that.

I disagree with the other poster, you can totally swear. It's just not a good idea because it can easily become a habit, and if you swear a lot it loses its emotional punch. So keep it sparse, exactly for situations like this! Sometimes people need some rudeness to shock some sense into them.

Also I love your name. Emperor's New Groove ftw!

*** I'm not a troll or a bot. You can go through my /post history and/ see that I posted two stories on my Quotev so far, and I promoted them here too! I also made a fanfic.net account because my friend Achille suggested I post my stories to as many fanfiction sites as I can so that they get more reads.

Also thank you, yes it's my favorite Disney movie ever! Besides Treasure Planet and Atlantis, they are my second and third favorites. :)

** Bots generally tend to have “bot” in their names. While there are exceptions, it is fairly clear to me that you are not a bot, so as far as I care it would probably be best if you just took those who treat you as one as stupid people and ignored them.

Also, please don't cuss. That some people are stupid does not mean you have to get down to their level.
