Just finished Fate linkffn(13170637) and it put me in the mood for more of the same.

I didn't like how fast paced Choices linkffn(7467796) was.

Thanks for the help

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Latest chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

** You could always read, The Red Knight. What Fate was roughly based off of.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]]

The Chessmaster: Black Pawn, is always a crowd favorite.

*** Thanks for the suggestions! The chessmaster seems to be a little short in words. Id love some longer fics if you got any suggestions. Fate took me 2 weeks to finish so I read pretty fast

**** Slytherin Ron isn't common, can't think of anything else worth reading. Chessmaster is book 1. I think there are 5?
