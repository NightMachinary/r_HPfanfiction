It could be a crossover or not. I'm just looking for Harry finding out his life is a very accurate kids book series. Maybe he visits Rowling?


** Would you be interested in a fic where Harry is actualy, Fictious and he tried to deal with that?

#+begin_quote
  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.

** Not exactly that, but I really like linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel;A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808, White_Squirrel). From all “HP characters read HP books” these are probably the best ones (or at least, certainly, these are the best ones I've read).
