I don't get why so many people recommend it. Despite the author's intentions, it's neither funny nor clever (seriously, that first chapter is probably the poorest version of Slytherin!Harry I've ever read).

**** I disagree with you, but I'm not quite sure if I can change your mind, so I wont. I will say though, it has one of my favorite lines in HP Fanfiction.

/Slytherin Motto: Deny. Deny. Deny. Well, there was also that thing about "better a cousin than a mudblood", but whoever wrote that had obviously never met Harry's cousin./

***** I don't know man, I think that a better Slytherin motto would be "avoid being accused and having to deny accusations in the Minister's face in the first place", which wouldn't be hard to accomplish if Harry was actually cunning. I cringed so hard while reading that entire scene in Dumbledore's office.

***** Thank you, Captain Obvious. I hadn't realized that other people have different opinions from me.

What I don't understand is what exactly makes them have a high opinion of this fic, because the plot goes glaringly against the premise. Just to simplify things for you: it advertises itself as a series of scenes where Harry acts like a Slytherin - but in practice, he really doesn't.

****** exactly. It's your opinion that he doesn't act like a Slytherin. Acting like a "Slytherin" by it self is subjective to the reader, I personally take it as manipulation to achieve your goals, which Harry does in the fanfiction. There isn't a strict rule on being a Slytherin, if there was, only Rowling would know.

******* Yes, and that manipulation was objectively awfully planned. This isn't a matter of opinion. It's just an awful plan for manipulation no matter how you look at it. It would not have worked in canon. I don't think I need to spell out why but I would if you're really interested. Harry just comes off as a smug idiot rather than a master manipulator and it makes me cringe.

It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  Everyone knows how Voldemort was defeated - or thinks they do. Let Crookshanks tell you the real story of how he overcame a dark wizard, with a little help from some humans, and still had time for romance. JK Rowling obviously owns it.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.

  Harry Potter, the Master of Death, loathes the 'Adventures-of-the-Boy-Who-Lived' children's storybooks. I mean, what kind of kid grabs his happy band of childhood friends, smacks around some dragons, nundus, and dark wizards, and skips home in time for tea and scones? But, after 40,000 years of living and dying, the Master of Death realizes something... He probably could.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
