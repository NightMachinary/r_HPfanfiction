I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370842/1/The-Worst-Muggles-Imaginable][The Worst Muggles Imaginable]] and I realized how obvious it is that the 'puffs are controlling everything behind the scenes. Are there any other fics with this sort of thing going on?


** IIRC linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side) does this. The fic gets really weird though.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.
