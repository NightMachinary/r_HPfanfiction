I have designed a simple custom style for Fanfiction.net. Their typographic design is really bad, this fixes it.


** Thanks, but I don't think FF.net is that bad honestly.

** What does typography mean? Also, you made the letters bigger?! :) I love the bigger letters! Also the spaces! :) It looks more like QUOTEV. Yes it looks very CLEAN! :) I do not like how FF.net has so small text and it is so bunched together.

  typography
#+end_quote

Traditionally, it means the art of printing. The design of a page, letters, spaces between them, how many letters are there in a line, space between lines, indents, hyphens, everything to do the with the printed (or rendered on a screen) text.

** Alternatively, Firefox users can use the reader mode (ctrl-alt-R). I find the sepia background and narrow columns to be much easier on the eyes.

** If you can make it compatible with [[https://userstyles.org/styles/17556/fanfiction-net-purple-black-gray-ad-removal][this theme]], I'll give it a shot. :) Unfortunately, on a darker theme, it's impossible to see the text.
