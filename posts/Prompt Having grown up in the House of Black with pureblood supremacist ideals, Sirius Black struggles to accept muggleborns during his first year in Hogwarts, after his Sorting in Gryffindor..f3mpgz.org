I want to read a fic with Sirius Black dealing with his Sorting and his parents disappointment on not having been sorted into Slytherin.


** My headcanon for Sirius' first year is that he'd decided that his parents were wrong about muggle borns (because he hated their guts and figured they were wrong about every thing) but didn't know what, exactly, they were wrong about. He doesn't know that mudblood isn't the correct word till James punches him. He earnestly asks Lily if her parents ever tried to eat her. That kind of thing.
