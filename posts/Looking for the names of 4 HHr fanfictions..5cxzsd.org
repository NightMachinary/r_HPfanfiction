I read them on Portkey. Portkey is down but I was hoping that the fanfictions are on fanfiction or another site.

1) I remember this fanfiction begins with draco malfoy being in bed and waking up to find a dead girl next to him (Cho). Harry is in a self-imposed exile and Narcissa Malfoy finds him and convinces him to solve the mystery of the murder in order to save her son Draco. The murder involves an elf.

Solved: Soul Thief (6479080)

2) This fanfiction begins with Harry and Ron being aurors. It's close to Ron and Hermione's wedding. They were on a recon mission and outside a warehouse. They were given orders to stand down but Harry and Ron decide to go for it and enter the warehouse. Somehow, they get ambushed and because of either a spell or an explosion, Ron dies. Harry goes to court and accepts the blame for Ron's death. The Weasleys and Hermione shun Harry and so he leaves Britain. Later he comes back.

Solved: Soul Thief (6479080)

7) Any place where I can get access to Harry Potter and the Demon's Soul by Hotaru? It is about a half Oni girl named Kotone who befriends Harry and later becomes his adopted daughter.

Solved: Harry Potter and the Lost Demon (2993199)

--------------

3) Harry and (Ron? or maybe Neville?) are aurors. They are working on a strange case that takes place in a muggle nightclub. They go through a special passageway in the nightclub to an area where there are lots of people and everyone somehow get drugged/mesmerized and lose control of their minds. Oh, I think the muggles there get killed off to feed some sort of monster in the basement. I remember them mentioning that there is some sort of stench that originates from the monster.

4) Hermione either decides to be a professor or student away from Britain. I think she goes there to do some research or something. At the place, she discovers a special room with runes or something and somehow she unlocks a portal to another dimension/world. At this place, there's an antagonist. I think it might be a professor or the headmaster but he had evil purposes in mind. He pushes Hermione through the portal and she gets locked inside. Harry comes to her rescue. I think this takes place in Australia...or another country. But I remember that the institution is well hidden. I distinctly remember that Harry apparates to get to where Hermione is at but he has to do it in chunks because the distance is too great, so he makes a few stops along the way.

5) Sirius and Harry are aurors. Because of a mission, Harry has to return to Britain and protect Hermione. Ron is still alive and is in a relationship with Hermione. Harry has to stay in Hermione's apartment to protect her. I remember an exchange where Harry forbids Hermione to go to work that day because of danger and she was upset at first but gives in.

6) Harry and Ron are both aurors. Hermione works in the ministry building in some capacity. Maybe she's the minister of magic? I remember there was a part when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in an elevator and it malfunctioned because it was tampered with and subsequently, Harry and Ron were both knocked out/hurt. Hermione has to lead in the command center set up in the ministry against an attack by death eaters or some other dark wizards? I don't think Voldemort was mentioned in the story.

8) This fanfiction follows the way the epilogue goes. Except Rose is actually Harry and Hermione's child. I remember Albus (Harry's son) and Rose having a close friendship. In the end, Harry and Hermione ends up together. I remember a specific exchange between Rose and Harry.

H: How's my favorite nibling (or something)?

R: Uncle Harry, that's not a real word.

H: Sure it is, it is a neologism.

R: That doesn't mean it is a real word.

H: Well how do you think new words get made?

R: When they appear in a book!

H: So if I write a book, then it'll be a real word?

R: Maybe, but mum says you're not a good writer.

H: Oh really?

R: Yeah, she said that you are better at giving speeches. Writing is too passive for you.


** 1) Soul Thief

2) also Soul Thief? (it's a good fic!)

3) no clue

4) I think I've read something like this, but can't remember.

***** OH my bad. You are right. I should've checked the fanfiction before making a judgment. I didn't think the fanfiction would be under a different name. But yes this is it. Thank you.

Hmm I googled that story. I don't think that is the one. Harry isn't a vampire in the story. I'll try to edit my post and add more information.
