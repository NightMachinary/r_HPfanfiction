What I'm looking for is a fic or fics where Harry actually goes to Dumbledore or another member of staff when there are problems. And of course they take him seriously.


** Linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) involves adults getting involved and sensibly fixing problems but I don't think it's quite what you're looking for. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a Harry who is smart enough to involve adults sometimes. You'll have troube with this request though, you don't often see fics where the protagonist offloads their troubles onto other people.

**** Yeah, I agree but I figured it sort of broadly fit the competent adults take Harry seriously vibe. Have you read Prince of Slytherin as it has a similar take on some darker magics?

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** I know it sets kind of a boring precedence, but I just thought it might be an interesting change of pace to read about it. Thanks for those recs unfortunately I've already read them.
