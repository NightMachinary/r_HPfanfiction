Are they friends?


** Overall wholesome, no. Aspects of wholesomeness, yes. Relationship is too complex to be called friendship... but if they had both survived the second war, I think it would have morphed into friendship.

** I think it's toxic in general but has wholesome aspects. If they both survived the war they'd probably be very close.

Romantic or Platonic? I don't know. I can honestly see both.

**** Well, the first is the matter of Severus having to kill Albus. That can't be healthy and the conversations before that were likely painful. Then there's also the risk of Severus being discovered but Albus needs him to spy.

As for romantic, I don't know. It depends on how someone interprets their dynamic. I put it there because some people do see romance. And some days I do too.

** Oh absolutely not.

Snape made an oath to Dumbledore. That whole "What will you give me Severus? Anything" thing. Dumbledore owned Snape. Snape didn't spy for the sake of the order, Lily was dead, he did it because Dumbledore made him. Snape could not have been happy about any of the dumb HBP plot, but Dumbledore said so Snape was obliged.

No I don't like Dumbledore anyway so I'm definately biased but I certainly think there was some unbreakable Vow made between the two of them that forced Snape to be Dumbledores lacky. Also it makes the story waaay more interesting if you believe it so I do because it's fun ðŸ˜Š

** Well in the original series we only see instances where Dumbledore manipulates Snape using his love for Lily. Overall I think they care for each other, especially Snape since he is willing to take on the hatred from all the people he is trying to protect for the sake of the old man. Dumbledore is at the very least happy that he had managed to keep a talented and skilled wizard away from pursuing dark magic but he also almost always takes Snape's side even when he is a complete piece of shit and, despite all the condemnation, he goes out of his way to protect Snape's secret. So all-in-all, I'd say it's quite toxic and opportunistic (for Dumbledore at least) but it does have some wholesome aspects to it. There are some fics that explore their relationship in more depth but that's the only conclusion we can draw from the books.

**** Because Dumbledore got Snape involved in the Order activity in the first place because he could use Snape's love for Lily against Voldemort. Also Snape accepted it because he wants to see Voldemort destroyed.
