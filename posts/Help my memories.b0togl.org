Hi folks

I read a story a while back. I want to say that it was AU GOF and OOTP, and Harry was attacked by Deatheaters. After a very long battle ( Harry didn't do so badly) they had broken his wand and Lucius took the broken wand and shoved it into a wound in Harry's side and then there was an explosion.

Ring any bells? I've searched through all of my downloaded fics and nothing!

Thanks in advance


** I have no clue, sorry. Oh, and mark as fic search for better results.
