I recently read someone say that nothing was done about Umbridge because Harry did not tell any one about her. IIRC he was not the only one to be tortured with blood quills. I remember the whole of DA getting the punishment which includes the niece of the then head of DMLE. This got me thinking. Was Umbridge's use of blood quills as a punishment even illegal? In real life; of course something even remotely close to this would be illegal but the wizarding world is different.

In wizarding world a fair reward for saving the life of a classmate is 5 points but a fair punishment for breaking curfew at the age of 11 is 50 points and being sent to the forbidden forest in the middle of the night to hunt an unknown creature capable of killing unicorns. It took killing Quirrelmort and saving the Philosopher's stone from falling into his hands to earn back the amount of points.

You can run a smear campaign against the most powerful person in the country and a school boy and there is nothing they can do about it. Potions that are essentially rape drugs can be easily bought at a joke shop and there is no law against it. There are no consequences for dosing someone with a Love Potion. You can throw a child out of a window with no fear of repercussions.

You can deploy soul sucking monsters at a school and there are no consequences even after they very publicly tried to kiss 'The Boy Who Lived'. Someone can enter someone else into a contract without either their knowledge or consent and the contract would still stand and be enforceable. I can go on and on but you get the idea.

I think that given everything what Umbridge did might actually be legal. What are your thoughts on this?

Edit- There were no consequences against Hermione for tricking the DA into entering a contract without their consent.


** The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Quill][Black Quill]] was Umbridge's personal invention so there wouldn't have been any specific laws against it, just general laws about corporal punishment (if any). Corporal punishment was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_corporal_punishment#United_Kingdom][legal in non-magical UK state schools up until 1986]], and was still legal in non-government schools until around 2000, so JKR could easily have seen it or experienced it when she was in school. Parents and the rest of society simply considered it good discipline. The scarring caused by the black quill would have been comparable to the canings that regularly occured in English schools. Dumbledore may have stopped the practice in Hogwarts when he became Headmaster but there would be many people who still remembered it and might have praised Umbridge for bringing it back.

Her sending dementors into a muggle neighborhood and threatening/beginning to use the Cruciatus curse would be more of a deal.

That's a point of contention for me. Oh wait, Pottermore. Nevermind. Of course it's pottermore...

Umbridge couldn't invent her way out of a wet paper bag.

Onto the discussion. AHEM!

You can say corporal punishment was legal all you want. Four words: Dark Object Torture Device. If the Ministry raided Malfoy Manor over some dark objects, one would think that their employees couldn't use them on school children.

**** She can't be completely useless as a witch; she was somehow able to cast and maintain a corporeal Patronus in a room with Dementors.

***** Harry taught a group of kids to cast it. People can cast it if they work at it long enough. And with how sadistic she is, her want of working with Dementors may have been great enough for her to learn it.

I never said she was useless. But an inventor she is not. She is a beaurocrat, minion, and thug. She knows enough to be able to do what she needs.

IF she could invent that quil, she would not be a ministry flunky. She would be Malfoy-esque, working the political landscape with money, instead of brute force and fear.

****** We know that Snape was creating spells as a Hogwarts student. While he's a genius at potions and very capable otherwise, is it really that surprising that a middle-aged witch that's capable of learning a charm that eludes many adult casters might manage to pull off a single enchantment project? There's also the fact that, while the quills are stated to be her invention, nothing says she wasn't adapting or cribbing off somebody else's work.

Also, she's not some mere flunky, but the holder of a position that gives her a lot of power and influence with little apparent responsibility or accountability. The brute force and fear tactics only came out when she felt totally secure in her position and her victims couldn't do anything about it.

Side note: Considering how quick she was to attempt the assassination by proxy of a teenager just for being a political annoyance, it seems almost a given that her rise to the position of Senior Undersecretary left more than a few bodies behind.

***** She was overpowered by a bunch of horses with bows. Pitch Bellatrix Lestrange in that situation and you'll get a bunch of dead centaurs in ten seconds, Voldemort could probably kill them in three.

****** So she's good with magic but bad with surprises and crisis situations. There are plenty of people that are great shots on a target range, but a lot of them would still be near-useless in an actual firefight that they weren't expecting. Keeping cool and in control during a crisis is a rare talent, and usually has to be trained into people.

Umbitch was a bureaucrat and a bully that never struck against a target that could strike back - no way did she have any experience in actual danger. Throw in her bigotry and hubris, and she probably just assumed that the centaurs would respect and obey her and panicked completely when they didn't follow the script.

**** Yeah I figured you were referring to that but what makes you think what Crouch did was even remotely legal ? He hacked a government device to circumvent the rules of an important sports competition, no way that's legal, they just didn't knew who did it.

***** I was talking about the contract itself not the act of entering someone else. In GOF the contract was still enforceable. I messed up the way I wrote it. Once again thank you for pointing it out.

*** Hey I was thinking about the events of OOTP and I think me saying that it was completely legal to enter someone else into a contract without either their knowledge or consent might actually be true as well.

There were no consequences against Hermione for tricking the DA into entering a contract without their knowledge or consent.

What do you think?

I think this was a case of nobody cared enough to do anything. You have Fudge, who supported it, Umbridge who did it, Rufus Scrimgeour who didn't want any bad light on the ministry.
