** There was this fic I cannot remember the name but the author turned Harry into the incarnation of the most patriarchal amoral portrait of Jesus Christ/Christianity I have ever seen with such quotes as "Rape as Redemption". Harry also establishes a patriarchal state and rapes every female character before being defeated by Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter who had become the avatar of feminism. Very fucking wierd.

** There's one that starts off as a standard "creepily adult relationship between Hermione and Harry" where a ritual goes wrong in the first year, ending up with the troll incident ending up with Harry getting Hermione pregnant with magic, for no adequately explored reason, she decides to not abort, and for some reason this means she has to move into harry's cupboard that he keeps his clothes in (which is brainbleach on so many levels).

The rest of the fic and its sequel (which I skimmed in horrified horror), involve Hermione having the [virgin] birth, and every single character is a lapsed Catholic who suddenly rediscovers their faith, often in ways that feel very... Stepford Wife-y.

And Seamus and his parish priest... Oh my god I really hope the dialogue was not intentional.
