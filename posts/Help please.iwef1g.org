** I think your request will be taken more seriously if you put in more effort into writing the plot information. Most beta/writing partners don't want to deal with the very basic mistakes you are making, unless they already know you and are willing to put up with those mistakes for the sake of friendship. For example, learning when and where to use commas would help a great deal, as well as when words should be capitalized or not.

Regularly reposting the same error-ridden summary is not helping you at all in my opinion.

*** Just ban them. The poster has been annoying me & everybody in this subreddit and a few other subreddits for the past few months.
