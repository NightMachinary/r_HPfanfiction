I noticed how weirdly popular the fanfiction Harry Crow is so I tried and failed to read it. I really have no inclination finish it but my Ravenclaw curiosity is getting the better of me so I was hoping someone who has read it would be so kind as to answer a few questions I have about it.

What house is everybody in?

Any pairings besides the obvious HHr? I thought I heard something about Padma and Neville but I'm not sure.

Ron Weasley bashing? How minor or major if there is any?

Also any other character bashing?

Bonus: What things did you like and dislike most about it?

Thank you for your help!


** I read this early in my HP fanfiction career, so about four years ago. For the record it is complete and utter shit. It's not popular because it's amazing, it's popular because its a complete HHr filled with bashing, cliches, bad tropes, fix it, and plot armor for all the important characters; it's a feel good fic.

--------------

So to answer some of your questions I ended up rereading a few paragraphs. I would have dropped this instantly.

*Houses:* Harry & Hermione are in Ravenclaw

*Pairings:* Don't remember beyond HHr

*Bashing:* Literally everyone.

So Robst likes to write in a very particular way, as a result of this I'd argue he is literally bashing every character in some way, but I'll summarize:

The Malfoys get fucked hard early on and become irrelevant if memory serves, I'm pretty sure it bashes Snape and the Weasleys as the author is Robst.

The entire plot of this is basically "Bash Dumbledore." The first time he really talks and isn't just rehashing canon it managed to trip my bashing flag. At a point Robst gets rid of Dumbledore and then brings him back as the Deputy Headmaster of Dumstrang so he can bash him more.

Have I mentioned the author of this was Robst yet? Well he is. That means Hermione will at some point kiss Harry and become soul-bonded to him as a direct result, usually around or before she turns 12 (less than a month after they meet.) She will then become some chibi!Bellatrix Lestrange where Harry is her Voldemort, he can do no wrong. She's basically his willing slave at this point, also there will be an arbitrary point where they decide they're old enough to have sex and tell the adults not to worry until then.

So Super!+Edgy+Dark!Indy!Harry's are technically Harry bashings, well this is the /Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion/ of Harry bashings. There is no way to conceivably top the bashing of Harry's character in this story, if anyone came close the universe would literally implode.

If I haven't managed to convey it yet, Robst writes Harry Potter fiction using only OCs who happen to bear the names and some of the roles of the canon cast.

*What did I like most about it:* I don't remember nor do I want to.

*What did I dislike most about it:* At the time of reading, who knows? Now: Everything.

If you really want a Goblin raised Harry you should probably [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7s2jnw/harry_crow_questions/dt2lfjp/][read the story Achille-Talon linked below]] or make a thread requesting that. I imagine that would be difficult as for whatever reason you deleted your account sometime between when I started typing this and shortly after I posted this.

  Who wrote Achille talon?

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Talon][wikipedia]] 'Greg' aka Michel RÃ©gnier wrote Achille talon.

I was referring to the story [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] linked, /Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone/. At the time it was the only other comment and I thought it was clear enough. I've edited it for increased clarity.

***** *Achille Talon*

Achille Talon is a Franco-Belgian comics series featuring an eponymous main character, created by Greg (the pseudonym of Michel Regnier). Starting publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote in 1963, the series presents the comic misadventures of an anti-hero.

The name derives from "talon d'Achille", the French term for an "Achilles' heel", which suits the character although the Achilles' heel of Achille Talon is not his heel but his large nose.

** If the premise of /Harry Crow/ (a goblin-raised Harry) interested you, you might want to give linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) a look. It's a much better fic with the same original premise, and is believed to be where the writer of /Crow/ got the idea from, in fact.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?

**** Unfortunately, no; but it doesn't have anything like a big cliffhanger left hanging, since it was much more of a "slice of life" story. I read it whole in one go knowing it wasn't complete, and while I wouldn't have minded a lot more of that story, I wasn't left feeling "incomplete".
