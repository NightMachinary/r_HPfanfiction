I picked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/][The Unwinding of Percy Weasley]] from the fics that have been recommended so far via the book club recommendation form in the sidebar. A Percy-centric fic sounded intriguing.

The current recommendation thread is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2hutv3/book_club_recommendations/][here]] if you'd like to make recommendations for next time.

As a reminder with the new format we'll be discussing this fic two weeks hence when I announce the next fic. This gives everyone two weeks in which to read before discussion so people are better able to participate in the discussion even if they're slow readers or don't have as much time.


** I was really skeptical of this fic going in, but I found it to be a very easy read, with believable characters and interactions, a believable plot and conflict and a very satisfying ending. Two thumbs up for a fic I very likely would have never read.

** Oh man of any two words that might put me off a story, I never expected "Percy" and "canon" to top the list. Is this even canon though? I'm going to read it anyway just because it's on the book club thread, so I guess I'll just have to answer that question myself.

edit: BTW can you add the summary and stats when you post the thread?

Sure.

I feel like Percy gets a bad rap. I like fics that try to "redeem" him or show things from his perspective.

Definitely agree there. He's just another mindless ministry stooge in most fics and completely irrelevant and dismissed in the others. Nonjon's description of him in Browncoat, Green Eyes is probably the most positive words I've heard about him, and they're pretty realistic to boot.

** It is a very good fic in the purely "Romance" genre, but the fact that it is only a love story makes it a bit of a boring read. I prefer Romance when it is coupled with adventure or mystery.

That said the fic is very well written. The characters are totally believable, with no bashing or clichés. I took a liking to the author's Percy, remorseful and self-doubting after the war and the OC, which is a Luna-like self-insert in my opinion, is... okay. By that, I mean she was not overly annoying, but probably a bit too perfect (beautiful and intelligent with many men lusting after her) in the sense that her "flaws" are really more quirks.

My favourite part of the fic was how Mr Weasley described the Weasley men. It was very inspiring so I'll let you discover that on your own :)

Overall, I'd recommend this fic, especially to fans of Romance.
