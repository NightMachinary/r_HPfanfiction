Actually (depending on Harrys and Hermiones caring until this moment) the Lockets action was the Key moment for Harry. Soon after the War he quit with Ginny and start questioning his feelings, coming to the conclusion that he felt more for Hermione than just "like a sister", but he was to dumb to recognize it. He might confess this to her, but she declares, that she loves Ron and that Harry is like a Brother for her. Harry is torn between let her be Happy and feeling lost (possibly having a Grudge against Ron....dont want to say Ron-bashing, but in an acceptable degree anger).

Or Harry acts "strange" after the War is over, showing himself rare in the public, even the Weasleys. He wont open to anyone until at some point Hermione wants to speak to him and he angrily confess that he loves her, but cant bear to lose her. Harrys only comfort is his memory about their Fake images kissing each other. He do watch this memory multiple time through a Pensieve.

To Detailed? Ok, i cut it short: The Images of the Locket Destruction is "haunting" Harry (even after the War is over) and he question himself. Then at some point he comes to the conclusion that he indeed loves Hermione. He confess it (maybe even telling her about the Lockets actions), but she stays at her claim from above.

basically "Interloper" by Romantic Silence makes Harry admit of what he and Ron saw and that he loves her, but its to soon for me.

note from me: in my eyes there are in total way to little Fics out there that contain the Lockets actions....and yet even lesser if the Fics have H/Hr theme. But maybe i havent read enough Fic with this content.
