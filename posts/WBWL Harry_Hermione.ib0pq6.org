WBWL Harmony

I would be thrilled if anyone could recommend me WBWL trope with Harmony. I have already read Unsung Hero, linkffn(I'm Not The Only One) and linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived) and I'd love to read these kinds of stories. Thanks in advance ;)


** You've named all the ones I know of. Given how badly all the fics in this subgenre that I've seen---with Kwan Li's being a partial exception---degrade Hermione in absolute or relative terms, I've stopped reading them.

I'd be interested in any that don't.

*** Same here. It's really hard to find a Harmony story (with or without WBWL) where Hermione isn't relegated to the love interest/sidekick, but an equal to Harry.

**** I think it's a case of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect][The Worf Effect]]: the fic author wants to show how much more intelligent/scholarly/hardworking/competent/proactive WBWL!Harry is than Canon!Harry, and upstaging the reigning champion in these areas is a very convenient and low-effort way to do so.

  I always been misunderstood, never fully accepted for the burden I carry. Even if I didn't know it I still carried on and protected those from the malicious beast chained from within. Now, I try to find my own place in the world with those that lighted the way for so many. Their legends keep me going and there strength keeps me sane, I keep going even if my story goes untold...
