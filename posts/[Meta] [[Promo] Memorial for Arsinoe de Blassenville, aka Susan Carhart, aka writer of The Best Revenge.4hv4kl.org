One of the best has passed away recently. She was 65 and died of an unspecified cancer. Sorry if this is a repost, but she was one of the greatest writers I've ever read, and she wrote fanfiction for free for us.

Death is just another adventure.


** Damn, that sucks. Victory at Ostagar was my first fanfiction, and it was bloody amazing.

** She'd been struggling for a while and I'm sorry to hear of her passing. Back when I was cutting my teeth on HP fanfiction, her stories were some of the first I read. Her love for writing and the fandom was evident in the thoughtfulness of her work.

** Rest in Peace, Ms/Mrs. Carhart.

Although you will be dead and buried, your memory will always be with us, shining through the night.

After all, Death is nothing but the next great adventure.

** Oh man. I'd seen her mention her health here and there, but didn't realize it was so bad. She was a genuine treasure. Not only were her works fabulous, but she was kind and supportive to novice writers as well.
