Any genre, any pairing, completed only please?

I just love the idea of the trio, or any other characters, meeting their AU selves while stuck in an AU universe, or the other way around, in which the AU selves are stuck in canon.

Help?

*** After reading that, I've always wanted to read Harry and Voldemort as indestructible team. I get that it would probably only work as a crackfic since there's no challenge if you can only be killed by your ally (as long as you both live), but still.

** Harry from another world by Sprinter\\
The Lone Traveller by Dunuelos

Edit oh sorry didn't see you said C only. LT is episodic and Sprinter hasn't been active in a few months unfortunately.

** Literally just read this one today & it was good, albeit pretty depressing (I didn't get much done...)

The Rewards of Perseverance - doesn't have AU but its sequel, The Mirror of Erised, does.

** There's this really great fanfic I read about a month ago. It's called 'Frames and Glasses.' Problem is, Harry's dead in one universe and Hermione's dead in another. I'm sure it doesn't fit your description but it's still a good read. It's on FanFiction.net.
