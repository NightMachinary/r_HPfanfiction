:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I've been a long-time reader of HP fanfiction. Many years ago I read a HP/SS fic that stuck with me. I haven't been able to find it for several years. Any help would be appreciated.

Harry spends the summer working under Snape as a bit of an apprentice and the story begins with him coming back to Hogwarts after said summer. Sirius is still alive and he's jealous of the growing relationship between Harry and Snape. Story develops into a bit of a love triangle between Harry/Snape/Sirius but Sirius' intentions are less then pure. Ultimately ends with Harry's death (gasp). I distinctly remember the line "It was all smoke and fire with nothing inside."
