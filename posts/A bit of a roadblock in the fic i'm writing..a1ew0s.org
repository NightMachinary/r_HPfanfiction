So my fic is set twenty five years after the battle of Hogwarts . My OC (because I have no ideas what else to do) was born sometime after it and he is going to be a professor or at least work at Hogwarts. My problem is that by then a lot of the professors would be much older and I'm not sure if they would still be teaching. (aside from Binns and Hagrid, i'm not sure how long Hagird will live being half giant and all)

Would it be a good idea to create my own professors or just leave them nameless?


** In the books, JKR tends to focus Harry's attention on a select few professors and kind of vaguely sketches out the rest. I suggest that you do the same -- your plot can (potentially) revolve around one or two professors. Whether you choose to make those professors canon or not is up to you. Wizards live to be well over 100, so you have a lot of wiggle room about whether Hagrid, Flitwick, Sprout, Trelawney, etc. are still there.

Making your own professors is always risky (in terms of grabbing reader interest) but it is oh so fun. Do what JKR does -- base it on the most bonkers person you've known, or the most likable, or the least likable. Think about someone in your life who can always launch you and your friends into an animated conversation (or a rant) when you talk about them, and base your character on that person.

** I'm of two minds about this. Technically, you can probably still have all the same professors teaching, even if they're 100+ years old. But I almost feel like this is a bit of fanservice, just to have a familiar name and a known quantity. Like, it's cool that Harry's son has the same charms professor that both Harry and Harry's mother had, but is it really necessary from a literary standpoint? I feel like it's almost too /safe/. Professors don't have to work at Hogwarts until the day they die, so I think it's reasonable for them to retire, or pursue other interests, and to try and come up with other memorable replacements.

** As [[/u/FitzDizzyspells]] reminded you, life expectancy is massively greater for wizards. Dumbledore would probably have been Headmaster for another fifty years if not for the Withering Curse, going by his predecessor. If you assume that Flitwick is in his 60's or 70's in the canon books, as I do, it's entirely plausible (indeed, very /probable/) that he would still be teaching. Same for Hagrid (unless he ages faster as a Giant, but that's unlikely since it rather seems to make him /tougher/), Sprout, etc.

You're going to have to create your own Potions, Transfiguration and Defence Professors, anyway. Unless you're very inspired for another Professor, don't make your work harder for yourself than it has to be.
