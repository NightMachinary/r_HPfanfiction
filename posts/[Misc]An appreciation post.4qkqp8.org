I wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community, y'all are just so wonderful.

All of my experiences here have been positive and I don't usually see a lot of negativity. It's such a supportive place and everyone is so respectful of others preferences when it comes to the fanfiction they read.

Thank you to the all of the authors who continue to write for yourselves and others, there wouldn't be anything to read without you. Thank you for taking the time to write such inspiring pieces of literature and expanding upon the wonderful world that JK Rowling has left for us. I was reading a fic earlier and it just blew me away. It made me realize that there is so much talent here, talent and passion that I struggle to find in published works. You choose to write every chapter and I am so amazed at the brilliance of everything I've read. Even if you don't consider yourself a decent writer there will always be people who appreciate your involvement and commitment to this community.

I'm so incredibly grateful that I discovered fanfiction, stumbled upon this subreddit and that there are so many contributors that read, write, and love Harry Potter (fanfiction).


** You warmed my heart with this post. As a fanfic writer, I'm going to go ahead and say thank you for the compliment. :)

And I agree that this subreddit is one of the better ones out there. You get the sense of a community, and that's pretty special for a subreddit. Yes, there are negative things to be seen here from time to time, but let's not focus on that here.

Thank you all for making this subreddit (and the IRC of course!) a good place.

**** You click the "IRC CHANNEL" button in the sidebar, type in a username, click the "I am not a robot" captcha button and then join.
