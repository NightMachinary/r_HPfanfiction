I'd like to read fic that delves more into the American side of magical society and shows what's different or unique about it. Historical or society focused type fic would be cool but not required. Preferably at least slightly different from JKR's take since I personally find the extra info on Pottermore to be either lame or illogical.


** I'm surprised no one has recced linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle) yet tbh. Epic wizarding American story starring 11-year-old witch Alexandra Quick.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

America/Muggle wank and "Emma Watson with 200 IQ"-Hermione aside, it's not a bad fic, and it shows a more progressive and tolerant American society (no such thing as a "house" elf; no limit on underage sorcery, etc.)
