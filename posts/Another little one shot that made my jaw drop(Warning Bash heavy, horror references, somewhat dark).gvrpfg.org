So, I just finished reading this little one-shot, and I have to say it was a rather striking read, it take the canon epilogue and goes in rather dark direction(No reference to /Harry Potter and the The Cursed Child/, however)

  Albus Dumbledore gets an unexpected visitor in his office one late summer night. The Headmaster finds himself talking to a monster he never knew could arise from his actions. Darkish.

** Pretty standard bashfic in the beginning, though I do appreciate in the second half how Dumbledore is given the opportunity to fix his mistakes and preventing the dark future.

Definitely not a fan of the Ron bashing though, my god was that unwarranted.
