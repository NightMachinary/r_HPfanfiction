I'm looking for any fic where Harry or a main character is a creature or at least part creature of some sort. I prefer Harry hermione, but most lady pairings would be fine.

Please no slash or tentacles.

  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.

The only creature fic I can remember by name that isn't PWP or completely unintelligible. I think this author has another one in which both Harry and Hermione become werewolves but its not very good IIRC.

** There is a surprising amount of Harry/Hermione creature!Harry fanfics, which one one would have thought would be a fairly niche subgenre. Apparently not.

None of them are very good, but they are an interesting way of spending an afternoon; the best one would probably be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/][Cold Blood]] by DerLaCroix, who has several good fics to his name.

*** DerLaCroix is one of my favorite authors. Cold blood was the first fic to get me looking into looking for Harry hermione creature fics. I also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8813082/1/On-Crimson-Wings]], and "A Werewolf and a Veela Walk Into a Pub"

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  Stop trying to scare me, Hermione. Only Dementors, Voldemort, and Grawp freak me out, so you can just give up on that ... This is nothing. Get this through your head: I love you and that's not changing.

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.
