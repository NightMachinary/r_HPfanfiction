Hi guys,

I am looking for fics where Harry loses against Voldemort and is presumed dead, but is held a prisoner until rescued.

Any POV. It'll be great if the world is dystopic with Death Eaters in control and the Order a small resistance. Maybe with even Neville acting in Harry's place while presumed dead. Any time frame, but anything after Horcrux hunt a bonus.

Open to anything... except mpreg and chan.

Thanks.

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.
