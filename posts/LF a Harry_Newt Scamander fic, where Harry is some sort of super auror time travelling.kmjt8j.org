:END:
I read this fic not that long ago, but now I can't find it anywhere.\\
Harry time travels to Newts time, they meet up in Africa where Harry helps a tribe with a snake problem and Harry and Newt end up married because of drugs. Chaos ensues as they travel the world and experience a bunch of things: flying with phoenixes, gifting a dragon to an empress (in exchange for not marrying her), fighting with a lot of different animal-smugglers, and much more.
