I remember there were two separate stories but the general plot from what I remember was Harry was framed for murder and sent to Azkaban and was dating Cho. When he escaped the OOTP set up a trap to capture him using Cho who was in on it.

Something else of importance was the newest DADA Professor was a death eater in the story.

Its been really long since I've read it and was trying to find it because I was bored but couldn't.


** I would say this is Draco664's duology.
