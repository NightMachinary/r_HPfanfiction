I'm looking for fics, preferably long, well-written and completed, with main characters being OCs not from the original novels or related to them.


** Umbrus Shade, the incredibly annoyed Ravenclaw. (On SV forum, so no ffbot for ya)

A bit suish because it's an SI, but it is long, well written, OC (kinda, he uses technically Canon names but of characters that weren't really mentioned) focused.

** Check out the series by Slide. It follows 4 Slytherins the year above Harry from OotP to post-war. It's really well characterized and written (slide is a professional author) and even has a sequel trilogy in the next gen)

The first book is a series of one shots: linkffn(Latet Herba in Anguis by Slide)

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** The Calista Snape Triology (the second one is a lot better than the first one, so don't give up if you don't like the first fic)
