Hey! Does anyone know any good, preferably complete, fics in which Harry is raised by the Flamels? I don't care whether he's super, godlike, a total idiot or a Mary Sue, as long as the story is well written :)


** I had a brain moment, and read this as “Harry Raised by Flanders”.

I have no words.
