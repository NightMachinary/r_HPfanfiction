** I don't subscribe personally to the house elves need magic from others to survive. Instead I take further reference to the beings they are loosely based off of, Brownies and other house fey.

Most of the stories have them actively turning away and hiding from verbal acknowledgement of their services. Instead small gifts along with food and drink left out for them makes them happy.

They stay, clean, and do work because it makes them happy to do so. Not because they must or some other reason, they do so because of the most important reason of all.

*They are not human and as such do not have the same human motivations we do.*

I view house elves as a type of brownie who at some point decided they really liked the family they were with and bonded formally to the family. Only by giving them clothes and other things formally so they may have something for their journey on to new places can they leave.

Why? Once again because they are not human, and fey are bound by all kinds of really weird rules.

So most house elves are free to do whatever wherever they want to but some really take an interest in a family and decide to stay.

Maybe Dobby really liked Abraxas Malfoy, thought he would like to stay with the Malfoy family, only for it to go to absolute shit after Abraxas died.

My theory is the house elves of Hogwarts are not tied to the castle at all. Normal free house elves (brownie like beings) just enjoy keeping such a giant mess in working order. Hell maybe it is a right of passage way for house elf children into adulthood.

I agree house elves need a legal way to contact people for needing help.

However they are based off of the fey so you know, murder and torture is just games of fun to them. They might not like ironing their ears but with fey that is actually not a horrible punishment, compared to most stories about the fey.

*** Always here for more Brownie!House-elf interpretations. I've never considered them entering into the contract like traditional fae before though. I might have to play around with that a bit and see how I like it.

I've always though more along the lines of the Brownies collectively being tricked into contracts that seemed good on parchment, but resulted in slavery that they weren't able to escape from, and that over time their knowledge and identity were bred out of the species.

It's mentioned in that one that house-elves were brownies, who simply needed a magical place to live, and bound to humans in a symbiotic relationship, but centuries ago there was a movement to strengthen the bond between elf and human, which had the negative side effect of compelling the elves to obey orders.\\

****** The war was over and somehow they had all made it through intact. Sure he had been forced once again to spend considerable amounts of gold but in the end the Malfoy family was still whole and healthy.

It was a bright summers day and he was feeling especially lively today. He decided to take a nice walk down to the western pond. He had loved the walks with his grandfather down to the pond.

He was fully relaxed on a conjured chair enjoying the summer breeze when he felt his body grow cold.

"Former bad master has a bad memory. Former bad master doesn't remember Great Lord Braxies warnings."

He was frozen except for his eyes which he was using to frantically find his old house elf.

"Maybe a song will help former bad master remember."

Lucius felt his heart skip as he remembered the warnings and the song.

"Oh Dobby sees former bad master does remember now. Shall we sing together former bad master?"

Lucius felt his voice still stuck and desperately wished nothing more than to deny wanting to hear a song.

Oh how had he forgotten!? He had gotten so used to Dobby being underfoot and subservient he had neglected to remember the most important rule of all.

House elves were fey first and foremost, so if you mistreat your you better kill it and make sure no one ever finds out.

The fey always collect their dues.

More importantly to right now and here was something else.

The western pond and lands beyond were not Malfoy property. They were fey holdings that the Malfoy family had made their home near.

He was off his property and on feyweld.

He was fucked.

Dobby's voice broke through his thoughts as he heard the childish lisp of that was so common among the fey. All the better to lure prey into their parlor after all.

"Run, run, from the setting sun, it hides under the hill."

If he had any control of his breathing right now he would be hyperventilating. Yet even as his mind screamed in terror of what he knew was coming his body showed no signs of his fear.

"Run, run, from the setting sun, before the blood will spill."

He felt it then as the sun began to set behind the hill overlooking the western pond. The subtle twisting of magic from the calm magic of wizards into the wild magics of old.

"The wood is old, as the stories told, it is the land of fey."

He could feel his body get up from the chair as the last rays of light disappeared from the ground. Swallowed up by the hill overlooking the pond.

"The wood is old, as the stories told, it's now time to play."

The hill seemed to grow larger as he stepped towards it his hand reaching out to hold on to Dobby's.

"We will dance and we will sing all through the night."

He felt a smile form on his face as he desperately screamed within his own mind. Praying for a miracle, for him to survive what was to come.

"If your luck is all used up, then you will see dawn's light."

Oh dear merlin, that was a line he had not heard before. One that had him desperately wishing he would have not survived the war now.

"Come, come, have some fun and dance with us tonight. Come, come, have some fun and play with us tonight."

Malfoy noticed his other hand being grasped as a wild creature of sticks and mud grab it as they began to run into the shadowed hill.

His voice broke out in a wild and maddening laugh as he skipped along.

He tripped as he ran along but the dancers kept him upright. His shoes were lost in the shuffle but it was fine.

The ground was rough at first but as he danced more and more it became slick. Soon he was sliding along with his dance as he grew closer to the bonfire in the center before pulling back away from it.

Soon it he found himself waving two burning limbs laughing wildly at having two muggle firearms.

Even as he lost himself even more to the wild abandon a part of his mind screamed in pain and terror.

The ground was coated from his blood where his feet had been cut to shreds.

His hands were severely burned as he held burning hot coals in each.

He had been horrified in that small part of him that was aware of what was happening as he offered his hosts for the dance to lend them an ear.

He screamed inside as a beast made of bone and ash had taken his ears from his head.

It was a slow process where it had peeled back the layers of skin, nerves and cartilage one at a time.

A strange bird made of flesh had pecked his teeth out with a slowness that snails would be hard pressed to match.

He had laughed along as he cried for his death inside as a rope made of his shorn hair was woven.

He had desperately prayed they would simply strangle him to death at this point but it was not to be.

No the hair ropes were tied around his ankles and testes. Each step tugged on them even as he danced with a more wild glee then ever.

The night had been longer than he imagined a night could ever last. For what he knew had to have been days he had danced and danced and danced. All while screaming in a part of his mind in pain and terror.

It was finally over and his exhausted body laid upon the ground. He had given up coherent thought a long time ago.

All he knew was a tall man with antlers and a bow had offered him a drink that would heal him if he wanted it.

Desperate to end the pain he drank deeply from the offered cup. It was sweet, the sweetest thing he had ever tasted.

Falling asleep as his exhausted body healed his last moments of thought wondered what the wild hunt was and who their newest prey was?

There is an establishment in the story that has classic brownies preparing food and handling housekeeping, and as in older fairy tales, they will claim payment if you acknowledge their service, even if you're just thanking them. The debt increases the longer they go without being thanked, and these ones have been working a long, long time. The main characters don't encounter them until a while into the story, though.

 \\
Although, just now, I thought of the possibility, that house-elves are operating according to someone's /idea/ of brownies; they must work, they must refuse pay, they must leave if given clothes. They say they have no right to have fun or be unhappy, like those are rules. Deviating from those principles is a terrifying thought to them.\\
Maybe it's the case that someone created the house-elves and 'programmed' them to act (superficially) like fairytale brownies. Maybe their species is bound to some magical contract which prescribes certain behavior. Maybe house-elves are actually a kind of Boggart-like creature that you need to defeat by forcing it into a harmless/friendly form and binding it that way.

**** A lot of the talk about House Elves forgets about House Elves /not being humans/. It's in their names. House /Elves/.

Is it so hard to think that a different specie wouldn't want the same things as humans?

Even better, what about Centaurs and Mermaids? They have their own customs and worldviews. They're just not explored in canon, like with House Elves. What do we know about Mermaids? They live in the water, their speech has evolved to look like english when spoke underwater. What do we know about Centaurs? They live in forests, and are privy to divination using the stars.

Do we need to fight so that Mermaids can develop their own language, and not a language that looks so much like english? Shouls we "free" them? This example is pretty bad imo, so let's go with Centaurs instead.

Saint Granger approved of this: divination is hogwash. The only true way of seeing the future is having been there, and being touched by something and entering a trance that you won't even remember. Do you need to fight so the Centaurs gets a better way to pass the time? Should someone fight so they get better lodging? I doubt a forest is confortable to live in. /For a human, at least/.

So why are House Elves different? Because you can linken them to slavery? What fucking bullshit is that, seriously? People only like to think of the consequences, and not what made them.

Why are House Elves working for a household? There's soooo many reasons, all way better than just "lmao wizards bad & worse than muggles". Here's some of them.

1) They genuinely like working, as it gives them a huge serving of dopamine. Workink is the only way for them to be happy, and as they can't be happy doing something else, money holds no value and lessen the work they do, or something. Paying them = less dopamine = less happiness, and money is useless. Dobby's just built different, as it happens with some humans.

2) They are an artificial form of life created solely to perform those tasks. Either wizards have forgotten how to create them, or creating an articial lifeform like that is, shall we say, pretty hard. They can't reproduce in the second case, but as an artificial, biological lifeform, they can think, they can talk, they can have emotions. Dobby just recieved a tiny development mistake, or became a deviant, or something.

3) They are beings created by ancient buildings surcharged with magic, releasing it off. The House Elf then feels like they should take care of their mother building. Dobby is weird because he didn't know his mother building for long before it became destroyed, or something.

There's more than that but I have better thing to do than think for y'all about how to write a good story that doesn't just stink of white knighting.

No offense, but I don't get why so many people say that. In the first book, she's a know-it-all who condescendingly tries to "help" her classmates, and she gets attacked by a troll to stop that behavior. In the second book, she's not cautious enough and gets turned into a weird cat-human hybrid for a whole month. In the third book, she's overconfident about her abilities, and spends a whole year isolated and stressed out because of that. In the fourth and fifth books (and part of the seventh book), her whole arc is literally about having to stop forcing her opinions on the House-Elves, and she's constantly belittled by Ron, Harry, and a multitude of other people because of it. Being real here, what character has more on-page consequences than her (besides Harry, who is the main character)?

Also, I don't really get your comment in general. House-Elves can still be slaves without a bond. It's just that they won't be magically compelled to do anything and that they'll be able to leave anytime they want. Why would they suddenly be thrown out? And even if they were for some reason, why wouldn't other people take them in? They're said to be pretty rare, so even without their magical bond, they would still be extremely valuable, and Dumbledore could just take them in if nobody wants them.

**** Fair enough, you've given me some points to think over. I have some old ideas about this which I'll just chuck down below.

1. She got attacked by a Troll because of Quirrell's actions, rather than her own. It is Ron and Harry feeling guilty as a consequence of /their/ actions which then made them take a pro-active step to find her and warn her (and save her). One of the consequences of this is that she /lies/ to the teacher's to get them all out of trouble, her character changes slightly and she evaluates how honesty can be a detriment and deception has its place. This is a good character moment, but isn't really explored later on, it just becomes "We break rules now", but her

2. The cat-face is a superficial consequence and I don't /think/ we see any points later in the series where she recalls the incident and it forces her to change her course of action. It's a "funny" unintended side-effect, it doesn't alter their ability to get answers out of Draco while posing as Crabbe/Goyle. She still succeeded, but with a small speedbump along the way.

3. Being isolated and stressed isn't a massive consequence for her character, she isn't described as being outgoing, therefore isolation isn't a "personal hell" for her to experience. And, ultimately, the time-turner saves Sirius and Buckbeak which is such a positive consequence that any negative consequence pales in comparison.

She suffers "superficially", but ultimately she's never acutely wrong and never sees long-lasting consequences of her actions. It's like in a video game, where it is said that "player choices change the story" but then you still go down the same journey and have a similar outcome regardless of what good/bad choices you pick. And Rowling had a tendency to use "House Points" as a consequence, but they might as well be confetti for all the impact is has long-term on the story.

One good thing that happened was that she took the initiative and Obliviated her parents, sending them to Australia to protect them. Unfortunately, though this caused some tension during the Horcrux Hunt, we don't see the final consequences of those actions (i.e. she fundamentally, /permanently/ changed her relationship with her family). A consequence isn't really a consequence if the ramifications aren't on the page. But it did show her state of mind and commitment to Harry.

Regarding on-page consequences for other characters:

1. Ginny is too open and trusting and obsessive which leads to her writing in Riddle's diary. This leads to the basilisk being released and her very, /very/ nearly dying because of it -- which would have had the consequence of a revived teenage Riddle in the world once more. Her shy nature stops her from revealing what has happened, and she suffers far worse because of it (she approached Percy at the House Table to tell him, but blushed and ran off, they blame it on her shyness etc.) She directly suffers because of that. It's unfortunate Ginny isn't a larger part of the series.

2. Lupin cares so much for Harry that he fails to take his Wolfsbane potion at a crucial moment, which ultimately sees him endanger those he loves and gets himself fired, and contributes to Wormtail escaping capture, which leads to Voldemort's rise.

3. Draco's story is a shitshow. His actions and the consequences of them lead to Dumbledore /dying/ and Death Eaters roaming the castle, which ultimately leads to Voldemort taking over Hogwarts the next school year (students on the run, students being hurt and used as bargaining chips against rebellious parents).

4. Quirrell's desire for greatness and his gullibility has him essentially sell his soul for a slither of the Dark Lord's power, which gets him killed.

5. Lockhart's desire for recognition and fame has him seek to remove Harry's memories, which only backfires because of Ron's broken wand, as a consequence he loses /his/ memory and is hospitalised for life. That's a pretty serious consequence if you stop to think about it (I read a good fic that explored Harry's sort-of guilt over this).

--------------

Anyway, moving on -- I think Hermione needed consequences with more meat in them. I don't get emotionally invested in her character. Remember Arron Paul in Breaking Bad ("He can't keep getting away with it!") -- that's how I feel about Hermione. She gets away with it (whatever it is) time and time again. And she's a useful character for introducing exposition and driving the plot forward. She shouldn't get a free-pass given her importance to the story. She exists to help Harry. The only other times she expresses independent intent is with the House Elves and Obliviating her family (iirc). I've covered the Obliviation already. I just wish there was a House Elf or two who take an adversarial role, forcing her to remove her rose-tinted glasses and view them critically.

Maybe she should have succeeded with the S.P.E.W movement, but then has to contend with a number of "free" House Elves who turn to petty crime or else seek out traditional families like the Malfoys to maintain a centuries-long status-quo. So she creates her own enemies, which affect the plot in some real way. She'll have to reconcile the fact that /her/ actions are tied to a worse outcome.

Rowling has a habit of making episodic adversaries. So the adversarial DADA professor will somehow tie into it, but they just get killed or thrown out of the story once they serve their purpose.

At the end of the day it started out as a whimsical magical adventure series, and I'm applying a more mature outlook on the events in earlier books.

** I don't, exactly, understand all the frustration about slave apologism for this topic: I feel y'all are making a mountain out of a molehill. And please, before I get downvoted into oblivion, actually read what I have to say. Thanks.

Here's the thing about most of these stories. You have this indy!Harry. He's young. He's been abused. He's just found out that he's loaded, and has political power, and the "friends" that are teaching him all about it say X about house elves. And he believes them. Of /course/ he does. Why the fuck wouldn't he?

He can believe the people who think that he should stay at the Dursleys, or he can believe the people who think he should go all edgelord. And he's a little kid - which one do you think he picks?

Of course, the "elves want to be slaves" shtick comes in all types of stories... but it's the most predominant in the Indy ones, it seems, and frankly it makes perfect sense why. Lord!Harry suddenly has some semblance of control over his own life, and the people who helped him with that told him that they want to be slaves (because they believe it, or want to believe it, or just like the status quo - whatever). So he agrees, because otherwise... what else are they not being truthful about? What other customs from his 'heritage' did he adopt that are actually bullshit?

Is it a shitty trope? Of course it is, and I'm sure we can all agree that slavery is bad and good riddance to bad rubbish. But I've gotta say... it fits a lot of the stories you find it in.

(I really, really do like [[/u/Michal_Riley][u/Michal_Riley]]'s take on it though. It's awesome, brownies ftw!)

** I don't want to see this because the fact is Hermione doesn't have any evidence and the closest she has to testimony is Dobby who is openly acknowledged to be wildly different from literally every other member of his species all the while dismissing anything and anyone that disagrees with her views as brainwashed. You might hate the Lord Potter defends slavery trope but I hate the Saint Granger descends from heaven to the lowly wizards to raise them out of ignorance and barbarism with her muggle values trope.

She's only been in the magical world since she was eleven and the only house elf she's ever spoken to in her entire life is the one openly acknowledged as crazy by his own peoples standards. Her deigning to speak for an entire species that she knows fuck all about and tell them how they should live their lives and conform to her views always smacks of white missionaries trying to eradicate tribal customs among natives to me.

You want a prompt? Hermione goes on her House Elves are slaves rant and tries to leave hats laying around for them only for her to get slapped in the mouth in the Great Hall by a Hogwarts house elf for trying to trick their kids into being forced out of the only home they've ever known because she's too self righteous to care how they feel about the situation.

*** I think I need to point out (and I probably should have included it in the title text after all) that in Goblet of Fire, after Hermione learns about there being house-elves at Hogwarts, she spends all her time outside of lessons and lunch/dinner at the library doing research on the subject for the next three days (before presenting SPEW). It's safe to assume that she's informed (or at least, familiarised herself with human documentation of house-elves).\\
Also, I don't think Hermione actually ever met Dobby until Goblet of Fire, only heard about him second-hand from Harry. Winky would have been her first encounter with a house-elf, at the Quidditch World Cup.\\

...Funnily enough, looking back through the books, it's Ron who tends to parrot the 'house-elves like being slaves' claims. You'd think that people who write Ron-bashing would jump all over the chance to condemn him for promoting slavery.

**** No, it isn't. There's absolutely no way to know what if any real information she found in the school library. Saying that reading in the local library about a people and culture she's never even met qualifies her to make judgements about them as a whole and try to steer their future is silly. Bottom line Hermione has absolutely no idea what she's talking about either but in the books she can't see past her own self righteousness long enough to realize it.

** Thing is, Hermione genuinely is wrong about house elves. JK isn't the greatest at alleglries, but she already has a clear allegory for oppression and racism, that being pure/non-pure blood. The houselves are based on the mythological creatures called "brownies" who are helpful spirits that do domestic favors on a whim. House elves clearly do derive genuone pleasure and fulfillment from offering their services to others, Dobby is the only elf we know of that wants to be free, and even then his idea of freedom is working 20/7 for a galleon a week and with a single day off a month, and no holidays.

*** The thing about brownies it that they were free and could very easily get offended and go away.

If elves want to clean for free they can do it but there shouldn't be anything forcing them to remain if they want to leave or to obey when they don't want to.

Kreacher didn't want to obey Sirius or Harry but was forced to by magic, Winky was abused and no one could do anything about it. Sure the elves in hogwarts are treated fine now but what will happen when the next headmaster decides to use them as target practice, legally no one could do anything about it.

**** I agree with that sentiment wholeheartedly. I think the best way to go about dealing with house elves is to legislate greater protections for them since their own culture seems to have developed to the point that they get deeply offended by people setting them free. The crux of what I meant is that Hermione was basing her, and by extension many readers, view of the situation on real world historical examples of slavery and oppression, all of which revolved around the norion that the oppressed people was either fundamentally inferior and therefore not worth respect, or else naturally predisposed to contentment in servitude. In the case of humans enslaving others humans this is both baseless and horrific, in the case of humans enslaving most sentient fictional species it is both baseless and horrific, in the case of house elves it is not baseless, and not always horrific. The simple fact is that they /are/ predisposed to contentment in servitude, everything we see in the books points to this, and as such by attempting to take away their service Hermione was taking away their happiness, not granting them their freedom.

They don't want wages, they feel as though it cheapens their service, they don't want recreational time, their service is what they enjoy, they don't want to retire, that'd be like quitting a lifelong passion. Hermione wanted soemthing good, but went about it the opposite way of what was needed. The house elves /should/ be protected from abuse, the house elves /should/ be granted legal rights in accordance with their desires, the house elves /should/ be allowed to sue for violation of those rights and protections, but wizards /should not/ take away what makes them happy, just make sure that their happiness remains untainted and pure.

All of this could be achieved either with or without setting them free, and I am of two minds on that matter. On the one hand I cam easily see the elves seeing at as the ultimate service, to give of themselves freely and without reward to the totality of their being by binding thmeselves to another, an ultimate act of service. On the other hand, the service of an elf is in many ways not their own to give if they are the servant of another in perpetuity, and that cheapens the gift as well. I say start by addressing the house elves protections and legal rights, and then once they have those and are used to them get the house elves opinions on whether they want to be free to give of themselves as they see fit, or if they want to bind themselves permenantly to another.
