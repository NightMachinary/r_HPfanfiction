Looking for fics where Harry through some temporal anomaly or time loop desperately tries to level out the playing field sometime after Voldemort returns. Not looking for MoD/reincarnated in 11 year old body fics. I want 14-16 year old Harry desperately trying to even out his odds of survival- even if he ultimately fails. It can be dark Harry, but I'd prefer it if he had good intentions outside of defeating Voldemort by any means nessasary. Thanks!


** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I) and its sequels fit the bill. There is a very large time loop involved, and Nizar is Harry

** The Many Deaths of Harry Potter kinda applies. It starts when he's 10, though. Really fun work. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]])

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
