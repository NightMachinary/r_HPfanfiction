So, I know its been batted around how old Dumbledore really is but if we take he actually was around 150 that means he grew up in the mid 1800s. So I wonder how that would influence him. Like, maybe he knew about Harry's abuse but by like, 1850s standards Harry's relatives were not that bad(not that it excuses Dumbledore). Would also explain why he isn't bothered by Snape being very abusive to his students.


** Dumbledore was actually pretty progressive for his age (which was 115 not 150 at his death). Violence free education is a thing from the late 20. century and he banished corporal punishment from Hogwarts.

To the rest: I don't think it's that Dumbledores age is the reason Hogwarts seems pretty backwards in his pedagogy but JK Rowling. She grew up in England of the 60/70ies. In Great Britain the last privat schools outlawed corporal punishment in 2004 - public schools outlawed it not earlier than 86. Corporal punishment in families isn't outlawed till this day only "immoderate chastisement". The Child Act which protects minors was only racified in 1989 (two years before Harry went to Hogwarts) So as awful anything the Dursleys did - in the 80ies it wasn't even illegal.

*** The thing is, I'm not sure anything the Dursleys do would be illegal even /now./ There would be an investigation into why he was kept in a cupboard, and the home would probably be judged as an unsuitable environment for him (and probably Dudley) but in terms of actual illegality - they don't hit him often (so mild chastisement), he's not locked in, he is (despite what fanon says) allowed to use the loo, eat (just not the good food) and access education.

The point where they cross a line according to UK law is when they lock him into the bedroom and don't feed him/let him out for the bathroom in CoS. Up to that point, and indeed after it, their behaviour is highly immoral yet not illegal. Which is utterly mind boggling when you really think about it.

**** I agree with you with exception that Vernon tries to choke him in Book 5. Harry has a small bout of accidential magic that helps him out there. Pretty sure you aren't allowed to choke your children. I think that's the only time beside CoS Vernon could have actually be arrested for abuse.

****** i mean, Butters from South Park is an example on how grounding affects a child, he essentially charges all negative emotions he has against his friends and parents into professor chaos.

Theres also the fact that Petunia threw a frying pan after him and he didnt react like it was something crazy, implying that having heavy objects thrown at himself isnt out of the ordinary and actually quite normal.

Dursleys as pepole that raises Harry is horrible, it didnt age well at all, when we have the other responsible "good" pepole in the story send him back without ensuring a healthy source of food or ability to do his summer homework.

** I think he was heavily progressive because of his upbringing. It's noted in the books often how Argus filch keeps referring to the good old days of corporal punishment, which was ousted whilst Dumbledore was headmaster. He slams umbridge for daring to try and manhandle Marrietta. Chances are when he was a student things were a bit more sinister and he aimed to influence change. He purged the library of dark arts books to try and prevent students under his care falling under the way side also.

But then he goes and locks a Cerberus in a corridor for 9 months so who knows!

** Dumbledore knew from the start that the Dursley were bad, as he explained to Harry during their talk in OotP. The reason why he still chose to put Harry there was because, at the time, it was still the "least worst" choice. The Dursley may have been bad guardians, but they still took Harry in, letting him enter Hogwarts healthy, pretty well adjusted and . . . alive, something that was far from assured had Harry been raised in the magical world (between the people worshipping the "Boy-Who-Lived" and the Death Eaters wanting revenge or a new Dark Lord to follow).

I also want to point that, even by the 1990's standards, the Dursley are not really that bad. I mean, they would never win the "Parents of the Year" award (neither for Dudley, nor for Harry), but judging by what we see in Canon, the only true Red Flag is sleeping in a cupboard. It's not like they were beating Harry daily, or treating him as a House Elve : The few chores done by Harry in Canon are either a special circunstance (Dudley birthday or trying to bribe Vernon to sign a paper), or a punishment (CoS).

As for Snape, I don't think Dumbledore could have done anything else. Snape was, before anything else, a spy, and Dumbledore needed to keep him in a position where he could "justify" the informations he gathered. Without his positon at Hogwarts, I doubt Snape would have survived his 1st meeting with Voldemort in GoF, so Dumbledore had to keep him there, no matter how bad he was. Though I'm also convinced that Snape was especially bad to Harry (and Harry's year in general). Not that he would ever be a good teacher, just be a bit more harsh/ bullying whenever Harry was near).

*** I'm not sure that sleeping in the cupboard is even a “red flag”. (Not in terms of how a kid should be treated, of course, especially when there's a spare bedroom, but in an absolute sense.)

I had a friend with a lot of siblings whose parents were poor. She slept on a small mattress that rolled out from underneath her sibling's bed, in a small room with 4 other people. I'm sure there were times when she would have loved a small spot of her own-and a cupboard under the stairs, provided it had room enough to spread out and sleep in, might have been an improvement on her actual situation.

I think “cupboard under the stairs” sounds more horrific than it actually is---which, if it's warm, dry, and has appropriate bedding---is hardly worse than what a number of poor children (who are not victims of abuse except insofar as poverty can be considered abuse) have to deal with on a daily basis.

**** I think it was more the fact that the Dursleys had two other bedrooms available in the house (Dudley's other room and Marge's guest room). It would've been more acceptable if the Dursleys were poor, didn't have another room, had many other children, etc. Since none of those applied to them, the cupboard is a "red flag".

**** Idk, he makes friends with Ron and Hagrid pretty fast. He shuts down Malfoy in the robe shop in a confident yet non-confrontational way. He's socialised enough to appropriately approach Molly to ask how to get on the platform - and indeed she comments on how well mannered he is. He adapts to Quidditch - a team game - almost instantly. He understands social cues in a way that, for example, /Hermione/ (of all people) absolutely doesn't.

I think canon Harry is really well adjusted actually. He's friendly, he's polite, he can adapt to different social situations (for example he understands that you speak to your peers differently to your teachers). Also, the fact that the books narration (which is from his perspective) comments on things like Snape's poor hygiene and rude manner and Ron's lack of mealtime etiquette means that he notices these things and recognises them for the social faux pas they are.

The only real thing that could point to him being a "social cripple" is that for the first three books he only ready has two close friends (three if you count Hagrid) and even that is debatable - he's on good terms with most of Gryffindor and actively "matey" with the Quidditch team. And most people only have a few "best friends" but are "surface friendly" with other people.

The other part of it of course is that he's a teenager and they're notoriously self absorbed, even ones that aren't constantly being attacked by a deranged mass murderer.

**** Where did Rowling say that? I don't recall a definitive answer to his age coming out until his bio on Pottermore was released.

1881 is different to 1996, yes. But 1850 would have been even drastically more so. In all honesty, social attitudes in 1881 were pretty much the same as social attitudes in the first half of the 20th century. It was only after the Second World War that British society began to be more open, less deferrent, and so on. A poor family in the 1920s had a similar life to a poor family in the 1880s.

Between the 1850s and 1880s though, there was huge amounts of social change - including extending the voting franchise to most men, making child labour illegal, making school compulsory and so on.

1881 was radically different from 1850, but 1939 - when Tom Riddle was at Hogwarts and Dumbledore was teaching - was not radically different from 1881. The 1990s were different, but by then Dumbledore was over 100 and set in his ways. But whether he was nearly 150 or only 115 when he died would actually be really important to this argument because attitudes specifically to children and schooling underwent a massive overahaul between the 1850s and 1880s, so his formative years would be very different depending which decade he was born in.

It also explains why McGonagall, who was quite a bit younger than him (she was 11 in 1927-8 at the earliest as this is the point when Albus started teaching Transfiguration and he mentored her in the subject, so she's a minimum of 35 years younger) has very similar social attitudes to him. But if he had been a product of the 1850s, not the 1880s, they would have clashed not complemented.
