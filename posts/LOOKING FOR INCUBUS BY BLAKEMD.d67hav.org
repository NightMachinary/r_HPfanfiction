It seems this story has been taken down off of FFT.net, Hpfanfictionarchive, and I was wondering if anyone had a link or at least a way to download it. It's one of my favorite smut stories. Please. Reddit. Lend me your strength!!!


** You can download it [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Blakemd&sort=author][here.]]

** Last update I got was up to chapter 22 that was a year ago. I only have up to chapter 16 though.

That author also went by the username squarerootbeer so that might be something else to use to search

*** Is that chapter 22? If so, as far as I know, that's the farthest the author got with the story.

** I was searching for it but apparently it was deleted on ffn.net. Instead I stumbled upon another story with the same name in which voldemort and Harry are having gay sex. I'm scarred now. It's creepy how big an audience there is for that kind of stuff. Also, is it me or do gay people have weirder kinks than straighr people?
