Yes, I know, a very controversial topic. Yes, yes, yes all the atheists and theists will be up in arms about every single issue. But this is fiction and fantasy, so please bear that in mind. We're good? Nice.

In canon they celebrate Christmas, specifically. With presents, tree, decorations and such. So basically cultural Christmas in 90s UK. They swear by the Lord etc.

Many fics go the Yule route, in that only muggleborn celebrate Christmas and that most wizards are pagan or non-religious. Which is weird. If anything wizards, as they are slower to change than muggles, would be MORE Christian than late 20th century muggles. They separated in the 17th century, at the time when the majority of Europe was Christian in one way or the other (apart from Muslims in the Empire and various minorities). So if we consider a pure historical perspective, as canon lays it down, then the wizarding world in Britain should be very much Church of England (Catholics are disenfranchised for instance, poor Seamus).

And so on, and so forth... There are a lot of issues with the pagan wizards which is so much loved by fanon. I won't write a treatise about it, because it would take forever and nobody here would even attempt to read it.

So what do you think should be the default religion, if any, of the wizarding world?

Considering their power over reality, would they hold to any religion at all?

Is it even possible for druidism, which was eradicated in the 1st Century BC, to still be present?

Are the Roman and native pagan beliefs from the 4th century still present?

You get the drill.

This conclusion does not follow at all. Wizard can never have been fully integrated into muggle society.

Hogwarts, for example, would have been in hostile territory for most of its student body for one time or another if muggle borders ever mattered to wizards.

Pureblood ideology predates those times as well. How is it imaginable one of those wizards accepted a muggle king ruling over them? Wizards have /far too much/ power to be ruled over by someone without the same abilities.

Every influental position in society would have been held by someone with the ability to control others with a flick of their wand if those wizards would have cared to do so. There would never have been a witch hunt if the king and the pope would have been wizards.

The only model of wizarding-muggle history that would vaguely hold up to any scrutiny is that wizards never /bothered/ with ruling the masses, preventing famines, winning wars, healing the sick.. And that only makes sense if they were up to their own thing most of the time.

You didn't meet the local witch in your sunday mass or by waving over your garden fence to your neighbour. You sought her out in her remote little cabin in the woods where she and her coven were minding their own business.

Sure, they celebrate a gift-giving holiday they call christmas. Just like easter, these are just repackaged versions of whatever the previous society already celebrated.

If the wizarding world were christian, we would have noticed.

*** It's a very interesting point, but I think you ignore one very poignant issue, mainly that the 17th century and before were not the modern world. You equate history to current reality, which is a fundamental error. People in the year 1000 AD had a very different view of the world than you do now. Hell, people from the early 1900s had a very different view of the world than you do know. Current cultural biases have no place in historical analysis.

Pureblood ideology is a non-issue in this context. It's mostly a clannish problem, not a religious or even cultural one. If the wizards were just living among muggles, as canon leads us to believe (remember that), then the differences in culture would be minimal. They spoke the same language, they bought the same food on the market, they drank the same beer in the tavern, etc. The only problems with muggleborns, would be the same as in canon (that they come from non-magic).

In fact, you can see the British historical world in JKR's wizarding one (which is of course intentional).

And yes, if there was no separation then you would meet your local witch on Sunday Mass. It just stands to reason.

I can give you credit, that I can believe in some reclusive society of wizards that didn't want to interact with the predominantly Christian muggles in the 1600s and went into hiding. But that would require no muggleborns, which were a point of contention back in the 1000s, no contact with muggles and no cultural contamination. It would also require wizards to not use Latin, which they do. All the Romans left in the 400s AD on the Isles were Christian, there's no escaping that.

***** ehhh what? Middle English most likely. Old English in the early medieval period. French was only used by the invading nobility after 1066 and was quite quickly abandoned in normal parlance. Gaelic and Welsh was mostly used by local and national minorities, not common when you wanted to trade. Latin was the Church language and the language of the intellectuals.

I don't understand your objections. It's like you don't realise the realities of a pre-modern world.

*** JKR was very unspecific about the witch hunts, which causes some confusion in the fandom. At first it was Wendelin the Weird route, when they were mostly ineffectual. Later, when she went the revisionist route (Black Hermione, Gay Dumbledore, Cursed Child etc.) she stated that they fled persecution. So I don't think it's a strong argument, since it's self contradictory. Damn JKR make up your mind for once.

As to spells mimicking what Jesus did. I agree that many miracles in the Bible could be magical in origin. Apart from the raising the dead and resurrection.

I can totally buy an atheist Wizarding world. It makes sort of sense with their power over reality. But, again quoting historical precedent, wouldn't they think they are God's chosen people even more?

How is it self contradictory? There would be more than one way to effectuate the witch hunts, Wendelin the Weird was a comment that made the burnings ineffectual, that does not say that witch hunting was ineffectual.

Why would they? I don't know the Bible extremely well, but from what I do know, nearly everything in it, the witches and wizards likely are able to do, bar creation of earth (and even that might be shaky). They could just think that the Bible was some witch/wizard messing with the muggles.

***** Witch hunts were ineffectual against powerful witches like Wendelin, but not against everyone. Muggleborns, children, anyone not capable of a wandless flame freezing charm would be in trouble. Maybe a flame freezing potion or powder would be invented to make surviving a witch hunt easier. Maybe with a built in escape feature.

***** First point. No. Harry was learning that as part of History of Magic course in his second year. At that age you are just learning the main points not the nuances. Therefore she was the image that the teacher wanted to plant in the minds of his students. So your argument makes no sense. If they were effective, they wouldn't teach 12 year olds about Wendelin the Weird. It makes no sense. It's like teaching children that war is very nice and nobody died, ever.

??? I don't know if you read the same Bible I did, but even Voldemort would struggle to replicate some of the feats that are mentioned there. Parting the sea? The most we saw wizards do is making a small stream of water appear from their wand. Turning a river into blood? Killing every first-born in the entire nation? Resurrecting people from the dead? Yeah, you're just plain wrong.

As to adopting their religion and belief. In canon, there was no separation between muggles and wizards before the Statute. Which is late 17th century. Considering the muggleborns that would constantly enter the society and the fact that wizards celebrate Christmas, it's evident that wizards and muggles before the Statute were a single people, with very similar beliefs (at least according to canon).

Why not? You teach them about it all, and mention that one such method was ineffective because of the flame-freezing spell. We get a very small glimpse into the course itself, for all we know the witch hunts were bad and Harry was narrating that part specifically because witch burning is a big part and that was the one part that was ineffective (edit: that he didn't know about). At no point were we specifically told that the witch hunts were ineffective, just that burning a witch was pointless. It could be something like this

Main Points:

- Witch Hunts - was a bad time in history (no reason he would narrate it, witch hunting was a prevalent thing in the muggle world too)
- Witch Burnings - part of the witch hunt, ineffective because flame-freezing.

There main point, both get taught, not contradictory. I'm not saying you're wrong that the witch hunts were ineffective, I'm just saying you have no basis for that and it isn't contradictory by Rowling claiming wizards chose to flee the hunts despite witch burnings not being effective.

Like I said I don't know the bible too well so I'll just hit on your points.

- Parting the sea, why not? You say all we saw is making a small stream of water appear, but that isn't remotely the same thing. I'd have to double check if its in the book, but in the movies, Dumbledore took control of the water and created a sphere to surround Voldemort, who says he couldn't have just parted the water as well he could control it.
- River into blood, one word: Transfiguration
- Killing every first-born - how is that not replicatable? I'm not sure how that was done, but I mean it seems pretty replicatable with enough followers, as shitty as that sounds.
- Resurrecting people from the dead? That's fair, but it could just be an exaggeration. If they were making fun of muggles and making them believe in the Bible, why wouldn't they sound far-fetched at points? So no I am not "plain wrong"

I'm not even going to touch your last point because I don't really care enough about what the religion is and don't see the problem of pagan witches and wizards that you seem to find with it. The only thing I'll say about it is that just because they celebrate Christmas in canon, doesn't mean fanfiction can't change it up and choose to have them be pagan and change the history because that is the point of fanfiction.

******* Even if the witch burnings were a huge problem, every culture edits their history a bit to make it look more palatable.

Wizards see themselves as vastly superior to muggles, of course they would focus the narrative on what make them look better.

I'm also very unconvinced magical people were ever truly integrated into normal society. What we know of our muggle-world history is either heavily censored or magic just never had a lot of influence. And that can only ever have been by choice of those who could have ruled countries with a flick of their wand and won wars with another one, while healing epidemies and preventing famines left and right..

Except there are? Them changing witches and wizards to celebrate Yule implies that they did not celebrate Christmas even before the Statute and I don't see any problem with that.

You claim you see a problem with it which is fair, I can't discuss it though because I don't know what those problems are that you see and I would believe that the writers don't see a problem with it too because it would be an implied change that doesn't require too much if any discussion.

The only real problem I see with it is what you brought up about wizards being slower to change, I don't see that as a problem if the wizarding world never started celebrating Christmas or any of the religions that do celebrate it which would be implied.

** You know there is already [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dnks4a/discussion_a_question_of_faith/][a thread about this,]] it hasnt been even 18 hours since it was posted.

I am just going to post my answer from the other thread.

#+begin_quote
  I think Abrahamic religions make most sense for wizards.

  The worship of Pagan Gods usually had some purpose in mind that a wizard could easily achieve with magic, like there is no reason to pray for success in something when magic already guarantees it.

  With Abrahamic religions the promised reward lie in the afterlife, which wizards know nothing about beyond its existence, they are also as religions go much more well suited for international communities rather than pagan gods which were often bound locally.

  And I doubt atheism would really be a thing among wizards since they still have a lot of questions about the universe like where everything comes from or what happens after Death, while at the same time they know that the supernatural is absolutely real and that muggle science is wrong, so they have lots of religions which offer a variety of (potential)answers to these questions.

  I don't believe everyone is very devout though, I just think that while they would in general believe in god, they would only really practice religion when its convenient and probably have some interpretation of holy books that are somewhat less strict.

I dunno about your answer. I can understand the afterlife argument, it makes sense. Wizards know that afterlife exists (ghosts). I'm not sure about your comments regarding devotion though. Most insular communities tend to become very spiritual and religious (call it God, Manitou or Flying Spaghetti Monster). I can see the same happening to the wizarding world. I mean THEY can control reality. Muggles can't. THEY can do things similar to the prophets and gods of different religions.

You see where I'm heading?
