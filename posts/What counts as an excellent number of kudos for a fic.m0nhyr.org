Discounting word count, number of chapters, any other metrics that may or may not influence the kudos count etc, what is the number of kudos that makes you go "wow, that's amazing!"? I'm not talking about "oh this fic looks somewhat successful" kudos. I want to know what counts as a high number to people.

I understand it's bad to compare my own kudos count to that of others as a fic writer, but I also want to know what people consider a generally great number to aspire to.


** I don't want to burst your bubble, but I don't think there's an answer to this question. The truth is that the number of Kudos depends on Hits along with a whole host of other things (is your pair a rare one? Do you change things a lot? etc.)

I totally get where you're coming from though. I write as well, and it's SOOO tempting to get caught up in the numbers. I would say that as long as you enjoy your story and like the process of writing it, then you've produced something worthwhile. Along those lines, if you have commenters who express that your story has improved their day or made them happy...THAT'S far more important than a Kudos.

Anyway, I know this wasn't the answer you were looking for, but I firmly believe that writing Fanfiction is a passion project. If we make it about numbers, we risk discouraging those people who aren't reaching the arbitrary figure we put forward.

** Well, I consider it an accomplishment that the two fanfics I've put on AO3 (neither are HP fanfics) have slightly better than a 10:1 hits:kudos ratio. Although they both have less than 1,000 hits.

** As a reader I don't really use kudos as a signal to say good fic or bad fic. More kudos can be just because the fic has popular ships or tropes. Maybe that the writer is pretty active in fandom communities. So yeah, don't let the kudos stuff get to you as a writer!

** This is extremely dependent on the ships & tropes, some of which have cult followings. Be sure you tag your stories properly. Also, longer fics with more chapters published over a longer period of time will get more play in the "recent" feed. Another thing that might affect all the stats is if you already have people subscribed to your user account, which will automatically bring in some readers who already like your prior work and are /much/ more likely to interact with the new one.

All that said, I write in an extremely popular ship, and my most popular fic by far has 320 kudos, most of which occurred during the first three days, when I staggered posting the 5 chapters over my typical peak time for readership during a holiday season.

The first time I write something that reaches 500 kudos, I'm throwing a party. That's my /personal/ amazement level.

When I spot a fic with over a thousand kudos and tags that I dig, that's when I go /damn that's a lotta love/ and drop it on my 'Marked for Later' list if not read it immediately.

** 2,000 is my benchmark.

I once sorted HP stories on fanfiction.net by favorites and started working down the list looking for stories to read. Currently, the top story has 33k favorites and I remember finding it very hard to find stories I wanted to read when I got down to the 2,000s. This set my personal standard.

AO3 has 288k+ works in Harry Potter. If you sort by kudos, the top work has over 40k kudos. If you go down to the 2,880th work (roughly the top 1% by kudos), it has just under 2,000 kudos. Top 0.1% has about 7,000 kudos so that's probably a better standard for "amazing".

Now, you can definitely find good stories below 2,000 kudos/favorites. One-shots especially can flicker in and out of feeds too quickly to gather many kudos/favs. But for long stories that have been around a while, 2,000 is my benchmark for "worth checking out".

** If 20% of the hits is equal to or greater than the amount of kudos... that makes me think “huh, can't be that bad, let's give it a try.”

** 2,000-3,000 is a good number that if the description is decent I'll probably take a look, over 10k and it's even more likely.

** The Harry Potter story with the most "kudos" on AO3 has 41,441.

I don't think that fic is particularly impressive, so you should probably be aiming to get at least 50,000.
