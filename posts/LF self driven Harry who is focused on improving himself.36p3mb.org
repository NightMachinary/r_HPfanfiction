Anything goes: Apprentice/mentor fic where Harry is gaining a mastery, A Harry that is trying to gain control over wandless magic, A harry who is really passionate/advanced in one subject, A Harry who loves reading and studying, An OP Harry who is winning the triwizard tournement easily, A Harry/Hermione fic where Harry gets really into studying as he realises he is being lazy and not achieving enough, A Harry who is really into martial arts or a really good musican, OP dark Harry etc

Basically I'm at uni and it's the time of year where lots of work has to be done. Maybe its weird but during this time of year I love reading fics like this to keep me motivated.


** - in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][HP & the Nightmares of Futures Past]] (W: 409,130; WiP), when Harry goes back in time and gradually forms a group with his friends-to-be, they start methodically training, learning and practising in order to be as ready as possible for the impeding darker times.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] (W: 363,743; abandoned for 1.5years), Harry is raised to have a good working and study ethic. Later he gets sorted into Slytherin, where he eventually manages to convince some older housemates to give some practical study sessions to him.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] (W: 152,578; abandoned for 9 months), the trio try to improve themselves partially through training and partially through R&D.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109003/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Maw][HP & the Maw]] (W: 426,464; abandoned), Harry gets himself stuck with a personal tutor who always tends to drive him the extra mile in order to make him adequate for the coming confrontation with Voldemort.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] (W: 232,797; abandoned for 9 months), Harry tries to improve his chances of survival by studying some dark magic.
- for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] (W: 695,420; abandoned for 5 months) at least [Apprentice/mentor fic where Harry is gaining a mastery] and [A Harry that is trying to gain control over wandless magic] apply.
- maybe also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] (W: 100,387; complete) but I don't remember if it was definitely the case in this one.

edit: You can also have a look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance trilogy]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] (W: 183,000; abandoned), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/70/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] (W: 445,199; WiP). The protagonists' drive is more academically-focused in the last two stories though. The main plot line in Arithmancer doesn't differ much from the canon for 1991--1994.

There is also [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] (W:355,026; WiP), but the protagonist is an OC (Xander from Buffy) and the story feels like a crackfic at times, TBF.

***** Read the resonance trilogy, it is quite decent.

Will look into 'The Well Groomed Mind' and I'll maybe check out 'The Arithmancers'. Hermione centric fics usually write her as Batman on amphetamines and an unlimited supply of deus ex machinas.

Thanks for the suggestions!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], by The Santi. Is by one of the best written fics I have read. There are some more chapters published in the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][DLP]] forum.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/1/The-Weapon-Revised][the Weapon]] Harry responds to Sirius' death by deciding to study a crazy amount. YMMV with Harry, though if you want him to be driven then its right up your street, but most other characters are very effectively portrayed.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]] Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

This is the first "book". The second one is complete and the third is in progress. It's a good read.

*** I'm reading this now and I like the story, but something in the writing really bugs me. I'm not talking about the editing (which this book at least could really use) but the sentence structure, phrasing, etc just... bugs me.
