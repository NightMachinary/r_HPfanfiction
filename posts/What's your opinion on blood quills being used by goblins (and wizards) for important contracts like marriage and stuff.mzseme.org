I was reading a fic one of the harry goes to the goblins fics were harry does a blood test and he had to sign something with a blood quill so it got me wondering

what's your opinion on blood quills fully illegal semi illegal not legal to keep in the home

Either way it would be illegal to use it on children till they come of age


** Canon, it was called a /black/ quill and it was invented by Umbridge (so it wouldn't be in use anywhere else).

But for AUs, "signing in blood" is a very old trope and a blood quill seems more "civilized" than cutting yourself and dipping a regular quill in your own blood. Most people wouldn't need to have them in their homes, but anyone dealing with contracts might have them at work.

*** I chose to ignore canon because that would mean admitting Umbridge was smart enough to invent something, and I die before I compliment her.

***** Yeah and it annoys me because either she is totally evil and learn that spell so she can be around dementors or she is actually good at defence and that just makes me angry that she made kids hate the subject.

***** Pottermore can't really be used as a source for canon anymore considering it had been taken down along with all its data. WizardingWorld.com does mention Umbridge but it doesn't mention her inventing the quill.

** I like it. But I tend to like the good!goblin storylines.

Though my head-canon was that a Black a ancestor came up with them, slightly informed by canon's naming the ‘black quill', which I always misread and thought there was a capital ‘B', so thought it was an old Black family artefact.

But as munin says above, it makes sense that if things needed to be signed in blood, using an artefact to make it a more expedient and ‘civilised' process makes so much sense. As someone who used to draw with ink, the natural tendency to clot, and sheer amount of blood one would have to let in order to get enough to write with is a lot more than if the quill just took it from you---And then there is also the danger of leaving a pot of your blood around for someone to steal and use in shady ritual or location spells or whatever else

so yeah, using them for things like binding contracts makes sense. And I can also see Black ancestors cruelly using them to punish their kids as well (but I can also see a cruel bitch like Umbridge coming up with that all by herself too)

** Based upon your name on here, I'd ventue to guess that you're used to separate entities handling specialized financial services. Once upon a time banks were really an all in one shop for financial planning. I really don't think that JKR was all that concerned with doing anything other than writing stories that were centralized around magic rather than finance or politics.

** I am personally not a big fan, but that's mainly because I don't like neither the "Magical Contracts" or "Good! Goblins" (or rather Goblins in any role outside of basic banking).

**** For some reason, Curse Breaking never really bothered me (maybe because it gives this "magical" fell). It's all the "modern" financial service that I dislike.

Basically, I think that the Magical World is too small to support a modern financial system (Stock Exchange, loans . . .). I also think that the Goblins dislike the Wizards (at best), and I would not trust them as far as I can throw them. Asking them to keep a vault safe is one thing, but in my opinion any wizard asking the Goblins to invest their money would see them purposefully make terrible investments just to see him ruined.

But it's just my headcanon and I can understand why some people would want to give a bigger role to Gringott

***** Exactly. While there shouldn't be a wizarding stock market there could be ownership in businesses. But we dont have any evidence that the goblins act as more than security box guards. Finally why do wizards even use gringots. Especially after rebellions why are wizards so trusting of goblins. finding a cave and using a few concealment spells and apperating there and back would be easier to use and very safe, especially if you didnt tell anyone where it was.

If I had to make a guess, I would say it's mainly for the security. From what we saw in Canon, not all the wizards would be able to truly protect a cave (hell some can't even Apparate), some for most wizards, Gringott provide a better protection than what they would be able to do by themselves.

Gringott also provide the advantage to transfer the responsability of the Gold. In the (unlikely) case Gringott get robbed, it is the fault of the Goblin and the victim should expect some compensations. While a wizard getting his cave robbed can't do anything about it (outside of trying to find the robber by himself).

** I like the idea of Blood Quills being used to sign binding legal documents and because of that they are heavily restricted. They /can/ be used, but only in legal settings and in the presence of an authorized holder/user as well as an independent third party as a witness.
