** To quote Shigeru Miyamoto /"a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad"/.

If the game need to be delayed, it's good that they do it. Or else we may end up with another Cyberpunk 2077 or worse, a Balan Wonderworld.

*** Even if it is good, remember to pirate it unless you want your money going to J.K. Rowling.

** I'll wait until 2030 if the game they do release is good. I'd rather a VERY late good game, than an on time pile of garbage every time.

*** sadly that is not even a secure bet in this world, just look at Cyberpunk.

My best advice: Do not get overhyped and do not pre-order. Wait and see how other people react to it, before buying it.

**** I don't need to preorder it to be dissapointed at a bad game.

Every missed opportunity is a waste and reduces the chance for a great game for me to play.

** Yeah this was announced a minute ago, but I'm sure it will be a good game when it does release. Avalanche is a consistent studio

** Hope It doesnt end like Vampire Masquerades 2. Since its set in the 1800s I wonder if you will meet Dumbledore as a classmate.

** I've not heard much about the game, but it is nice to see games being delayed instead of rushed. Idk if I'll ever play the game since I don't have playstation but in general it's good development practice. The trailers look very pretty though, and it'll be fun to see some old-fashioned wizarding stuff, rather than the same era rehashed.

*** Only marginally related but does anyone know how closely this is tied to r*wling? I understand money will likely go to her for the rights and stuff but I'm really hoping for some less bigoted people heading the project

**** Unfortunately the lead designer was recently outed as a complete monster. He's a big anti-feminist creator who was heavily involved in Gamergate.

I've been waiting for a good HP game since like 2005, but I won't be putting money towards this project.
