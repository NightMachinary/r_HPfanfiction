This is such a pet-peeve of mine.

In book canon, at least, Harry gets his Hogwarts letter two weeks before his eleventh birthday, so surely everyone else would get theirs around the same time? I can see maybe the Muggleborns getting their's a bit earlier, to compensate for the fact that the teachers have to visit to explain what's happening. The letters also state that they “await [their] owl no later than July 31st,” presumably to allow Wizarding families to discuss sending their child to Hogwarts or a different Wizarding school, so if a child's birthday is in August, then it makes no sense to get theirs on their birthday.

((Sorry is anyone finds this confusing, I am well aware that I'm not the most articulated person out there))


** I think people make mistakes and forget that Harry's Hogwarts letter was only /successfully/ delivered on his birthday. Hundreds were sent before then that failed to reach their intended recipient.

You know, as funny as that sequence is, you'd think that Dumbledore would have taken a hand in ensuring the letter was properly delivered /sooner/, given just how many letters were sent out to ONE %$#%ING STUDENT.

***** She didn't read them. Harry read them (he found Hedwigs name in the history book). Hermione on the other hand learned them by heart and could quote them on the first day of school. She also understood parts of it so well she could perform simple spells before she even entered the train although there were theories in them which were completly foreign for her and her family. That's the difference between a normal child who is exited for a new school (Harry) and a child prodigy (Hermione). Reading two books per week isn't special for a curious kid - knowing them by heart is.

** If they knew on their 11th birthday, that would mean that Hermione had a whole year of knowing about magic as her birthday is the 19th of September (but due to age placement, she would have been in year six, the last year of primary school).

/"... It was ever such a surprise when I got my letter..."/

I don't even know if she ever alludes to when she got her letter, but if we look at the majority of the time, I would assume that most muggleborn (First Gen) Hogwarts Acceptance letters would be sent a week after primary school ends for the school year (Around 18-24 June give or take a few days) to allow them time absorb the information and the fact that they won't be going to a secondary school of their choosing.

/"My name was put down for Eton, you know..."/ Justin Finch-Fletchley.

For children of magical descent, they would have been told about magic all their lives (with the exception of Harry) and aware of Hogwarts for most of their childhood. They would get letters sent out at a more regular notice (two weeks before the 31st of July) to allow owls travelling across the U.K (give or take a few useless defense teachers (/HemHem/)).

By the time second years letters arrive, all first gen would get their letters the same time as those born to magicals.

I have no idea if I'm rambling here but this is my take on it.

And it's not only book canon where Harry gets his letter before his birthday. In the movie he also get it at least some days before his birthday - there is the scene where Vernon goes to work, the whole "No letters on Sunday"-scene and then the travel scene before Harrys birthday which started at the moment when Hagrid breaks into the hut.

There is also the scene where Dumbledore visits young Tom Riddle. It's raining. If he would have gotten his letter on his birthday that wouldn't make any sense. Tom was born in December and in the thirties there wasn't such a thing as climate change so there should have been snow and not rain.

For me, in middle europe, it means we don't have as snowy winters as we had when I was a kid about 20 years ago but instead rainy decembers. When I was a kid in the 90ies nearly each christmas we had snow. The last white christmas I remember now was in 2008. Its similar for Great Britain.

** It might be the reply to the school has to arrive by the child's eleventh birthday: there's no reason why every letter has to have the same text.

I think maybe ff authors assume the eleventh birthday has some magical significance, as the seventeenth does for removal of the Trace.

** It doesn't bother me because honestly I forget, too. lol It's a small thing in the long run, and I don't really think about it, but when an author does go out of their way to either be accurate in this sense or do something different (ex. all letters sent out same time the summer before the year) then it's definitely noticeable and appreciated.

** in a lot of fics, Harry was supposed to get his letter early since his birthday falls so close to the beginning of the school year, and other students whose birthdays fell at the end of July or in August get their letters early as well.

** This always bothers me! They find out the summer before, probably all around the same time, allowing for multiple visits to muggle families from teachers.

** To be clear, a future student receives their letter in the summer of whichever year they'll be turning eleven. Is this correct? I noticed Lucius Malfoy's birthday is a week after term starts- does this mean he was ten when his letter arrived?

** Honestly, not really. I think it's because I didn't notice until I sat down to figure out the timeline for... It must've been [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10987173/1/Violet-Elizabeth][Grandad Dudley]], an abandoned fic of mine from some years back? But that doesn't make sense? Because I remember doing this more recently? Maybe it was because I did have the letter arrive on Violet's birthday and when I reread it recently I thought that was strange?

It's more a "ah, that's not right" thing than something that annoys me (e.g. wards).
