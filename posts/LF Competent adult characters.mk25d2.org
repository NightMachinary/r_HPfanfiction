Can be good guys who are competent, can be bad guys. NO character Bashing. Bringing things up in canon isn't bashing to me. But going overboard like having Dumbledore blocking Harry's magic, or using his fame/fortune is bashing. Ron and the Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, Ginny giving Harry a Love Potion, Ron giving Hermione a love potion, is bashing to me, etc.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes/Asexual/Bisexual/Etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.

Anyone can be the MC/Can be on ANY site, Can be ANY length, etc.

I don't want perfect characters, I still want characters to make mistakes and learn from them. But I want more competent characters/and adult characters.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** It is depressing how rare this is. I am currently trying to write one and may soon get some posted because I find it really hard to enjoy stories with rampant incompetence from every character.

This took me far too long to find again, but linkffn(5856625). A crackfic of if Lily and Sirius had taken Harry away from Britain and done things properly

  Mad-Eye Moody always wanted kids, but it never happened. So he made due with a slew of apprentices.Until one day, he finds a little boy who needs someone to step up. Someone who can protect him from any threat, and more importantly, teach him how to protect himself.Or, how one adult stepping up can change the world (and also make people's heads spin).

** Time-shifted Harry masquerades as a resurrected James, raises his younger self, and falls for Amelia Bones. Both are competent. The writing in this story is excellent.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Dumbledore blocking Harry's magic, or using his fame/fortune
#+end_quote

Now, if he does these things to protect him, would you consider that bashing? Like, for example, he decides to block Harry's magic after receiving word of something happening at 4 Privet.

For the fame/fortune argument, if he does it to make sure Harry doesn't go overboard on things(which, if we're being completely honest, he probably would've in an effort to keep his friends)? And he makes sure Harry understands the darker side of fame due to his actions

That's fine. On the magic side of things, it'd be nice if Harry knew that his magic was being blocked.
