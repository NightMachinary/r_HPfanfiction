** What is the context of this excerpt? I don't really understand what it's about and am not totally sure if this is a joke or not. You said 'smirk' a lot, which is usually the sign of satire on Reddit. And what is 'falling backwards through the wards and vanishing'? It's not the Veil. Is there some kind of cloaking device around the Burrow, and why did he 'fall' through it? And why would someone borrow a couple lines of Harry and Ginny flirting? The flirting is arguably the most exciting part to write yourself.

Also, I think the second line has dialogue from both Harry and Ginny with nothing to distinguish the speaker? At first I was wondering if it was an AU where Harry had a bunch of brothers then realized it must be Ginny speaking, but I'm pretty sure Harry is the one saying, "No, you."

*** The “you do realise I have six older brothers” is also satire in feminist circles and menwritingwomen. Because obviously the only way a woman can be good at a (manly) thing is if she has a bunch of older brothers to teach her! Calling Ginny “girl” is also patronising and kind of weird. So I think this probably is satire or a joke.
