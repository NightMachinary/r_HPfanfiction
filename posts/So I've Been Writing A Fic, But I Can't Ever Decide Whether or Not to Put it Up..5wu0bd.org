** Chapters can be formatted in many ways but the best is that a chapter tells a self-contained b plot that should hopefully help advance the a plot of the overall story. Example: harry is at university, studying to be a healer. That's the a plot. The b plot of a chapter might be him having issues with a diagnostic spell and he gets help from another trainee healer to test the spell only to have it go wrong and her clothes vanish. Or he's injured by a backfire.
