:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I only really remember two scenes from this fic.

Harry is young-ish and in the Wizengamot chamber/hall in front of the lot of them. He asks if he can have a license to sell things he's made, demonstrating with some carved little thing that they near-mockingly coo over and give him the license.

Only it turns out that he tricked them all and he can make (in a legal sense, meaning these items were legally his products, not that he literally made each thing by hand) far more than that and they basically just gave him a license to make a massive pile of money. I think he had an animal ranch too, perhaps? But the fic was big on 'family monopolies' and such and some of what he kept hidden that he could make infringed some of those monopolies that other families had somehow.


** I remember that story basically all of the families have found a way to through the wizengamot to monopolize the businesses they own. I think it included Dumbledore stealing the ink monopoly from the potter family hence the giant squid in the lake. I'm away from my computer but when i get back i'll see if i can find the story.

*** Yeah, PoliticalJunkie remembered the ink thing in another thread ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g3lmi3/help/]]) and that provoked my monopoly memory, but I wasn't sure if my answer to their question was right, so I thought I'd check.

****** The author of this fic either started out or became a radicalized alt-right nut and clearly let their bias show through by basically inserting their views through Harry halfway through the fic.

******* Well, that's disappointing. Thanks for the warning, Harry is the last person who should hold such views. He has shown to accept marginalised people like Lupin without a thought and has never judged anyone based on their race or gender. Such a waste of a good concept.
