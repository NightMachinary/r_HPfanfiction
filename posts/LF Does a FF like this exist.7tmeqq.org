I had a scene in my head that Voldemort comes to the Potter's home only to be set up in a trap as Lily and James ambush him with Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore. Tom laughs and then asks if they really think they can beat him. James replies that yes, he thinks they can...but just in case he's wrong.... McGonagall, Flitwick, Slughorn, Amelia Bones and Mad Eye pop in as well. Voldemort smiles when two of his own pop in, wearing Death Eater masks before they take off the masks to show it's Snape and Peter who aim their wands at Voldemort. They all destroy Voldemort that night and its followed by an AU. Can anyone think of anything close to this or is it all in my head? Thanks!


** I only remember that one-shot where Dumbledore took the lesson "deal with a Dark Lord before he grows too powerful" from Grindelwald's war to heart and called his old pals to deal with Voldemort in the 70s.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.
