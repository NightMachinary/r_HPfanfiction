:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading an oc x Harry Potter fanfiction on Wattpad where the oc is Cho Chang's sister nicknamed Mulan. I really want to find this fic because it was one of the only fanfictions where I genuinely liked the "boyish" oc. I swear I followed the author and added the fic to my reading list but I looked for it one day and it was gone. I can't remember the name of the fic or the author's @ so I'm doomed :( Does anyone know the name or if it got deleted?

Here's details:

-Her name was Mulan\\
-Cho and Mulan are Chinese and use separate names for when they're with family and when they're at school\\
-She was a Gryffindor\\
-Had a skateboard\\
-Had a crush on Harry\\
-Comforted Cho in the beginning\\
-Cho Chang's sister\\
-I think the summary mentioned Harry falling into Mulan's arms but I'm not too sure about that one
