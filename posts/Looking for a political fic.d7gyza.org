:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I am trying to find this fic, but for the life of me, I cant remember the name of it. The key thing I remember of it is that both Harry and Neville gain their respected seats in the wizengamot. I think there were others who were part of the DA who took their seats, but that might be me miss remembering. They proceed to take Hogwarts to task for some of the poor teaching methods, and lack of safety, as well as challenge the status quo. Honestly, it came off as one of those Cliche Indy!Harry, and I kind of only want to just so I can know what it was. I think Harry was also young, no older then 20, but I am pretty sure he was still in school.

I also know it is NOT "A murderers plan", nor is it "Accidental animagus". It wasn't written as well as those fics. It also wasn't "Poison Pen", thought that is more in line with the level of story I am trying to remember. I am also sure that this was a finished story. While I can't remeber the ending, I never read a story that isn't finished.

EDIT: With the help of IamProudofthefish, I have figured it out. It was Honored to serve. I am sad to say that my memory was foggier then normal, and I misremembered key details of the fic. Thank you to all that helped me!


** This doesn't seem to quite fit but you might like linkffn(Honor a Hufflepuff).

** Neither of these is probably the one, but of them are lovely stories:

1. linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) ... despite the author, this is rather good story, it makes one think what is really important about the democracy (and how far my country is sliding from it :()
2. linkao3(proof by novensides) ... on the other hand, this story is really delightful, and aside from lovely political games, you get recipes from apparently good cakes, and an awesome Kreacher, the elf.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
