I get nervous and overthink summaries, so inevitably they are either dull or ridiculously cheesy. Could any of you give advice on the below?

*Theia and Harry are back. When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, the pair want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas on family, love and death rise to the surface.

Sequel to The Aurors.*

Any thoughts?

Love to you all!


** Honestly, you could probably just put 'Sequel to The Aurors' and folks will be beating down your door to read it.

But for the new customer:\\
Senior Auror Potter and his steadfast protege Theia find themselves drawn into one of those kind of cases; where helping the Obliviated victim dredges up problems from their own lives. Sequel to 'The Aurors'.

** Since it's a sequel, I'm assuming Theia would be a known entity to readers?

I think your summary is pretty good, if a bit wordy. May I suggest:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

After the second to last sentence (...their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface), you could added something else that foreshadows the consequences of these troubles and traumas, ie, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question everything they believed in.

** I'd read it based on that summary. It's descriptive enough that I'm interested it's better written than 99% of summaries.

** A different perspective using mostly the same theme.

"Sequel to The Aurors. The victim of a terrible crime, an obliviated woman turns to Theia and Harry as her last hope for justice. Evil deeds and sinister events are uncovered as they delve into the past of their mysterious client."
