Hi, everyone,

​

As you all may know, I'm doing a project where I'm attempting to create a comprehensive, complete wizarding world. Today, I'll be opening my worldbuildiing notes to the community. This is in preparation for a fic I'm going to be writing, so please try to be consistent.

​

Anyone can add or remove things as they wish. The link is below. All I ask is that you not troll.

​

I look forward to seeing what everyone here comes up with.

** You could at least say please before asking us to do the majority of the work setting up your story for you.

You phrase it as if this is some kind of service that you're doing for us instead of phrasing it as you should have: /A very, */very** humble request to please, maybe add some material to your notes.*

*** You're right. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that it would be taken this way.

Please help me add to my notes.

**** I shall, yes. /looms haughtily/

In all seriousness, I'll add some things I never managed to make relevant in my own stories (not cause they're bad, just cause they're overly theoretical) tomorrow.

** The way I see it, you did no writing since you've made a similar post months ago, except for going against canon when you wrote that the ICW was formed in the 14th century.
