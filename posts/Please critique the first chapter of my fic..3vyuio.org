** u/Lukc:
#+begin_quote
  The headaches started in February . . . but it was not always so.
#+end_quote

That's your first sentence, I don't get what you're trying to say here. "The headache started in *February*" -> this tells us already that it wasn't always so. We know it wasn't so before February, obviously. So the second part of the sentence doesn't make any sense. Unless I'm missing something.

** I'll try to help you out a bit. Going to be updating this post as I go along. Also, all of these revisions are based upon personal preference and should be taken with a grain (or mountain) of salt.

#+begin_quote
  It was a few years ago that they last lived in the country, his aunt Petunia had taken him and all of their belongings from the small estate they resided at to the nearest city hub.
#+end_quote

Instead of that first comma, you need a semicolon. If you want to leave the comma in, the correct form is his aunt Petunia having taken him. It is a bit awkward though, and I would rethink your usage of 'estate', as it sometimes implies a large amount of property, which is directly contradicting 'squalor'.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia was new to city life in general, but as a freelancer in her craft there was a magnitude more work in the city than in the country, not that they wanted for money; the money she'd won with the settlement would last five more years if they lived frugally, beyond that she'd get a few thousand added onto whatever wage she earned for another twenty.
#+end_quote

'In her craft' is unclear, and having read a few paragraphs down, it is still unspecified. Consider telling us what her craft is outright instead of having the reader wonder about it for most of your first chapter.

In this paragraph, you also use 'she had told' 'he had laughed' and then 'she had won' pretty much back to back. This kind of repetition is pretty boring, and I'm sure you can figure out different ways to say the same thing.

The part starting with 'Beyond that' needs to be a separate sentence.

Reading on a bit there also seems to be an excessive use of ‘she'd' in place of she would. Vary that too.

#+begin_quote
  Harry watched his aunt work with awed eyes as she deemed the flat ‘acceptable' with two days of redecorating.
#+end_quote

Instead of 'as', try using 'until'.

#+begin_quote
  She'd sanded the wooden floorboards in the main living room in three hours of horrendous noise. She was unapologetic for it (but paid the other two tenants thirty pounds apiece for the fuss). The tiles in the kitchen and the small bathroom were gleaming in even less time. The woodchip wallpaper -- Petunia's face could've been looking upon a mangled corpse, such was her expression when faced with it.
#+end_quote

Again with the 'she'd'. Really, just remove any instances of this at all from the story.

Also, you can't sand floorboards in noise.

#+begin_quote
  It was scraped off promptly and scrunched into mulch then thrown away.
#+end_quote

It was promptly scraped off, scrunched into mulch, and thrown away.

I've done quite a bit of interior decorating myself while helping out friends and family. The sheer speed of which it happens in this story is absurd, not to mention ordering a same-day carpet installation and trash removal (and the primary reason for redecorating was frugality?). It doesn't fit together with Petunia's earlier reasoning. Normally you would wait for both services instead of paying extra.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered useless facts perfectly and spewed them out at odd occasions. Other than those two traits he picked up his mother's level-headedness. From his father (a mysterious figure long dead) he'd received his looks -- almost every feature of his face apart from his eyes, which were as identically his mother's as Petunia's own eyes were identical to her fathers. But those eyes were poor of sight like his father's, too. He'd had to wear glasses for over a year now.
#+end_quote

I don't really care that you give Harry a very good memory, but kids who spend time learning don't just regurgitate information at random occasions.

I gave the rest of the chapter a pretty quick readthrough. I actually really like the idea of your story, but it could definitely be better written. You have a tendency to write really run-on sentences, and while a few of these are allowed, and you can set the tone by using them, too many just ends up confusing the reader. In addition, a lot of character actions don't really make sense, such as the ones I stated above. Other ones are:

Why do Sullivan and Tim hate football players? Unless I'm mistaken most boys at that age at least play a little, if only so they can be with literally every other kid at recess.

What other events in Harry's life have been so extraordinary that her aunt would tease Harry? Without prior mention of any of these events, the joke doesn't make sense.

You have Harry 'remembering basic manners' yet being kind of rude?

Overall, the story is written really awkwardly. There's no other way to put it. However, getting past that, you have very nuanced, particular descriptions which make the story very interesting to read. And though there are grammar issues, once you get out of past tense the story gets going really well. I would rewrite your entire introduction until Harry gets to school in present tense. And I would consider expanding on Harry's growing introversion, because it seems very sudden, like a sharp interjection in the story. I have friends who have experienced a similar sort of introversion, due to serious life events. Readmission is a VERY long, delicate process.

Hopefully this helps a bit.

**** Other than some slight style issues (which are negligible) I really enjoyed this introduction to your story, and am definitely looking forward to chapter 2!
