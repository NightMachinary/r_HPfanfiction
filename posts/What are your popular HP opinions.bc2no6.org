#+end_quote

No, the whole situation was insane. Just because Scabbers turned out to be a Death Eater in disguise in no way excuses Hermione for ignoring how Crookshanks was constantly attacking Ron's pet. This is an example of J K Rowling just handwaving Hermione's obvious flaws away. Had Scabbers been a normal rat (and Hermione was not aware that he wasn't, there's no using that as a justification), this would have been rightly considered by more fans as a major dick move on her part.

Ron and Harry fall out for a few months, from the announcement of the Champions to the day of the first task. While it is obviously Ron's fault at the beginning, it's clear that a few times Ron tries to make up with Harry but is rebuffed. In the second task, Ron is the one Harry would miss the most. Harry was miserable without Ron. Yet the fandom seems miserable with Ron's place at Harry's side.

There were great casting choices, but Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were a bit of a mistake. Emma was way too beautiful to play Hermione, and Rupert was too short and a bit too homely IMHO. This disparity in attractiveness, along with production wanting to promote Emma Watson's character, caused some significant distortions in the film adaptations that were unnecessary.

It didn't help that he's short (5'6"), as height is considered by many people as important for a man's attractiveness. My point is that Emma Watson was just that much more better looking than her two co-stars and the writing of the scripts started to reflect that as the stars grew older. By GoF, the midway point in the films, it was obvious that she was going to be a great beauty and Rupert especially wasn't going to match her.

Mcgonagall was both a badass and an amazing woman.

Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw should have had more representation, and Slytherin should have had more non-evil/not morally grey representation.

Hagrid doesn't get enough credit for being a pseudo father figure to Harry.

Could you please provide examples of Mcgonagall being a "badass" in a way that the other adults who supported Harry were not? I know this is a popular impression of her in the fandom, but I honestly fail to see any badass moments she had outside of the Battle of Hogwarts, where badass moments were handed out like dollar bills at a strip club.

Throughout the books she's either useless, missing or easily fooled. Just because her eyes go conveniently misty at the right emotional beats doesn't mean anything. When it's time for her to show up for her students, all the misty eyes in the world won't do a thing. She's like the opposite of Snape, in that she gives the appearance of goodness while not really doing much to forward the good agenda.

She argues with Umbridge, yes. Yet Umbridge still gets her way. At no point before this or after this does she ever reach out to Harry, in fact her words to him ("Just keep your head down this year") in part cause him to hide the scars on his arms from her. She has a great moment after several months of not doing her job very well.

Yet she's never there to punish Malfoy for his bullying ways. In fact, she punishes her own House far more harshly (someone tallied points teachers took throughout the books).

Trying and failing can be seen as badass, I guess. You've convinced me that she had a good heart and meant well. I just don't see her as competent enough to be called "badass". She fails a few too many times for me I guess. It's just unnerving when you realize that Snape had a far larger impact on the plot and the heroes' victory than McGonagall did.

****** That's totally fair. I'm definitely not going to say that she, or any other character, is above criticism. I think the coolest part of the series is that most every character has both good qualities and flaws. They're realistic in that way. And I wouldn't say that McGonagall's negatives outweigh or detract from her positives. I think she can be a badass at times and still fail at times. On the other hand, I'm never unhappy to see the flaws pointed out in the characters that the fandom tends to put on a pedestal. It's good to look at them from all angles.

And I do absolutely agree with you about Snape. I've always been a Snape lover, even well before his "redemption" arc happened, and I was thrilled to see all that he really did behind the scenes. And as much as I like to see flaws pointed out in someone like Mcgonagall or Hermione because it's interesting and thought provoking, it gets really old to see his pointed out constantly. It's like, geez, tell me something I haven't already heard 5 million times. (ETA clarity. I definitely don't mind discussing Snape or his negative traits, even tho I do like him. The annoying part is just hearing the "Snape was an incel" comments that are repeated ad nauseam. He was not a nice guy but he was an interesting character and reducing him to that is overly dismissive imo.)

****** I think that's arguably not the case considering the particularly negative light Rowling portrays Sirius in by the mouths of characters like Dumbledore and Molly Weasley, even Hermione who are obviously supposed to ‘speak truth and sense' in times of chaos like when people mistakenly think Sirius Black types are sympathetic. (i.e. easily recognizable voices of narrative intent/author self insertion)

To me, it's clear to see she's got a definitive line in the respectability politics sand saying there is a right way and a wrong way to handle rebellion. Compare the narrative treatment of Sirius with the narrative treatment of Snape who is no more morally correct as a character, potentially even morally worse, but treated much more sympathetically in the text despite all this because he adheres to what Rowling considers respectable forms of rebellion.

Putting those two foils side by side, it begins to looks like the text supports a reading of Snape as a sympathetic character but derides a reading of Sirius being sympathetic despite them both abusing their power in similar situations, Snape with students Sirius with Kreacher. Even though Kreacher was one instance of power abuse verses Snape having a pattern of this behavior for sixteen years or so wherein he was exposed to hundreds if not thousands of students.

******* I very much disagree that Snape got more narrative sympathy than Sirius. While Molly's argument that Harry is too young to get involved in the Order is reasonable, I think the plot really ends up proving Sirius right, because it is the withholding of information from Harry that ultimately results in Sirius's death. And the fact that Sirius's treatment of Kreacher is an outlier is explicitly stated in the text, by none other the Dumbledore:

#+begin_quote
  "Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated." (OotP, Chapter 37)
#+end_quote

In comparison, Dumbledore gives a much stronger rebuke to Snape:

#+begin_quote
  "You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. "You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?" (DH, Chapter 33)
#+end_quote

And while you're right that Dumbledore is often used as a voice of moral authority, in the end the series is from Harry's POV, and therefore his feelings on characters are going to highly color how the audience sees them, and he is steadfastly sympathetic to Sirius:

#+begin_quote
  He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered... OotP, Chapter 37)

  It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn's cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. (HPB, Chapter 4)

Now I might be a total relationship dummy but is /forcing/ somebody to do the thing you like good?

I mean, I understand that when you're interested in somebody you make an effort to be a part of what they're interested in, but Ron and Hermione don't really care that much about what the other likes

You can't seriously tell me that Ron went studying to please Hermione, more often than not, it was to get her off his back (which is totally justifiable imo) and even then he didn't try very hard. Is that really good from a relationship perspective? And for Hermione, she mainly went to Quidditch for Harry (at least until Book 5). Does this mean that she's now interested in him? Not really, so why should it apply to Ron?

I linked it because by contrast, Ron and Hermione's chemistry is shown to be far superior. When I say their fighting is "playful", this doesn't mean that they are happy or smiling. What I mean is that their relationship is not irreparably damaged by their arguing. This is shown not to be the case when Harry and Hermione come into conflict.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry unleashes his pent-up anger on Hermione, she is generally cowed, crying (OP64/66) [OP4], looking frightened (OP71/74 [OP4], 646/733 [OP32]), looking stricken (OP293/328) [OP15], stepping back in alarm (OP647/734) [OP32], etc. While this behavior is admittedly not typical of a son to a mother, it is just as unequal---at these times, Harry switches from being dominated by Hermione to dominating her. What is missing is the sort of equal give-and-take arguments we see between Hermione and Ron. Harry dislike of arguing prevents him from letting Hermione know that she is bothering him on a normal basis, and when he does explode, she has a hard time holding her own against him. A frank and equal exchange of views between Harry and Hermione is a rare thing indeed.
#+end_quote

The essay also goes on to cite many times from the beginning of the series where Ron is much more aware of Hermione's emotions and inner life than Harry is, and Hermione is shown to be much more concerned about Ron's opinion of her early romantic exploits than Harry's.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's and Hermione's relationship is unequal in another way. Hermione worries about Harry, thinks about Harry, supports Harry, and helps Harry far more than Harry worries about her, thinks about her, supports her, or helps her. While this is perfectly normal and healthy in a parent-child type of relationship---and perfectly acceptable for a hero-sidekick type of relationship---it would be disturbing and unsatisfying in a love relationship. Harry's disinterest in Hermione's needs and activities is striking. In Book Three, he didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible schedule (PA181/244) [PA12]. He displays little or no interest in Hermione's relationship with Krum, her investigation of Rita Skeeter, her efforts to free house-elves, her family, her dormitory mates, her feelings for Gilderoy Lockhart, or any other interest she has besides supporting him. This is perfectly understandable in the context of Harry's life, but the fact is that Hermione gives, and Harry takes. Hermione worries about Harry, and Harry doesn't worry about Hermione. Their relationship is very unequal.

  Ron, in contrast, displays a consistent and vigorous interest in Hermione's life. He is, of course, intensely interested in Hermione's feelings for both Gilderoy Lockhart and Viktor Krum. He is curious about what Hermione's secret doings in the library are (GF325/373) [GF21], and he expresses frustration at her secrecy (OP334/377 [OP18], OP484/548 [OP25]). He is curious enough about her heavy course schedule in Book Three that he actively investigates it (PA180/244) [PA12]. He asks her questions about her preparations for the Yule Ball (GF357/411) [GF23], her smaller teeth (GF352/405) [GF23], her planned skiing trip (OP399/451 [OP21], 440/498 [OP23]), her reasons for taking Muggle Studies (PA47/57) [PA4], her reasons for dropping Muggle Studies (PA314/430) [PA22], her Christmas present for Kreacher (OP444/503) [OP23], her reason for setting out knitted hats (OP230/255) [OP13], her Ancient Runes exam (OP631/715) [OP31], her SPEW badges (GF197/224) [GF14], her letter (OP407/460) [OP21], and many other things. We see Ron “mother” Hermione almost as much as she mothers him. In Book Four, he worries that her campaign against Rita Skeeter will backfire on her (GF392/451 [GF24], 445/513 [GF27], 470/542 [GF28]), and he notices and comments upon her eating habits (GF161/182 [GF12], 171/194 [GF13], 175/198 [GF13]). Sometimes his concern for her is almost Molly-like:

  *“You don't reckon Malfoy did something to her?” Ron asked anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. (PA217/295) [PA15]

  *“You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. “I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.” (PA218/295) [PA15].

  *With that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.“Oi!” Ron called after her, “We've got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, “she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam” (GF533/614) [GF31].

  *Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night (OP626/710) [OP31].

  Again, the relationship between Ron and Hermione may be stormy, but it is equal. They try to boss each other around. They tease each other. They worry about each other. They show interest in each other's non-Harry-related lives.

** I don't think this is popular opinion here it goes.

I think that Umbridge is in fact the best well written villain in the series. That fact that she still pisses me off mean it. She was not a sympathetic villain but rather a very real type of bigot. Sure she has no redemption or anything like that but she didn't need to.

Voldemort fell flat compared to her.. he has his moments but in contrast to all of it..... Sure, he's a very real threat but the way he is told by other characters versus the way he is potrayed felt a bit flat. Sure, Textbook psychopath is good and all, the memory diving gives a good background on the dark lord but it all boils down he had a shitty life and was born evil. I would have preferred if the similarities with Harry was amplified. At least the toad's minor character despite having short appearances, she delivered perfectly, no need extra detail. Let's just say, yes... Riddle is horrific that he tortured his followers that did something truly stupid. he kills people but he has none of the Tom Riddle, I assume it's because he doesn't need to appeal to anyone but seriously, There's nothing Slytherin about the whole ordeal... I suppose He's not my type of villain in general. But he... Well let's say I can think of a couple of villains in other media that can work,

Good and evil are too polarized in a way. This is why I like Snape and Regulus. I do hate Snape and not think of him as redeemed. the Lily background gave him more character but a good person he is not.

** Remus Lupin deserved better.

Side note: Sirius and Remus were most definitely in love, whether it be romantic or simply platonic. Their characters were written both in the books and films as being practically dependent on each other once reunited. Whether anyone denies it or not, these two were in the films written and directed to pretty much be a gay couple. The director went as far as to tell Thewlis that Lupin was a homeless gay drug addict (or something of that nature). I'm not sure if that's a popular opinion (WolfStar being canon, I guess) but my ride or die is Lupin and if there's anything I wanna talk about, it's how he didn't deserve to die.

** Dumbledore is a manipulative old coot. It's actually a very polarizing opinion to have, but I feel it's accurate if you read through the books years later.

He left a child in an abusive home with no magical supervision, let an innocent man sit in prison, let 3 children constantly save the school from external and internal threats every year, and took a 16-year-old off school property without guardian permission to hunt down dangerous magical artefacts that contained fragments of Wizard-Hitler's soul.

*** You're forgetting one thing:

Harry survived.

Despite being marked for death by an murderous cult leader, with a piece of that cult leader's soul latching onto his own, with the only known method of removing that soul piece should result in the death of the body holding it, Harry, survived.

And no, Dumbledore is not all knowing. I truly believe that he did not know about the Horcrux inside Harry until the Diary was presented to him in Harry's second year.

He did not know that the Dursleys would neglect Harry, and he had Arabella Figg to watch over him, who reported that while he was skinny and did a lot of chores, there were no signs of physical abuse and no bumps and bruises that couldn't be attributed to roughhousing with his cousin. She had no idea that he slept in a cupboard, she had no idea that they would deny him meals as punishment, and so, neither did Dumbledore.

In addition, he had the blood wards set in place through Petunia. He had to keep Harry safe from the Death Eaters, such as the Lestranges, who would go on to torture the Longbottoms to insanity, or the Sadistic Carrots, or any number of the Death Eaters who would buy their way out of Azkaban.

As for Sirius Black, are you really that convinced that Dumbledore knew Sirius was innocent? How?

To his knowledge, Sirius was a troubled child who came from a dark family, with multiple Death Eater connections. At school, while he made good friends, and seemed to despise the Death Eater crowd, he also had a nasty tendency for violence, with pranks going too far due to boredom, and one notable case of where such a prank almost resulted in the death or horrible maiming of Severus Snape. If it weren't for the heroic actions of Black's best friend, James Potter, then Sirius would have been a murderer then and there.

In Dumbledore's mind, he might have looked at all these incidents, and come to the conclusion that Sirius was indeed hiding a malovent sadistic side to him. After all, James had told Dumbledore that Sirius was the Secret-Keeper, and all those people, just destroyed like that, with Sirius /laughing/ at the scene of the crime after Peter Pettigrew had clearly accused him of the Betrayal.

It looked to be a cut and dry case. Dumbledore would be sad that Sirius had fallen back into the ways of his family, and angry at him for betraying his friends and the Order.

There was no way that Dumbledore could have known that Pettigrew was the actual Secret Keeper, that he was also a secret Animagus (which quite frankly seemed outside of the scope of Pettigrew's talents), and that he would kill 12 people and accuse his friend of the murder just to save his own skin. Pettigrew had none of those red flags at all.

Again, Dumbledore doesn't know everything, and can't speculate and make shrewd and clever guesses on things without good reason to.

As for the threats to the school?

Dumbledore had Snape watch Quirrell the whole time, so that Quirrell would not be a threat, no matter what his motives may have been for seeking the stone.

You could argue that students were only in danger that year because those students decided to be reckless and go after the stone.

The only time he those students really saved the school was Harry's second year, when he slayed Slytherin's monster, which turned out to be a 1000 year old basilisk in a chamber on accessible through Parseltongue in the girl's bathroom. Pretty far off Dumbledore's beaten track if you ask me.

In third year, he had no say in whether or not there was dementors at the school or not. It was all he could do to keep them off of school grounds, and they act as a deterrent against Black, a known serial killer, from staying near school grounds (or so he believed). The children did not save the school by any means that year.

Nor did the school need saving in their fourth year.

He had no control over Dolores Umbridge from taking her spot in the school and interfering, and was one the run for 1/3 of the year.

In their sixth year, he had a lot of things on his mind, like Horcrux, and dying, and trying to prevent the kid with the Horcrux inside him from dying.

Speaking of which, Dumbledore was /dying/. Clearly, he had plans to try and destroy the Horcruxes on his own. That plan fell through when he put on that ring and put a time limit on his own life.

Thus, he knew he needed to get his affairs in order, namely getting Harry prepared to face Voldemort.

So yeah, Albus Dumbeldore, one of the most brilliant and most powerful wizards in the world, took the 16 year old kid who had already faced against Voldemort multiple times, into the secret of the Horcruxes. Time was running out, and Harry was going to face Voldemort again, whether Dumbledore was there or not. So yes, he told Harry all about the Horcruxes. He gave Harry information about Voldemort's past, so that Harry could understand Voldemort, and understand how Voldemort thought. He took Harry to the Horcrux site, because ultimately he knew that Harry needed to know exactly what he was getting into, and the lengths Voldemort was willing to go to in order to protect himself. He did so, believing that he could keep Harry safe, with the confidence that one can only have while being the wielder of the Elder Wand, and possessing one of the most brilliant minds in the world.

Dumbledore was secretive. Dumbledore was very knowledgeable. Dumbledore was powerful in magic and in authority.

He was also human.

He also truly cared for Harry and did everything he could to ensure he survived.

And he did, all while acting as Headmaster of Hogwarts, Cheif Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwamp of the International Confederation of Wizards, and then dying 1 year before his plan came to it's conclusion, and he had to guide his lieutenants from the grave.

He was neither incompetent, nor a manipulator. He was just a man, who had flaws and made mistakes like everyone else.

****** I agree with all your points, but it has to be said, Dumbledore shows a pattern of relying on people of questionable competence and character. Relying on Arabella Figg to watch Harry's welfare, relying on Hagrid to deliver Harry's letter, relying on Quirrell to help defend the stone, relying on Imposter!Moody to keep the students safe, relying on Mundungus to guard Harry's house, it's quite a long list. At the end of the sixth book I quite felt that Dumbledore was wrong to have relied on Snape to be a spy, and it brought into question his faith in Harry to be able to complete the Horcrux hunt.

He was doing the best job he knew how to do, but I do think he made some mistakes, some more costly than others. The Occlumency thing was a huge mess from start to finish. I've often wondered why he didn't send Harry that book during the summer, especially as the reason he gave Harry for not being kept in the loop was because of his connection to Voldemort's mind. Harry is capable of learning difficult pieces of magic when he feels he needs to and is given sufficient time. Explaining clearly that Harry couldn't be told anything until he learned Occlumency over the summer seems much more logical. Keep in mind Draco Malfoy learned Occlumency over the summer of the next year, so it's definitely possible.

******* Dumbledore believed in second chances. He had to, in order to believe that he deserves a second chance after his youth.

Speaking of which, think about his sister, Ariana. Broken and beaten down, unable to do magic, destined to be locked up away from the world, and seeing magic everywhere, unable to interact with it, and dead before she reached puberty.

Now look at Hagrid, and Figg, and Filch. People, either by birth or circumstance, unable to do magic, pariahs of wizarding society, but yet still part of the magical world than the Muggle world, with no good work for them to do.

You combine that with Binns, and Trelawney, and Firenze, and Snape, and you start to realize that Dumbledore has a soft sport for the broken, the cripples, and the misfits of the world.

And to be fair, Hagrid delivered Harry's letter well, and became Harry's first friend.

I think it's also unfair to fault Dumbledore for not realizing that Quirrell had Voldemort on the back of his head. Even so, he felt something might be up with Quirrell, but couldn't figure out what, he had no proof, and looking into Quirrell personally would possibly spook Quirrell and he might do something rash.

Also, Quirrell's troll was one of 7 different safeguards against the stone, all of which are fairly time consuming, and ultimately there for delaying any would be thieves until Dumbledore gets there. After all, No one with the intention of actually using the stone was able to get it from the mirror.

Again, it's unfair to say Dumbledore was relying on Imposter!Moody. Dumbledore was relying on Alastor Moody, his close personal friend who hates the Dark Arts more than Severus Snape hates shampoo. It just so happens that Imposter!Moody did a good job of impersonating Moody.

As for Mundungus, what kind of secret spy order would it be without underground connections?

I do want to point out though, that having Mundungus guarding Harry is more of a sign that the Order was in dire straights, and didn't have a lot of spare competent people running round. At the time, there were only 3 Order members with Auror training: Moody, Kingsley, and Tonks.

Moody was retired as an Auror, and had a peg leg, so he's not going to be stealthy; Tonks worked at the Ministry all day, just getting out of training, and is clumsy as heck, and would give herself away; and Kingsley was one of the new recruits of the order, and as an established Auror, was needed most at the Ministry as he was fairly respected there, and could not jeopardize his job there by hanging around Harry Potter.

Also...Book? an Occlumency Book? I don't recall such a thing in canon.

Also keep in mind that Occlumency is going to come easier to some people more than others, so Draco Malfoy, a boy who is far better at controlling his emotions and keeping his cool. He compartmentalizes his emotions well and pushes down his emotions when he needs to, always the sneering bully who can bait Ron or Harry into a fight, yet still also a scared teenager unable to see a way out.

Harry is, quite frankly, bad at controlling his emotions. Always taking the bait from Malfoy or Snape, lashing out at his friends, etc.

More than anything, Occlumency requires the user to clear their mind. How could Harry clear his mind from the nightmares of the graveyard? How could he have let go of his anger at Umbridge, or his hatred of Snape, who was telling him to clear his mind, yet still baiting him and making him angry?

His fifth year is all ABOUT emotion, and Harry's just not the type of person who can shut that off.

And the irony of that, is that all of his emotion is what saved him from being possessed by Voldemort. his grief for Sirius and that raw hurt is what saved Harry in the end, not some haphazard Occlumency shield.

I had a quick skim of OoTP and to my embarrassment there is no occlumency book! I have been infected by fanon it seems. However, Dumbledore does admit in canon that he should have taught Harry Occlumency and not Snape, so my feeling that the whole Occlumency thing was mishandled is actually spoken about in canon.

At school, while he made good friends, and seemed to despise the Death Eater crowd, he also had a nasty tendency for violence, with pranks going too far due to boredom, just like what we saw in Snape's memory when Snape called Lily a Mudblood, and another notable case of where such a prank almost resulted in the death or horrible maiming of Severus Snape, when Sirius told Snape how to get under the Whomping Willow. If it weren't for the heroic actions of Black's best friend, James Potter, then Sirius would have been a murderer then and there.

Before that fateful Halloween night, Dumbledore may have dismissed them as the mistakes of a troubled young man lashing out against dark magic enthusiasts, because of the trauma of living with his family.

After the news came that Lily and James were dead, and that Sirius had killed Peter and 12 Muggles, Dumbledore would look back on all the memories we saw of Sirius, as well as the one's we never knew about, and like jamming in puzzle pieces to fit the puzzle, angry at himself for not seeing the signs, and grief-ridden from 3 of his pupils dying, Dumbledore would look at those events with the perspective that Sirius would grow up to be a murderer.

Perhaps Sirius was a sociopath and a sadist. The Purebloods who keep it in the family sometimes become unstable, just look at Bellatrix, his cousin. Maybe he took pleasure in the pain and humiliation of Severus Snape.

Perhaps Sirius' hate for his dark family was a ruse, just as his friendship with James was a sham. It had to be if he would betray them like that.

But he doesn't have the mark! Then again, if he really was a spy, he /wouldn't/ have the mark, would he? That would be a huge giveaway, having Voldemort's symbol on your arm.

For a covert mission like this? Yes, yes. It would be monumentally stupid to have the Mark on his arm this whole time, and if Sirius has been manipulating his friends and the Order this whole time, he'd never get the mark.

These are the thoughts that would have run through Dumbledore's head.

Again, going by what DUMBLEDORE knows, the only logical conclusion to make is that Sirius really betrayed the Potters, as shocking and painful as that may be.

I mean, Harry couldn't because he was stuck at Privet Drive for 2-3 weeks out of the summer and then got a chance to be a wizard and a teenager with his friends. What's the Supreme Mugwump's excuse?

********* Because Severus Snape had already given his statement, which completely discredits anything the students could say, not to mention the fact that he mentioned the possibility of a Confundus charm in play on them; Lupin was out wondering in the Forbidden forest as a werewolf; Dumbledore had no evidence to present to the Ministry of Pettigrew's survival; Dumbledore was not a witness to the events, so he couldn't provide his own memories of such an event as evidence; and Fudge had already decided to schedule a Dementor's Kiss for Sirius that night. Time was of the essence that night, and recognizing that Buckbeak was missing and one of Mr. Potter's friends has a Time-Turner, and that the dementors had scattered from the group without any of them having their soul sucked out, Dumbledore had just enough clues to piece together the time travel and the plan to break out Sirius with Buckbeak.

*** I agree that's the only valid interpretation of canon, but I also think it's mostly the result of JKR writing Dumbledore as a typical "adult in a children's adventure tale" for the first three books and then having to deal with it for the rest of the series, as opposed to something she deliberately intended for his character.

** Popular? But what is counted as popular?

I'll just roll with it;

》I like Romione and Hinny

》Drapple is my favourite crack ship

》I like to ship Seamus and Dean

》Harry and Ron have the best brotp

》Hermione is the cruelest of the trio.

》Looking at the books, Harmony can't work.

》You can ship Wolfstar and Ronks. Both fits into canon.

》I hate Umbridge.

》I don't count the movies as canon.

》Snarry, Snamione, Dramione and Drarry are not healthy relationships.

If I have the energy to find it, there's a really good (though somewhat long) video that really gets at the heart of what makes it so bad for me. Will post if I can.

** When I read those kind threads I always feel like we should define what is an unpopular opinion.

For example, considering that Snape was a good teacher is an unpopular opinion while believing Snape to be an exhibitionist isn't one. It's straight up bullshit that has nothing to do with the depiction from the books.

** Snape is not a nice nor good teacher. - is a popular opinion.

However I've admired him since the first time I read book 1; I was a 12-year-old girl stumbled on this book in my school library. He's a great character and I always find myself getting wind up while reading how people loath him. A while ago I found some stories in ff.net which show me how great this character could have been portrayed to us.

It annoyed me how movie!Ron didn't get his brilliant part as often as in books.

Ravenclaws, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin deserve to be more acknowledged on their parts. Inter-house relationship should have made a cooler and better plot for readers, espicially children. How the students from different house got team up in final battle scene could have been one of the most heart-wrenching moments, yet it could never be.
