** Aren't most students underage? Not just "it's illegal" underage but "Cannabis would negatively impact their development"?

I get your idea, but unless you want to want to turn Hogwarts into college, which would fit the party sex and drugs theme, it would be a very fucked up story.

** I had a half formed story about each house having their own chamber of secrets.

Hufflepuffs', was a not so secret garden was a monastery brewery overseen by the Fat Friar. But it could just have easily been anwhole bunch of pot plants.

I like the idea of the Puffs having their own culture and side adventure's. Maybe partaking in muggle weed culture during the 70s was why the Death Eaters gained so much traction, just by being obnoxious teenagers who smell weird and play strange music.
