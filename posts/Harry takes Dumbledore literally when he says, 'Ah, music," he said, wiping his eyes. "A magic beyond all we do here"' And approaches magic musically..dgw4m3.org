** Generally, there is just crazily little of music in the HP universe. I remember when I was the age of the HP heroes I was completely obsessed with music, swapping tapes with friends (yeah, that marks my age) etc.

There are some song stories which are mostly ridiculous, there are linkffn(3912184;4236594), which have at least something (“[[https://youtu.be/bx1Bh8ZvH84][Wonderwall]]” will never be the same after reading that story). Probably music in linkao3(373224) is one of reasons why I like the story so much.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** Closest I have is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][*/The Revelation Of Harry Forrester/*]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in Boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Due to a charm Sirius put on Harry during the chase he doesn't get discovered by the American magical authorities until he has a big burst of magic during a concert.

Warnings: Mild manipulative (but ACTUALLY well meaning) Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing. Is like half musical theory.

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
