I am looking for any decent harem fics. No Weasley bashing. Preferably with Hermione not part of the harem, at the very least not Harry's main partner.


** You might like linkffn(4081016). The only issue might be [[/spoiler][Hermione joining the group in one of the last scenes in the story, but she is nowhere near the main relationship and had in fact spent the story to that point actively avoiding becoming part of the group.]]

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

** linkffn(firebird's son) is probably the closest thing out there to a realistic/believable harem fic. Hermione is in the harem, but she isn't Harry's main partner. No Weasley bashing.

****** I never did finish that fic. It lost me at some point.

I tend to do that with long fics. If the author fails to keep me interested the whole time I'll sort of trail off and forget about it. Doesn't show much in shorter fics, but with very long ones(150k+) it very much does.

The worst part is that I can't even pinpoint a reason why. Just kind of devolves into a "should I read another chapter? Ehhhh, nah." situation.

******* that trilogy lost me in the second book when the MC tells her guardian "OK I won't do something major without consulting you" then goes and does something major without consulting them and fucks it up.

I'm like "we JUST talked about this."

*** I can't stand that story.

The entire thing just reeks of some pre-teen male fantasy where you have to bang as many women as possible all in the name of keeping magicals alive.

That and I never liked how forced males are into the whole deal.

******* I don't mean that it reads as a Tumblr feminist creed. It seems more like something that would have happened if something as radical as that would have won the gender war and now everyone is suffering. I don't think it's a a hatefest. It becomes very clear that both genders suffer a lot under the regime.

** One of the few harem fics I can handle is by Darth Marrs.

Not really a spoiler, but I'm going to tag it anyway.

*Four Founders*

[[/spoiler][This is part of an /optional/ trilogy where Harry carries over into different universes and timelines and leaves the harems behind.]]

linkffn(4753440)

*Firebird*

There's also another trilogy by the same author, completely different context, where harems are required due to a population gender gap (10/1 fem-male).
