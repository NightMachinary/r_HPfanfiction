:END:
I remember the fic was a WBWL fic and full of Cliches. Unrealistic premise, but it's fanfiction. The dark side is literally good, and a lot of emphasis is put on the fact that "We would never give up a child of any wizard blood no matter what". Harry was a slytherin. Sirius after the events of that Halloween cuts off his friendship with James due to the sending away of Harry. Voldemort is revived as sane, and goes to the wizengamot and takes up the lordship of slytherin. He is known as Marvolo. He has a castle, and Harry visits it. Snape takes the Prince seat on the wizengamot, washes his hair and instantly becomes handsome somehow. James abuses Lily,the dark find her, and I think she started to get attracted to Snape.
