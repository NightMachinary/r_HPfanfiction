Is it just me or has there been a lot of request bashing lately? I've come across two instances in the last 10 mins alone and more besides.

I'm relative new to this subreddit so I'm not asking to open a can of worms or start drama - I'm honestly asking to help gauge if I'm the one being overly sensitive or if this is a new trend on the rise.

Also, I'm going off the definition in the rules for what constitutes request bashing (#9 for reference), so to me that includes comments that aren't necessarily aggressive or derogatory but are still argumentative & questioning why the OP even wants that type of story. If someone disagrees philosophically with the theme of a request (or prompt) it seems to me the place for that kind of talk is a separate Discussion post, not comments on a Request/Prompt post. But again, I'm newish, my interpretation may well be wrong...and if I am, I'll sure know about it soon lol.


** I feel like the sub has always bashed certain characters and pairings. If not aggressive comments, there are mass downvotes bringing the posts to 0, mostly when the OP asks for fics with slash or trans characters. That's why I just keep my requests to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]], honestly.

*** People who avoid slash fics are missing out on a lot of awesomeness. I know this because I used to avoid them <.<

Consider Of A Linear Circle. I hate the pairing on principle... but the story itself? It isn't a romance, and the pairing takes a back seat to so many degrees of OMG YAS! that I've lost count. Avoiding the story because of /maybe/ a dozen scenes spread across over a million words is silly.

***** It is intimidating, yeah but it's also a sprawling epic, and unique, and awesome. Not perfect, of course, but pretty damn close especially if you consider the scope. Technically, it's fantastic with all the little hints throughout that you'll miss the first time around. Yes, I've read it multiple times. Part 3 in particular.

If you want to make it /slightly/ shorter, skip parts 5, 6, 7, and 9 as labelled by AO3. That's... around 200k words less? Maybe 250k? Math is hard this morning lol

I'm waiting for the author to start working on the Gryffindor part again, personally, to start reading it. I don't feel like I'm missing much: the Ravenclaw one, while interesting, doesn't add to the overall plot very much after all.

Edit - Since it's so big, [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J59EbRpWZ-7AVRq3CtpDbFpSZzAalOkw/view?usp=sharing][here's a carrot]]: an anthology of the core stories in epub format for your reading pleasure. Not Mercy nor Pity is in there still, but it's short and/or easily skipped if you feel like it.

The author is on hiatus with this story now that part 8 is finished and posting in a different fandom at the moment: there are two (I think?) more planned instalments though. You can also safely skip all of Part V too (it's backstory).

**** I just started on part 1 and I can't stop reading. I hadn't realised there are so many parts though....

Ah, well..., with the amount of fics recommended through [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] every day, I don't think I will run out of fics to read ever again.

**** There is not a single pairing which would interest me for slash. 0. The only Weasley I like is Ginny, Neville and Cedric are overhyped af, Snape, Malfoy and the like are a hard no, I hate Lupin, I have 0 interest in next gen or Quidditch fics, so what exactly is there for me?

Like, if you go for Death Eater revisionism, Bellatrix is the better choice since she's actually a danger (unlike pretty much all other Death Eaters) and therefore the biggest boon for Harry if she switches sides (only feasible if she defects BEFORE killing Sirius). Voldemort is a hard no since he's the reason for everything what's wrong with Harry's life while the Lestranges, Dolohov and the like never directly affected Harry.

Tl;dr: IMO all popular slash parings suck or are boring since the only interesting male characters are Harry, Sirius, James (only if he gets together with Lily and has Harry) and Moody.

***** Did you miss the part where I said I hated the pairing? It's Snape and he's a hard no for me too: I think he's an awful person, and my mental image of him isn't attractive. But you know what? The /story/ is still fantastic and I'm quite capable of scrolling past things I'd rather not see or rolling my eyes at snape apologist lines because there is /so much else going on/ and its all awesome.

So again: by avoiding slash pairings, you miss out on excellent stories. Especially when the romance is a minor plot point and most of the action isn't from his pov.

****** I have no interest to read about him in any manner other than, at the very least, being fired and fading into obscurity and, in the best case, life in Azkaban or him dieing miserably. I'm not touching slash fics with him in, het romance with him in, marauder era stuff where he's the protagonist, nothing. And the same goes for most male characters, I have no desire to waste time reading about characters I'm not invested in and, personally, see no potential. That means slash fics, fics where they are shipped with female characters I'm invested in or gen fics with them in it.

You might say that it's a very black and white view, and you are right. Am I missing out on things? Maybe. But just like Europa Universalis isn't a game for everyone, fanfics about certain characters aren't for everyone. AND there's a lot of stuff I'd rather do than read about anything Snape, Lupin, Malfoy or the Weasleys (other than Ginny) do.

****** Your link is broken. 0/10, would not be baited again.

I have nothing against gay people, I simply have no interest to read about pathetic characters like Snape, Lupin or Malfoy, or utterly unrelatable ones like the Weasleys (single child, such a large family is a nightmare scenario for me), romance or no romance. And what was left for alternatives (Neville, Cedric) have been ruined by fanon for me to the point where I try to kill Cedric off and make Neville antagonistic towards Harry whenever possible.

Harry/Sirius is disturbing because Sirius was friends with James and Moody falls in the same category as Garrus Vakarian from Mass Effect, total badass, but not attractive.

*** Nice, I'll definitely give that a go. I'm actually pretty new to all of Reddit, I deliberately avoided it for a long time, but recently got back into HP fan fic and ended up here looking for rec lists.

The last time I was reading HP fic LiveJournal was still the main host for rec lists!

** I admit that I have done this once (asking why the hell anyone would want this type of story). The request in question, though, was looking for a story describing specific ways Peter Pettigrew could have molested the young Weasleys and/or Harry Potter while he was still in disguise as their pet rat. I think my comment was "Jesus, /why?"/

​

Upon reflection, I'm rather glad that I never got an answer. I'm probably better off not knowing.

*** Yikes, that's a doozy. I'd call it even on that one, wouldn't the OP be breaching the No sexualisation of minors rule (#8) anyway?

But it's not really that kind of post, I can see why that'd be contentious. I feel like I'm seeing more fairly standard requests that end up with these long and detailed 'I hate this type of story/why don't you just get over it/why do you want it' kind of comments. They wouldn't be out of place in the right Discussion post but yeah, in a Request post the subtext is more 'request shaming' than 'lively fandom debate'.

*** But is a Request post the right place for that? (and maybe it is considered so by the majority). Cause from another perspective it's kinda hijacking a Request post instead of starting a new Discussion post about whatever it is. The scrolling thing goes both ways as well - sure they can scroll by, but so could the commenter if they don't have any recs & it's a topic they don't like/don't agree with.

**** I'd say it is. To start a whole discussion post over another post seems superfluous and a waste of scrolling space. After all, if you're interested in the discussion, you're probably interested in the request thread. It's not really hijacking a request post, they almost never get enough comments for the recommendations to be overshadowed.

The scrolling thing does not go both ways here. There's a key difference. One scrolls past what they do not wish to engage. The commenter does wish to engage.
