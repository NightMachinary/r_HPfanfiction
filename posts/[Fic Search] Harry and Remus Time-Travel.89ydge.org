Hello, I am looking for the name of a time-travel fic I read a while ago where Harry time-travels to the Marauder era and tries to befriend them. If I remember correctly, he had issues getting along with all but Remus and they slowly become best friends (and possibly romantic?).

Also, any recommendations for other time-travel fics that have a strong Harry and Remus friendship/relationship.

Thanks!


** I highly recommend the Healing Series by Sarini. Read in this order:

1. Healing [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/2501109/1]]
2. Another Chance [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/2512812/1]]
3. Behind Blue Eyes [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/2520937/1]]

Companion piece (read last): Changes [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/2524121/1]]
