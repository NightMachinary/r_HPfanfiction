Any Fics that have a character being Undercover for an Organization or Group, but this Job is affecting the Characters personality? To keep it simple, i name Harry. So Harry changes his appearance and investigates. However, the things, he might has to do to make progress in his Work are not only part of his Fake ID, but also stay part of him, when he gets out....atleast for a certain time. He must recover. For example: he tricks and manipulates other people, to gain what he is after or threatens others with violence.

He might be affected, but he always stays loyal to the Ministry, regular reports and stuff.

​

Thats the basic. Optional things would be, him taking drugs/alcohol to keep his Cover and calm himself down or sleeps with prostitutes or females of the group he works with.


** I'm working on one about Remus spying on Greyback's pack in the First Wizarding War. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796][Prisoner]] It will eventually explain why his friends didn't trust him enough to tell him they'd switched secret-keepers, as they started to wonder which side he was really on.

** Linkao3(changing of the guard by Lomonaaeren) It is not exactly what you asked for, but as I remember it correctly, Harry struggled a lot with self identity here as a result of his job. I also believe it's much more dark then the summery paints it out to be. It has been years, though. So I might be mistaken about some things about this fic. It is slash.

  Need a perfect stranger? Ask Metamorphosis. Harry Potter runs the business secretly and becomes whoever's needed for each occasion. He's not sure whether he should be more surprised, worried, or amused when Draco Malfoy comes to Metamorphosis and requests an actor who can play his boyfriend so that his parents will disown him. Yet Harry has even more dangerous choices after he creates Brian, Draco's “perfect” boyfriend. Draco doesn't know who Brian is, but he's trying to find out---and now so is Harry.

** Linkao3(15558741)

Harry isn't quite undercover in this fic, but it explores what measures Harry would take to “overcome” the prophecy I.e. join Voldemort and become a DE. He is still “good” in the fic, and explores his (very bad) coping mechanisms to handle the atrocities he'd done.

  Harry Potter's choices have always been restricted to almost nothing. After learning that he is the subject of a prophecy, he wants desperately to be able to choose something for himself - even if he knows it's the wrong choice.
