Its one where Sirius gets free somehow and gets revenge on everyone... Especially Dumbledore towards the end and when Dumbledore asks him why he is so angry, Sirius tells him that Azkaban made him impotent. Also, I think he ends up as the minister later. It wasn't a long story, probably a one-shot or 2 chapters. Tried googling for it and went a bit crazy looking for it. Mheh.... Thanks in advance.


** I haven't actually read this, but it's on my list to eventually get to. Based on the initial author's note, I thought it might be what you're looking for: /Black Vengeance/ linkffn(7254667). Apologies if it's not the correct one.

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!
