** I enjoyed your last one so I think this would be great as a new weekly / biweekly sticky thread or something. Something I really liked was that we saw some new fics rather than the standard recs we see repeated here all the time.

*** I think having something more free form than the usual "give me the best fic you've ever read" request threads might benefit the community by opening us up to new things as well.

** I know this has nothing to do with the actual topic, and I did enjoy that thread so I wouldn't mind seeing it more often, but...

Is the term biweekly an American thing and does it mean every two weeks, twice a week, or is it interchangeable? I guess I'm so used to 'fortnightly' that I always read biweekly as twice a week.

**** The definition of biweekly is "either twice a week or every two weeks". So if you wanna be more specific, you want to use *fortnightly*

** I like this idea. It can bring in a lot of new fics rather than all the old recs! If done regularly it also has the potential to help stir up interest in WIP fics as they get updated.

** Recurring topics were in the survey we had recently and I think this would be a good one. Biweekly (or fortnightly) seems enough for this sub. I want to make my writing thread a biweekly one, too :) It's nice to have more general discussion type threads in here.

** Isn't the general recommendations thread already reposted and stickied on a regular basis? Seems to have the same function, pretty much.

*** It's nice to have a thread to talk about fics without them being judged or talk about fics that are fun but not necessarily something one would rec. Personally, I don't think the general rec thread is all that useful. It doesn't fulfill any purpose that searching the subreddit wouldn't also do, since it's still mostly massive lists of fics without much else. I think a 'What are you reading' thread would bring in fresher conversation.
