** I think Mistress of Death sounds kinda stupid. I'd just go with Master of Death. It can be genderless.

*** Yeah I feel the same way. The word mistress always makes me think more of someone being a mistress in the sense that they are a lover, rather than the female version of a master.

** You are the author, you decide. In my opinion "Master" is genderless, simply because "Master of Death" means Champion of death. and Champion in english is both genders, isnt it?

** 'Master' here is not a gendered term, so it should be 'Master of Death'. It's like, female chess players aren't 'Chess Grandmistresses', the term just indicates mastery over something.

** Master of Death since i'm pretty sure it means, in canon, someone who has Mastered Death the same way a medieval apprentice would master a skill. Mistress is more female slave ownerish. I suppose Mistress of Death would make sense if Death is an actual person.

** Far as I know, "Master of Death" wasn't actually a title anyway, it was just something that was said about the Hallows: Whoever unites the Hallows will be master of death.... a female Harry with all three Hallows can call herself whatever she wants, I reckon, because the semantics aren't that important.

I never really liked it when fanfics threw around the "Master of Death" title as if it was an official title or something. Not only does it tend to lead to a totally overpowered Harry, but it just sounds so... super-pompous. :)

*** I know, I agree. I don't really like an overpowered Harry either. But hey, when you need a convenient way for your character to be dumped into another fantasy series' world, it's an easy thing to use. :P At least until I comu up with more creative.

** Matron of Death, if you really need to genderize it.

** Just call the fucker an Endless of Death or some such. Endless, Death, Daddy Death, Mr. Death, I'm-Going-To-Fuck-You-Up-Cause-I'm-Death, Ultimate Death, etc etc.
