Read linkao3(Equilibrium by RenderedReverse) and it was a really great read. Even if it was totally AU with no HP magic, the writing makes up for the OOCs. I really like how Dumbledore, Gellert, Hagrid and Sirius were portrayed.

Anyone know anything else? The ones I've read are linkffn(Harry Potter: Game of the Year Edition by Flux Casey;HJP Online by LogicWhatLogic)

Seven hours and nobody has mentioned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]] (W: 301,307; WiP) yet?! Well, I can't leave it like that, now, can I?

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20][The Natural 20's]] premise is that someone's Player Character gets summoned into the HP universe from one with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse][RPG Mechanics]] and thus uses magic that abides to laws that are completely different from what JKR had in mind.

The author is knowledgeable about what he's writing about, and even his characters, dialogues, and plotlines are pretty good --- which, unfortunately, is not what always happens when a D&D player sits down to try writing a book.

--------------

Another relevant story that's somewhat similar to HP: GotYE is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][HP & the Temporal Beacon]] (W: 428,826; abandoned). The author never says or implies that his story happens inside a game, but what protagonists do can be described as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming][Save Scumming]] ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]]).

p.s. Oh, and you can also check [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] (W: 279,202; WiP) [RPG-ish universe, Groundhog Peggy Sue], but it's not a HP fanfic.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

****** This. I read a few chapters and then started skipping around. There are times the author literally did a copy+paste to indicate grinding. You - the reader - have to /grind/ while reading the story.

And /anything/ involving sex is just *bizarre*. Children having gratuitous sex -- while their mother figure house-elf is there, the author's obsession with describing the breast size of every female character introduced as c-cup, d-cup etc.

And jumping to the last chapter had a bunch of Loki and Thor references.

I... I have no words. I'm honestly a little concerned about the author.

  Hermione dies to a surprise attack just before walking off into the sunset and wakes up to find out that her life up until now has been a video game or at least that's what all of the signs are pointing to. This is her attempt to play through the game as other characters so that she can try to get brought back to life.

  Voldemort was just supposed to be the bored necromancer who had a slightly creepy obsession with the undead. Scarred was just supposed to be a berserker--but things never quite work out that way.For one, he isn't a berserker. He's a bishop. For two, he isn't just anything--he's the renegade High Priest of Gryffindor. For three, well... let's just say Voldemort's slightly creepy obsession wasn't on the undead anymore. Glitches were so inconvenient.

  My inspiration for this is the amazing Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, a korean light novel about the fictional Virtual Reality game Royal Road, and the player who sets out to conquer it all (for money)! If you don't know what it is and like the gaming genre, I highly recommend you read it! (and go write fanfiction on it so I can read it and love you)

  The translation for it is on royalroadl[dot]com, though there are multiple translators (the website documents them all together). Japtem Translators is one of them :). Google, anyone?

          So as you've probably noticed, the summary sounds really weird compared to the actual, y'know, chapter\. BUT\. I'd like to bring to your attention the fact that this is slow build, and we'll get to the summary in maybe five chapters idk how many I'll choose to write before Harry and Tom actually meet\.Because this thing I just gave you?It's\.A\.Teaser\.Don't you hate it when authors do that?\!\!\!\!\!\! AGHHHH I'VE NOW BECOME ONE OF THEM SORRY\.Also, I know this kinda sounds funny, and I'll probably get some dislike for it, but I'm genuinely writing this for the sole sake of fixing my writer's block, which means the writing will probably be a bit funky as I'm not putting much focus into it\-\-my focus is in the plot; first time I've written like this tbh\. So it's gonna be all over the place\. Apologies\! If anyone wants to volunteer to get the stuff ahead of time \(though it'd probably be once in a blue moon, so lol?\) and fix it up, be my guest\.

** RI don't remember which one exactly, but there was a pretty good Harry potter/sword art online crossover.

In case you don't know SAO: it's an anime where the characters get trapped in a virtual reality game where death ingame results in death irl, they spend quite a while in it and a new society emerges from the circumstances.

The story of the fanfic was half/half, in the first half harry lands in Aincrad (the world of SAO) after using the old virtual reality system of dudley, the second half exists in the magical world.

While I have to recommend the fic to people who have seen SAO, I cannot recommend it to those who don't. While the plot is straight forward and easy to follow, some of the SAO characters simply become too important to read about without knowing their backstory.
