** This seems like an interesting start. I like the idea of Dark magic having a scent and it being comforting to the main character. Is this going to be a situation where Evalina learns more about Dark magic and rejects it or goes deeper?

Overall, this seems to be more a "telling" situation rather than a "showing" and there is a lot of passive voice here. For example, your starting paragraph is full of description, but who is experiencing this? Who is feeling the warm breeze, hearing the ocean, seeing the galaxies whirling around? No one--you are simply telling the reader, rather than showing the reader. If you have a character--a bird, a lizard, a mouse--feeling the warm air, hearing the ocean, seeing the stars and observing the pair Apparating onto the scene, your reader will be able to relate to it much easier.

#+begin_quote
  “We're definitely not at Malfoy Manor.” Evalina said conversationally, straightening up. She had half expected the gathering to take place in their large ballroom.
#+end_quote

Your main character has appeared in an unexpected place and this is all she says? What does she feel? Surprise? Apprehension? Disappointment? Does she trust her dad? Has her father done something like this before or is this unusual? What are the characters wearing? Are they dressed appropriately for the weather?

#+begin_quote
  As a child she had loved the spaciousness of the marble flooring and the height of the manor's ceiling. Draco, one of the youngest in their typical troupe, would sneak in old broomsticks for them to whiz around on. Narcissa had caught them once because of an unfortunate accident with a chandelier.
#+end_quote

This is another telling rather than showing. I think this would be better served by having a conversation with Draco about it or even an interior thought. Something like, /The bonfire cast Draco's face in red light, making dark shadows under his eyes. He looked distracted and Evalina sidled up to him, the roaring of the bonfire masking the incessant roaring of the sea. "A little bit different than sliding on Malfoy Manor's marble floors in our socks, isn't it?" she said. "Tell me, has your mum recovered from that time you snuck in those old brooms for us to ride?"/ Something like this creates a shared experience between the two characters and hints at an actual friendship between the two.

#+begin_quote
  The scent of Dark magic was always stronger at night.
#+end_quote

The idea of Dark magic having a scent--what does it smell like to Evalina? /The scent of Dark magic always reminded Evalina of a particular cedar grove she had visited as a child and she smelled it on the wind now. Always stronger at night, she felt it pulling her forward, down to the beach./ Give the character, and therefore the reader, something concrete to experience.

#+begin_quote
  The path turned to sand and Evalina could see dark figures up ahead.
#+end_quote

What was the path made of before? Stone? Concrete? Wood? Hard-packed dirt? Bones?

There are a few minor stylistic issues. For example you have:

#+begin_quote
  “We're definitely not at Malfoy Manor.” Evalina said conversationally, straightening up.
#+end_quote

This should be “We're definitely not at Malfoy Manor,” Evalina said conversationally, straightening up. When you have a dialog tag after a statement, a comma is typically used. A period at the end of the dialog would be appropriate if: "We're definitely not at Malfoy Manor.” Evalina straightened up from her crouch and peered around, her eyes adjusting to the faint moonlight. So, if you're going to use "said" or something like that, you usually use a comma and then go on to say, Evalina said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear or whatever.

Please don't take this to mean that what you've done is terrible--it's very easy to tell rather than show--but that makes for a somewhat dispassionate rendering of the story. Try to keep in mind who in your story is experiencing the action because that character is your reader's proxy.

Try to stay away from passive voice. If an action occurs, someone or some thing needs to be responsible for that action. This is passive: "A loud bang echoed in the room, causing everyone to duck." No one caused the bang sound--it comes about passively.

This is active: "Draco threw a lit firecracker into the fireplace, causing everyone to duck at the loud bang." The loud bang is the direct result of a character's action.

Thank you very much for sharing your writing and asking for an honest critique. Please feel free to PM me or whatever if you have any questions. I am by no means the perfect writer--everyone makes mistakes--and the only way to improve is practice and feedback! Good luck on your story. :D

*** Thanks a lot! That's a great review. This is an excerpt from the end of the chapter, so most of the context and character descriptions happened in the beginning, so a few of your points are cleared up beforehand and afterwards. I'm definitely going to work with what you've given me! I'm going to work on showing rather than telling :)

The fic is going to be about Evalina essentially being indoctrinated into the Dark Arts. Dark magic is addicting, very nearly like a drug, and it's easy to get sucked into using it. She's definitely going to delve deeper into dark magic.

**** Very good! The addiction angle sounds very interesting. I recently read "Six of Crows" by Leigh Bardugo that features the idea of magic and addiction. If you like caper-style stories in a fantasy setting, I highly recommend it.

Think about how the addiction will manifest--will it have a physical aspect? If it does, what will it be? White hair? Sharpening or blurring of facial features? Eye color change? Will there be a particular substance the practitioner will crave? "I must have peanut butter!" How does she feel when she practices Dark magic? Is it pleasurable? Painful? Does it enhance some sense? Can she smell colors? See music? What effect of practicing Dark magic is what she can't live without? What keeps her coming back?

Evalina murmured the incantation, even though she could cast it silently by now. She closed her eyes as the familiar rush of casting the [insert dark spell here] spell seemed to flow up from her toes all the way to the top of her head, caressing her skin much as she wished Draco would. As the energy of the spell left her, a gnawing hunger that could only be satisfied by Skippy crunchy peanut butter descended and she broke out in a cold sweat.

Or whatever. :D

***** Hahaha very good to you too. Crazy how you can shoot out ideas like that! Yes, I've got a plan for some physical maifestations, however it's mostly mental. That second bit was essentially what it might feel like. Thanks for sharing! And Im more of a Kraft Crunchy Peanut Butter girl myself. Much love

******* Hmm, I supposed squirrels like nuts, so Skippy makes sense. Bears... erm... bears like getting fat for the winter? Peanuts are fattening. Yea, let's go with that.
