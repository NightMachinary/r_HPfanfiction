** Internal logic. If a character has a skill, why and how do they have that skill? This is important when writing OCs

Other than that, it's just writing good characters.

** There was a good post on this awhile back that might give you some interesting answers to your questions. I copy-pasted my answer below from the one I gave in the other thread.

#+begin_quote
  Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. Other than that, anything goes. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

  Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

  I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people) and where her interactions with the various other elements of the world (people, resources, places, etc) make sense.

  I'd also recommend doing a search of this sub on the topic - there have been some really good discussions on this that I've seen in my year here. If you're unaware of how to do this - find the reddit search bar, then type something like "writing OC" into it and click the little tickbox to limit your search to this sub, then search. You'll get a list of posts about OCs and can read them at your leisure. :)

After that, you write them how you write any other character. Write down everything you know about them and ask yourself some questions about what they're like and how they might react to various things until you're happy with how fleshed out they are. Then make sure to keep their thought processes consistent until they get some character development.

Also, don't make them a Mary Sue/Gary Stu.

That's pretty much it. :)

** 1. A very clear specific personality. I'm assuming this is not supposed to be a self insert story... so I think good characterization is KEY. The same way we feel we know canon characters enough to write them readers should feel they know ur OC the same amount. Otherwise it's hard to care about them and their contributions in the story feel forced. We already know the canon characters so some work is already done for u but we don't know the OC at all.

Characters need a value system and personality traits. And everything u say about them shoukd be reacted to accordingly by those around them. I don't really think characters need “flaws” we just need to fully explore their traits. Like Fleur is extremely beautiful, to fully explore this...she's used to guys being mesmerized by her so she can be pretty dismissive when it comes to them, also a lot of ppl don't take her seriously as a talented and smart person..she can also come off as vain cause she know she beautiful and her being a more feminine type of girl makes ppl like Hermione and Ginny not as fond of her initially. Hermione is an academic overachiever which can come off as annoying to some and she can come off as a rude know it all around ppl who don't value academics as much as she does (like Ron).

1. Any time the character is there, let there be something that characterizes them so we have a super clear idea of who they are. No one needs multiple paragraphs describing clothes or looks but sprinkling little details helps a ton. Like if ur character is muggle born then maybe their first instinct isn't to reach for a wand when angry it's to just slap someone. But if they are a Slytherin pure blood maybe in the same fight they immediately reach for a wand and they know lots of curses already. When first visiting hogsmeade ur muggle born OC will want to look at everything and take their time maybe buy one of each candy. Ur Slytherin pure blood maybe will know exactly what they like and don't like and might get bored quickly. Just little details that emphasize what we already were told about them.

2. Again this clear specific personality should guide how they react in different situations. If the muggleborn OC isn't used to having a lot of friends but now are meeting new ppl/feels overwhelmed or unsure of themselves in this unfamiliar wizarding world maybe they become a ppl pleaser and just agree with ppl opinions or go along with their ideas because they scared to give ppl a reason to not like them. Maybe we continually see them internally struggle and this leads them to be in a situation they really don't want to be in and they have a breaking point. Maybe initially when they talk they tend to sound unsure of themselves and add “but I don't know” when they present ideas...then later they gain more confidence and stop saying that.

3. They need a reason to exist. I think it rarely makes sense to just add new characters in to only go through canon events. It should be a new story that requires these extra ppl.

4. Of course no one likes all the Mary Sue pitfalls (too special, too perfect, everyone loves them immediately, everyone prioritizes them, overly tragic backstory that doesn't seem to affect them, etc)

5. Their place in the world should be thought out and make sense. If their dad is Rabastan Lestrange but they are sorted into Gryffindor then this will likely cause serious family tension and the Gryffindors might not initially be as warm with them (have to prove themselves or make friends with muggleborns who don't know about their family), other Slytherins they grew up around will likely have words for them or even stop talking to them as Slytherins are very insular.

** Give them a goal. For instance, that OC you just dumped in Slytherin, her trying to survive isn't a goal. BUT, maybe she sees the racism in the house and she wants to change that. So she starts befriending people and excelling in classes. BUT that isn't enough. Her goal changes, especially when the war breaks out and people are trying to hand her over to the government. Her goal isn't staying alive and watching the events, but actively fighting against this oppressive regime. She collects other like minded individuals and starts attracting the ministry, freeing the captured Muggleborns.

Her goal changes as she changes as a person. Think of characters as people. Always ask what they want, and how do they obtain that? But each person is different, so how you might react to something is different than they would. You might see freeing Muggleborns to be enough. She might see killing the snatchers and Ministry officials to be more than acceptable. Don't try to put yourself into the situation. Jump into their heads, and convince your readers that they are reading about a real person.
