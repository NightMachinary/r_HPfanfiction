I've looked this tag up on ao3 and searched some pages of google for some good stories with this pairing but I can't find a good one where they are paired alone. [[https://Ffn.net][Fanfiction.net]] is something that I can never truly been able to navigate so I've not been able to search there either. I'm not interested in a harem/multi pairing fic and that seems to be all that I can find. I would prefer a more domestically romantic fic but I'd also consider a nsfw fic. (That's why the nsfw tag is added)

â€‹

If you decided to read the whole post I'd also take some Harry/Fleur fics, I've read most of the ones on ao3 and ffn though. I'd appreciate these fics as well.

** Harry/Angelina is a Super Rare Pair. Mostly (99%) seen as only a background pair or in a multi/harem. AFAIK in the last 3 thousand stories I've read in the past 2.5 years I have yet to find a story with this as a main pair that Isn't pure side smut/crack >1k words. Same goes with Alicia, no author has bothered making either of these characters interesting with depth as they are MOSTLY* a OC personality outside of yay I'm a gryffindor quidditch player look at me everyone! I've seen a hand full >10 Katie stories as well.

*** Yeah that's why I was hoping to find some with this post. I think I've read 2 stories that were not a multi/harem/background pairing. I just think it's an interesting pairing and I like to read those fics. I understand why they aren't popular, they aren't main characters in the books/movies but I wish there were more stories based around them. I honestly dont mind smut as long as it has a good storyline, but I prefer a more romantic story than what most smut ones provide
