** One thing about OCs is something I think a lot of authors don't get:

/The audience doesn't give a shit./

There is no attachment to Rane from my side and the side of many other readers I would assume. When Sirius says that he can't and he shouldn't and whatever else he whines, its a really hollow thing to read. Simply because /we don't know why/. And on the other side, when they tell each other their feelings - its the same thing. Its hollow. Why should I care? I don't root for Rane.

OCs have to be built up. The reader has to have some sort of emotional attachment to them. We /want/ to root for them. But we know /nothing/ about Rane and never get to know anything about her, except that for some reason half of her fell out of the Lord of the Rings universe... whats that about, btw?

But anyway. I think the writing is really solid. Some kinks here and there, some unfitting words and sentences, but good overall. Its just the character design is off - or maybe not even the design, maybe you have a fully built character in mind, but, at the very least, the presentation is not working. That would be my critique and feedback to you.

*** Thanks for the pointers :)

I'm going to try to develop my OC as continue on. I usually write these on a lark with a lot of the character development already in my brain and it honestly never even occurred to me. First legit helpful critique I've had.

  Sirius Black is awake tonight, and so is Rane, a young female Auror staying on duty at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. What happens when they meet each other in the evening chill neither of them could have predicted. (Rated M for sex/language)

** I think truthfully the people who read this will be looking for some smut; and that's what they will get and they'll be quite happy with it. Reading as a writer, It's generally clean and quite polished in the technical sense but there isn't much of a story arc, the OC isn't really explained, and (this is the biggest peeve for me) a quick shag turns into true love far too quickly for my liking.

As a Sirius fan my own headcanon of him as a difficult, complex, tricksy, damaged man often gets in the way of my enjoyment of stories about him and it did here. I admit I found your characterisation of him rather undefined and two-dimensional. But I'm not your target audience so I'm not who you have to please and I'm sure your readers will like it. You've already picked up several favourites in a day, so you must be doing something right.
