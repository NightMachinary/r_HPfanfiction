Very early in my days of reading fanfiction I read a story that (if I remember correctly) is something like this.

There was a star(??) shaped place in the Chamber where Voldemort could apparate in. Harry might have been his son. Pretty sure Voldemort had a girlfriend/wife or something like that. Lily Potter and Alice Longbottom were both alive and well by second year. I think he was also friends with Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, and Blaise Zabini. I don't think the story was more than 200k words. Pretty sure it was more than 100k, though. I don't remember if it was just one story or a series.

Does this sound familiar to anybody?
