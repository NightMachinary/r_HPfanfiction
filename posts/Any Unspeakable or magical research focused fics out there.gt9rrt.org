I'm looking for fics about Unspeakables! Preferably long, and not Harry-centric. I'll settle for fics that focus a lot on magical research/theory and pushing the limits of what magic can do, or finding unique ways to use magic, too.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks! :)

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

*** I second this story. Lots of spell inventing by our girl and lots of magical theory throughout. There's two more books after this one. The second goes through years 5-7 and has even more spells and theory. Third bool is the shortest and ties everything up. 10/10
