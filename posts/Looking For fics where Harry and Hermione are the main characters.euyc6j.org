** That's going to be tough to find, considering a lot of Harmony fics aren't labelled correctly on FFN. You could try to sort it out but I'd doubt it's accuracy. AO3 might be better, idk.

** Well, there's Methods of Rationality, but YMMV. Many love it, many despise it. It does feature Harry and Hermione, though (primarily Harry). Very divergent from canon; it takes elements of first year (broomstick lessons, Quirrell, troll, Stone) and tells a very different story with them.

** Linkffn(12978018) is the only one that comes to mind.
