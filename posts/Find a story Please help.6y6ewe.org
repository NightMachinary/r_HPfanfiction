Harry is put under a curse where his personalities changes, he forces Draco to become his slave. I believe that Hermione might have been able to break the curse, after Draco is of sound mind he goes to Severus' place.

Narcissa is alive and in the story, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco and Severus are in it. Not sure who all else.

Been looking ages for it. Multi-chapter, not sure if it's finished or not. Might not be on Fanfiction.net site, might be somewhere else. Who knows maybe the writer took it down because I haven't found it and I've been searching from memory for it. Or if anything sounds familiar please let me know!

  How much of what you are depends on your environment? If everything changed, who would you become? Harry Potter is about to find out. If it would save everything he loved, could he become a Dark Lord?

**** I don't think that's it.

I think I remember a few more things about it:

I think Harry was attacked by either Voldemort himself or a Death Eater during the final battle, and then Harry managed to kill Voldemort.

His personality/attitude changed as I said, forcing Draco to become a slave of his. He took Draco to Grimmauld Place and chained him in either a basement or another room I believe.

Something happened (can't remember what) that made them realize that Harry must be under a curse or something. Hermione, and maybe Poppy ended up breaking the curse setting Harry free.

Harry had trained Draco to be a slave when his personality had still been changed, he went back to Grimmauld Place and found Draco chained in a room.

Harry was horrified, I don't think he remembered doing anything to Draco, or it was very vague of his memories. (Can't remember sorry).

Harry afterwards tried to bring Draco back to normal, his mind had snapped under Harry's training, or something.

But Harry ended up contacting Narcissa I believe, asking her different things of what he could do to bring Draco back to normal.

After a while Draco regained his sound mind and fled to Severus Snape's place. That was around the time I stopped reading it.
