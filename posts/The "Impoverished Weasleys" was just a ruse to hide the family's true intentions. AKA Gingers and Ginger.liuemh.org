Despite having been to The Burrow hundreds of times over the past 10 years, Harry had never seen this door before.

The whole family had been packed into the kitchen to celebrate his and Ginny's recent engagement when he had stepped out to go to the loo. He was just washing up when he noticed a small door in the wall of the room that had definitely not been there before.

His curiosity getting the better of him, Harry pushed open the door and was greeted by an enormously long staircase going down. He started walking down and down and down until he came to the bottom of the staircase. There sat another door.

Harry pushed it open and was stunned by what he saw. He had entered a large room that looked to be the size of a large warehouse. On the many miles of shelves that sat throughout the room, there were tens of thousands of small plastic containers holding what appeared to be spice.

House-elves and humans alike were walking around, most lugging boxes of the spice into fireplaces across the walls and disappearing away. Harry walked over to one of the shelves and peered through the dim light at one of the bottles. It had no label, but inside there was a fine orange powder. In fact, in every bottle, there was a fine orange powder.

Harry turned around and bolted back up the stairs.

“Ron!” Yelled Harry as he burst back into the kitchen. Not caring that everyone was staring at him he continued, “What the hell is in the bathroom?” “What?” said Ron, “In the bathroom! A door which I've never been and until now I don't think even existed!”

“With the passage behind it?” said Ron, “Yeah.” “And the warehouse behind it?” “Yeah!” With that, Ron yelled out “He found it!”

It was pandemonium. All of the Weasleys were surrounding Harry and clapping him on the back and Ron was shouting “He's in, He's in!”.

Poor Harry, who obviously had no idea what was going on stood there dumbfounded until Ginny piped up, “Mum, Dad I don't think he knows.” Ron looked at her like she was daft.

“What do you mean he doesn't know?” “I mean he doesn't know” replied Ginny, “Maybe you should explain everything before you go around acting like he won the bloody World Cup!”

As Harry looked at her gratefully, Arthur spoke up.

“Right then. Harry, you see . . . "

For the next two hours. Harry was given a crash course on the Weasley Family.

Turns out, the whole “Impoverished family living in a shitshack” was just a ruse to disguise their true intentions.

The Weasleys that Harry knew were a major branch of the larger Weasley family (all of which were redheads). The Weasley family controlled the entire world market for one type of spice. That spice was most fittingly ginger, of which Ron and Ginny's Family were the head of distribution for England.

All of the family members' jobs were meant to aid the business, as Bill managed the finances, Charlie used the dragons for protection, Arthur and Percy used their jobs at the ministry to keep sway over the Wizengamot and Aurors, and George and Ron used the joke shop as a distribution centre.

All family arguments, all their activity in the Order of the Phoenix, and especially all of their appearances as a poor family were simply to keep their cover. In fact, Dumbledore was in the family's pocket and Fred had only been killed because Augustus Rookwood had tried to betray the family and Fred had gotten Voldemort to punish him as a result. (That's right, even Voldemort was under the family's thumb)

Old family magic had decreed that only members of the family could have access to the facilities, and non-family members could not even see any entrances or buildings.

With his engagement to Ginny, the wards had decided that Harry was now a Weasley, despite not being ginger.

Harry was amazed. Life was still full of surprises.
