Especially in manipulative!Dumbledore fic harry always goes back to hogwarts despite the danger/subpar education.

Why the fuck does he do that. Is being out of his fucking mind an essential character trai- oh...

Oh. Oh dear even in cannon harry is both a masochist and absolutely fucking insane.

Ok so here is my question why does genius!powerful!godlike!super!harry go back to hogwarts for no ficking reason in every goddamn fic unless he is a super submissive midget in a gay harem. Lik, what the fuck. Can you please give us an explanation (not that the question isn't semi-rhetorical. I mean, I know that it's because hogwarts is where everything established happens and to go anywhere else is more than most are going to read and/or write not to say that there isn't a level of universe established enough to feasibly write a fic taking place so where that was never mentioned in can- eh. Hem, Hem. Cough, couch. But I digress) for why this phenomenon takes place.

I guess I should get off my ass and write this shit huh.

** Simple, there's two explanations:

First: In universe - Harry often wants to stop Voldemort and protect his friends (and often he doesn't see a way to do that from another country!)

Second: Most writers don't want to make up an entire new school (or flesh out one that we know about, but don't know any real details about like Durmstrang or Beauxbatons)

Still, I agree: Harry often kind of stays the same if when writers make him more intelligent, more driven etc. when really the ripple effects alone should change EVERYTHING (from friends (which very intelligent and academicly inclined person would be friends with Ron? Hell, even Hermione would probably be more of an academic rival than a true friend!), to stuff happening (a truly intelligent Harry would probably look into leaving Hogwarts after first year, hell he might start looking after the troll incident, especially if he didn't save Hermione and the teachers were too late to do so - so a student died on school grounds and nobody is truly looking into the why and nobody is punishing the bullies that are partially to blame?) etc. etc.)
