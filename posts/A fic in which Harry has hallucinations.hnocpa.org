#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

**** Woah, I don't know what I was expecting going in, but it wasn't that. I got to the end of the final chapter (so far) and realised I'd been holding my breath.

** The whole entire fic isn't hallucinations, but he does have really trippy ones for most of it. It's a WiP.

** Not sure, I can offer you Percy has hallucinations?

I appreciate that you did only ask for who components, though.

Edit: I remembered [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/812453][this oneshot]] with Harry in. It's very well written. Heads up, unless you feel you need trigger warnings, I would suggest not reading the tags. I didn't, by chance, and was glad as the warnings are spoilers. On re-read, maybe do. Ah. Your choice.
