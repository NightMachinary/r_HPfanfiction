I'm looking for stories where the main character, preferably Harry, is at least part-demon. Anything can come as long as there is no slash. Sry, but thats a big no for me :D

** linkffn(Do Unto Others by Lady Salazar)

DmC crossover. I don't remember how well written it is or even how it ends, but I DO remember it didn't suck too much.

You've probably read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][The Denarian Renegade]] given how often it's thrown around on this sub, but it's worth mentioning just in case.

  James made a mistake. Lily got even. In the wake of Voldemort's resurrection, the consequences catch up to Harry, and from there it's demons, dark wizards, and devil hunters. Let's rock! HP/DMC crossover, fifth year AU.

*** A HP/DMC crossover?! It's even complete and the writing seems decent! Thanks for the recommendation!
