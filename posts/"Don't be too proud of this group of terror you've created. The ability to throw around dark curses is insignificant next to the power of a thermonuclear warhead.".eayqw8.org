** Nuking a city of ten million people in order to fight a quasi-immortal dark wizard who can just whip up a new body for himself in a cauldron, sounds like a plan.

*** God! Have you wizard-lovers got so little vision?

I, a staunch muggle-lover, can easily see the best course of action.

Bomb the whole world! Wizards can't escape to fight another day of they have nothing to return to.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

*** "I find your lack of faith in science disturbing." With the push of a button low yield Plutonium-238 dirty bombs detonate simultaneously in Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Malfoy Manor, the Ministry and Hogsmeade.

"And by the way, there are no wards against radiation. We tested with help from the Goblins, who were happy to cooperate and remove the funds from Gringotts, in exchange for revenge and access to international financial markets."

** The only use I see for the atomic bomb in a magical war is a first-strike against the ministry or Gringotts. And unless Gringotts is a gateway to a vast underground city, a large conventional explosive would work just as well. But once the enemy knows they are at war with you, if you know where to nuke you've already done 95% of the work.

** Hermione had an idea, an awful idea. Hermione got a wonderful awful idea. If magic disrupted electronic, could electronics disrupt magic?

She smiled a smile that was most awful. Hermione had a wonderful awful idea.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

She smiled as the magic spinning buzzer buzzed no more. It would not spin, never spin again. The faraday cage had worked okay.

Muggle science was useless they had all said, better off sleeping in late instead.

Don't cram your head full of muggle stuff you see. Well Hermione smiled her awful smile at her device that made a small EMP.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Death Eaters all laughed as she showed off her blaster; they waved their sticks firing magic though she was faster.

It was with a awful grin she began to strike, as their magic did fail she did move in.

A blast from her blaster and a shot from her gun. Oh she watched them scream as she laughed at the fun.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Now their is a ministry no more, no phone booth or mystery door.

No racism, classism or is'ims at all, well not after the fall.

The problems had a simple fix indeed, a EMP blaster is all you need.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hermione had gotten an idea, an awful idea. Hermione got a wonderful awful idea.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Not totally what you prompted with but got back from a christmas musical with the wife today and this just came into me head.
