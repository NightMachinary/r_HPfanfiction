these fics are always have a kid thats like “are you asking me for.... a favor?” /quirks eyebrow menacingly, swirls wine glass of apple juice/ “your comportment has been so admirable thus far... i'd hate to see you slip now” /smiles knowingly/

that kid woulda got his head dunked in a fucken toilet in my middle school


** Yeah, always makes me cringe when writers write the Slytherins as Bond villains. They're just teenagers! No teenager is /that/ interested in politics and social manoeuvring, doesn't matter how they were raised. Ambition and cunning doesn't have to mean political ambition, it could mean literally anything, a kid with a dream to open his own broom store would get sorted into Slytherin.

*** Idea for a story, it's canon that Harry had dreamed of being on a flying motorcycle, but it's only mentioned once in book 1, instead Harry had dreamed of it more than once and thus flying is one of his dearest ambition, maybe even his normal dream of being a pilot maybe in the army is encouraged by the dursleys, Dumbledore convinces Harry to come to Hogwarts by telling him of flying brooms, and quidditch, his ambition to become a professional player lands him in slytherin, lol maybe even Harry finding common ground with others over flying and the love of flying is the "power he knows not"

*** I was a bit disappointed by encountering casual homophobia while I was already at the third volume

Namely the author letting dumbledore calling himself "a monster" for being gay in letters and making a big thing about this, while in the canon it was only inspiring Grindelwald, and the death of his sister that gave bad PR, not the being gay part.

**** Hey, author here...just wanted to give context here. The Dumbledore/Grindelwald letters that you're talking about took place in 1899. Correct me if I'm wrong, but being gay was not particularly acceptable then. It also represents Dumbledore's opinion of himself, not my opinion of the gay community. Please don't misrepresent my work with these accusations.

***** First, I'd like to say that I still enjoyed your writing.

However when I say that your fiction contains homophobia that does not necessarily mean the entire work or writer themselves is homophobic. It just means that your fiction contains people/events/situations/language that are homophobic.

Even the most LGBT+ positive movies and work often contain homophobic remarks/plotlines/characters. Encountering homophobia is not everyone's cup of tea, which is why I gave this warning (which is also why I tend to tag works like that with 'contains (implied) homophobia' or such. People deserve to know before being tenthousands of words into the story (which is also why I posted this on a recommendation thread).

The HP series by JKR does not contain homophobic language like this. Since that differs from the canon it is worth a warning.

> The Dumbledore/Grindelwald letters that you're talking about took place in 1899.

First, that does not matter. The fic still contains homophobic language, which people would like to be warned about in advance, whatever the reason for inclusion is, however reasonable or realistic the inclusion is.

Secondly. You as a writer as perfectly allowed to include a homophobic society in your works, you do not necessarily have to justify it. Likewise a writer is also perfectly allowed to skip homophobia or create a non-homophobic society.

The wizarding society is separate from the muggle one. It doesn't have to be either homophobic or non-homophobic. Especially a wizarding world which does not follow the Abrahamic religions. A great part of the world did not really have heavy homophobia before proselytization and the institution of colonial laws by W-European colonizers in the 19th century either.

Even in our own (muggle) history there have been periods where laws were more or less strict. Actual historical letters between same-sex lovers from this period were often positive and did not contain words like 'monster' when referring to themselves, only focussing on their own romance or just basic life.

It was your choice as a writer to let Dumbledore use these harsh homophobic terms to describe himself. That is not necessarily homophobic, or makes the entire work homophobic, but it still means that this work contains some some strong homophobia.

Thirdly. If the work as an entirety is homophobic is not possible to say, since it's not finished. There may come some cool plot and stories due to your inclusion of these homophobic remarks used by Dumbledore, or not, but it's not finished.

> Please don't misrepresent my work with these accusations.

I didn't, I merely gave a warning that your work contains casual homophobia and told them how it happened. I'm sorry you misunderstood my intentions. Don't feel to pressured by this to reply (i'm sure you've got better things to do), likewise I strongly suggest people to not attack the author. It's my opinion that giving unwanted negative criticism to fanfiction is bad form, however since this was a recommendation thread and not a comment on the fic itself I think people deserve to know that it does contain homophobic language.

*tldr; Your work contains homophobia. That does not make the work or you personally homophobic. People deserve to know that it will contain homophobia. Especially with the extreme words Dumbledore uses.*

Yeah, those fics are retarded. You can certainly make a manipulative little arsewipe out of a teenaged character, but that doesn't mean they'd behave like a bad stereotype of politicking aristocrats. Ends up looking more like a chuunibyou than anything else. A well written manipulative kid still behaves within the norms of behaviour of his average year mates, otherwise he'd stick out like a sore thumb and be marginalized.

Only first year has been written, and it looks like it has been abandoned. Although, the author did have a long hiatus between 2010 and 2014 and wrote a few chapters, so he might come back again. It's reasonably well written, and has none of the shitty Slytherin house tropes.

** Magical Relations. On one hand it's been unfinished for like two years. On the other, there's 71 chapters. The writing actually improves as the story goes on and it has the added benefit of making the characters feel like they're actually going from childhood through adolescence. Dudley gets a hogwarts letter and gets sorted into gryffindor, which puts Harry off gryffindor, so the hat puts him in slytherin. Nobody is overpowered, there's real conflict, and the characters act like actual people.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
