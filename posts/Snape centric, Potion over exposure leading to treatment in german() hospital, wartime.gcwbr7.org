:END:
Hey I am searching for a specific fic where the ministry enforces regulations regarding Potion work and exposure and Snape has to get tested if his exposure over his work with potions was too much which it was by alot. Which leads to moodiness and depression and other issues so they contact a hospital out of the country and try to arrange everything it is still wartime and even voldemort wants snape to get treatment and he begins while still teaching which he shouldn't.
