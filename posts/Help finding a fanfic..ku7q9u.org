:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So im looking for a fic. It ends with dramione but 80% of it is sevmione. They got together at the end of 6th year right before snape kills dumbledore and he helped her while they were on the run and he snuck to see her right before they were caught by snatchers and again right before the battle of hogwarts. And no one understood why hermione tried so hard to save him and was absolutely devastated when she couldnt. Shes pregnant and broken as she tries to return for her 7th year. Draco is told all about her and severus from one of his portraits after he receives a "upon the event of my death" letter asking him to take care of her and make sure she survives and lives and loves. So he does.
