I've been on a bit of a kick lately, and have really been enjoying fics with Slytherin House politics and hierarchy. I would love any recommendations for good fics that include this! It can be in any house, not just Slytherin, and I would prefer Harry-centric. Any pairing welcome (her/slash/etc).

I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]], the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] series, and I recently went through all of [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/sunmoonandstars/pseuds/sunmoonandstars][sunmoonandstars]] fics. Thank you!


** Linkffn(New Blood) is a really interesting story with Slytherin politics that's getting updated really frequently right now, it's basically about Hermione slowing convincing everyone that she's totally pureblood and at the top of the hierarchy even though it's completely made up. Also some friendships with Gryffindors and Ravenclaws who see her as the poor muggleborn Slytherin.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
