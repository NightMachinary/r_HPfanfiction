I suppose no one here was following this story, but I could try. The story had about thirteen chapters and almost no reviews, I think three or four at best. Then the author deleted it. I thought it was a shame because even though there were several other Marauders Era canon compliant Snape/Lily stories I thought this one was a good addition. However I can't remember the author's name. Does anyone know about it, or the author?


** Was SS and the Marauders the title?

What year/month was it written? Anything notable about the story that could be used to identify it?

*** Thanks for your reply, it was started recently in 2015 or 2016, and the chapters were very short.

**** So this is going out on a huuuuuuuge limb, but does it have anything to do with the fan film of the same name? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsntGGjxiw]] Like maybe someone transcribed the video into a fic, and then was forced to delete it? Kind of like that person on ffn.net who was writing Cursed Child as a book based on the screenplay. Sorry, I'm a huge Snape fan but I don't think I've come across the fic you're looking for!
