So I recently read Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure and really enjoyed it. It was refreshing to see a Dumbledore who isn't an Evil!Dumbledore, or at least a senile old fool which seems to be fairly common in fan fiction.

I was wondering if anyone had an other fics that have a decent Dumbledore in them. I enjoyed reading the story from mainly his perspective but they don't necessary need to so, I am happy for any stories that show him in a good light, as someone willing to help other (rather than try and control them for the "Great Good"). Whether than be helping train Harry to some degree or something different.

Looking forward to hearing your responses.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Let's seee... Dumbledore as a main character is hard to come by, but...

He's pretty good in the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl]] series, an AU where Ron Reasley is a girl named Veronica. There's a certain warmth to him there that he lacks in a lot of other fanfics; he's not infallible and is taken by suprise a few times, but he's definitely a kindly and benevolent figure who gets a few really good moments. Especially his confrontation with the Voldemort-possessed Quirrel during Harry's first year... and his "alternate method" for getting the Philosopher's Stone out of the Mirror Erised is both funny and sad at the same time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/][Backwards With Purpose]] is one of the classic time-travel fics; this time Harry, Ron and Ginny are the ones travelling through time to relive their Hogwarts days. Uniquely, one of the first things they do is go to Dumbledore and tell him everything -- and so Dumbledore works as their ally throughout the story.

** My absolute favorite Dumbledore is in, and despite the description and title it is a fantastic fic, linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)

Just give it a try, I know soul bonds have a terrible rep (for good reason), but this is a genuinely amusing fic. Plus, as I said before, the Dumbledore in it is fantastic.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
