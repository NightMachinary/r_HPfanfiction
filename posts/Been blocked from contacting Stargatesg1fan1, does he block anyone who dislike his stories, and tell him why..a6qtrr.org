** You definitely overreacted. Authors can write whatever they want and it's not up to you to police them. That story is marked as mature. That alone is enough. It doesn't matter if kids ignore that. That's on them and the parents.

You can't seriously expect everybody to write a certain way just in case children happen across their works. Your line of thinking is absurd, and while the story itself is absurd as well, your review was out of line and the author had every right to block you.

This is the internet. It's full of fucked up things and it's up to the parent to make sure their kid doesn't come across any of it. It's certainly not up to the creator of whatever it is.

/"I am over 18 years old"/ has to be the most common lie on the Internet.

** Fanfiction is full of stuff like this; that's probably why it has such a bad reputation. For reasons which mystify me it is very popular. But this is rated M so no one under 16 should be reading it, and if they are, well, that's their look out and not your problem.

It may well break site rules, I haven't read it so I don't know, but if it does you can report it. It's highly unlikely that the site admin will take any action however.

But it's the writer's prerogative to block you if they wish. Your review will stay there.

Just move on. Life is too short to waste it on worthless rubbish.

*** True, but can you honestly say that kids will follow such a rule, not to mention that rape in that story in not really considered bad if Harry does it. Ron, or Snape got fucked, but Harry was let off pretty damn easy. I don't like the message it sends, or the casualness of it all.

**** Don't go down this rabbit hole, it will never end. There are many fics like this.

You can't stop children reading it if they want to but M rated fics do not show on ffn by default, you have to actively choose to see them, so as I said before, it's not your problem. If it bothers you that much, report the fic.

** I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not a troll.

It's not any of your business what this author chooses to write, and it's not his responsibility that your niece stumbled across adult content. If she needs her internet usage monitored that's her parents/guardians job.

It doesn't sound like a story I would ever read or enjoy, but rape fantasies another adult content is common in fanfiction and people are entitled to write what they want as long as it's not breaking site rules. The author does not have to take it down because you don't like it, and nor do they have to engage in polite conversation with you.

*** Have you actually read it. The story says a lot about what type of person he is. If he was writing his own story using his own characters i'd agree, but he's using famous characters that kids like more than adults. When you write about such characters, it is his business that my niece searching for a Harry Potter found this pile of excrement. She didn't find it on Fanfiction, but on hpfanficarchive.com. They don't censor, and last I checked he said the smut version was on that site. I linked the Fanfiction one, because I don't want to link that one for obvious reasons.

You believe what you want, but he is at least somewhat responsible for this situation. Again if he wasn't using such well known characters that focus on kids then I wouldn't care too much, but he is, and therefore should be held accountable.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

**** No, I haven't, because I glanced over the summary and warnings and saw that I would probably be upset by it.

If a site doesn't censor, don't let your niece on it. It's that simple.

Like you said believe what you want. But you believing he is somewhat responsible for the situation doesn't make it so and he can choose to stop you from imposing your belief onto him and/or harass him.

** Wow, you know that rape fantasies are a thing, yes? I's not everyone's thing, but don't go kinkshaming people as long as they're not looking at real exposure?

And as for children finding such stories - if it's against the site's rules, report it. If not, install a blocker on the PC your kid uses and block the site. It's that simple.
