I have had this one stubborn muse for a female harry and it refuses to leave, I fear writing a Mary sue so it stopped me from writing it.

I would like to know what's your opinion concerning this trope, what do you like about it, what do you hate and what should I not include?

My muse is a female harry who grew up in a spoiled world with her living parents, all mauraders alive and Neville as the boy who lived, thus making her a spoiled, snobby and demanding person, until Albus stepped in and sent her in an alternate universe, it was supposed to be a six month trip in an universe where her parents ' died'.

She returns later than the date limits, looking and acting very different ( cold, avoidant, smokes, drinks and has a few scars here and there, refuses to tell what happned)


** What I hate about fem!Harry:

- Often pairs her with Draco or Tom

- Often makes her into a Mary Sue

- Often forgets to mention the 'issues' which girls generally get as they grow up

- Often makes her into a bitch

- Dumbles bashing very common in these fics, as is Snape, Dark side, and Malfoy apologism

** I'm wary of anything that sets up Dumbledore to be an easy target of blame. Also you should have some reason for the reader to sympathize with the character. Skipping over all the trials that make her 'tough' would be cheating the process of character growth and therefore not create the bond of reader empathy.

I mean, take it from Neville's perspective. Magdelene Potter the beautiful spoiled brat falls into a hole. Compared to his quests, that's just the end of some background noise. She comes back, acting all punk, goth, damaged, or whatever and hinting that she could help him if he worked hard to crack her Snape-like spiny exterior. "Yeah, no thanks. Go be drunk somewhere, preferably out of my way."

*** I assume, from my muse that albus is not the target for all the blame, hell, even the femeharry did not shove all said blame on his back.

I'm also incredibly wary about how to show her, but there's no gothness or punknness with this potter, but I curiously get cynical and philosophical gives from her, there's also the fact that she had ho relive her life in another dimension where she-holds the weight of being the girl who lived along with interferences being Norse mythology of magic and gods

** I'm sensing a plot I might be into. Is Harry also in this universe where her parents are dead?

Regarding your question, I've a story that's goes along those lines a bit, and had been accused of my fem!Harry approaching Mary Sueness during the early chapters. You need to identify what her weaknesses are and then write them in.

It's important that your main character not win all their encounters and conflicts. Remember that in real life failure is the best teacher, so a good strategy is to set up minor victories and major defeats early on leading up to the climactic conflict.

That way the victory (if it ends in victory) is so much sweeter in light of all their previous failures and as a result of their resilience.

I really do think that having these type of plot milestones should naturally give rise to character flaws if you keep in mind that every failure should result from one or more character flaw(s), and through these experiences, your characters should, while not being perfect, manage to put everything together well enough to eek out success because they've either eradicated or just withstood their flaws.

Tl;dr: if you make your character lose sometimes, their failures prevent them from being a Mary Sue.

*** Thank you, I happned to be an angsty writer who loves putting trauma in my work The thing is, harry was supposed to be sent in a version of herself where she no longer spoiled and such, but due to the rules of magic and gods, she merged with her baby alternate self and kinda redid her life with no memory of being the spoiled child of the potters

While she is not a loving and lovable person, has a mountain of weaknesses and also being emotionally stunned from the shit she went through, I still fear overpowering her

  thus making her a spoiled, snobby and demanding person
#+end_quote

That is basically what all Mary Sues end up as, unintended or not. And not everyone who grows up in good conditions ends up an annoying snob. And I second what [[/u/wordhammer]] said in this thread about Dumbledore's role and about how annoying her reappearance would be.

#+end_quote

Honestly, the idea is intriguing but it always ends up with a way too girly character which has more narrative focus on being female than on being Harry Potter.

IMO the best way to handle this trope is to keep most things as they were and only diverge where it would make sense. FemHarry would still be at the core Harry. Being a girl might mean that Dudley would not have gotten away with as much bullying, but overall her childhood abuse would be similar.

Starting Hogwarts, she would be basically the same. However, friends are the obvious divergence. Ron is very unlikely, Hermione as well (or at least not in the way they became friends in canon). Lavender would probably take FemHarry under her wing if she ends up in Gryffindor, the other girls are basically blanks. Maybe Padma in Ravenclaw and Susan or Hannah in Hufflepuff, but that's just based on the fact that we know even less about the rest. FemHarry would still be into Quidditch, however, if Malfoy is still her nemesis, he would get a lot of ribbing over his obsession over a girl. Alternatively, FemHarry gets "adopted" by Katie Bell since they are the youngest girls in the sport and there is no gender barrier this time.

**** How about this then:

Someone in FemHarry's world does some ritual in the hope of bringing Voldemort back, yet all the ritual achieves is to throw FemHarry into the canon universe.

Going by your goal, you basically want FemHarry to be OotP Tonks a few years younger. And that would actually fit your "drinking, tattoos and bad attitude" goal. Scratch the part where she goes back and instead focus on how such a FemHarry would screw over the canon universe. She has no way back, no friends or family (Sirius disappeared, Lupin avoiding responsibility, the Potters dead), basically the perfect setup for a YOLO mentality.

Since you want angst, the easiest way is the disconnect between her and who had been her friends in the original universe. Which leads to feeling alone, drinking, getting tattoos and so on.
