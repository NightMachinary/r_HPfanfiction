I have been planning the following Harry Potter fan fiction idea, and I may start writing it once my current project is finished. It is still at an early stage of brainstorming, and I decided to ask people on this subreddit for comments and further ideas you would like to see this story featuring. (If someone else is interested in writing this story, by all means!)

The name of the story is *Harry Potter and the Jacobin Club*, and the base idea is this.

The Dursleys are nice people who consider Harry a member of the family, and neither he nor Dudley is spoilt. Harry's official name is Harry Dursley. Vernon is not a businessman, but a prominent politician, and becomes the Prime Minister of Muggle Britain after the general election of 1992. From him Harry learns about politics at an early age, and it is Harry's ambition to become a politician himself.

Harry gets his Hogwarts letter and is taken to Diagon Alley. (He is not accompanied by Hagrid or anyone too loyal to Dumbledore.) After coming from his Gringotts vault he meets Lucius Malfoy who demands Harry to listen to him. At Lucius's insistence the Goblins perform a blood test on Harry whose true identity is revealed: he is in fact Hadrian Peverell, the richest heir of the noblest and most powerful families in the entire wizarding world. He has a vast fortune, several manors, hereditary seats in the Wizengamot, and many marriage proposals from prestigious pure-blood families. Lucius explains that Dumbledore has been using Harry's wealth and political influence for his own purposes, and offers to help Harry.

(You hate this idea so far, right? But here is the twist.)

Vernon happens to be a politician of the LABOUR party, and Harry has embraced his foster father's left-wing ideals. Harry is not interested in the aristocratic pomp in the tiniest bit; on the contrary, he is disgusted by the medieval status quo of the wizarding world. It becomes his great purpose to destroy the system and establish a new one based on the ideology of democracy, social justice, and rule of law. At Hogwarts, when Hadrian Peverell is called to be Sorted, Harry declares himself Harry Dursley. Most students are shocked. Harry is Sorted to Slytherin, and he immediately begins to form his revolutionary conspiracy, the Jacobin Club.

Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and others have strict orders from their fathers to befriend Harry at any means necessary, because their families desperately need Harry as their future ally in the politics of wizarding Britain. The pure-blood children have to feign interest in Harry's leftist propaganda, but years of exposure leaves its marks. Draco and the others eventually become like many contemporary leftist politicians in real life: born to rich families, have a good education, have never experienced the life of a disadvantaged working-class person, but still believe they know what is good for the working-class, better than the working-class people themselves.

As almost every Hogwarts student is converted to Jacobinism, the revolution starts getting attention. Muggle-borns and many half-bloods realise this is the reform they have been waiting for. Gilderoy Lockhart, who is not a fraud or an obnoxious narcissist in this story, becomes Harry's mentor and the poster boy of the revolution.

Unfortunately, Voldemort is not such an idiot as he pretended to be, and he finds many ways of using the revolution for his own purposes...

*** I mean I'm like 90% sure the whole point of this was to be as satire as possible to every trope you're annoyed about here if so it could be hilarious to read. Although I'm also scared its not satire at all

** Commie crackfick? Definitely gonna read that. I'm surprised anyway that many fanfics keep the aristocracy everywhere... on the other hand, UK is one of the few monarchies left in Europe and even people on the continent are hooked on everything Royal... s i g h.

**** And you can fuck off, too, commie (and judging by your comments, one of these Green neo-Luddites, as well).
