Is there any fanfiction like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] where all the trio is taking the Indy!Harry route?


** I can remember two which fit your criteria -

Linkffn(The Sum of their parts by holdmybeer)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]

This second one does not 'exactly' fit your request but all the three of the trio do play an active part.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
