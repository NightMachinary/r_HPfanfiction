:END:
Trying to find a time travel Tomarry (Tom Riddle/Harry Potter) fic.

I originally read it on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]] and it was quite long and very well-written.

* Plot from memory
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot-from-memory
  :END:

- Harry travels back in time to Tom Riddle's Hogwarts era. I believe the time travel followed the final duel between Harry and Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts in the Deathly Hallows.
- Harry befriends Tom and they commence a relationship. Tom cares deeply for Harry.
- After graduating from Hogwarts, Tom and Harry move in together. Harry tries to influence Tom's behaviour but Tom still creates his horcruxes. There are a few times when Harry decides to leave Tom but Tom convinces Harry to stay. I recall one occasion when Tom comes home after a bloody murder.

*Travelling after Hogwarts*

- Tom and Harry go travelling on the Continent to explore the limits of magic.
- Tom tries to persuade and eventually forces Harry to make his own horcrux. I believe from memory this occurred during their travel, where Harry stabs a beggar or a stranger.
- Harry feels such remorse for the murder that his splintered soul begins to heal. As Tom is aware, the remorse can kill you. Tom is frightened that instead of saving Harry from death, Harry is dying from the horcrux ritual.
- Tom performs complex magic on Harry which acts as a 'stopper' to Harry's remorse, thus pausing the potentially fatal healing process. However, unbeknownst to Tom, the spellwork had the unintentional side effect of curbing /all/ of Harry's emotions, including his love for Tom. Tom believes that Harry is back to his old self. He confesses his love for Harry, they spend their days travelling and nights making love.
- Tom is horrified when he discovers the side effects of the spell work. He lifts the spell from Harry, I can't remember how the horcrux healing issue is resolved.

*Return to England*

- The next plot point I can recall is Tom returning to England. Harry remains at Tom's side and befriends Tom's inner circle of Death Eaters.
- At this point, Tom is known to the world at large as Lord Voldemort. Tom learns of Sybill Trelawney's prophecy and becomes obsessed with finding the child "with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". Harry tries to dissuade Tom to no avail. Harry realises that the unfolding events lead to his parents' murder. He begins to give tip-offs to the Order of the Phoenix ("OOP") to try and protect his parents.
- Harry later takes one of the Death Eaters into his confidence and that Death Eater becomes a double agent for the OOP. I believe the turning point was when this Death Eater is bitten by a werewolf?
- Tom catches Harry during a tip-off mission. Harry admits the extent of his betrayal.
- Tom is entirely in denial, he's talking about how "We'll get through this," and "We will get over this, Harry". (My poor babies.) Tom locks Harry in their chamber.
- During a visit, Harry and Tom struggle, break a mirror, and Harry stabs Tom with a shard of glass. Can't recall how but Harry dies during the fight. This devastates Tom. He's sworn off love which has brought him more pain and betrayal than he thought he could feel.
- Tom goes down the same path as HP cannon.

*Ending*

- While Voldemort's reign of terror is occurring, the Death Eater Turned Double Agent for the OOP saves Harry somehow and takes care of him in a cottage. They work on some sort of restorative potion.
- Harry waits until the final duel at the Battle of Hogwarts. During the kerfuffle of Voldemort's (apparent) death, Harry steals the barely alive remains of Voldemort and puts him into a cauldron, pours in the restorative potion, and patiently nurses him back to health. I'm pretty sure i remember the Voldemort which emerges from /this/ cauldron was remarked as being different from the Voldemort in the GoF.
- Voldemort/Tom is shocked that his Harry did not kill him but saved his life.
- Eventually Harry and Voldemort/Tom forgive each other and live happily ever after. (I'm nearly certain it was a happy ending.)

​

Thank you for reading through this very long post. I've tried to be as detailed and accurate as memory serves.

I've tried looking for this fanfic on FanFiction and various Tumblr recommendation lists but none serves. I really hope I can recover this fic and treasure it again.


** Hiya, I believe you are looking for the fic called ‘Their Verdict of Vagaries' by the author ‘Angstier' on ff.net. It's 635k words long with 81 chapters.

Reading your post reminded me of the fic again, took me a while to find it again but I hope you enjoy reading it again.
