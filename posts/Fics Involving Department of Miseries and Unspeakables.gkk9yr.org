Preferably fics where DOM and the Unspeakables play a major role in the story. Either by training Harry. Or by running a black op program against Voldemort. Or fics exploring things that happen down there. There's literally hundreds of ways you can involve DOM in a story, I just want something that uses them well.

Preferably, a complete fic. Thank you.

Edit: In the title it's supposed to be Department of Mystery not Miseries. Typo.


** Not sure if Department of Miseries instead of Department of Mysteries was a typo, but it gave me a nice chuckle.

*** That was a typo. But after reading one of the suggestion, Sphere of Influence, I don't know what to think.

** Department of Miseries sounds like an unofficial but widely used name for Muggleborn Registration Committee of Voldemort's ministry. Am gonna use it.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978
