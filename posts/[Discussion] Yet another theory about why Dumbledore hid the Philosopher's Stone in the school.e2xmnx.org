So I've read a bunch of theories and explanations about why Dumbledore put the stone in the school and each one seems to paint Dumbledore as either manipulative (It was to test Harry as a means of grooming him to be his dark lord slayer), incompetent (It was to protect the stone with an obstacle course three first years could bypass), or just irresponsible (It's a trap that involves luring a murderer into a school full of children)

But think I have a motivation that fixes those problems.

My theory is that the stone being in the school was meant to distract Voldemort from Harry. Dumbledore knows that Voldemort is hell bent on killing Harry, and since this is the first time HP was going to be in the public eye, he probably thinks Voldemort is going to try to break into Hogwarts anyway. Dumbledore also knows Tom's only other greatest desire is immortality, so he asks for the stone from Flamel in order to entice Voldemort and split his attention away from Harry should he somehow get into the Hogwarts. So why not place the stone somewhere besides a school full of children far away from Harry? Because Dumbledore is not sure what Voldemort prioritizes more and whether he would completely ignore the stone in favor of killing Harry. By placing the two in the same place he gives an actual incentive for Voldemort to keep his murder attempts sporadic and on the down-low until he acquires the stone (His first murder attempt at the quiditch match was probably because he was pissed they knocked out the troll so quickly).

As for why the defenses besides the mirror were so simple, if he made them too difficult he was probably worried Voldemort would just blast the place apart with fiendfyre and call it a day. By making problems that are solvable and require intel from multiple sources it delays Voldemort's actions when he tries to solve the problem and tries to see if Dumbledore is double bluffing him with how simple it all is. Also if the obstacles are too deadly and troublesome, Voldemort might just forget the stone and decide to make the best of a bad situation and kill Harry so the year isn't a complete waste.

Not only this, it doubles as a trap. If they manage to capture Voldemort as he tries to steal the stone, all the better. Then there's the whole question of whether the stone was real. Perhaps the stone actually /did/ need protecting and Dumbledore saw a way to do that and protect Harry at the same time. After all Voldemort couldn't bypass the mirror. And maybe just a small part of Dumbledore was glad he got to test how powerful Lily's love magic was.

Feel free to poke any holes in my theory


** As for the latter part - if there was only a mirror then someone just sitting there could say he just stumbled upon it and wasn't trying to do anything.

And other protections... well they couldn't be too deadly or some overly curious student would go and get themselves killed or maimed. And that way a bunch of first years managed to do it all.

I actually considered this a possibility but the problem is some of the protections could potentially be deadly. The Devil's Snare for one, as well as the Troll and the Poison. Unless it was all just theatricality and these were child safe versions and bluffs which I think is possible.

However I have another theory about why they aren't too deadly to first years. Dumbledore knows the at least four children of former death eaters will be starting school that year. Maybe he fears Voldemort would use them to get the stone for him and wanted to ensure that the kid wouldn't get killed in the process. I think Fluffy is enough to deter any students who are just idly curious.

**** The latter part - makes sense.

The former - I think it lets you go if you go slack (or was it just movie thing?). Still, if you figured out Fluffy you'd probably know devil's snare, it's rather easy to recognise, i think. You needn't go into troll chamber if you don't feel too confident and the flames probably won't burn you and the poison isn't lethal.

***** I think you needed fire in the book. But we know Devil's Snare /can/ be deadly from OoTP when someone in St Mungo's is assassinated by it. I don't know if it's easy to recognize or if Hermione is just a nerd. True about the troll though, you could just leave and it's probably the most difficult challenge. The fire probably is real though since getting past the troll means you're a serious customer.

** Alternatively, it was a test. In the sense that, in a sort of manipulative way, Dumbledore was enticing Voldemort to Hogwarts to confirm that he did indeed survive.

Dumbledore obviously believed Voldemort didn't fully die that night when he faced Baby Harry, but nobody could prove that (not even him). So how does he? Simple. He concocted a scenario where Voldemort would have no reason NOT to appear.

In the same year that Harry James Potter, the boy who destroyed him all those years ago, enters Hogwarts for the first time, he places the Philosopher's Stone in the school. Dumbledore turning Hogwarts into a Voldemort-themed mousetrap with Harry AND the Stone being the bait.

If the year goes by and neither of them are interfered with... then maybe Voldemort DID die all those years ago. But if one of them is attacked then BOOM, Dumbledore's right and Tom IS still out there.

** I think this works if we assume that Dumbledore has a specific reason to think that Voldemort's spirit would come back to the UK that year. Maybe I'm muddled from all the fanfics, but I don't recall that ever being full explained. I've always assumed that the Philosopher's stone was not originally in Gringotts, but kept there temporarily, and somehow that's what got his attention. Or perhaps Dumbledore merely put out some rumors and had a fake stone in the vault.... Just to see if anyone would bite.

*** It's been a very long time since I read the books, but wasn't it implied at one point that somebody had made an attempt on the stone already? I thought that's why it was moved to Gringotts in the first place. Once it was moved there, Dumbledore believed (rightly so) that Hogwarts was a much safer place for the stone than Gringotts.

I'm not sure if that first part was canon; I know that's what I've believed since before I discovered fanfiction, but I was younger when I last read the books so it's entirely possible that I was just making assumptions.

In fact how convenient that the day Harry goes to Diagon Alley Quirrel happens to be there too, maybe he kept the Stone at Gringotts so that the day Harry goes to buy supplies an agent of Voldemort would have to decide between killing Harry or making an attempt on the stone. And on the same day that decoy is no longer needed he has the stone removed.

** There is a massive hole in this theory.

Simply put, the nature of the traps and Dumbledores announcement to the school. The way the mirror works, the other traps were neither necessary to delay, nor even hard enough to really delay Voldemort. He could easily have bypassed all the traps without even thinking about fiendfyre regardless. The only reason he likely "played along" is to try and maintain his cover as a professor. And if his sole purpose was to distract Voldemort, Dumbledore really never needed to announce the corridor was off limits to the school because any competent adult wizard could have secured the area to where students would not have been able to investigate it much less blunder into it.

As for the stone itself. I have long been of the opinion that the stone was a fake and either Dumbledore knew it, or Flamel provided a fake without Dumbledores knowledge. It simply makes no sense for this event to be what causes the Flamels to decide to "pass on", especially after all that had happened in the prior century.

But the most important aspect is that it is simply unbelievable that Dumbledore was unaware there was something up with Quirrell. Even if he did not know it was Voldmort, the fact that snape was "stalking" him suggests there was some awareness or concern already. And since Snape is technically under Dumbledores "employ" in more ways than one, it was likely Dumbledore who had Snape checking out Quirrell. And if this was the case, why allow him to teach children in the first place unless hes manipulating the situation.

*** Dumbledore doesn't know Voldemort has already entered the school or that he is among the teachers. He makes the announcement to the students hoping they all write home about the crazy headmaster and spreads the word out for the third floor corridor to be a big juicy dangling Philosopher's Stone to aim for instead of the ready-to-murder Harry cooling on the windowsill nearby. Heck for all he knows, one of the upper year students could be minioning for Voldemort already.

The reason he had multiple teachers devise multiple easily bypassed traps is he knows how paranoid Voldemort is. Theoretically Voldemort doesn't know what the other traps are besides the troll. So even if he does figure one of them out and it sounds ridiculous (catch the flying key), he might think it was a ploy by Dumbledore to lure him into a false sense of security and the next room is just a doorknob with a flesh eating dark curse or maybe all those chess pieces are filled with garotting gas. By setting the other tasks Dumbledore can get an indicator of who to suspect by seeing who is going around trying to gather intel from the other protectors. I also like the theory is that the first room Fluffy is essentially harmless and primarily there to scare off any students who do stumble into it.

As for Quirrel, I guess it might have been more appropriate to kick him out but without knowing his motives Dumbledore probably wanted to keep him close to ensure he didn't do something drastic or maybe if he was working for Voldemort, get information out of him. Added to the fact he was the Muggle Studies teacher for some years before becoming the DADA teacher he had probably built up a few years of goodwill. That part I will agree is somewhat manipuulative

Ok this is just a straight up reach. I get your point but its highly unlikely he designed the traps because of Voldemorts "paranoid" nature. There would be far better ways to do it.

Yes but he probably suspects if word gets out of the mysterious dangerous third floor corridor Voldemort will put two and two together. He didn't want a big neon sign so much as a subtle way to get the word out. Third years and up might be over-heard discussing it in Hogsmead, it might just be a passing curiosity in letters home, and he knows the son of 4 former death eaters who could be in contact with the Dark Lord's just started Hogwarts that year so maybe he suspects they've been asked by their parents to look out for anything suspicious. That's why he words it so ominously, so it'll be gossiped about.

** I will answer to those arguments with those counter-arguments :

1. The Dark Lord priority was not to kill Harry before regaining his body and power. Using the power of your enemy designated by prophecy and that was the cause of your downfall in the fist place is more logical and used in many circumstances.
2. The Stone power does not include to recreate what was lost but only to gift whose who seek it longevity of life or riches. The Stone is a product of Alchemy, the art of transmutation of Metals and others materials. It cannot transmute into organics.
3. The Stone could have been hidden in a public location but the precise emplacement protected by a double fidelius.
4. If Dumbledore did not know about the horcruxes before the diary, he could not know that Tom was alive because Horcruxes are the only way available to Voldemort to obtain invulnerability to the veil between the physical word and the spirit world (death).

Finally Your arguments are more of the card castle or trump legal counsel on the prerogative power of the presidential office.

Regardless, I believe the blood protection was used to protect Harry not only from Voldemort, but primarily from Voldemort's supporters. The Death Eaters weren't exactly a moral or kind bunch, they were incredibly powerful and influential, and some of them got off completely free by claiming the Imperious (Malfoy) or making deals (Karkaroff). Harry was very much in danger moving forward, all it took was one Death Eater to learn his location to end the Boy-Who-Lived.

***** The last time Voldemort tried to Avada Kedavra Harry he ‘died' (horcruxes notwithstanding). He probably wasn't in a hurry to try that again.

*** 1. Voldemort literally tried to straight up murder Harry multiple times. I agree that "using the power of your enemy...that was the cause of your downfall" would be incredibly logical and wise, to an extent. However, consider that it also helped Harry (allowing him to come back from the second Killing Curse) and Voldemort wanted Harry dead in Philosopher's Stone, I think we can agree that he wasn't thinking that far ahead or logically at the time.\\
2. We know literally nothing about the Philospher's Stone other than who it was created by, what it looks like, that it's responsible for the Elixir of Life, and is a source for unlimited gold. This whole "cannot transmute into organics" is completely head-canon on your part or fanon.\\
3. The double fidelius? That is not something that has ever been discussed or mentioned in canon at all, again you are pulling information from fanon and head-canon material. We don't know the exact limitations of the Fidelius Charm yet, but we could speculate on why it wasn't used. Personally, I do believe that the stone should have been moved to a location under the /normal/ Fidelius Charm, with Dumbledore as Secret Keeper. However, that /entirely defeats the purpose of Dumbledore using the Stone./ Dumbledore used the stone as a way to bait out Voldemort; to finally confirm that he's still alive (if only just barely) and possibly capture/stop him.\\
4. You're assuming Horcruxes are the only way to keep someone alive. It's hinted at by Dumbledore that there are other ways to keep someone alive, horcruxes just being the most extreme. Even Voldemort mentions there are multiple experiments that could have helped him survive in the graveyard: "it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked... for I had not been killed." Dumbledore didn't /know/ about the horcruxes, though he suspected, until he saw the diary in CoS. Even that confounded him, however; because though he had considered a horcrux, he had never considered /horcruxes./ Voldemort was the first to imagine splitting the soul multiple times to ensure immortality. "Voldemort was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had.

​

I mean, overall I think the OP theory is a bit fun but lacking in solid verifiable proof (splitting attention between stone and Harry, etc.), but your counterarguments are rough my dude.

**** 1. The Horcruxes are the only way to true immortality because to become truly immortal one has to sewer the soul paths. Why Voldemort choose to make seven horcruxes because it split his soul into eight parts : the figure reversed of infinity. To obliterate ad infinitum the soul paths to death;

***** Voldemort wanted 7 pieces of his soul because it is a powerful number. He did not intend for Harry to become a Horcrux.

Six Horcruxes plus him is seven.
