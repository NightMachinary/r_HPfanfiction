** You probably would find the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterDayInTheLimelight][Day in the Limelight]] section of TVTropes to have many of these stories.

Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has several canon-consistent Post-DH tales that are very nicely written. His [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] just updated.

** I am working on a project about a group of next gen OC characters that attend Hogwarts. They are in the same year as Victoire, and a year below Teddy. I intend to make them run into each other several times during the story.
