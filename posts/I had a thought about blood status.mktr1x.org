In canon, and fanon, we seem to have the following classifications: muggleborn, squib, halfblood, and pureblood.

Muggleborn are magical that are born from 2 nonmagic parents

Squibs are basically nonmagical born from any combination of pure, half and muggle (with the exception of muggle-muggle)

Half bloods are born from a pure blood and a muggle.

Here is where I had my thought. James potter was pure blood. Lily was a muggleborn. Harry is the offspring of a pureblood and a muggleborn (not muggle). I see two ways of looking at this: harry /should/ either be a pure blood (born from 2 magical parents, so 100% magical blood) or should be 3/4 (100+50)/2) Either way not a half blood. (Personally I think he should be considered pureblood by the above logic)

If people think it should be latter not former, how many generations would it take to have your line considered pureblood again? For example, say people think that Harry by the above logic is 3/4 not a pure blood, and say he marrya a pure blood. The offspring would be ((3/4)+1)/2 = 7/8 or 87.5% "magical blood". That offspring has a child with another pureblood so ((7/8)+1)/2 = 15/16 or 93.75% "magical blood". If going this route, how close to 100% would one need to be considered "pure blood"? Since you could never again hit 100, only approaching 100 as t(time) approaches infinity, there has to be a point where you are considered pureblood again. So 3 generations? 4? 5?


** I think a Pureblood needs 4 magical grandparents

*** That still doesn't make sense to me lol because I look at it like james was obv pureblood, but lily was muggle born (which means she /had/ magical blood). I look at like like magical blood+ magical blood should produce what's considered pureblood offspring.

Not that any of this matters, just random thoughts I have lol

**** Harry is a half blood because his maternal grandparents were muggles. His children with Ginny would be considered Pureblood I think.

***** I believe a pureblood is someone who has all four non muggle and non muggleborn parents. Thus Harry's children would not be purebloods but his grandchildren could be.

Its based off old nazi beliefs with Judaism.

***** I think going off grandparents is bad canon logic tbh. He was born from 2 magical parents, he should be considered pure. At least that's the way the logic goes in my head

****** I think she was basing it off the way Nazis classified people as Jewish or not. Meaning, if you had no Jewish grandparents then you were clear. If you had 1 or 2 Jewish grandparents you were "mischling", or "mixed breed/halfbreed". She tried to draw parallels between the persecution of muggleborns and the persecution of Jews so it makes sense she'd take elements from how Nazis classified people when designing a xenophobic society's level of acceptance of people with "outsider" heritage.

So it's not what readers would consider logical as "pure", but what the xenophobic wizards in British wizarding society accept as "pure".

** The blood status system is based on real life race caste systems and ideologies like the one-drop rule, so this post is...interesting.

Half-bloods are anyone with a muggle/muggleborn/half-parent as, again, JKR borrows the "logic" of the one-drop rule.

Harry isn't "pure" because his mother is considered "dirty"; a "mudblood." In the simple words of their muggle equivalent: "if there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup."

*** It's actually based on the Nazi's belief of Judaism.

If any of your parents or grandparents were Jewish, you were marked in some way. They had whole diagrams about it but it's similar to what Rowling describes in HP.

If we are following a similar pattern, the average definition of pureblood would be that all your grandparents aren't muggles or muggleborns.

But you have those extra crazy ones (like the gaunts and Blacks) who follow the one drop rule.

**** Nazis studied American race laws. Among one of the things they reportedly paid attention to was the one-drop rule: the idea that if one had one Black ancestor they were in fact Black.

***** They might have studied them but the Nuremberg Laws didn't care what your great grandparents were, nor if you had a drop of Jewish blood. Your status of a jew was determined by your parents and grandparents.

** I have a 'throw-away' line in one of my books where the Pureblood families all count differently - basically the more prejudiced families count at higher generations because their family heritage goes back centuries. But other, perhaps less-advantaged Pureblood families count at smaller generations because they can't guarantee blood purity past 3-4 generations.

So basically everyone uses the math that suits their own history.

*** That's my theory too. I reckon families like the Malfoys and Blacks would claim that a pureblood is someone with /no/ muggle blood in their ancestry, which is obviously impossible as the level of inbreeding would have killed them, so they erase all records of muggleborns marrying into the family. And then all the other families would be pulling their hair out like “fuck, how do they have no muggle blood? Quick, claim that Jerry was a bastard pureblood rather than a muggleborn” and it creates this cascading effect where every pureblood family has smudged their records and they each think that they're the imposters when in reality every family is doing it lmao.

** Consider that those who truly care about this nowadays are bigoted and won't be as accepting as you seem to be. Now, consider that everyone else just uses the same system to determine blood status because they were just raised with it and why bother creating another one. Now, consider that literally everyone in Canon considers/calls Harry a half-blood.

The Blood Purity system is almost copy-pasted from the racial segregation chart of the nazis, and so is based according to grandparents, not only parents. Now, consider that Lily Potter née Evans is a 'Mudblood' by purist standards, since, despite having magic, she still has no magical heritage whatsoever. Blood purity is largely biological, but there's still a small cultural aspect to it. Lily and Harry Potter were raised as Muggles until the age of eleven, and so are outsiders to the magical world.

** No. Purebloods are magical offspring born from two purebloods. Muggleborns are magical offspring born from two muggles. Any magical human born from any combination other than this two is a Halfblood. Squibs are not another category. They are muggles born from magicals(opposite of a muggleborn).

Once your line stops being considered pure, It wont be considered pure again for a long, long time(potentially for centuries until "impurity" is forgotten). Harrys children are considered Halfbloods in canon despite Ginny being a pureblood.

** Technically no, after a few generations, they would still remain halfbloods. HOWEVER, they can claim to be purebloods and most people won't blink an eye unless they get suspicious.
