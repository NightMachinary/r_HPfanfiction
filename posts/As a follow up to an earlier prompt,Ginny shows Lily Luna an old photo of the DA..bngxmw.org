** "I want to know." Lily Luna set her jaw in the exact same stubborn fashion as her mother had done at the same age, more years ago than Ginny would care to admit.

"Lily...the War was really, truly awful. You're..."

"Too young?"

"That wasn't what I was going to say."

"Yes it was. Mum--I have the /right/ to know. I'm as old as you were when you joined Dumbledore's Army, under Umbridge."

Ginny pinched the bridge of her nose. "It's not that simple, love."

"Yes, yes it is."

--------------

"This was the Dumbledore's Army that I helped Neville and Luna lead during the War."

The photo was old and ragged but it still clearly showed more than three dozen teenaged wizards and witches.

"There I am, next to Demelza Robbins and Colin Creevey and his little brother Dennis."

Demelza was slightly built and had shiny black hair. Colin was even smaller than her, with wide, eager eyes. Mum, or the teenaged version of her, had her arms around Demelza's shoulder. Colin had a smaller boy who looked very much like him in a headlock, both roaring with laughter. His brother?

"Colin died in the War, right?" Lily murmured, though she already knew the answer.

"Colin threw himself at Dolohov, right after he got Lupin with that awful fire-curse of his. The last spell Colin ever cast was a Shield Charm...over me and your Aunt Luna."

Lily had seen Dennis Creevey, Colin's younger brother, once. Five or six years ago, at one of the memorial shrines. He hadn't spoken to anyone, but had caught her eye just as he was leaving the memorial shrine for Colin. She hadn't even known who he was.

Dennis carried himself as if he walked with a limp, even though Mum had said Dennis hadn't seen much battle in the War.

It reminded her of Uncle George and how there was always a trace of sadness in his smiles.

Losing a brother...It was like losing a limb, only for your heart. Lily thought about James and Albus and how when Albus wasn't being teased by James, he was helping James tease her. They'd pull her braids or chase her around the house. Pin her to the floor and draw on her face with a marker. But they hadn't caught her in a long time.

The next time they chased her, she'd let them catch her. Even the worst teasing torment from her brothers would be worth it.

Lily shook her head sharply.

"Mum? What happened to Demelza?"

"She was too young to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts...but she sneaked back."

"Was she..."

"She wasn't killed, but she was hurt badly--she had her leg mangled by some horrible curse...I forget who she was dueling. She had thought of playing Quidditch...but she couldn't fly with one leg."

I may come back to this.

*** "What happened to Demelza after?" Lily whispered.

"She actually got into designing broomsticks. She's done well for herself. Go on, now--scoot aside."

Lily didn't want to move. Her legs felt very heavy. It wasn't until several of the figures in the old photo began shifting that she realized her mother had been speaking to them. Oops.

"There's Uncle Neville and Aunt Hannah."

It wasn't nearly as sad seeing Uncle Neville (It was summer--Lily was not calling him Professor Longbottom until the next term started) as a young man. His face was rounder and there was a nasty gash on his cheek, but he looked mostly whole. He and Hannah were not quite holding hands...

"Had they started going out yet?"

"No...that wouldn't happen for a while yet. But I do know they liked each other...they had only been going out for all of a month before they got married."

Lily smiled as the Old Neville and Old Hannah blushed deeply at hearing that. She recognized Seamus Finnigan punch Neville on the shoulder.

"Aah, that's Seamus. He did fine in the War--nearly lost his arm to an Arcomantula, but he recovered well enough."

"Hmmm..."

"Oh..." Ginny murmured. "Adeline..."

A /tiny/ wisp of a girl was standing between Hannah and Aunt Luna.

"Adeline was in Ravenclaw...she joined up after the Carrows took over...she was the only other girl from Ravenclaw in our year to join the DA."

"She was Luna's roommate?"

"Yes...she was the only one who hadn't picked on Luna...but they didn't really become friends until that last year either. But after a while, never saw one without the other."

"What happened to her?"

"She was hit...I'm not sure with what...the curse was horrible...I found her outside and helped her to the Great Hall...Luna was there too..."

"But..."

"She died. The curse destroyed her insides. The last thing she told us was that she'd tell Luna's mother that we said 'Hi.'"

Lily felt like crying. This wasn't at all like she had thought it'd be.

"There's Lavender Brown...Fenrir Greyback got her...she bled out before we could save her."

"Uncle Neville and Uncle Ron got Greyback didn't they?"

"Yes...two blasting curses mixed with a Jelly-Legs pulverized Greyback's legs, and then Neville got a cutting curse at his throat."

--------------

It went on for almost an hour, and Lily felt as if she may be sick.

"And there...I think that is everybody. Or everybody in the photo at least..."

"Dumbledore's Army..."

"We all have scars Lily. Some of us more than others."

"You all gave so much...was it worth it, do you think?"

Ginny hugged her. Lily wasn't nearly as resistant to hugging as her brothers. She leaned into her mother's shoulder.

"Yes honey...It was worth it. We owe it to the fallen to make a better world. And make life worth it."

**** /Owe it to the fallen to make a better world...And make life worth it./

Lily blinked back tears as she entered the sitting room. James and Albus were alphabetizing their Famous Witch and Wizard cards.

Losing a brother would be like losing one of her arms.

"Hey James," Lily called.

"Yeah, Lily?"

"I have a question..."

"Yeah?"

"What's that card in your hand?"

"It's a Circe card. Is that all?"

"Circe...could you spell it for me?"

"C-I-R-C-E," James scowled at what clearly sounded like a stupid question. But it gave Lily the perfect opening.

"No, silly--"It" is spelled "I-T! How'd you get past first year, Jamie-boo?"

"Gah!" Color flooded James's face. "You're gonna pay for that one!"

"Hmmm...sorry James, but I think teasing dopey big brothers should be free."

"Lily," Albus warned looking between her and James, as if deciding who he should help.

"I'm not gonna pay you either, Albus."

"What?!" Albus spluttered. "I'm gonna...gonna..."

"Gonna what? Use your words."

"Get you!"

Lily smirked. "You'll have to catch me first!"

"Albus! Help me get her!"

She broke off into a run, with her brothers hot on her heels. Lily relished it. She honestly couldn't remember the last time she had teased her brothers to the point where they chased her. But thinking about Dennis and Colin...and Uncle George and Fred...she had to relish this.

Maybe she wouldn't let them catch her after all. She was faster than them, and had a head start on her slowpoke brothers. Through the sitting room, and the kitchen, and then up the stairs and then through Albus's room and then James's room and then the study...

And then James hit her with a Trip Jinx.

"Aaah! We're not allowed!"

"I'm of age, Lily!"

Lily squeaked as she fell to the floor, right outside her room. Her brothers pounced on her--Albus pinning her arms above her head while James pinned her legs. Lily saw Albus's green eyes widen and then his triumphant smile turned into an evil smirk. She felt James begin to untie the laces on her trainers.

Oh dear...

--------------

I'm tempted to end it here. Lily's "dread" at being at her big brothers' mercy makes an amusing ending.

***** Thank you!

I'm not sure whether or not to have a little bit more to the epilogue--ending it right when Lily has been "captured" by her brothers seems right, but then again, James and Albus haven't really gotten a chance to "get even" yet.
