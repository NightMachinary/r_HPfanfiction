  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** Maybe I read the first few chapters before this was edited, but I really don't understand how this fic gets rec'd so often. I remember being really excited because runes have always been fascinating to me, even before HP, and then reading it and not being able to get through the terrible writing...has this been overhauled?

** /When Vernon Didn't Miss/ by DrT on Schnoogle has a brotherhood of wizards who create horcruxes (I think by executing criminals). The method they use is incompatible with witches magic so part of the fic involves overcoming this so Hermione can be immortal as well.

Two more fics both slash neither technically what your looking for. /Shiny and Blue/ Harry has a soul that is divided (I think seven ways) but they aren't technically horcruxes and he didn't kill anyone to produce them.

For a given value of "not evil" /Influence of Souls/. Harry actually murders Hermione (not a major spoiler, it happens in the first two paragraphs) to produce a diary horcrux like Riddle's but it's not so he can live forever it's just the mechanism the author, Nia River, has used for time travel ie he sends the diary back in time for earlier Harry to write in.
