** If I feel confident that the writer has a solid plot and knows what they are doing and where the story is going. It's a bit abstract but you know when it's there.

*** I agree. If I get the sense that the writer (1) has thoroughly thought through the story and (2) has taken careful steps to avoid common pitfalls (canon rehash, extreme bashing, chapters where nothing happens, etc), then I'm a huge fan.

World building is part of this (world building tends to imply to me that the story's concept was really thought through).

** With my read and (limited) write experience, I found some things I don't like.

- Don't introduce too many names. You can introduce a few new names, but don't make it more. It is a difficulty to track them all. Remember that everyone and everything you introduce in the story needs to have it's place. If you aren't prepared to write a few scenes for it, leave it out. I haven't seen many stories do this with characters though. Usually it is some superpowers Harry suddenly unlocked.
- Don't solve problems in the first chapters. This is for me an indication that the writer doesn't challenge his main character enough. If you want to ignore certain problems, start in media res.
- Don't repeat canon and especially sentences from canon. Start at the point of divergence. If the divergence is only subtle, focus on it and leave the rest for what it is. I am totally fine by an author that introduces Hagrid and then skips Diagon Ally.
- Don't go too fast through the story. For you, your reasoning is logical. For me, as a reader, it isn't. Introduce every chapter and give it a conclusion. Do the same for every scene. I know it is difficult, but it helps the flow.
- Don't make too many grammar errors are another thing. To solve this. 1. Use (free) grammar-checking software. They may not be perfect but they might catch some mistakes. 2. Print your text and search for any error. You will find more than you think is possible and still it is only a small amount of the actual mistakes. 3. If you have a proofreader, ask a proofreader to do the same.

*** Most word-processing programs have some form of spell and grammar checker, and most have a dictionary you can add to, allowing things like names to be ignored by the Spell-checker.

**** I agree, but the grammar-checking quality varies greatly. I personally used Grammarly and it found different errors than word. Libreoffice and google docs didn't find a lot though.

*** All very good points. One thing I would add is if possible draft a brief outline of the story before you start. Also, outline each chapter and see if it makes sense before you jump the gun and write several pages. It will flow much better.

*** Punctuation is big for me. I've come to accept that most writers don't know how to use commas correctly, let alone semicolons or colons. It still bugs me when people don't set names or titles of people being addressed apart using commas. I also hate run-on sentences and sentence fragments.

I also drop stories quickly if dialogue is too stilted or awkward. It's a good habit to say the dialogue out loud when you write it. If it sounds weird when you say, it will read weird, too.

Another pet peeve is misuse of homophones. There/their/they're, passed/past and to/too/two are the big ones, but I read one story where just about any word that had a homophone used the wrong one (one cannot go down stares). I swear the author was doing it on purpose.

** Good grammar, and the promise of interesting plot points to come. If the writing is solid, and interesting world-building and/or plot points are introduced, I'll give the fic a shot. Also chapter length. If it's less than 2k words, it's hard to get a feel for the writing style.

** Dialogue. When I click on a fic, the first thing I do is quickly scroll through the first chapter. If it's only long, blocky paragraphs with no breaks for dialogue or character interaction, I close it without reading a word. Don't /tell/ us how your story starts, /show/ us.

*** A bit short-sighted, imo. Show, don't tell doesn't just mean dialogue or character interaction. You can write a starting chapter about a character in a cell, by themselves, not doing anything and still be 'showing' and not 'telling'. it depends on how you write the scene.

**** You're right of course. However, my point was more about the big, blocky paragraphs of text without breaks. In my experience of reading fanfiction, when a story starts that way, be it a scene with a character in a cell or something else, it's just the author telling us what brought them to that point. If it's important to know /why/ someone is in the cell, show us how they got there. It shouldn't take hundreds of words to describe a scene, an author should be able to do that in a few sentences or paragraphs at most.

Breaks in the text are important - they show the progression of ideas that are to be communicated and help with the flow and pace of the story. If it's just a solid page of text, there's something very wrong going on.

There's always exceptions to the rule, but they're few and far between.

***** Writing in big blocky paragraphs of text and 'showing not telling' are completely different things. I agree that if I open a story and the author can't even use proper sized paragraphs, I'm disinclined to continue. And not just because it's difficult to read. However, it has nothing to do with the content, only layout.

In my example of the character in the cell I didn't even mean describing how they got there. You can describe the character; are they beat up, are they healthy, do they have food. You can describe the state of the cell; is it clean, is it gross, is it modern, etc.

Both of those are showing, not telling, and it doesn't involve any dialogue or interaction. Also, setting the scene and describing it, especially in a first chapter can be incredibly important.

** For me the main plot point of the fiction briefly introduced in the first chapter will be good, you can introduce a short and mysterious prologue. IMHO these are the points to avoid: * Long explanation of every single concept of Wizarding world in first chaper, ex: explaining what if Gringotts, globins in the second sentences. Its ok to explain things if its a crossover and people who know HP lore may not be aware of some other lik GoF, avoid explaining HP lore. * Too many lordhsips and talents bestowed in the first chapter itslelf. * Too short sentences. Too short paragraphs with lot of shouting ( All caps) * Too short chapters.
