#+TITLE: LF fics that tidy up the horribly stupid supposed "canon" that can be found in HP and the Cursed Child. Are there any good fics about Delphi Riddle? I'll take everything in which she is not a cheaper copy of her already pretty cheap dad.

While the idea of Delphi Riddle's existence is pretty ridiculous, I would nevertheless love to read something that explores her and makes her not another disney villain. I would prefer her being good or grey, but basically just not as ridiculous as she is portrayed in CC. I would love for her to be human, maybe extremely talented, like her father, but human and able to love, hurt, think and feel.

Even time travel is fine, as long as she does not blindly cheer for her parents crimes. Disappointment when seeing her parents would be cool.

I would absolutely adore a Teddy Lupin/Delphi Riddle pairing, in which they bond over being angry at their parents, who all thought fighting in a war is more important than caring for your own child, but I am aware that a fic like this probably does not exist.

Thank you!!


** linkffn(12379203); I don't think this is quite what you are looking for, but it is about Delphini and I think it's quite enjoyable for people who are looking for a fic with her in it.

  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Delphini Riddle is self-taught; things can be different.

**** It doesn't focus on her exactly. She's a toddler, but she is pretty prominent. I do love how she's written. Most recent chapters have given Harry the idiot ball though.
