** I imagine the therapist would try to get him to accept that the things that happened to him weren't his fault. He probably also has a lot of survivor's guilt to deal with. The ultimate goal might be to have him be willing to get emotionally close to people again. That'll be challenging, considering what happened the last time he got close to people.

In one of my stories, he internalizes the hate society directs at him, and is a cutter. The abuse he accepts from Tonks is another manifestation of his self-destructive impulses. Good luck to a therapist trying to fix that.

**** She manipulated him emotionally into starting a relationship he wasn't ready for, especially so soon after losing a dead friend AND Tonks's cousin. However, Molly also did the same, so it's almost unspoken that Remus surrounds himself with people who make decisions for him. Most abuse victims do.

I'm writing a story about Remus from when he's eleven to his death, so I have to keep these sorts of things in mind.

**** In canon, she grabs him, shakes him, and tells him it doesn't matter how many times he tells her no, she's going to keep pursuing him. That's abuse. And that's just what she does in public. Who knows how much worse she could be in private?

** Big disclaimer: I'm not a therapist, but my stepmother is.

And the answer, as per my understanding, is "it depends". There is no one form of therapy, there are multiple approaches that the therapists chooses based on their diagnosis, own experience, gut feeling and other facts that I don't know about.

Let's take one example that doesn't apply, but involves less of the talking you would usually associate with therapy: there is behavior-theraphy, which you do when you want to change a certain behavior, to help the patient out of patterns they aquired over their lifetime. Instead of talking about the past you would instead try to develop new patterns and strategies to apply to your life.

What you're thinking of is called "analytical psychology" or perhaps psychoanalysis - two distinct approaches that both (and I might be wrong here, so take this with a grain of salt) have in common that they assume that current problems stem from stuff that happened in the past, and base their therapy of that.

In general, in psychoanlysis a fundamental idea is that by talking about your past and being confronted by it, you gain insight into it, allowing you to get better. And here I put my third disclaimer: I'm not a therapist, so I might be misunderstanding things! Despite the risk of being wrong, I'll continue: it might involve the therapist asking questions and trying to understand Remus' past, and then confronting him with things he isn't willing to talk and think about.

"Do you think you deserve hate for being a werewolf?" "Do you blame your parents for it?" "Do you truly believe Sirius could do this? Why haven't you visited him yet?" "So do you think Harry deserves to be with the Dursleys, or why did you stay away?" "If it's so shit in England, why stay?"

Stuff that Remus might now /want/ to think about on it's own, or questions that may help him realise things he hasn't realized yet.

--------------

Anyway, that is one approach to therapy. There is also [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy][Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], that is a bit more modern and tries to take into account to progress made since Freud. Because just like physics research didn't stop with Newton, psychotherpay research didn't stop with Freud.

If you want to check out how to write this, I'd go to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Phases_in_therapy][Phases in therapy]] section of the article, and figure out what phase you want Remus to be in, and then you can chose approperiately.

tl;dr: There is no one "therapy", instead there is a host of approaches that depend on different things, so the questions asked depend on the therapy, the therapist, and the patient

** I keep thinking about the relationship between Lucifer and the psychologist in "Lucifer". Basically, Remus would tell the therapist he is a real werewolf from the start and the therapist would just think he has a form of delusion and just goes along with it. Remus would try multiple times to convince her he is the real deal unsuccessfully while the doctor tries to cure him. Until Remus actually transforms in front of her and she runs away screaming or something lol

In the end, she would come to accept werewolves are actually real and continue having sessions with Remus. This would be a hell of a story, I would definitely read it!

** Hopefully this link works.

Also, I should clarify the first part of the story is a seven-part “novel” series about how the Marauders grew up as friends (strictly from Remus's point of view) and the sequel is a one-book look into the first and second wizarding wars for most of that generation's point of view. So Tonks doesn't show up as a love interest until the sequel.

If you're still interested, though, I'd love to hear what you think!

*** Thanks. I have a question though I do realise it's sort of a spoiler. I haven't started the fic yet, but in your tags it says Remus is gay, so what are you going to do about that canon romance? I now imagine that this might be something he chose either out of loneliness or like you said in your comment, because they sort of manipulated him. I'm just really curious about everything that writers think about Remus and his behaviour, particularly since you are maybe the only one to recognize that Remus lets other people treat him badly.

**** Well, I'm considering the metaphor JKR said she originally had in mind, right?

So basically, like Remus suppressed the fact that he's a werewolf, he would suppress that part of himself as well. Especially since it's canonically stated that Tonks has a very similar personality to someone Remus has a lot of respect and affection for.

Though, I'm hoping to expand on both Sirius and Tonks (and others) and make them more complex than they ultimately were in the Harry Potter books.

** I thought of a Muggle therapist and how they'd be doing some very interesting psychoanalysis on how this mild-mannered man thinks he's a werewolf and what kind of a childhood event could have made him hate his inner self so much. (Because, of course, the werewolf is symbolic.) Since I mentioned psychoanalysis, I suppose the therapist would think it has to do with sex.

"It's perfectly fine to be different as long as you don't hurt anyone with it, Mr Lupin. It's been known for many years, that homosexuality isn't a sickness." Or something along those lines. This one was just an easy one.
