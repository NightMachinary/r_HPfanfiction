Hey guys! So I guess these problems are generally faced by readers who follow fics with large quantities of worldbuilding and AU content, so I'll preface my post with that. But it could technically apply to anyone, so all thoughts are welcome!

So... I've got a couple of days off to buckle down and get a lot of writing done, yet it's also dawned on me that I haven't updated in a long, long time. For an AU as divergent as the one I'm writing, it's a little selfish in hindsight, because I can't expect readers to retain that amount of information for such a protracted period. I'm aware that this is one of the main reasons why many in the fandom only read completed stories.

So if you're into massive AUs with near-stationary update rates, do you enjoy reading a few chapters before the most recent instalment, or is it just a chore. Moreover, what can the author do to facilitate this? Chapter summaries? In-universe shorts on the side?


** Well, I generally read the update, and then if I'm confused or don't remember enough context, reread basically everything.

*** That's fair. Is it just a skim-reading binge, or more thorough than that?

I dunno - maybe it's the typical chapter-by-chapter release that engenders an expectation for regular updates in readers, but I can still understand when people don't have the patience to re-read the entire thing.

**** Well, it depends. If I'm only slightly vague, I'll just reread the last chapter or two. Generally though I'll dive all the way back in (though in some fics with clearly delineated sections/arcs I'll start at the most recent arc). But I also can read between 110 and 150 pages an hour, so I'm probably not a good representative of the average reader.

** Honestly, I follow the fanfics but I generally don't really read them when I get an update unless it is one I particularly enjoy as I don't remember much (if any) or the fanfic in question - I think once you have read a few hundred fanfics, it all tends to blur together.

Though if your fanfic is very good then it might be one of the few that people anxiously await updates for even if it has been years since your last update.

I think most people will reread the fanfic if they have forgotten (which is pretty fun actually) but I do wish that authors would have summaries (a general summary and a bit of the last chapter) at the top of their new chapter.

** Sometimes I just let the fic die. Like, in Prince of the Dark Kingdom, there was a point of time where I was current, but that was a long time ago, and I don't want to have to trudge trough half a million words to get to the next spot that the story was abandoned at.

Sometimes it's fun playing catch up though. If the author is updating regularly, sometimes I'll wait a few weeks to read a dozen updates at a time.

** No joke, I have over a hundred fic update notifications sitting unread in my email, going back years, because I read (/used to read) so many fics that I can never remember what's happened in which. Basically, I can't follow updates. I have to re-read the whole thing to know what's going on.

Edit: Hit send before I finished typing (thanks, mobile). Writing a summary of what's happened would probably be super helpful. I sometimes read the previous chapter to see if I can remember what's going on, but I usually have to go back and re-read the whole thing... probably doesn't help that I read a lot of fics with the same premises.

*** Hm... re-reading seems to be less of a problem for people than I thought.

Yeah - chapter summaries seem to be the best course of action for something like this. I've done them before, but they're not in the most accessible place at the moment. In-chapter would inflate the word count and posting them on my profile would cause clutter (and a spoiler hazard).

Maybe a Google doc would work...

** You could do some kind of abstract or reminder. Like they do in tv series. "In the previous chapters..."

Begin you're chapter with an author note, then delete it after a while. Something like this.

Usually I just reread the last few lines of the previous chapter and it's enough. Or I just pick up the context as I go. If I'm really confused, I reread the begining of the fic.

** I will read a partially completed fic, subscribe, then ignore updates until there have been a few. I might go back and reread the whole thing at that point or just read the new chapters, or I might just wait until it's completed. Usually I wait though.

** It's a chore - and a reason why I usually don't start fics that are rarely updated (and I still have hopes that the next chapters will be ever written), even though I know that I probably would enjoy the story in question.

The summaries can help, allowing to quickly remind the reader what the hell happened in the last few chapters, because I think that this, more than a setting is easy to forget.
