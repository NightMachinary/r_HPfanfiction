** Peter Pettigrew reached shakily for his wand. He remembered the first time he'd touched it, in Ollivander's shop in Diagon Alley. It was 9 inches long and made of soft oak with a dragon heartstring core. He'd been shaking then too. Back then, he couldn't say what it was he'd feared exactly. His mother perhaps? His mother had been there of course, standing impatiently by the door, tapping her foot and Peter had wished she would just listen to him. But of course she hadn't.

“You don't need a new wand,” she'd insisted instead, “Now let's go.”

“But...” said Peter, “I... er...” He'd only been eleven. He didn't yet have the words to express how wrong it would feel to give the wand back to Ollivander now that he'd felt it.

“I've your father's wand back home on the mantle,” she'd said. Peter knew that well enough. He'd had a go with it a time or two, just to see what it was like. “It will do fine. You're just like him you know---twitchy man---right to the end.”

“I'm not twitchy,” protested Peter, “And I want---.”

“Oh, /you/ want?” snapped his mother, she crossed her arms and tossed her hair behind her shoulder, “I wanted you to wait for me outside Mistress Mim's, but instead, you went gallivanting off on your own and I had to track you down. Put it down now Peter, we're leaving.”

He'd reluctantly handed the wand back to Mr. Ollivander and followed his mum back home. He'd used his father's wand during his entire first year at Hogwarts and it wasn't until one fateful Charms lesson during second year that James had taken matters into his own hands and set Peter's father's wand on fire.

“That wand's worse than a stick off the Whomping Willow. It's dead useless,” James had said. He'd set it on fire and then tossed Peter his own wand. “Here, you can use mine until you get a new one.”

James had been right. Even using James' wand had been better than his father's. Of course neither were anywhere close to feeling how the wand felt at Ollivander's. Peter had returned at Christmas with his mum and finally gotten it. Ollivander had kept it on a special shelf for him---confident he'd return.

Peter now held the wand delicately and tried to even out his breathing---but even the wand wasn't enough to calm him now. He was standing in the bathroom of his flat, cool water running. He stared at himself in the mirror. His eyes were sunken, his face was blotchy, sweat was caked down in his hair. He thought he might never be calm again.

Once, when he was seventeen, he'd seen something in himself. He'd seen someone more powerful than even his friends had believed---and especially more than his teachers at Hogwarts. He'd been standing outside a muggle village near his home. He was on the bed of a river clutching his arm---which was bleeding---and looking back and forth between the man he'd just killed and his own reflection in the stream. The man had been a Deatheater---a servant of the Dark Lord and Peter had single-handedly stopped him from destroying the muggle town.

Every muggle in that entire village owed him their lives and Professor McGonagall had lamented once that he couldn't even turn a matchstick into a needle. Professor Slughorn had said Peter lacked the finesse for Potions. Even Professor Flitwick had underestimated him.

But then Lord Voldemort had arrived and Peter would have given anything for one of them to be there instead of him. The Dark Lord had restrained Peter with barely a flick of the wrist. “My my,” the Dark Lord had said in a high, cold voice, “What have we here?”

Peter hadn't known what to say to that, so instead he'd stayed quiet.

“Blothgart was a very fine wizard,” he'd said, “I trained him myself. Marked him as my own.” He'd stepped forward and with the toe of his boot, moved the wizard---Blothgart's---sleeve up the length of his left arm to reveal a tattoo in the shape of the dark mark.

Cold, red eyes focused intently on Peter, “And yet? You've killed him. You, a mere boy.” The Dark Lord quickly swiped his wand and Blothgart's body disintegrated into thousands of tiny bits of dust. “What is your name boy?”

“Uhh, Wormtail,” Peter had said, not wanting to reveal his true name.

“Well, Wormtail, I have a proposition for you.”

Not in that exact moment, but eventually... eventually, Peter had derived a very superior sort of satisfaction out of his offer of recruitment. In joining the Death Eaters, he thought he understood things which his friends---James, Sirius, and Remus---brilliant though they were, just couldn't grasp. There was no great right and wrong in the world. There were only the weak and the strong. Those who were strongest got to dictate what was right.

Peter had always known he was strong. His wand had known it. The Dark Lord saw it---even when his closest friends hadn't---and he'd honed it.

Peter just wished... he wished it hadn't been James and Lily's son destined to challenge them. He loved James and Lily. He loved Sirius and Remus. He even loved little Harry.

And now they were all dead

** I think Peter is a skilled wizard. Maybe not on the same level as James, Sirius and Snape but he did manage some impressive feats. So I always thought he has performance anxiety since he didn't seem to do well in school.

*** Hell yes. No matter how much James/Sirius helped him with the animagus transformation, they couldn't do it for him, and he managed it at age 15. He was clever enough to betray the Order successfully and frame Sirius. He brewed the potion to resurrect Voldemort. He's sycophantic and selfish, but not weak or stupid.

Same. I think, in addition, that there were certain subjects he was very good at at school (besides Transfiguration), but he was sometimes overlooked.

** Both the most competent Marauder and Death Eater. This is a man who had the highest kill count among all the Death Eaters. He:

1) Successfully spied on the Order of the Phoenix during the 1st war with absolutely no suspicions and was even made secret keeper, selling out Lily and James.

2) Cut off his finger, killed 13 muggles, and successfully framed Sirius.

3) Escaped from Sirius the second time around.

4) Lured and handed over Bertha Jorkins.

5) Successfully found Voldemort and brewed the resurrection potion.

6) Sliced open Harry's arm with a knife (Let us remember this is a child Peter knew as a baby. James and Lily welcomed them into their home and Peter probably babysat for them.)

7) Cut off his arm and successfully resurrected Voldemort.

All these actions speak of a man who is frighteningly competent and honestly more evil than cowardly. My opinion is that he wasn't any less skilled than James and Sirius; I just think he was constantly underlooked and underestimated which he used to his advantage. He is actually the most useful Death Eater, doing more to aid Voldemort's return than anyone else. He also is extremely violent, being the Death Eater with the highest number of known murders under his belt. He cuts off body parts twice; these aren't the actions of someone who is weak-willed. I don't think Wormtail is a coward. He just believes in absolute self-preservation-- 'The world and my friends can burn in hell as long as I can survive.'

** I like the backstory he has in Against the Moon, which I'll spoiler tag since that version of Peter keeps it a secret for much of the story:>! His father is in prison and his sister is a squib.!<

I read a fic once where he was the only one of the Marauders who was a good dancer, so he was popular with the girls when the Yule Ball Or Equivalent rolled around. I liked that, too.

  Everyone always called Remus the voice of reason in the Marauders. They were wrong; that title belonged to Peter.

** Peter was the first of the marauders to realize that Lupin was a werewolf; James and Sirius were too self-absorbed as young students to recognize the signs or the inconsistencies in Lupin's excuses for his illnesses. Peter kept the knowledge to himself for several months before the other boys finally figured it out and they let Remus know that they knew.

** I think that he stopped trusting Sirius during the last few years at Hogwarts, and when he betrayed the Order, he knew that they'd suspect Lupin. Which would lead to Sirius wanting to switch, to keep everything truly hidden, and who'd be better than Peter?

Continuing off that, he didn't hide with the Weasley's just to track Harry, but also to see who's be the easiest to manipulate. That way the Death Eaters could've reformed and struck a blow against morale by immediately sacking Hogwarts
