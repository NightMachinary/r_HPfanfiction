it doesn't really matter what house they're in. if it's the same or not i don't really care. but they have to be best friends. like super cool ally best friends like rey and finn from star wars or eren and armin from attack on titan or goku and vegeta from dragon ball super or sora and riku from kingdom hearts. like they have each others backs and stuff all the time and they work together to kick voldemort's ass.

this one from a while ago is the only one I can think of, it ends up being Dramione but the premise is Harry going to Slytherin because he chooses to befriend Draco over Ron.

** In the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/41198][Like None Other]] series, they end up brothers who have each others back, but it takes them a while to get to the point where they trust each other enough.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12311860/1/Old-Scars-and-Future-Hearts][Old Scars and Future Hearts]] by AnotherGirlWithAStory. Everything is cannon until the beginning of the summer before their 3rd Year. I absolutely love the story. No slash or romances, just pure chance of them becoming friends.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.
