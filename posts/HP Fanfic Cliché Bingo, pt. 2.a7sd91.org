**** Ok but that trope being canon has WAY more problems than it being fanon. Namely, in that it means purebloods are right, and muggles literally are a different race than magicals. Like, if magic can't arise in muggles, period, than the only other option is being two closely-related species with a common ancestor. How else could there be a race of “humans” with magic, if it didn't just pop up from a non-magical world?

******* There's always expressivity and penetrance of a certain genomic trait to consider (you could inherit a dominant trait and randomly not express it because biology, fuck yeah). Also, if it's a one-gene trait, and has two alleles, it's possible that the "magic" only manifests when the host is a heterozygote, and the trait goes unexpressed in either dominant or recessive homozygotes.

Ot it's the other way around.

Or there's also letality, which, let's not.

Obviously, Rowling doesn't have a degree in genetics, the ratio of squibs and magicals is nowhere near Mendelian (or squibs are shoved so deep into the dark that we've no chance of discovering the true numbers) and this is a children's book.

******* The second part I definitely agree that's bad wording. But inbreeding (which, look at the Gaunts) seems to be a factor considering how small the wizarding world must be---I mean, we see over and over how inept wizards are with anything muggle (Quidditch World Cup), so they can't live in muggle towns, and there's only a few magical villages....

And inbreeding could easily explain squibs born to pure bloods. Especially since we don't know exactly how common squibs are. We see what, 3, 4 in the entire series?

I think JKR gave some ridiculously small number but she's never been good with math. Also, I only recall seeing a bit of inbreeding (mainly in the Black family tree) and it seemed to mostly be cousins, which shouldn't have a negative impact on the genetics.

Then again I'm not an expert so I could be completely wrong.

******* The average woman has 2.5 children, and the lower/poorer the population, the more she tends to have. Let's round down and say she has 2 children on average that survive to adulthood and themselves have children. After N generations, a squib will have given rise to 2^{N+1} people who might be magical.

After 10 generations, there's 2048 people who might have gotten Hogwarts letters. After 20 generations, there's over 2 million. After 36 generations, you have more people than could have ever lived in the history of our species.

Given /one/ squib, or hell, one wizard, way back before humanity left Africa, and basically every human on the planet is descended from a wizard or a squib. This is also assuming that the the fertility rate is fairly low. In short, it doesn't matter whether /most/ or /all/ come from squibs; humanity as a whole is very likely descended from a squib.

********* Souls are on a separate plane of existence, and "being alive" means that something physical (a body, usually) is connected to it. Generally, you need a mind to handle that connection.

Every living thing has a soul, but some souls also have the property that they can (locally) manipulate the physical world around the wizard.

If you die, the connection is severed, and the soul will move to yet another plane.

When two humans have sex, the souls are heavily involved, and sometimes can produce a child. (Basically, both souls merge a little to produce a new, independent little offspring)

The child's soul might be "magical" randomly, but it has a very high chance if one of the parent's souls was magical, too.

Most of the plot-holes could probably be filled by longer explanations, but I'm too lazy to go into it. And when it comes down to it, the model is heavily inspired by some mathematical and physical ideas that I'm definitely misunderstanding. However, for my fictional story I made them mine.

** There's fics that portray James (and the rest of his friends) as people obsessed with pranks, brilliant at Transfiguration but average at everything else.

Canon James is seen from only one scene, which is from fucking Snape's POV - the most unreliable narrator of them all - and even there, James and Sirius are talking about how laughably easy they found their OWLs. This is the person who became an animagus at age 15, enchanted the Marauders' Map, and the mirror sets around the same age, survived Voldemort 3 times without any +silly+ ridiculous Deus Ex plots, and fought the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters for over 2 years, until he's forced into hiding for the sake of his wife and son.

But nope, he has to be average at everything else other than Transfiguration.

Even when they pick on Snape, we see enough from Snape's later memories to form a conjecture that they could be getting back at Snape for his use of the Dark Arts on fellow muggleborn students. In the memory where Lily tells Snape that she thinks James is a toerag, she's also calling him out for using Dark magic against a girl named Mary Macdonald - which Snape says he did for laughs. It's not assuming much to think that Snape had been cursing muggleborns as stress reliever or some shit, and James and his friends thought it was time for a bit of payback.

But nope, James has to be a "prankster" and a "bully".

There are also a lot of fics that call Voldemort a bully. That's just so...ugh. Honestly, I want to read an anti-trope where the fucker who says that crap gets slapped by a passing parent/teacher who lost family members in the war for making light of a megalomaniac.

Also, Lily being portrayed as a fanon pre-Hermione or something - a perfect girl with no real negatives, other than maybe her temper. Fun fact : Lily is a terrible judge of character. She was friends with fucking Snape for five years. It took a yell of Mudblood to finally open her eyes.

**** 10 year old Snape gets so angry at Petunia saying something he doesn't like, he makes a tree branch fall on her. You could call it accidental magic, but Snape and Lily (along with the Marauders) are always said to have been brilliant wizards, and if Lily can control her accidental magic, it isn't a big leap to assume that Snape could as well. But you can overlook that if you want to - for the sake that it's accidental.

11 year old Snape almost says, "She's only a muggle," regarding Petunia's feelings, which is something you'd expect to come from Draco Malfoy's gob.

11 year old Snape makes a jab at James' father before he even knows James' name, for no particular reason other than the fact that he's an asshole. Sirius asks James which house he'd want to go, and when James responds, "Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart! Like my Dad!", Snape snorts and says, "Sure, if you want to be brawny rather than brainy..."

Snape even attempts to defend Avery and Mulciber after Lily calls out on their use of Dark magic on a girl.

Dumbledore says they thrice defied Voldemort when he's describing the prophecy to Harry - he's directly comparing Harry's exploits with his parents', so it is a reasonable conjecture to state that their defiance did not involve refusing him (like Voldemort would ever take a refusal to the face in good spirit and walk off).

Going by this logic, we never see Snape murdering anyone, but it's quite clear that he murdered and tortured several people during his years as a Death Eater before his supposed "awakening to the light", but anyone with a brain knows he did those things. Voldemort and friends did not plan to take over Wizarding Britain by hosting tea parties and holding debates.

Snape hung around Mulciber and Avery who cursed people for laughs - it's extremely unlikely that he wouldn't have indulged in those same things from time to time, or he wouldn't have been close to them in the first place. You'll lose your friends in school quite quickly if you're vehemently disapproving of their activities. Snape even attempts to defend Avery and Mulciber, you know that?

The Weasley twins aren't "pranksters", in spite of the best efforts of ff authors.

His first year - his first year! - he gets detention in the Forest after a whopping 50 point loss in one swoop.

Going by this same logic, anyone who sees Harry's detention records and point loss records will assume the same thing - but we know that Harry is not a troublemaker, or a prankster. He gets into trouble, yes, but he hardly causes trouble for anyone else.

Fred and George have no established reputation as pranksters.

Yes, it damn well isn't. 3-4 pranks across a span of 7 years doesn't make anyone a prankster. Imagine an analogue - you do the bucket on a door prank on three separate people when you were 13, and people keep calling you a "prankster", when you're 20. Just think how ridiculous that is.

#+begin_quote

The Cruciatus curse became the preferred form of punishment under Snape's tenure as Headmaster. Snape was Voldemort's right-hand, he could have changed/averted that easily if he'd wanted to, and Voldemort would have listened to him. So yeah, don't give me the BS about Snape not torturing or killing anyone.

Snape was a Death Eater for 2-3 years before Voldemort decided to hunt the woman Snape was wanking off to. If you think that a halfblood Death Eater was refraining from participating in raids, torture and murder during all that time without drawing Voldemort's attention and suspicion, well, you need to stop wearing kiddie lenses.

Even though it isn't explicitly stated anywhere in the books that muggleborns were slaughtered in camps like Azkaban, it can be inferred quite easily by anyone with a brain. It is the same thing with Death Eaters who willingly joined Voldemort in the First War - you'd be have to be incredibly naive to think that they were just chilling out in black robes and face masks during the First War.

I've already said that Dumbledore directly compares Harry's defiances with those of his parents. You can only compare those things if they're on the same level - no one is going to say Mundungus Fletcher defied the Dark Lord when he apparated away like a coward. But since you asked for it, here:

#+begin_quote
  'The odd thing, Harry,' he said softly, 'is that it may not have meant you at all. Sybill's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.'

  'He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,' said Dumbledore. 'And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pure-blood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far-- something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved.'
#+end_quote

As you can see, there's a direct comparison between Harry's escapes and those of his parents'. That the escapes were preceded by confrontations is easily inferred, since it is a direct comparison.

The only one who's being needlessly obtuse here, is you.

Mouthing off teachers, getting into verbal/physical fights with other students, wandering in areas that are out-of-bounds, breaking curfew, skiving off class, sneaking into Hogsmeade on school days, getting drunk/providing drinks for other students in a school, stealing Snape's potions --- none of these can be called practical jokes or pranks. All of them can, however, be called trouble-making.

Compare those things with charming Percy's Headboy badge to say Bighead Boy. Or giving Dudley the toffee. The difference ought to be clear, although you'll probably come up with something obtuse again.

And before you start, those are /examples/ of what trouble-making /can/ be. It doesn't mean that Fred and George do all of that, even though they do check several of that list.

#+begin_quote

Opening a joke shop makes them entrepreneurs and businessmen, not pranksters.

They market minor love potions in their shop too. According to your logic, although it's getting difficult to call it that, Fred and George no doubt dosed girls with love potions. And pygmy puffs - no doubt Fred and George were raising those during their days at school.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

We know exactly how much sway he has over Voldemort. He's the fucking right-hand man of Voldemort. Voldemort trusted Snape enough that the task of killing Dumbledore would have fallen to Snape, in the event of Malfoy's failure. He trusted Snape enough to make him Headmaster of a school where every single witch and wizard were educated. He trusted Snape enough to take his suggestion over Yaxley's regarding the Order's extraction of Harry. He held Snape in such a high regard that he waited several hours after his resurrection for Snape to show up and report - in spite of Snape's actions against Quirrel, and indirectly, Voldemort - while he swore death upon a few others that failed to show up. Heck, he even takes Snape's begging into account and offers Lily a couple of chances to move aside.

The Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. If Snape wanted to stop the Cruciatus punishments, he could have easily stopped them, and the most the Carrows would have been able to do was grumble.

#+begin_quote

This is mostly irrelevant. Helping others kill a man makes you an accomplice, and you'll be given the same punishment as the ones who did the deed themselves.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes to creating spells. Sectumsempra is his own creation - at 16, I might add.

There was also espionage involved, as Voldemort thought Snape to be on his side. For Snape to actually keep his place without losing his head, he'd have to provide information of some kind or the other to Voldemort.

Brewing potions is almost definitely a yes. He's not a potions master for nothing, and Voldemort would be a fool to waste talent that's just there. In the first war, Voldemort was no fool.

As for the murder, torture and everything else - Voldemort had a finite number of followers. If one of those followers consistently did nothing but sit on his hands during planned attacks, that follower would come under greater scrutiny and eventually be disposed of. Snape, for all of his faults, is a brilliant wizard. He wouldn't do something as stupid as not kill while being a part of the Death Eaters.

Instead of living on Privet Drive, they live in that shack where they hid from the letters in canon. Dudley has a habit of wearing and consuming human flesh and has a chainsaw fetish. Petunia goes door to door, asking for cups of sugar. After getting invited in, she subdues the family and forces them to kill each other. Vernon stalks targets in the streets, axing targets in alleys.

All the while, poor Harry is dumped on their front door by a well meaning Dumbledore. He grows up absolutely hating the people he is forced to grow up with. Not because he is appalled by what they are doing, but because they're doing it so /badly/. He views himself as more of a Jigsaw Killer-esque individual, using intelligence and engineering ingenuity to keep his own hands clean and getting people to effectively kill themselves. A far more elegant method of killing, in his opinion.

**** Umbridge shot Harry a simpering little smile before tucking into her roast veal. Harry's face darkened. He'd had enough of that pink toad.

Harry stood up to his full height and rolled his broad, defined shoulders. He shook his unkempt, shoulder-length mane of black hair away from his eyes. Harry made his way up the aisle towards the staff table, jaw set, a tight grin plastered across his face.

"Something to say, Mr. Potter? More of your lies?" Umbridge raised an eyebrow at him as she spoke, daring him to make trouble.

Harry stared straight into her eyes, his curse-green orbs filled with anger, hate, and the fiery passion of the Last Potter. He opened his mouth to speak.

" What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
