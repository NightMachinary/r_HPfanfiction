Anything where the sorting doesn't just happen. Maybe the hat decides to not sort everyone or to sort them into all the wrong houses. Image a year when only muggleborns get sorted in Slytherin and all the Slytherins end up in Hufflepuff. Maybe someone like Ginny gets sorted into Slytherin and refuses to go. Any thing along these lines sounds like an interesting read.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** This is a really fun one, and there are a couple of parts. Basically, Fred and George tamper with the hat and it sorts people all over the place. Chaos ensues! [[https://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html]]

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.
