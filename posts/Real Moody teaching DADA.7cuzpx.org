Are there any stories out there where the real Alastor Moody gets to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts?


** Well, it sort of happens in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3721921]["Weasley Girl,"]] though in this fic he's only a substitute teacher filling in for the missing Quirrell, and we only really see one of his lessons. That said, the author does a pretty good job of keeping him in character without having his teaching style a carbon copy of Crouch Junior's.

*** It makes sense that he'd be a copy of Crouch Junior though. Crouch Jr. was a ridiculously good actor and knew Moody super well.

**** Yes, but he had never been a teacher before, so Crouch Junior wouldn't have anything to copy there. More like "the sort of lesson Moody WOULD have," not a carbon copy.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
