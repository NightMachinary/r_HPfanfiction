Have you read any good ones? I'm looking for something where his love interest is a well written adult, and not a student. Thanks so much!


** I desperately ship Theophany Knapp and Snape in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]], but... well... it takes place during Book 7, and we all know how that ends for Snape. The fic isn't complete, so I have no idea what kind of a relationship, if any, they could have. If I had to guess, the author will let us at least glimpse some sort of relationship, however brief, before he dies, but tbh I'm not sure.

Also, side note -- there are several pieces of fanfiction that capture Snape really well, but this is one of my favorites.

** It's quite a ways into this insanely long (but amazing) fic, but linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has a really good Snape/OC pairing. They are both adults in it and their relationship is written really well.

** I'm pretty sure this one I'm currently reading is building up to be exactly the kind of fanfic you're describing:

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302061/1/][Speaking in Tongues]]

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2237626/original-star-girl-78][original-star-girl-78]]

A trader on the edge of the wizarding world is about to turn Snape's world upside down.

​

Description is a bit vague, but basically an OC teacher comes to Hogwarts to teach foreign languages and to work with Dumbledore to figure out how to speak Parseltongue. There is some mystery between OC and Snape that has not been revealed yet, but I have guesses upon guesses as to what it could be. And OC Professor is slowly developing feelings for Snape. It takes place during CoS year, and fits very well into canon, and it's very well written. It's a WIP, and I'm enjoying the hell out of it right now.
