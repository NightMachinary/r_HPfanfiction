It does annoy me when people start acting like he wants to be utterly normal. Granted, the Harry in the books didn't really try except for Quidditch and a bit of DADA.

**** The Dursleys wanted greatness just as much as anyone. Normality doesn't mean mediocrity, to the Dursleys it just mean excelling at non magical things. Their aim was to move up in society, which meant fitting in and not being abnormal.

Vernon was the head of his company and entertaining investors and customers in his home in order to increase their wealth. Dudley became boxing champion at Smeltings, which is far from mediocre. His skill at boxing could be comparable to Harry's skill at being seeker, though Dudley probably had to work harder at it since he had to go on that big crash diet enforced by the school nurse to overcome years of bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle.

**** That's not true - he enjoyed being a Quidditch-hero. Not that that is something bad: he was good at it and liked being recognized for it. He just wanted to be respected for things he did and not for being the boy who lived.

Being recognized for the things he did was never his motivation for doing things, but that doesn't mean he didn't liked it.

Edit: His fantasies about glory as a Quidditch-Pro happened in GoF if I am not completely wrong - you can read it.

***** As I said to Bleepbloopbotz2, Harry fantasied about being a Quidditch-Pro like every boy watching the event with him. Like sometimes you imagine yourself being famous. Once the event was done he quite forgot about it and chose to be Auror and it was because he believed it was the most righteous thing to do. Nothing to do with glory at all. It's essentially selfless.

He enjoyed Quidditch but not like his father did. Harry enjoyed the sport, while James enjoyed the sport AND the glory that comes with it. You're conflating both here. James likes to be the "clutch player" and capitalize on it, Harry likes to play Quidditch.

I didn't say Harry didn't like to be recognized for the thing he did. I simply say that Harry doesn't care about glory and doesn't have any ambitions.

There is a selfish part about ambition. Wanting to be the most goody-good guy around isn't an ambition. It's called being nice or simply virtue signaling.

****** Is there really always a selfish part about ambition?\\
I say you can be ambitious and selfless. Harry is a great example for that. He wanted to be Auror - Auror is one of the most difficult carriers you can strive for after Hogwarts. He could always have become a Hitwizard - they do basicly the same thing as Aurors but it's requirements are lower. But Harry didn't do that - he went for the more prestigiously (and probably more dangerous) Job. But he didn't do it because it is a prestigiously job... so in the end Harry was ambitious - but without being selfish.

******* Harry chose to be an Auror after a Death Eater told him so. As someone else pointed out on this thread, choosing Auror was a random choice that makes sense for him. During his meeting with Minerva, we clearly see it wasn't at all a well-thought project and more a spur of the moment. I'm pretty sure he didn't think about HitWizard at the moment either. They were absolutely no ponderation in his mind.

There is a part of selfishness in ambition because ambition is about wanting something for yourself. The thing is people like goody-good guys with no selfish bone in their body for reasons. So mental gymnastics to explain that random choice is the sign of an ambitious mind.

Another characteristic of ambitious people is their actual drive to reach their goals. They apply themselves a little and think a lot more about their objectives. Harry doesn't do that at all.

The fact Harry hasn't any ambition makes him even more shallow as a character and far easier for people to like him. Which was Rowling's intent.

Wanting something for oneself isn't the same thing as being selfish. Selfish means you put yourself before others, but wanting something for yourself doesn't have this aspect.\\
For example - I wanted to be a teacher. That's ambitious for me because nobody in my family ever made it to a university. I was the first one there - so that was ambitious. But there wasn't selfishness in that dream - sure I wanted that for me but it wasn't selfish. So there is ambition without being selfish. And that's only one example.

Back to Harry - Harry worked very hard to archive the grades he got on his OWLs (at least those he needed to be an Auror). He wasn't a genius like Hermione so his above average grades were an archievment for him. I don't say Harry is the most ambitionous person out there - but he isn't without any ambition.

No, Harry's greatest ambition isn't killing Voldemort. Harry is a passive character, he isn't a pro-active one. That's one of the main reasons Indy!Harry is so appealing to so many people. Harry reacts to events, he reacts to the plot, he isn't the one driving it.

Voldemort wants to kill Harry and the poor boy tries to survive and the plot armor, Deus Ex Machina and cartoonish villains do the job for him. That's it.

Harry shows up at the end gets himself killed, resuscitates like Jesus, and waits for the wand to do the job.

  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or---”

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”

******* I expected that you would quote me this passage. It just illustrates some of the shallowness in Harry's characterization.

He wants to kill Riddle so bad, and yet he never used anything lethal or really harmful against him while he didn't mind at all using the Cruciatus Curse against Bella and Amycus. /Expelliarmus/ against Riddle til the end...

He never really tried to apply himself to the task, it was Hermione who thought about creating a defense group while it was Harry who saw his nemesis coming back from the dead. DA who was obviously forgotten in the next book like Harry kinda forgot Riddle was still there.

And let's not forget about Riddle's defeat who is just lame and where Harry did nothing besides walking in a forest and be there after spending the whole year in...a forest wondering what to do like a lost puppy with his sidekicks (prop for Hermione again who actually prepared for the journey more than Harry btw).

Harry wanting so badly to kill Riddle and yet we never see him want it badly. It's the same thing with Riddle and Dumbledore's so-called genius. People talk about it all the time yet we never saw them do anything remotely smart, nevermind genius level. It's actually quite the contrary.

On one side you have words, on the other, you have facts, attitudes that speak of a whole other story.

Like me, you're a Slytherin at heart, I hope for you that you don't consider Harry's attitude as proof of killing instinct... That would be a shame for the House.

Even the Auror career part is more of a random choice he makes because he doesn't know any other career. It's quite saddening that JK turned that into his long-life goal. It would have been cool to see another Potion inventor Harry especially after all the shit he gets from Snape.
