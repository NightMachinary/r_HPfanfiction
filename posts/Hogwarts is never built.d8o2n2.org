** Sure, that would be all those non magical AUs featuring characters with their canon names and personalities. Some of them are actually very good, like this one:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(8941561), is an excellent H/G romance. The Potters and Hermione are even Americans here.

Or you could have dimensional travels to such a world like this one:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738), in which an almost canon Hermione accidentally ended up in a non magical world. Most of people she's familiar with still exist there, some are in familiar roles, but others are not. For example, Dumbledore and Grindelwald (born in the 1920s In this world) are ex spies and current corporate tycoons, who happen to have a secret research facility at Black Lake, canon site for Hogwarts. Hermione, without her wand, is desperately trying to get back home, but her effort is already attracting significant attentions.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** What's the actual premise, though? Hogwarts is never built and here's why, or Hogwarts is never built and this is what everyone does instead?

** I dunno. Could be anything? I just wanna know if anyone wrote something with 'No Hogwarts' as the point of divergence.
