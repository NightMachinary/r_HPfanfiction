Every source I've checked says it's through the Wizengamot, which makes perfect sense since the Wizengamot is equivalent to the British parliament. So, does that mean Wizengamot members are elected by the people?

Do you think, that in the post-Voldemort world, given the array of ineffective PMs (Fudge, Scrimgeour), they'd ultimately change the way PMs are elected?


** I generally assume the Wizengamot seats are part appointed, part inherited. Sort of like the House of Lords.

** From what I can tell, unlike the fanon assumptions, the Wizengamot is largely populated by an elderly elite, whose members invite others for consideration to be included. Nothing is inherited, as there is no assumption of honor or value being transferred to one's children. A poweful wizard may have powerfful kids, but the Wizengamot is looking for strong personalities with well-reasoned opinions. None of Arthur Pendragon's wisdom or humanity appeared in his son Mordred, after all. In fact, most of the highly-respected wizards and witches appear to be single (aside from the Flamels, and they never had children- or if they did, they chose not to give those kids the Elixir of Life, which sorta proves the point).

The members carry authority based on their scholarly reputation, and much respect is given to the most elder of members. During low points in Fudge's administration, some prominent members quit their seats in protest.

Aside from them, the rest of the court are the Ministry Directors, who seem to be appointed by the sitting Minister only on the occasion of a vacancy, though one promotion can lead to a number of staff changes.

The Wizengamot are probably also the ones voting in or out the current Minister when they can rally condemnation or support, though most of the candidates for Minister will come from existing (and therefore recognizable) Ministry officials.

Each Minister is permitted to assign their own support staff (as are all the Directors). It ends up looking like a Republic but acting like a Plutocracy, where wealth in this case is replaced by inferred magical power and experience.

It's important to keep in mind that the whole of Wizarding Britain amounts to the population of a small town (3-10 thousand, depending on whose numbers you believe). Most everyone local is known by name or association, and the power of hearsay is much greater than one would expect.

** I've always assumed that the Wizengamot is like the makeup of the House of Lords pre-1997. In other words, all hereditary seats with some high ranking judges and religious people thrown in.

** Hm. I've never really thought about this. To me it always seemed as though the Wizengamot was appointed too, which doesn't really mean anything, that's just the impression I got.

I think there would definitely be pressure from the community to change the system after the war was over, but it would probably be more about switching to new Wizengamot members. That's just easier than pushing an entire system change. However, if anyone wants to write me a fic with a badass adult Hermione tackling this issue, I would love to read it

** I think a lot of the seats in the Wizegamot are decided by heritage. It makes sense with the dated Wizarding World. Perhaps some seats are reserved for the heads of the important offices too, like Amelia Bones for the DMLE.

I think the Wizegamot is also the one to decide over the MoM. It wouldn't surprise me if they had a sort of Vote of No Confidence as well, that they act like the body that reigns in the Minister.

** aren't they judges? the minister at the time probably fills spots as they vacate.

*** That would mean that the Wizengamot appoints the Minister while the Minister appoints the Wizengamot...

doesn't seem like a particularly good idea.

And yes, as far as i can tell they are judges but they are also a parliament voting on laws.

To be frank, they just have way too much power, even if the seats weren't hereditary.

**** that doesn't make sense i suppose.. i guess i thought they were meant to be some corrupt version of a wizard 'high council', playing at muggle politics, so maybe they do do it that way.

** Despite the crazy ideas here the most likely way is plain old boring election. Also the Wizengamot is more akin the Supreme Court than the parliament.

And it would be MfM, its Minister for Magic, not of.
