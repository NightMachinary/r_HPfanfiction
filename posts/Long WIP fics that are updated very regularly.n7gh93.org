I'm looking for an interesting fic that puts out a new chapter at least once every week, with no sign of abandonment. Not romance centred, and not an OP Harry. I'm reading New Blood, so preferably something a bit different to that.


** I'm back, because I thought of another long WIP that gets regular updates. The only downside is that there IS romance involved. I am not sure how much of a deal breaker that is for you, but i thought i would link it anyhow because the writing is solid.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

#+begin_quote
  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a young metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** Not updating weekly... or even monthly. But the updates have a tendancy to be huge, (e.g 60k) so maybe it would be interesting for you? Also, Ron-centric for a change. Very awesome, highly recommend. linkffn(Fate by thetruesparton)

Political Fem!Harry, one of the best Voldemorts that I have ever read, super high quality writing and an awesome discord server. Updates around once a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. Certain Dark Things. linkao3(16940712)

Sometimes a bit of a slog. Five dimensional politics that fucks my brain five ways to midnight sometimes. Prince of Slytherin. This one pushes ffn/ao3 updates once a month or so. /However/, the author releases each chapter as a series of chunks (typically a couple of thousand words each) on his discord server. So still fitting the criteria. linkffn(11191235)

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
