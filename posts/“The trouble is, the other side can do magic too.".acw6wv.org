If I could impress upon writers of fanfiction a single principle of how to write magic, it would be this one from HBP Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  “But for heaven's sake --- you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out --- well --- anything!”

  Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.”
#+end_quote

Not only is this principle uttered by the characters, it's also something JKR mentions in commentary sources:

#+begin_quote
  ... he could have employed a range of measures against the Potion - he might have sealed his own throat and faked a declaration of innocence, transformed the Potion into something else before it touched his lips, or employed Occlumency against its effects. *In other words, just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible.*
#+end_quote

I think this is something that a lot of fanfiction writers should take to heart when:

A. Trying to "fix" something they consider to be a plot hole, and

B. Writing fics in which characters take advantage of apparent "broken" aspects of magic.

So...

Think wizards should use the Fidelius to protect everything?

Like all magic, the Fidelius is not infallible.

Think it's odd that wizards don't use Veritaserum for trials?

Like all magic, Veritaserum is not infallible.

Think wizards should demand magically binding contracts/vows to govern basic social relations and eliminate the risk of betrayal and the need to trust?

Like all magic, magical contracts/vows are not infallible.

Etc.

Crucially, the key to this fallibility is that /the other side has magic too/. That is, these things /are/ generally useful, and do go some way to solving problems that Muggles face. There'd be no point in having magic if it gave you no advantages over a Muggle life. But these items of magic don't go all the way to solving those problems because magic can overcome other magic.

Why is this so important? Because it ensures that magic fulfils its promise (a large part of the charm of the Potter universe is how much the readers want to be a wizard) while making sure that stories retain conflict.

As an author, you should not want for your characters to be able to trust people with no possibility of betrayal. The need to trust and the possibility of betrayal are key elements of character and plot development.

As an author, you should not want a world where the justice system is infallible or characters avoid obvious ways to make it infallible. Realistic, nuanced miscarriages of justice provide a cause for the characters (and reader) to rally around while keeping their opponents three dimensional.

As an author, you should not want a world where it is possible to create a completely impenetrable defence. The existence of a completely safe space prevents any real tension from developing, and leads to plot holes (every time something bad happens: why didn't they just use their impenetrable defence?).

** This is a very useful post.

I /would/, however, like to stress that this treads dangerously close to the "best of all possible worlds" fallacy --- just because there /might/ be very good reasons the Wizarding World doesn't implement many of the easy "patches" fans can cook up, doesn't mean /none/ of those ideas are worthwhile. The Wizarding World is very far from perfect in most ways, and there's no reason to assume that its tendency towards inefficiency doesn't also prevent optimal use of the magic available to them.

Of course, having the good guys figure out /all/ of the ways in which magic could be exploited further, and the bad guys none, is a problem. But don't confuse "if you give a lightsaber to Frodo, be sure to give Sauron a Death Star" with "you should never give a lightsaber to Frodo". If the canonical Lord Voldemort can figure out beautiful magic loopholery like making the Triwizard Cup a double-Portkey or absorbing Harry's blood so the protection no longer harms him, similar feats should be available to smart MCs too.

I've read millions and millions of words of fanfiction at this point, hundreds of works, and I have never seen a story which would, for example, feature a social taboo on Veritaserum and a smart MC loopholing around it to free Sirius. Insert any other example of the MC using something apparently obvious, but unused in the world. Its never that there are good reasons that the MC chooses to ignore.

****** Of the two methods, I think I prefer the one that is more true to real life:

Option A:

Lucius walks into the Ministry, casually pops into the Minister's office which he can do because he is rich, and says "If you pass law X I will give you 1000 Galleons".

Fudge says "okay" and the law is passed.

Option B:

Lucius hires a few ex-Unspeakables to write scholarly articles on the subject of law X promoting his view point. He then makes a sizeable donation to Fudge's political party, which grants him enough favour to have a 5 minute conversation directly with Fudge.

In that meeting, Lucius presents the articles written by the ex-Unspeakables. Fudge may or may not be convinced, but either way he sees that the material is of sufficient scholarly merit that it would provide a plausible basis for supporting law X. He also understands the unstated implication that further donations will only be forthcoming from Lucius if he feels like he is being listened to.

Fudge orders an underling to look into the situation. The underling consults further with Lucius, which satisfies Lucius, but also consults with Lucius' opponents on law X, who have done exactly the same thing that Lucius did but for the opposite viewpoint.

Having gone through the charade of consultation, underling reports back to Fudge on the real driver of his decisions: which position is more politically expedient. Fudge backs the position most likely to get him reelected, taking into account his need for donations but balancing that need against other influential factors (e.g. if it's a hot topic issue with voters, donations aren't going to sway him; if it's an issue only a few people care about, he will go with the highest bidder).

Sometimes Lucius will win, sometimes the other side will win. Fudge is careful to not favour one side too much over the other, as it's important that both sides feel like they have a good chance of winning on an issue-by-issue basis to keep them playing the game (and keep making donations).

As I said it's really a matter of tastes. I think it's on-record that I like significantly more humor in my /Harry Potter/ stories than you do. I'm not saying your second option isn't more realistic, I'm just saying it's less funny than Ministry employees casually selling favors as grocery-salesmen sell potatoes.

Mind that that's how I think of it for clerks and other "lower" employees. How it goes between Malfoy and /Fudge/, while not Option B either, is significantly different in my headcanon --- I conceive of Lucius and Cornelius as having been in the same year and House at Hogwarts, and so Fudge thinks/doublethinks that he can trust Lucius, that he owes Lucius a lot for sticking up for him in their youth, that Lucius is a good man full of good ideas. A good man who also gives him expensive jewels for his wife, handy magical artifacts, and fine wines at Christmas, but that's because they're friends, isn't it? Indeed, that he gives Cornelius all those gifts is how you know they're friends. And it really wouldn't be proper for him not to reciprocate when Lucius asks for the occasion rule-bending favor, would it? He's so very good to the Fudges. And such a clever and proper pureblood wizard, too --- such a man can't be /wrong/ when he wants a law passed, anyway; there's really nothing wrong with fast-tracking his suggestions, it's for the greater good anyway.

Your latter situation is pretty close to [[/u/Taure]] 's "option B" in that it is Fudge's reaction to Lucius doing all those things. Lucius earns that opinion from Fudge with favors (gifts), coercion, and appeals (pleasant conversations, insinuating nudges, etc). Lucius also has some political power himself, so he's better as an ally than a rival.

Corruption is often equal parts comically obvious and insidiously subtle, as something like inconsequential gifts, compliments, or favors can sway influence without the target ever realizing his opinion of you has changed.

There is an easy reason. All of their high school years is focused on magical studies, and not on the humanities. Also, problems with science are much easier to solve than problems with society, you can see that all over the world.

  Or have a signifcant amount of philosophers/poets throughout history been Wizards?
#+end_quote

This is one of my pet peeves, famous historical Muggles turning out to be magical. It's pretty well established that the magical population is a tiny fraction of the Muggle population.

So the odds that rare geniuses would be wizards rather than Muggle are vanishingly small. If wizards are 1/1,000 and geniuses are 1/1,000, wizard geniuses are 1/1,000,000 (assuming being a wizard and being a genius aren't correlated).

Put another way, the once-in-a-generation level Muggle genius would occur once every thousand generations among Wizard-kind, which is longer than all recorded human history. Meaning such geniuses probably never existed in the magical population, ever.

#+begin_quote
  What kind of literary periods have they gone through? How prevalent are the humanities in general? What about Wizarding philosophy or poetry?
#+end_quote

This statistical analysis also means that wizards are unlikely to have produced many great works of literature, they just don't have the population for it. There might not be a whole lot to it other than traditional bedtime stories for children (Beedle the Bard) and trashy novels for housewives (Lockhart).

And of course, there's the factor that they can do /magic/, which is deeply mysterious and has incredible potential. Most of the genius-level magicals would probably be more interested in studying magic than writing literature. As we see with the example of Lockhart, writing about imagined exploits (or worse, stealing credit via Obliviation) is the provenance of those who lack the ability or disposition to actually go out and /have/ those adventures.

If anything, I could see there being some good memoirs/auto-biographies; retired Curse-Breakers and Aurors would have some good stories to tell, and would be past the point of still physically doing it themselves.

Firstly it's the one case where a special exception was already prepared for a way to magically teleport out of Hogwarts. (That and House-Elves, but Voldemort's tendency to underestimate House-Elves in general is, of course, well-documented by the Kreacher plotline and thus it's not a stretch he wouldn't think to use them here.)

Secondly, unlike Barty kidnapping Harry in Hogsmeade, Harry being lost in the /Maze/ for longer than planned would not be immediately suspicious. And thirdly---

#+begin_quote
  If anything, Voldemort is stupid for not removing the original enchantment which gives Harry a way out.
#+end_quote

--- there are many potential explanations for that, all of which paint Voldemort's skills as a schemer in good light.

First, most prosaically, it may be that the Cup was checked just before the Trial to make sure the Portkey spell that took you back to the entrance of the Maze was functional, though not in-depth enough to detect a theoretical /second/ Portkey spell.

Second, Voldemort may have intended to send Harry's corpse back through the Cup after their duel, so that it would look like something in the Maze had got him /just/ before he reached the Cup, and he only had time to grab it before dying. That way, Dumbledore might still suspect foul play, but the Ministry would have very strong grounds for denying it --- consider that this is still basically what happened in the end when Harry got out of the Maze with Cedric's body. The Ministry couldn't have dismissed Harry's claims that easily if he'd been found in Little Hangleton.

Third, and kookiest; an authorized Portkey into Hogwarts grounds is /gold/. Perhaps Voldemort was planning to use the Portkey for himself and his Death Eaters at some point to take Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote

  Or the protection was rather useless in the first place since apparently, Quirrel can curse Harry's broom just fine.

It's not foolproof, sure, but the element of surprise is key. Quirrell /did/ get burned to death because he tried to strangle Harry without realizing what he was getting himself into. Had he lived, he could then have thought ways around it, sure. But in point of fact, the secret was well-kept, it killed Quirrell, and Harry lived.

First, /Wingardium Leviosa/ doesn't work on people, AFAIK. Second, even if it did, it takes more time for a capable wizard to realize what's happening and cast a Levitation Spell than it takes for a child to fall a dozen feet and break his neck.

**** My own interpretation of the portkey loophole is that Crouch Jr. hacked the original portkey by adding another destination before the intended one, therefore conserving the "porting privilege" of the original one (I'm assuming portkeys are not allowed to and from Hogwarts, unless exceptionally created by an "Admin").

​

Also I think you can't expect a mystical magical protection of love to also cover anything the recipient happens to be in contact with (up to an including clothes, wands, brooms or other people...) , and it doesn't appears to apply to ranged attacks (or does it? the crucios were after the rebirth... Riddle used the Basilisk and Quirell didn't use any aggressive spells directly on Harry, did he?). Levitation charms might be a thing, but try hitting someone falling at 50 m/s 100 meters away from you with one. I got the sense that Dumbledore used a sort of baddass slowing down field to save Harry in PoA, more a big AoE kind of spell than a little *pew pew* "fixed that for u boy, why other ppl didn't do it they so dumb" kind of situation...

As for why the blood didn't burn Babymort... well, why didn't he drown in the potion?... why didn't he boil to death? At this point, were his body and soul fragment more an ingredient of the potion and ritual than a manifestation of his person? IDK... Magic?

Some of my favorite fanfictions take a small aspect of canon, tweaks it a bit, and then follows it to its most logical extreme, creating an entirely new story from one minor twist. It doesn't dismiss canon but explores it with a different light.

** Hear-hear! I think that a good rule of thumb when using magic or some magical law to solve a problem without difficulty, or when introducing new magic, one should ask several questions:

- Keeping in mind that canon characters know more about magic than you do (even if you might know some factoids that they don't), why didn't the characters do that thing under similar circumstances in canon?
- How would society be different if others could do what the protagonists are about to do? Is it (whether in canon or in your fic)?
- Would the antagonists be in the position to anticipate it, and what countermeasures would they take?
- If others can't do it and/or can't anticipate it, why not?

One should not proceed with the plan until one has found satisfactory answers to all of these questions.

I find this argument just terrible for two reasons:

(a) It's a lazy way out. As a world building exercise it doesn't suffice to say "well anything that doesn't make sense is explainable by some off screen thing that I haven't explained yet and won't bother to explain". Clearly just putting a sentence like that in your work of fiction doesn't somehow /magically/ (no pun intended) protect and immunize it from plot-holes and inconsistencies. It's clearly a self-serving declaration by the author (there's some more of those in HBP and DH).

(b) Lets try something else: "Well, our policemen don't use guns, because the bad guys do have guns too". Obviously this makes zero sense. The opposite site having magic at their disposal too is a terrible explanation why some tools that are available aren't used. In some cases the fact that the other side has magic too should actually escalate the usage of a "magical arms race" instead of saying "well, that's why we don't bother, because it could be broken".

Not a main point, but I argued this before: Just because the other side might be able to defeat a Fidelius or Veritaserum doesn't mean you won't use it. That's retarded. The only decent counter-argument I've seen is the supposition that every magical is brain-dead enough to not consider the possibility that they might be broken, so it's better not to use them in the first place to keep everyone on their toes or some other mental gymnastics like that.

The fact that they are fallible means that they are not a one-stop-shop method to remove all conflict and "fix" the world in all situations. It does not mean they are not used (because they are).

That was actually my last point about fulfilling the promise of magic. It's important not to make magic /too/ fallible, because that ruins the fun of a series about wizards. Magic still needs to be useful. But equally you can't make it so useful that it eliminates conflict or the drivers of character development.

The way the books achieve this balance is by having magic able to fix most Muggle problems, but then having other magic exist which can undo that solution. I believe this is the right way to achieve the balance required. It means that in peaceful times, magic will be of great use and therefore is a very attractive thing to have, but in war time, conflict is maintained.

I think we have a very fundamental disagreement, that we won't be able to overcome in this discussion, but I want to state it outright:

You are very concerned with making the magic of the HP world internally consistent. You spend lots of time "divining" the deeper meaning of some of the stuff hinted at in canon and come up with some kind of model how it could all work together.

I respect your tenacity and canon knowledge about this, *but* for me this is a fools errant, because in my opinion there's no deeper meaning to find. JKR just wrote things she thought were cool and helped her with her plot or desired outcome. There's no inner meaning or any type of consistency (except that which you create). Please don't take this as dismissive, but I look at these efforts like I look at numerologists or theologists (all very intelligent and diligent people).

This closely ties to why I prefer AUs: It allows authors to make up and dismiss stuff about magic at will. I can start reading with the presumption that things that aren't explained yet will be explained and that everything is consistent.

If that's the case then there isn't really any point ever discussing Harry Potter. A discussion without a standard of correctness is just a group of people stating baseless opinions. The comparison isn't really theology. In theology, you still argue on the evidence. Questions like the "synoptic problem" are questions to which there /is/ an answer (historically, it must be the case that the gospels were written in a certain order), it's just that the evidence is insufficient to determine the answer in a way that leaves no doubt.

The situation you're describing isn't just one where there's insufficient evidence, but rather one where there's no answer at all. The more apt comparison is a debate over which colour is the best. The only sensible response to such a debate is to walk away.

Any non-pointless discussion about the contents of the HP universe has to be premised by an assumption that there is a correct "in universe" answer. It may be that, from an out-of-universe perspective, we know that the answer cannot be known with certainty until JKR chooses to state it. But that doesn't really impact the in-universe analysis at all.

No not really. You are aware of Sanderson's laws of magic, right? HP rarely uses its magic to solve problems (when it does it's shit, exactly because it isn't consistent), it's more about friendship, love and other over-arching themes.

I can perfectly enjoy the HP universe for its overarching themes, its characters and its world, without thinking that the rules are entirely (or have to be) consistent or (have to) make sense. If I spot an inconsistency in another work of fiction my first instinct isn't to come up with some explanation why that isn't an inconsistency (unless I missed something obvious). I'm perfectly capable of just suspending my disbelief and moving on from that. Back to HP: "Yeah sure, the magic doesn't really make a lot of sense, but who cares?" not "Oh, it has to make sense somehow, I have to twist and bend my brain until I can come up with a workable theory".

I don't think I'd be able to enjoy very many works if I applied the standard you seem to demand here.

My position was that to engage in in-universe discussions about the facts of the HP world, you first have to accept an assumption that there are facts about the HP world. Out of universe observations have no place in that discussion.

You initially rejected that position, stating that out-of-universe objections that the universe is inconsistent are valid responses to in-universe questions. Now you state that you are willing to engage in in-universe discussions based on the aforementioned assumption. So /comment chain I guess.

As for what the /thread/ is about (as opposed to the issues raised in this comment chain, which has been largely off topic):

The thread is stating that it is a /fact/ of the HP universe that all magic is fallible, and in particular that the fallibility takes the form of other magic being able to evade or overcome it. This is an in-universe fact, stated by the characters. It just so happens to have been also been stated by JKR in commentary.

My position is not that "magic is fallible" is an answer to all plot holes. There are plenty of genuine plot holes in the HP books, such as the period of time between Hagrid picking Harry up and delivering him to the Dursleys. Magic is fallible isn't an answer to that question.

However, the fact that all magic is fallible is something to consider when you /think/ you have identified a plot hole, when in fact you have just identified an area of the magical world which is unexplained. I am pointing out that even for those things which are unexplained, we know, as an in-universe fact and an out-of-universe writing principle which JKR adheres to, that for any given piece of magic, there will always be some other piece of magic which renders it fallible. This also ties in nicely with Snape's comments about the Dark Arts in HBP.

These are the lengths that JKR apologists go to: Things that are done routinely by more competent (in regards to internal consistency) authors *all the fucking time* become complete literary impossibilities and "wonder woman" JKR is just doing the best she can with the terrible realities she's faced with. As if she had a careful discussion with herself like this: "Wellllll, if I start to explain these things that may appear like plot-holes, it would totally ruin the vibe and theme of the story, so I better don't do it."

******** He (in this case actually JKR) is saying I should dismiss any presumed inconsistencies or potential plot-holes by imagining that some kind of explanation (possibly involving powerful counter magic) exists and can readily be used to defeat any idea that I could think of that would break canon. I find this to be terrible and no one would accept this in their writing.

Really, arguing like this no plot-holes could exist ever.

Yes it's the old "x isn't a plot-hole just because it isn't explicitly said" excuse. I get that. You can do that for mundane things. "Well how did Harry get to the Burrow?"... Who cares? There's a million reasonable explanations how he could have gotten there.

"Why doesn't Voldemort demand a Unbreakable Vow from his followers?"... I bet you can come up with all kinds of explanations for that too, many of which make a lot of sense too, but they aren't mundane and simple, they are probably very complex. Just because some things that can't be explained aren't plot holes doesn't mean that all things that aren't explained also aren't plot holes, yet the phrase that is the subject of this discussion demands exactly that: Come up with something on your own.

And nobody is saying otherwise. Plotholes can and do still exist, but there are plenty of people who claim this or that is a plothole without bothering to give it a bit of thought.

Though, if you are trying to engage in a discussion about the HP world, it is best to try and always assume there's an in-universe explanation. You can of course believe it a plothole anyway, and you can be right, but then there's no longer really a place for you in the discussion beyond "It's a plothole," is there?

All in all, I don't believe Taure thinks there exists no plotholes in any universe with magic. That would indeed be silly. He's just trying his best to fill in any potential holes, and really, why shouldn't he?

*** Indeed. Also, the excuse pretty much fails since we never see that principle being applied to the enemy. Voldemort's plans always work out, no matter how stupid and convoluted (Year 4, 5, 6). We never see why the enemy doesn't simply chain-imperius everyone. Or why no one uses time-turners. Or why the Unbreakable Vow wasn't used more often. (And no, "it's too dangerous" is worthless as an argument - if it could save you from Azkaban or Death, you'd happily swear a vow. And Voldemort certainly didn't care that much about his followers not to force them into such vows.)

There are still so many ways to nerf them. For example, a vow /inherently/ limits your ability to make decisions, so it takes away your free will. Will is also the same thing that protects you of the Imperius curse, so you might gain nothing but contempt from your followers - because they could still betray you, just not of their own free will.

Note: I'm not saying that this is true, but that there can be more than one way that magic can be failing you.

***** He got resurrected in the most convoluted way possible. He managed to fool Harry into walking into a trap against any reason. He managed to break into Hogwarts thanks to everyone being an idiot.

The problem with the Unbreakable Vow is that it adds nothing to the story or setting but problems. Cutting it out entirely would be the best solution by far.

I agree, but the point of this discussion is that just because there should have been a better way to abduct Harry, doesn't mean they weren't attempted or ruled out in favor of what happens "on screen."

Entering Harry into the tournament illegally and ensuring that he wins has more effects than simple abduction from Hogsmeade or whatever, one of which is that it paints him as a rule-breaking attention seeker to all except his closest friends (even Ron betrays him for a time). He looks like a cheater because he's /obviously/ getting help in the tasks he can't figure out himself. It's a hugely publicized event Potter's reputation gets put on blast, and I wouldn't be surprised if Voldemort had something to do with ensuring a tenacious journalist with an unscrupulous grasp on truth was the primary reporter for the event. It also lets Voldemort pick a time and place for the ritual, which probably took a lot of time and planning to research and prepare. In terms of place, it is also free from witnesses outside of Voldemort's followers, and it allows him to grandstand and show his exceptional power + skill in front of said followers. We know there are only a couple months between Wormtail's escape and Voldemort's return as a baby, so big V's capacity for planning and rational thought and re-acquiring competent help is pretty limited.

It is also worth noting that there is evidence that Dumbledore manipulated Voldemort into believing Harry was his greatest enemy, so Voldemort was forced to act in a way that gave Dumbledore all the power -- except maybe in this one, convoluted circumstance. If Voldemort had less regard for Dumbledore or dismissed Harry as non-threat, things would probably have happened differently. The 50-year-old DARK LORD challenged a 14-year-old to a *duel*.

Is it a logical way to kidnap a teenager and force him to give up some blood in a resurrection ritual? No -- it's completely insane -- but we don't see what other options Voldemort planned, tried, or ruled out, or why. And Voldemort is patently insane.

There's a sort of rule in creative writing that everything must further A) *plot*, B) *character*, or C) *setting*, and should do more than one whenever possible. The Unbreakable Vow does all three: it advances the PLOT by spurring a CHARACTER to action, and it shows us another facet of the magical SETTING. We get more insight into Draco and magic because of it, and it is the ultimate reason for Dumbledore's death.

But in order to do this, it wrecks the plot, character and setting, and that means it's stupid. a) and b): The character in question doesn't need the Vow to take action - Dumbledore can get him to mercy-kill him anyway. c): The vow utterly wrecks the setting, character and plot since everyone with half a brain will be asking why it was not used for so many other occasions by supposedly smart characters. The Unbreakable vow turns your characters into idiots and breaks SoD for your plot and setting.

And that's stupid.

Not saying there can't be an error, but the statement "there is no way this can't work" also requires proof. All that story is in her head, so I feel like her word is kinda the law. So when I see some contradiction, my instinct is to try and smooth it over instead of picking on it.

*** Yes, I don't dismiss plot-holes outright, and I think people these days are way too quick to jump to that assumption. A plot-hole is only evident if the TEXT directly contradicts ITSELF or something happens that is physically impossible without an explanation. Like establishing that /Avada Kedavra/ is a killing curse and then letting people survive it with no explanation. That is a direct contradiction. A contradiction of character forgetfulness or an omission of relevant detail is NOT a plot-hole, especially if it doesn't affect the plot, it's only when something relevant to the PLOT contradicts itself (hence the name).

Characters are people and people are illogical, so they aren't going to do the best possible thing all the time, and it would be a terribly boring story if everyone did the thing they were supposed to do.

I think everyone should watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9HivyjAKlc][Patrick's SHUT UP ABOUT PLOT HOLES]] before joining internet discussions about said subject.
