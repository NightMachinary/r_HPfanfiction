Albus is suppose to be seen as a wise mentor in the serie but in fanfiction he is mostly seen as a manipulating old men. What are some other examples?

***** I'd like to point out that it /is/ a kids story that developed into a young adult story (and I get the feeling that JKR didn't actually intend for that to occur). Such inconsistencies were bound to happen. I'm not going to say I prefer Canon!Harry above all else, but to see a Canon!Harry every once in awhile can be considered a nice change of pace to many, me included.

*** Part of the problem there is writers with no sense of a light touch. It's fine to have Luna be just very insightful and empathetic, maybe occasionally having her fantastic statements hint at a real truth. Then again, best way to handle that would be a toned-down version of Shore Pibald from Schlock Mercenary: On at least two occasions, he's the first person to figure out what's going on because he's insane - his particular flavor of crazy leaves him with a larger starting "possibility space" than a normal person, so he's able to come to correct conclusions that are too out-there for most to even consider. Luna could be the same way, to a degree, with her more open mind meaning that she's more likely to consider the extraordinary. Some of the classic literary detectives (Holmes and Dupin come to mind) are like this as well in many stories.

*** To be fair, as someone that only considers the original books as "canon" there is little to no information about Fleur. One of the attractives to use her in fanfiction is that the writer can do pretty much whatever he wants with her, that why you have Seductress!Fleur, Innocent!Fleur, Slut!Fleur, Indy!Fleur, Ice Queen!Fleur, that's pretty much the same for most of Slytherin students save for Malfoy, Crab, Goyle, Parkinson and Flint

That is the point I'm making though. We don't know her as well as let's say Hermione but Fleur is not another Daphne either. We do get little snippets of information about her, her character, her attitude and somehow many writers pretty much completely ignore/change what little there is given by the books which makes her unrecognizable.

** Remus Lupin in some fics is definitely unrecognizable. Women often show him as very violent which is nonsense. He would not be violent towards women, even before a full moon. His wry sense of humour is not always there, along with his compassion and good teaching skills. In fics he sometimes says things I cna't imagine him ever saying, even in his own head. But I sometimes wonder if some things that bother me are just because I have specific idea of what I think he is like. That applies particularly to fics where he uses words like fucking. These break my emerssion completely.

*** I agree. He's so wise and gentle in the books. And seems like a very kind and reasonable person. While in fanon he can be portrayed as either a sex God (due to him being a werewolf of course) or as some kind of killjoy who doesn't joke at all and tries to stop Harry from doing anything. And let's not forget The Debt of Time and its Remus. Ugh.

**** God that fic! I know people like it, though I honestly have no idea why. I read maybe one chapter and kept wondering who on earth was that character named Remus Lupin. In this case my taste in Remus-centri fics is so different from the rest of the fandom that I honestly practically have nothing to read. And he's also a kill-joy? sigh. Another thing I've noticed is that when it comes to romance, Remus is sort of almost a bad person because he doesn't jump at the chance to be with someone. And it's always, always his fault that the lady is suffering, because he is the one to seek her out after dumping her. I don't know how one is supposed to want that sort of relationship to even exist. Women have some sort of secret love for assholes because it's never a woman who does something wrong. But Remus as a sexy god due to his werewolf condition now just makes me laugh.

***** I know, right? I like the Sirius/Hermione part of the Debt of Time because it's fun and Sirius is not OOC (for the most part). But (spoiler alert) there's a plot point there which basically says Remus suffers through the Full Moon easier if he has sex for a couple of days in a row before it. Like WHAT???? And I just hate the bookworm!Remus trope because come on, he's one of the Marauders, he has to be just as bad of a prankster as James and Sirius. And he's just such a complex character that most of fanfiction authors just don't bother with. Clearly, it frustrates me. He's so underrated.

****** True. And like you said, people don't bother with this complexity. The same goes for Sirius and Snape as well. People tend to take one character trait and exagerate it or not take context into account, so that's how Remus is no fun and Sirius is just a womanizer.

** I think the worst case of fanon divergence is Snape. In the books he's a grey character who doesn't always do the right thing and most of the time is a complete arsehole. But in fanfiction there're usually two extremes: the worst person walking the Earth!Snape and the wonderful, amazing, spectacular man but damaged (but still very appealing and sexy)! Snape. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love me some well-written Snager, however I view that Snape as an OC basically, because he's so different from the canon the version.
