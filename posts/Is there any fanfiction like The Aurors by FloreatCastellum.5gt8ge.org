*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2469997/1/][*/Imperius/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/74910/Jess-Pallas][/Jess Pallas/]]

#+begin_quote
  “Imperius...Werewolves...You Know Who...” The last words of a dying man force Remus Lupin into a dangerous investigation at the infamous Feral Institute. Sequel to Oblivious although prereading isn't vital.

** It depends how 'like' it you need it to be. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic][THIS]] is an Auror story I wrote, but I don't know if it's the sort of thing you want.
