Hi everyone!

My name is Malory and I'm the new editor of [[https://fanslashfic.com/][FAN/FIC Magazine]], a nonprofit publication for fanfic readers and writers. We've been active for about a year now, so I thought I'd try something new and (hopefully) fun!

I'm organizing our first ever [[https://fanslashfic.com/2016/08/18/flash-fic-festival-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/][Flash Fic Festival]], which will take place on *September 1st* (in exactly two weeks time). Since I read/write Harry Potter fanfic and considering all the current goings-on in our fandom, I decided that +everybody's favourite script-play+ /The Cursed Child/ will be the subject of our little ficlet challenge.

There are more details on our [[https://fanslashfic.com/2016/08/18/flash-fic-festival-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/][festival post]], but basically it will involve being Owled a choice of 3 prompts on September 1st, at which time you will have *24 hours to create, write, and edit a fic between 400 and 2500 words*. Once we receive all the entries, we'll pick our favourite fic and reward the winning author with [[https://fanslashfic.com/2016/08/18/flash-fic-festival-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/][a few little prize tidbit thingys]]. But it's all in good fun!

Anyway, I wanted to post here first in case any of you were interested in signing up! And if anyone has any tips about organizing fic challenges like this, please feel free to send them my way. If this one goes well, I want to do more festivals like this in the future. I hope it will a fun writing exercise at the very least :)

Thanks for reading!

Edit: Strikethrough indicates much sarcasm.

*** I can't tell if the OP was sarcastic or not. The Trolley Witch bit seemed like a missing moment from Ruskbyte's (much better IMO) Evil Be Thou My Good. linkffn(2452681)

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

***** Eh, I have difficulty picking up sarcasm in real life, text is near impossible. We all have our quirks.
