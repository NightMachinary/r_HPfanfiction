So, if you're like me, then some of the first HP fanfics you read you found by searching on FFN. You know what makes up, like, the top 100 fics there? Variants of 'what if Harry had this other, extra, awesome power?', which is almost always /incredibly/ dull. Half the time it's just an excuse to have Harry curbstomp all oposition with virtually no difficulty, and it blows.

Sometimes it trends towards being decent, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]], but it's... difficult. More often than not we get some bullshit like Harry Crow, or at best, uninspired and tedious crack.

But I'm in the mood for something easy to digest, so does anyone have any examples of this done /well/? "Harry has additional advantage X, and let's see what he does with it" style fics, maybe where Harry has a new weakness to go along with the strength or something? Timetravel is actually done reasonably well semi-frequently, so let's make this harder by excluding that.

I dunno, maybe this is asking for way too much, like a Drarry fic that doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out at some point. Might as well ask, though.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue): the "power" is understanding of metaphors and soon proves a sufficient point of departure to take a very different turn.

Also, would you be interested in a few where Hermione is the one with the additional power?

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

But I don't think it's fair to describe /Barefoot/ as a "harem". Yes, he is more or less in a relationship with Tonks and Human!Hedwig at the same time, but that's the extent of it, and Harry even begins to question whether that much is really a /right/ thing to do.
