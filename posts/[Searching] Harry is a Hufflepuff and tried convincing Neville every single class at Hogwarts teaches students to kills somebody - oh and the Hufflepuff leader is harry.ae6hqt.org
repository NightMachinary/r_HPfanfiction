** Crap this sounds so familiar but I can't quite remember. I'm pretty sure it's not linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) or its sequels, but I'll look through my saved fics and get back to you.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** I don't know the story you're after, but the general idea rather reminded me of chapter 16 of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality).

#+begin_quote
  "Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate dangerous?"

  "Ah... um... he's creative?"

  "/Wrong!/â€¯" bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist came down sharply on his desk with an amplified sound that made everyone jump. "All of Mr. Potter's ideas were worse than useless!"

  Harry started in surprise.

  "Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat you do not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there would be a hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had exactly one idea which he could use immediately, right now, without extensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does not know. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket. Which would be more likely to break his wand than kill his opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were uniformly awful."

  "What?" Harry said indignantly. "You /asked/ for unusual ideas, not practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How would /you/ use something in this classroom to kill someone?"

  Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were smile crinkles around his eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said you were to /kill/. There is a time and a place for taking your enemy alive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those places. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck with the edge of a chair."

  There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were laughing with Harry, not at him.

  Everyone else was looking rather horrified.

  "But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most dangerous student in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses of items in this room for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested using a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming enemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised shield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was offensive rather than defensive, and either fatal or potentially fatal."

  What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of vertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely there had to be a counterexample...

  "And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is why Mr. Potter's ideas were so strange and useless - because he had to reach far into the impractical in order to meet his standard of /killing the enemy/. To him, any idea which fell short of that was not worth considering. This reflects a quality that we might call /intent to kill/. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it, not yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary murder, but even he was shocked - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was watching your face - when Mr. Potter described how to use his classmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your mind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter thinks /purely/ of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any means to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off. Even though his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical as to be useless, his /intent to kill/ makes Harry Potter the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom."

*** If you're going to downvote, you should also leave a comment explaining why. Was the quote too long? I can cut it down, but I don't think it rambles. Do you simply dislike HPMoR? That's actually [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t][not supposed to be enough reason to downvote]]. I think it was just as relevant to the OP as the first reply, which currently has 12 points, but if you feel otherwise, please explain.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
