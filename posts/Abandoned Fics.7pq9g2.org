Any abandoned fics that you absolutely love and you wish someone would take on and finish?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer]])

So many to choose from, but this is definitely near the top.

Edit: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532059/1/Dragons]])

I know it isn't HP but this fic deserves an honorable mention. Making the Dragonborn an interesting character can be hard, but this fic does a decent job of doing it. Love the interactions between the characters as well.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

** Well, the fics I really loved to read and want to see finished are good because of the person who wrote them, their writing style, their humour, their characterisations, their foreshadowing. I want to see how they imagined the story would continue. So while there are a lot of stories I want to see finished (most of all On the Way to Greatness, but also Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived) I can't imagine I would get much satisfaction reading someone else's continuation. Are there any examples out there where someone took over a story and actually continued to write it at the same level of quality? (And didn't get bored after a couple of chapters?)

** There is this one fic in which Lupin raised a vampiric Harry. It stops when Harry is supposed to take over Dracula's throne, or something.

I read it so long ago, I can't even remember its name, but I loved reading it.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

The plot wasn't anything to write home about and it had its share of awkward scenes, but after awhile it just became a rather fluffy if unrealistic story about how many inventions and new enterprises you could stuff into the setting.

It was like one big checklist of things that would later become cliches. I keep coming back to enjoy the sheer breadth of ideas. And damn if it isn't one of my guilty pleasures.
