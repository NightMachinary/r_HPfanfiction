In most stories Harry seems to date one girl who is the love of his life and that's it. Maybe he will have a brief relationship with someone (Cho) that is a complete disaster. Are there any stories where he just dates like a normal teenager? EDIT: Yeah, I am not looking for harem fics.


** I think this is a worthy request and a bit of a challenge if you're still hoping he'll be Harry-like; that is, not a complete bastard but not a saint either.

*** I think it's also a bit of a challenge because it means writing a lot of subplots that INTENTIONALLY go nowhere, and I think that throws a lot of people both as writers and as readers. (and that's ignoring people who ship the relationship you're planning to have /not/ work out)

**** I could see Harry evolving as a character through different relationship. For example, he dates Cho and realizes that looks aren't everything, and that he needs to actually know a person to be with them. So not a plot that goes no where. But Harry is so very forgiving and saintly as a character it would be hard for him to break up with anyone, and why would anyone break up with him?

** The Merging by Shaydrall.

Harry +has relationships with+ dates multiple girls. They're not concurrent, and he's not trying to set up a harem, he just... doesn't really know what he wants in that aspect of his life and neither do they so things rarely go according to plan (like in real life.)

Best of all, it all goes on in the background of a story that isn't actually about the romance.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.

** There is a lot of harem out there, but I think you mean more that he dates a number of girls /sequentially/. I don't know any, but I mainly stick to gen or slash because I really dislike the whole male fantasy female objectification fic that is harem or Harry plus any girl except Ginny or (sometimes) Hermione. I would suggest you look more at post Hogwarts, as there just isn't really time in the canon time line for both (good) plot and the character building required for multiple realistic relationships.

*** I feel like there's a lot of +[I'm not sure genres is the right word, but categories... or maybe plot types?]+ *concepts* in fanfiction that have this bizarre issue where they're like communism.

AKA: The theory looks amazing on paper... but it rarely seems to work out in practice. (tho, using the 'on paper' analogy may not be a good one for a discussion about *writing* I admit)

For a few examples... SI's or Harem or I'm sure there's other categories of fics that count where they all seem like there's nothing wrong /per se/ with the concept but that there is a *lot* of badly written stories out there of those types...

I really wish there was a solid, well written, and completed fic of each of those categories that I could point to and say 'this is what you failed to achieve' because I think the issue is that including one or more of these concepts sort of secretly raises the required threshold of writing quality that you need in order to achieve a /good/ story but that it's possible. To continue with the harem topic that you mentioned... I suspect an *actually good* harem story wouldn't actually be about the guy, since each of the girls involved would have to be people in their own right and have their own stuff going on and most of the story would be about them and it gets very complicated very fast to keep all those subplots in motion.

And what happens is that the sorts of people who say to themselves "I want to write a harem fic" and the sorts of people who are capable of pulling it off well in terms of writing ability aren't exactly lining up

**** The point is any story which is based on a single idea is not going to turn out great. For example, if /'Harry is sorted into Slytherin'/ is the only basis of your story, I can tell you already it's going to be crap. If instead you say, /'hey, I want to make a story about how good intentions can lead to mentally dark but necessary places, and I'll frame it by making Harry sorted into Slytherin,'/ or /'treating people like monsters turns them into monsters, exactly like if Harry was sorted into Slytherin'/ has a much much better chance of being a good story. Exactly the same thing happens to *all* other concepts. If I go, /'hey, all these +actresses+ characters are +hot+ interesting, so I want to have Harry with all of them,'/ then yeah, crap fest full of one dimensional +female shaped sex toys+ characters is what you get. The other problem with Harry Harem stories is they go hand in hand with /'this is my story and Harry is the protagonist so he has to be super awesome,'/ (which leads to the whole harem because Harry is super awesome). I wouldn't be surprised if the best Harem stories out there do not include Harry at all, for instance I can see a pretty good story being written about a female harem with a random under powered (and controllable) male like Colin Creevey, where the females have banded together against the highly male biased magical society, stopping them from being married off like chattel to keep lines pure (/cough/Astoria Greengrass/cough/).

But that's all a bit off topic. The request above is interesting because it's asking for regular dating. Regular dating isn't normally seen in stories (even outside of HPFF). Why? Because for one, writers and readers don't want to read about things which have no impact on the ending. Spending 10,000 words with Random Girl (or Boy) A, B and C when after the breakups we never see them again and Harry ends up with Random Girl G can fell like the dreaded filler or in worse cases like mocking those who believe he should be with any of the rejected characters. This is especially true of fanfiction, which is highly targeted writing. I can think of stories where, like in canon Harry dates one person, breaks up with them and ends up with another. But more then that? No, I'd be surprised if there is more then a handful out there, and if there is any good stories is another matter entirely.

** There are those stories by drizzlewizzle (or however its spelled) but I've never read them. They seem very rehashy.

** Harry Potter and the Fall of Childhood is a pretty good fic that has Harry date three people (at different times). It is a reasonably self-contained story whose sequel was sadly never written. The obvious end game with the relationships is never eventuated without the sequel, but it's still a good read.

Edit: not slash
