I don't care who he gets adopted by, as long as it has all of those family bonding feels. Also would prefer that he gets sorted into a house other than Gryffindor as well. Thanks!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
