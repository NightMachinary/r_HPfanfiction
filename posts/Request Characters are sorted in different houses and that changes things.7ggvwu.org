Say Hermione is sorted into Ravenclaw, Harry in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff (read a ton of Slytherin Harry fics, but if you know of any that isn't recommended a whole lot feel free to rec me those Slytherin Harry stories; but if they are recommended a whole lot don't rec me them because chances are I've read them), ect extra. Seeing how different them being in a different house then canon might change things.

And maybe even other characters; I could see Draco in Ravenclaw, I could see Luna in Gryffindor, Neville in Hufflepuff or even different houses or whatever.

Any rating am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Very little to no character bashing.

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. The story focuses on Ginny's character development, culminating in Ginny's sixth year in when the Death Eaters take over Hogwarts. There's no bashing in this story, and the take on Slytherin is quite refreshing and avoids many of the usual clich√©s.

** linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) features Harry and Hermione in Slytherin, as well as some interesting plotting on the behalf of Snape and Sinistra .

linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) also has Harry and Hermione in Slytherin and is one of the most interesting writing styles I've seen -- a lot f the story is conveyed via interview transcripts, which makes it really fun to read.

**** It's actually part of a series, that covers several of the books. They're not terribly in depth, but they are a fun read. It's possible to find them on the livejournal site, but she's also posted everything at linkao3(704082) and I think that's a little bit easier to navigate. More familiar, anyway.

** The Art of Self Fashioning is a Ravenclaw Harry & Neville as the Boy Who Lived story that has some of the best worldbuilding and writing. It changed the entire story in a huge way, because it changed how Harry developed in a huge way. His parents were the ones tortured into insanity instead of neville's parents, and harry's pursuit of knowledge to heal his parents' minds becomes his main purpose
