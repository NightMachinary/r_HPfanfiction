For instance, they could place magically reinforced landmines on the front lawns so they explode when the Death Eaters come streaking through the grounds. Nothing suggests C4 wouldn't work around magic --- only electrical devices would have that issue. Or maybe they could straight up use the kind of bombs Bomberplanes use. They could be spelled to be resistant to vanishing or banishing.

Or you know how Voldemort uses some kind of spell so everyone in Hogwarts hears him say that they should surrender? The whole "one drop of magical blood spilled" speech? The Order could use that spell and force Death Eaters to hear a Mandrake's scream. This wouldn't kill them (because it is second hand) but I bet it would incapacitate them for at least a few seconds --- enough time for the Order to unleash a massive opening torrent of lethal spells the DEs can't properly counter.

The Order could use the Marauder's map or even a 3D version of it to control the battle from a war room, maybe the Headmaster's office. Booby trap the whole damn castle and when you see hostile names pop up on the map (or hologram) activate the traps in the place that you see the names.

Anyway, are there such fics?

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Indeed, mines (hell, why not use some explosive potions compound if you don't want to go muggle? I mean we know wizards can make fireworks, so just scale up the explosive force of those, tie in some kind of trigger (with a dark-mark detector!) and KABOOM, you've got a magical landmine that will leave good guys unharmed!)
