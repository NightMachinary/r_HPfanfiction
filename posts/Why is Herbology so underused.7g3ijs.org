Okay, so we have all read stories where they take the gang through their first classes, but out of all of these scenes, Herbology is almost always forgotten or skimmed. I mean, they spend more time giving the Goblin History Class^{TM} the typical spiel of worthlessness. So, I wonder why?

It's not that difficult to see that, in canon, Herbology is typically underrated. Outside of Mandrakes, Devil's Snare, and Gillyweed, magical plants aren't brought up in important situations.

I believe it to be a highly underrated area of magic. I'm sure there are plants/fungi that could be used for a plethora of different things, but they hardly ever see any action.

Given the magic of Harry Potter, it isn't so hard to believe that there are plants that explode, or others that could be used as difficult to pass defenses (not Devil's Snare, Hermione got out of that one pretty quickly).

I would love to see some more creativity involving this subject in fanfiction. Imagine a plant similar to the one in Jumanji, that shot poisoned barbs from sneaky positions. The possibilities are endless.

What do you think?


** Albus Dumbledore stepped up to the manor house of the Vile Noble, Long Mott...then stopped.

The old Supreme Mugwump might have been getting old and going senile, but he wasn't so stupid as to cross the overgrown garden of a Dark Lord and Master Herbologist while any of the plants in it still lived.

Fortunately, there was a simple solution, if a bit loud; with a wave of his wand, Dumbledore conjured a massive stream of fire from the tip of his wand, before spraying it across the garden...

...And then he promptly dived to the side as some of the vines suddenly tripled, quadrupled, a million-somethinged in size and rocketed towards him! Animated Pharaohsnake, the fire-eating vine! Curses! Curses other than fire!

Dumbledore clambered to his feet, barely ahead of the lunging vines, and swished his wand, lifting a big chunk of dirt out of the ground around him to smother the Pharaohsnake with...only to hastily cast a shield as the chunk of dirt swung around and tried to wallop him instead, being swung around by a tree root rather angry at being unearthed.

Hastily casting a severing charm at the Whacking Willowroot, Dumbledore reclaimed the chunk of dirt, just in time to interpose it between himself and a lunging attack by the Pharaohsnake, before dropping it and letting the vine be crushed under the ton of earth.

Breathing heavily and dusting himself off, Dumbledore rose to his feet and looked around; nothing else in the garden seemed to be attacking at the moment...was that singing?

...Crap! Unearthed Mandragora...but he wasn't dead yet? And the voice sounded very, very deep, almost like a baritone...

Albus shaded his eyes and peered into the distance, towards the manor house's door; there, sitting on top of a potted plant, was Vile Noble Long Mott's vilest creation yet; the gargantuan, baritone-singing, Dark Mandragora.

   :END:
Dumbledore stared at the strange sight of a giant humanoid plant belting out opera, before he remembered exactly what the Dark Mandragora did.

And then he swore, loudly, as several dozen trees, vines, and even the grass below his feet, all previously inanimate, shuddered to life and lunged towards him.

--------------

*One /extremely/ violent session of gardening later...*

Albus Dumbledore lowered his wand and panted heavily, exhausted. Finally, every last tree had been felled, every blade of grass incinerated, every vine tied in knots, and the Dark Mandragora had been gagged using a spell Albus honestly never expected he'd ever need to use outside the bedroom.

But finally, he had done it; Long Mott's garden had been trimmed. Now he could battle the Vile Noble himself...

...After he caught his breath.

   :END:
As Dumbledore continued to gasp for breath, slowly rising to his feet again, he noticed small disturbances in the ground in front of him...no, all around him...no, the entire ex-garden.

Raising his wand again, enough swear words going through his mind to make a Legilmency-using sailor blush, the old man waited...and waited...until the perfectly-harmless bamboo shoots pierced the soil and started rising into the air.

Dumbledore lowered his wand again. Bamboo shoots? Even faster growing than usual, but still. What harm could they possibly-

The old headmaster quickly stepped aside and cast a freezing charm at the bamboo stalks that had just started to pierce through his shoes. They could do that, maybe.

And now the fully grown stalks were browning, apparently starting to die off as fast as they grew. Okay then. Dumbledore raised his wand and cast a severing charm again, to cut his way through the bamboo maze to the manor-

* BAMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

--------------

""Bamboom?" Since when does bamboo explode, Neville?" Harry asked, while they were sitting at a table near Antoine Fortesque's ice cream shop, savouring their respective sundaes.

Neville just shrugged, "It's a type of grass, I figure it should be possible to crossbreed the Punji cultivar with Conflagrass to get something that grows fast and explodes when touched."

Harry nodded, "Alrighty, that makes sense...I dunno how you'd make a Dark Mandragora, though."

Neville shrugged again, before turning to Ron, the third member at their table, "Ron, what about you? What would you do as a Dark Lord?"

Ron scratched at his chin thoughtfully, "Well...I was thinking something with statuary. Like that time, Harry, you said that Dumbledore animated the statues in the fountain at the Ministry? Something like that, an army of stone monsters to guard my evil lair..."

** Because people think of it as just gardening, and think gardening is inherently boring or uninteresting.

Herbology is MUCH more similar to Care of Magical Creatures than to Muggle gardening, and one would extrapolate from its being compulsory that most witches and wizards can expect to need Herbology in their life - while a unicorn is unlikely to wander into your back garden, a very dangerous plant could well grow there, especially as most magical plant varieties seem to do a lot more than have a sweet smell or a nice perennial bloom.

Personally, I have a lot of interest in the potential for sentience or semi-sentience in the plants - I love the Mandrakes and the Venomous Tentacula in the canon, and I've worked on a few world-building details around Herbology. I think it's a very interesting subject, and it's a shame it's overlooked...

But the only people we see interested in Herbology are duffer types. Neville, Sprout, often Hannah Abbott - people don't associate Herbology with impressive wizards or big, exciting magic, and would rather see explosions and jinxes and the like.

** One idea; if there were a fertilization spell and could make plants grow at an accelerated rate, you could throw seeds and transform them into full grown plants. I'm imagining something like Briar Moss from the Circle Opens stories by Tamora Pierce. I considered something like this for my Harry/Neville fic, but ended up going in a different direction.

** I'm all for the main character having it as a hobby, or their extensive Herbology knowledge coming in useful in some situations. However, I don't think it should be their go-to solution for every trouble.

Imagine Harry luring his enemies into a patch of mushrooms which release hallucinogens when stepped on, or sticking a fast-growing seed into a keyhole to break open the lock. To me it would be too much like those stories where the main character has some obscure power and every combat encounter just happens to be conveniently tailored for them to make full use of it.

*** When I think of using Herbology more thouroughly, I imagine something like a Naruto/Harry Potter crossover. I don't know if you have read/watched Naruto, but I'm thinking of having one of the great wizards of HIstory be Hashirama Senju. He would utilize his wood-style techniques to devastating effect as a battle/war wizard.

On the non-crossover front, I'm thinking that Herboogy would be more attuned to assassination. Untraceable poisons, innocuous looking plants attaking you when you turn your back, etc. The story would have to be set around that idea, but it has merit.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

Did you mean his, as in LeadVonE, or did you mean "this"? Because I'm confused if you're referring to a third fic or not, as the last time I read Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, about six months ago, I'm fairly sure I didn't see anything about these plants and fungi.

** You need the right tool for your situation. So how do you get it with a given field of study?

- Wanded spells: you learn the spell once and can cast it at need. That might be appreciable initial prep time (learning the spell), but then you only need a second to ready it.
- Potions: you learn of the potion, learn how to prepare it, discover your need, brew the potion, and apply it. Less initial prep time, but call it an hour to ready it.
- Herbology: you learn of the plant. You discover your need. Now you have to raise the plant and apply it. That could easily be months.

This means it's a better tool for the antagonist than for the protagonist. The antagonist produces the initial action for the protagonist to react to, which affords them months or years of planning. Dark Lord Longbottom anyone?
