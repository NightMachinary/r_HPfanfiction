We all know the terms, Mudblood, Blood traitors ect. I was thinking about terms that the Muggleborn can use against the Purebloods that they can answer back, but was coming up blank.


** A few months ago, I think someone on this sub suggested "cousin-shagger," which made me laugh.

** The fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] has some slurs for Purebloods. The story is set in a topsy-turvy AU in which muggleborns hold political power while the old Pureblood families are repressed. The Purebloods are called "Old-Bloods" (a politically correct term equivalent to 'muggleborn' in canon). The derogatory version is "old fusty" or just "fusty".

** I was thinking of a fic (can't remember have too many) where Tonks and Sirius' mom got into a screaming match. Sirius' mother would call her a blood traitor and Tonks would cal her a hag. That stunned Sirius' mother silent for a few seconds and she called Tonks something else and it went back and forth until Remus or Sirius closed the curtains. You could tell Tonks was having a blast. I was thinking the same thing along the lines of Malfoy calling Hermione a mudblood and Hermione having a verbal response back that would stun him and such. I like cosin-shagger and ink pots and such. Something that would make them think a bit but be hilarious to those around them.
