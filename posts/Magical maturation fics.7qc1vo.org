This was briefly popular as a trope, then disappeared. I think they mostly appeared between GoF and DH, then stopped when DH made no mention of it.

Anyway, I loved this trope of some one-day event which pushed someone's magic over a threshold from child to adult. Often giving someone a new ability. Any recs? I am open to gen, het, and slash. And I prefer Harry-centered (all the ones I've seen have been), but I'd consider others.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** I'm about 40% of the way through, it's a pretty good story. The magical maturation wasn't a very big part, but still a good fic. I'm kind of afraid of who else might get killed off, considering who went first...

** linkffn(4776976) It's about two-thirds Hermione/one-third Harry and has both het and slash pairings. One of the things I love about it is that it's very long but also complete. Lots of intriguing sub-plots, and well-written. It's one that I re-read every year or two and always re-discover something that I'd forgotten.

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter, Heir of Gryffindor by Brent Braten) has Harry going through a magic maturation as a major plot point though he then becomes OP!Harry. Also this fic was written pre HBP so no horcruxes, and some of the characters will seem OOC. The didn't when I read it originally before HBP, but they do when I reread it after so YMMV.

** Linkffn(3163139)

Raspberry Jam by VVC. One of my favourite fics of all time and VVC writes really well in my opinion. It's Draco/Harry slash but the entire fic is about the magical maturation and has new abilities that may or may not happen depending on the power of the wizard. It's exactly what you asked for. :)
