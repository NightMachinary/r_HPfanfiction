*** Well... I think it's those fanfiction get to me. Lily always yell at James for his action to winning her. She doesn't like him so she doesn't care about his feelings. Anyhow I see that way in many ff and it stuck. Also, I don't like that she don't forgive Severus for calling her mudblood (he called her that in the verry embarrased moment for him - created by marauders) but she eventually gave James chance. To bully (her opinion). So no, I don't like her.

***** I don't like her because of ALL the fanfiction I read portay her like that. And in the books/movies she was described like that. But there was very little about her, only her story with Severus and Petunia. And of course with James.

** This fic is Hermione/James, but doesn't picture Lily as a bad person (just not right for James). I don't think a fic with your exact requirements exist, so I figured linkffn(Hero of the Story) would be the closest.

** linkffn(12830596)

I read this because I was curious about the pairing but honestly I didn't like it but that's because I love Lily and James together and Lily's character. You will like this I think, it does a good job of portraying Lily as a flawed older sister to feed the Lily bashing you wanted. For the most part Lily is a nice older sister to Hermione, but there is some Lily bashing about halfway through where I left off, I don't know if it gets worse or what.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
