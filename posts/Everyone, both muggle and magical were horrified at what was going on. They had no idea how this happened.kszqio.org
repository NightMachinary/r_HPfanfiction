The Black Plague had returned.

Hermione was the first to be diagnosed. She knows how it came back but she wasn't telling anyone.

She remembered working in the department of mysteries. She remembered an accident. She remembered waking up in the 14th century. She remembered getting extremely sick before coming back to the 21st century.

She knew she was to blame for the Black Plague returning. She had brought back the disease that killed a third of Europe. Right in to the Covid 19 mess...


** And then they remembered that the Black Plague was caused by bacteria /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis][Yersinia pestis]]/, so it can be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease][treated by antibiotics]]#Treatments). All was well.

Regardless, unless you are making the Black Death a magical disease I sincerely doubt wizards will have a problem with curing it.

  Globally about 600 cases are reported a year. In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru.

which I guess means countries which have problems to have any prevention. And 600 cases worldwide is really low number.

** Although, discarding the easily treatable plague, this time really calls for some humanity-is-dying-from-plague story (the magical version of “The Day of the Triffids”!). The only one I know about is “Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand by sikeus” linkffn(6719282). Awesome setup, but then it drags on for too long, unfortunately.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.
