** I imagine that would be pretty funny. Like Vernon making sure that Harry is training how to fight with Dudley while telling Petunia that the freak is getting beaten up. Or Vernon secretly telling Harry everything he knows about magic and his parents.

** Magical Relations by evansentranced has an original take on the Dursley dynamic, though I wouldn't describe Vernon as "good," per se. It's a long read and very well-written. linkffn(3446796)

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** For what it's worth it only has Vernon because the writer killed Petunia off so it might not be exactly what you want, but I feel that “Proud” (linkffn(11456392)) is a very good take at writing a not-bad-person Vernon.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

** In linkffn(Compound Interest by Cillit Bang Bang), Vernon quickly realizes the pecuniary benefits of having a wizard in the family. I don't remember what Petunia's attitude is.

  Vernon Dursley is an ambitious man. And when he finds a freak at his front door, he opts to see it not as a burden, but as an opportunity. An opportunity that shall provide him with rich rewards in due time.

** It's kinda my head canon that Vernon is mostly feeding off Petunia's antagonism in regards to magic/Harry. Anyway, it's not exactly what you're looking for but I really liked Petunia's Boys. Sorry for not using the bot. My mobile app messes it up.

*** I always felt that too. In the very first chapter vernon thinks that the wizards are weird but it is Petunia who gets extremely angry if someone mentioned her sister.
