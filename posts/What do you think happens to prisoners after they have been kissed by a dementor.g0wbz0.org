One thing I have theorised is that their organs are harvested for potion ingredients maybe? Alternatively, they are killed and disposed off without use of their organs. But then kissing them is ultimately pointless.

But Crouch Jr. is never mentioned again and I always wonder where he's taken to next. Maybe he's thrown in azkaban again? What are your thoughts?


** Kissing them is not pointless bc it destroys the soul.

If you think about what we learn about ghosts (5th or 6th book?) and the scene with Dumbledore at King's Cross in Deathly Hallows it becomes clear that there is some sort of afterlife in the HP universe. The soul of a person passes on.

For somebody who has been kissed that is impossible.

I've read several fanfics where it is stated that being kissed is worse than death and based upon the above I am inclined to agree.

*** That's so sad, now I regret making this post. But it also brings up another question. Theoretically, if a person discovers a way to destroy a dementor, can they 'release' the souls, and then they can move on in the afterlife?

**** Souls are said to be indestructible, which is one of the reasons a Horcrux is so resilient. Only serious dark magic that will destroy anything it touches will destroy one, and that's the case only because the object itself is destroyed. That's the reason for the shriek that occurs when one is banished - the soul fragment is loosened from the object and pulled into the afterlife. You can seriously maim and change a soul, but you can never, ever destroy it.

Dementors create themselves from misery, and a soul is said to be an infinite source of life and energy, which they subsist on by turning it into misery and depression. I'd say the dementor can't destroy a soul, but it can hold it and torture it for as long as it exists. It could be that dementors become stronger the more souls they contain, and that their aura is actually the aura of the souls that are inside them, drained of all happiness and infused with so much misery and fear that it radiates outwards in a tangible effect.

They will also fade away eventually if starved, which I imagine is when the souls inside them have been fully drained of happiness and love, and they essentially cannot sustain the energetic reaction of turning good to bad, and eventually lose their grip on the contained souls, which loosen from them and fade away into whereever souls go when they die. And when the last soul is gone, the dementor quickly collapses in on itself as there is no more energy to sustain it.

I honestly have no idea. I suspect that it's more of a lingering than a release--perhaps they'll be able to go to limbo where what's left of Voldemort's soul lingers, but that'd be the extent of it.

That, my friend, is a fanfic prompt in its own right.

It's not just fanfics. Harry reflects that this fate is worse than death when it happens to Barty Crouch Jr.

**** Remus says in book 3 that it is in fact considered a fate worse than death in the wizarding world, so it's a straight up fact for them. No wonder they used it to frighten Sirius.

***** I also read in a fanfic where Harry considers it a really harsh punishment for the relatives: While the person themselves won't know or feel anything, somewhere in Azkaban there is a shell , a living breathing body and knowing that it exists must be torture to their loved ones.

With death you would have closure, so it is a fate worse than death in more ways than one.

** There's a oneshot out there that I can't recall the name of - probably I should make a post about it.

Anyway: There's a special wing in St. Mungo's where the people who are kissed go... and Harry visits Sirius there. It chronicles Sirius slowly turning into a dementor

** I don't think that they die after the kiss - they're just vegetables. I'd think that they would stay in Azkaban (wizarding mercy and logic at its finest) or as someone else mentioned, at St mungos

However! Linkffn(The Second String) might interest you! It's long, yes, but has some very intruiging theory on dementor kisses, which is the premise of the fic. And it is an overall amazing fic.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

*** Maybe , or maybe not. I've seen fictions where losing your soul basically does that, but it could also be that it effectively renders your body comatose. Could also be like world of darkness where losing your soul leads to severe depression initially, and eventually reduces you to a catatonic state.
