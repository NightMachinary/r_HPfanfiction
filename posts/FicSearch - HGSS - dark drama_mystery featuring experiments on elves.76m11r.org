Hi, I've read a fic (not on ffn or aoo). It is HGSS but no romance (I think marriage law or something similar). I remember following:

- Hermione and Snape have met at the beginning at some conference about decreasing wizarding population/reproduction

- Hermione works for ministry and has a terrible boss. I think that at some point they are trying to steal something from his office

- There are two endings - good one and bad one

- There is an area in London (old factory or hospital or something) and the main villain is doing there some experiments on elves. I think they had some problem of getting out of this place..

- Hermione kept evidence in her computer and contraception in her shampoo? bottle. But the ministry were monitoring them..

It was long, dark, mysterious, dramatic and very well written.. I think I've read it on authors private webpage..

Does it sound familiar?

Thanks!

/edit: formatting


** It sounds very familiar - not al the aspects of it, but some.

linkao3(The Post-Burrow World by CeleryThesis) is not a Marriage Law fic, but it does contain the house-elf experiments, the terrible boss, the two endings (actually two entire timelines, I have no idea how CT managed it, she's a fucking genius), and the concerns about wizarding population, as well as contraceptive related shenanigans. Iirc, Hermione and Snape get arrested for teaching a Sex Ed class at Hogwarts, complete with banana.

If someone else comes up with a fic that matches the description, I'd be interested in reading it as well.

*** No, this one is not it, but it looks good, so I will read it anyway :).. I know someone has recommended it on DLP, but I cannot find the original post/thread.. I hope I'm not mixing more fics into one here..
