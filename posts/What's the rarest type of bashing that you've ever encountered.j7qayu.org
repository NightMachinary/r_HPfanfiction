You know how you have your standard Dumbledore!bashing, Hermione!Bashing, and weasley!Bashing?

What's the most odd character that you've seen get bashed?

For me, it was that one time where I read a Hagrid!bashing story

EDIT: Ive also seen Mcgonagall, sprout, and flitwick bashing

Doing Death Eater things for Voldemort so regulary that Dumbledore thought Voldemort has sent him as a message boy when he deflected? Being a DE means he killed people. He is literally a racist murderer. The only reason he stopped being a racist murderer wasn't because he suddenly thought it was wrong but because he had an obsession with a woman that never loved him.

And don't get me started on the things he did as a teacher. Thanks to Alan Rickman who played "just" a bad teacher people tend to forget that book Snape was a major bully who disencouraged and mocked a smart and hard working student, singled out another 11 year old for the sins of his father, treated a whole house like shit because his rivals/bullies where in said house and that was only in the first lesson.

He was a hero. He saved the wizarding world - he even saved Harry multiple times - but he was not a good human being.

Most common occurrence of Luna in fanfic I've seen:

Omniscient Super-Prophet. Everything she says and does is so wise and true and ultimately she is right. So no lovable quirky misfit who has troubles recognizing social cues but rather whimsy prophet who knows it all and just has fun with it / is the only one to see the truth

Oversexualized yet cold nympho. I don't know why but people really love portraying Luna as this nymphomaniac or overly sexual being that has a weird distant stance on sex for a teen. It's downright disgusting most of the time

Sometimes, the fic isn't even labelled as cracky or anything, and I'll find Luna randomly spewing some fourth-wall shit, or mutter future predictions or something. That's an /ugh/ for me. I close that shit immediately.

If you want a genuine seer, make Trelawney actually worth writing about, or introduce someone new. People get too easily derailed when they try to combine:

/Seer/ + /I-say-random-shit/ into one Luna-sized package. No moderation.

If anything, its easier to write that kind of Luna. Makes me wonder just how much effort people put into writing a normie Luna. Must be of it. tremendous, from the looks of it. Maybe I'll post a request thread and see what pops up.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

Also frequent is him actively abetting or even committing sexual assault against students. I've seen a fair number of fics in which girls in Slytherin either need to be too ugly to be considered or powerful enough personally or politically to be safe, otherwise the upper-year Slytherin boys abuse whatever girls they feel like. It's not just clumsy writing, but it's disrespectful to victims of actual sexual assault/abuse by using it for cheap drama and evil points.

The sacrifices he makes are out of friendly love, but being the socially awkward guy he is, he doesn't give a shit about Harry and puts his hatred for James above Lily's hatred for him.
