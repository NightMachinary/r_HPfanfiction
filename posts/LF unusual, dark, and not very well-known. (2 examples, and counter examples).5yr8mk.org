Examples: Without Thorn the Rose. A very weird story about Harry growing up in the island of Azkaban with his father, who is the warden (or some such). I don't think I've read anything akin to it.

Unbecoming. Okay, so this story is kind of well known /now/, but I started reading it at chapter 3ish, and it was definitely a very obscure weird creature then. This is again a fem!harry like no other, and while the character is very ooc, the manor and the fights and the perversion is quite decently conveyed.

Counter-examples.

1) Circular Reasoning. Amazing, but pretty much canonical for HP fanfic.

2) Princes of the Blacks. Have read as much as I wanted to.

3) Wordhammer's stuff. Have read.


** Linkffn(Wither by Concept101) is pretty dark. Its a oneshot, but its completely unlike his usual style and took me a bit by surprise.

  "A pair of familiar eyes stared widely back at him. And it was at that moment, Harry finally realised, that he had never been free." A dark spin on the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, 'Nineteen Years Later'. One Shot! Complete!
