In the UK there's a radio show called The News Quiz, and one regular slot is where each panellist reads out an amusing cutting from a newspaper. Usually a misspelling or an unintentional meaning. [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-news-quiz/press-cuttings/]] has a good list. For instance, " Police reveal that a woman arrested for shoplifting had a whole salami in her knickers. When asked why, she said it was because she was missing her Italian boyfriend. *(Reuters via The Manchester Evenings News)* "

​

So what are the best examples you've seen in fanfics. I'm asking because I found this one in an otherwise awful story I don't even know why I was reading:

​

"Ron turned even brighter red and Hermione smiled when she saw a bugle at his trousers. "

​

** -"Are you trying to call the cavalry or are you just happy to see me?" she said with a wink.

-"RETREAAAAT! RETREAAAT!" Ron cried running away.

Young men everywhere placed their right hands over their hearts in commiseration as the the virginal roar of embarrassment reverberated through the halls.

-----------------------------------------

Ahah, couldn't help myself.

I'm sure I must have seen some funny ones in my readings but I've never noted them down. I'll be on the lookout in future.

And after all, non-betaed-post shaming is the only kind of shaming I would endorse... I can't help but feel it is sorely needed in the fanfiction community :D.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5322714/1/My-Immortal][My Immortal]] linkffn(5322714), of course, is (in)famous for this. The most well-known example from it is probably "And Loopin was masticating to it!"

  My Immortal is the most famous, notoriously bad fan fiction ever written. Based very loosely in the Harry Potter universe and featuring the blatant Mary-Sue protagonist Ebony. Almost everyone on the internet knows about this story. With Key Notes. RR!

** "By the time he got up and dressed Dean, Seamus, and Neville were already downstairs in the Great Hall" -Vox Corporis, chapter 30-

How fragile is the written word... one, too few, or one too many that's all it takes...

I'll just leave that here.
