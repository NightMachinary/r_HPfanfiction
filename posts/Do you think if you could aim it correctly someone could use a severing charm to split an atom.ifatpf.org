I was recently reading a comic (DC) and it had Superman cutting an atom using wonder woman's sword and I was wondering if a wizard could do the same with a cutting/severing/splitting charm if properly focused on an atom.


** I wouldn't think so as Wonder Womans sword can cut through anything, whereas a severing charm can't. To metaphor a severing charm is to WW sword as a butter knife is to a Fillet knife(?)

*** I was just envisioning someone making a spell designed for that task and then firing it at the ground in front of Voldemort's army in the final battle Just instant annihilation in one fell swoop.

**** I mean of it was a spell created specifically for that task then maybe. But a standard severing charm probably wouldn't work by itself

**** I don't think it is a very good idea to mix Magic with Science, since Science is logic while Magic is not. Since the magic of HP is conceptual, it is possible (dare I say, probable?) that a spell designed to "split" an atom would do that, without any other reaction (like water would turn into oxygen and hydrogen, but no explosion). To have an explosion, a wizard need to create a spell that make things explode.

But hey, it's fanfictions and "Mc applied science to magic and easily dealt with the problem" can make a nice crack fic (or a muggle wanking one but that's another story).

** Magic doesn't acknowledge the existence of atoms. It runs on superficial similarities and metaphor.

Think of what Aristotle would consider the word "sever" meant. It can cut strings, or arms, but probably not metal, and definitely not atoms.

** HPMOR is full of stuff along those lines. It works pretty well some of the time, badly some of the time, and the climactic scene is preposterous but suspenseful enough that it's possible to forgive the bogosity if you're inclined to like the story enough to get that far (not everyone is).

** My thoughts are whichever spell is used it would need a Dumbledore level of skill, precision and power and he definitely wouldn't cast it

** Atoms are a lot smaller than you think they are. They're mostly empty space. That being said, if you /could/, it wouldn't do much. Nuclear blasts are powerful, yes, but we're talking a lot more than an atom being split in those cases.

I do remember one fic where the philosopher's gold was radioactive due to the whole "lead to gold" thing spitting off odd isotopes and such. Everyone thought it was cursed, but since wizards are resilient beyond belief all the damage was short-term or healable. I think harry and Hermione actually figured it out at some point.
