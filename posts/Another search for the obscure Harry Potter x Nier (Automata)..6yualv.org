I just got through playing this game and I'm looking for more in every direction. Nier fanfiction, crossovers, I don't care.

But I have yet to find a HP crossover with Nier that is in any way decent to read.


** Strange request, but then again: Said game is illogical, too :( (Androids fighting with SWORDS? Why? Have they forgotten how to make guns? Rocket-Launchers? Or even grenades?)

Still, I have looked (just for fun an giggles) and I haven't found any - must be because the game is fairly new and/or it's incompatible with HP?

*** My only idea was some sort of immortal!Harry thing where he just muses over the fate of the world until one of those Androids stumbles over him, or something.... I dunno.

And to be fair, they do have their heat-seeker-missile, gatling gun, laser shooting pods with them. Swords are for stylepoints, tho.

**** spoilers:

Well, Emil is in automata which is thousands of years after the original and he could cast magicish.

You could have a similar use for Harry. MoD turned into a weapon for project gestalt and helped defend against the machines

*** It's a Platinum Games game. They have a poor track with logic, but their games are still awesome.
