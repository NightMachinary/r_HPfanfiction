Read something like this a while ago, and I like the concept.

Harry traveled dimensions to a place with Neville as the Boy Who Lived, so that dimension's Harry is a spoiled idiot that never befriended Ron or Hermione. Hermione doesn't even have friends.

Harry has to win their trust from 0, etc.

Anything like that would be appreciated


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): He, Remus, and another guy travelled to this new world, where there was no prophecy, James and Lily were alive, he and Ron were fighting over Cho, Hermione was nowhere to be found, and Ginny ended up in Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Initially, he didn't want to go back, but he still picked a fight with the local Voldemort, under abysmal operational security. [[/spoiler][Voldemort made a key breakthrough later and royally fucked them over, so Harry had no choice but to limp back to his home world. But he managed to bring along his sister from the other dimension.]]

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

** Linkffn(5309378) Trio fic, but has some surprisingly nice moments. Harry travels with Ron and Hermione to another dimension but they do initially face difficulties due to all three being completely unlike their alternate selves .

Linkffn(4843238) Ron travels to an alternate dimension in this story and his friends both despise him due to his alternate self.

Linkffn(2681873) Harry trevels to a dimension where he died as a baby. One difference is Ginny's character and he works hard to get her to open up to him.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
