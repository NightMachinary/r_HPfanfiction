Or FanFiction in general.

For me, I read it because I love the world of the books but want more and because FanFiction has a much lower investment on my part.


** Cheaper than books.

** Have been doing for about 15 years now. Part habit, part comfort, part fascinating to see how things grow and evolve off each other. I read real, published lit as well, if that makes a difference... I majored in English. I just love dark, twisty villains, and books published with those sorts of characters have to have a Big Point... think Clockwork Orange, Crime & Punishment, etc. Fantastic but consuming, I like to read realistic Slytherin stories where I don't have to invest the same way I do in a novel but can still dip my toes into a familiar dark psyche from a new perspective.

** For the crackfics. The insanity. The things that just make me laugh because something that happened is so dang stupid that I can't help to.

Of course, I do like my fair share of graphic descriptions of things I shall not mention on reddit, such as in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16308311/chapters/38146175][New Beginnings]].\\
It hasn't been updated in a few years so I think it might be abandoned?

** Reading original stories lets you /broaden/ your scope of reading, while reading more books in the same world, which basically means fanfiction, lets you dig /deeper/ and explore the characters and plot elements in more detail. Both have value.

And then there are fanfics that have so many original elements that they broaden your horizons too.

** Fun

I think theres so many places you can go with the HP world. I personally love Marauder era and Black family stories. They were barely touched in the books. And it's fascinating!! A werewolf, a traitor, a disown aristocrat and a tortured father. There is SO MUCH you can do with each one of those! And the Black Family is brilliant. Just so much politics.

It's a tone that I love to read about. The right balance of humour and heartbreak.

** I love the premise of the Harry Potter canon.

However, when I read the series or any series, I can't help, but imagine my own endings, pairings, and twists from canon. It started when I wanted H/Hr as the main pairing as I never really liked Ron/Hermione, and I stumbled upon [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I fell down the rabbit hole.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] was my first fan fiction I ever read. I love how imaginative people can be and have similar ideas to my own, and when they both semantically and syntactically deliver the material well (my standards aren't that high because I just want the writing to have little to no grammatical errors), I can go on reading it for an entire day when I don't have work.

This is almost exactly my start as well. I got more invested when I helped a few friends as an editor/ beta reader around 2008-2012.

Now I liken it to a sandbox that I just want to see all the variations of, background characters getting their chance, things I disliked about the plot or the universe can be tweaked to fit.

I also should add I like the variety. Sometimes I want a series story, sometimes a power fantasy and sometimes a hilarious crack fic.

**** I wanted to add that Harry to the TVTropes entry for "Black Hole Sue", but you're not supposed to add examples to that page.

I guess I can see how people might like it if they sympathised more than I do with Harry's grievances like being left with the Dursleys. Without the years of emotional abuse, which didn't happen in this story, his level of anger about it seemed far overblown to me.

** I loved the books when I was a child.

I started reading Harry Potter fanfic after a re-read of the books, with a tiny amount of writing practice, and I just started noticing stuff where "if I was writing this book with myself as the target audience, I would have done this so much differently". That made me seek out fanfics with those differences in their premise.

** Started because canon Harry was a very lazy protagonist and because Harmony sunk.

So my first entry to fanfic were trash indy!harry. H/hr fics. I didn't know any better then.

** I have a huge imagination and so when I get into a fandom (I'm known for hyperfocus) I can see all these side stories and what if's. Rather than discussing with ppl it's fun also to read stories that explore that.

Also I fall in love with characters and just want to see them in a bunch more stories sometimes rather than read other stories where I have to learn new characters

Sometimes I get in a certain mood like how does one deal with PTSD or something and want to read about a character I already know and like doing it

There were so many things we didn't get enough of in the HP books like the marauders for example that I have to get from fanfiction

I HATE the epilogue
