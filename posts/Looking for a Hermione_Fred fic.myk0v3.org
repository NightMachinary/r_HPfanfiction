:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Fred pranks Hermione by telling everyone that they're together but she plays along with it. It's a whole back and forth thing where they keep one upping each other. I can't remember much of it but I know that she kisses George at some point accidentally.

Can't find it anywhere for some reason, does anyone know it?

  Fred accidentally starts rumors that he's with Hermione, and encourages them for a laugh. When she find out, she's furious. Now the two of them are fighting to outembarrass and annoy one another... but they're also fighting their feelings for each other.
