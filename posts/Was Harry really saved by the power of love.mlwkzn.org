I mean, I don't think that Lily is the only woman to give up her life for her child... but yet Harry's the only person that survived the killing curse - he's literally famous for it. Are we saying that Lily loves Harry more than anyone else can love each other?


** Accepting your death is important. Lily told Voldemort to kill her instead of Harry. Harry willingly walked into the forest and accepted the fact that he had to "die".

From what I understand, this is why Dumbledore didn't tell Harry about the possibility of him surviving. He had to /willingly/ sacrifice himself to give the same protection to everyone else.

Blood rituals is fanon. There's no wand waving, no runes and no special Knockturn Alley books for this.

*** Yes! And as nice as the concept of rituals is, it isn't very realistic, I suppose. And it makes a lot of sense when you put it like that...

** No - it's about the sacrifice and the choice she had. Other parents were not offered the option to step aside and survive. Because Snape had asked Voldemort to spare Lily, he offered her to step aside and thus survive.

** Yes and no.

Dumbledore isn't being literal when he says things like love and music are magical. He speaking about the feeling and what you're willing to do behind those feelings. In the figurative sense, yes, Lily's (and Narcissa's) ability to love saved Harry.

In the literal sense, no. Lily was given a choice to step aside unlike every other parent who died for their child. See: James.

** I like the interpretation that Dumbledore was speaking way too far around Harry with the "power of love" talk. The "power of love" is that people will sacrifice themselves for other people and will rely on one another, which Voldemort, having ruled strictly through fear, didn't completely understand. Lily didn't save Harry because she loved him, she designed a protection ritual capable of deflecting the Killing Curse because she loved him, even though the ritual demanded her death to function.

*** Good thinking, I like to think that Harry was always meant to be the master of death and death protected him from Voldemort until he could actually collect all the hallows. And the ritual thing is a very interesting concept: how far did Lily delve into the magics? What ritual did she even cast?

**** There are multiple ways to go with it. There's also the guest rights angle (being told the secret counts as a guest invitation, and "take me instead" operated enough as a deal to count). Or the "Voldemort thought using the prophecy child to make a horcrux would be a lark and completely destabilized his soul" angle. The investigators just noticed powerful death magic residue, and thought horses, not zebras. Or my own oddball prompt, "Voldemort made a deal with the basilisk to produce a clutch of hybrid human/basilisks, on the condition that he swear an oath to not harm the children. One girl had no basilisk traits beyond the green eyes and crest-red hair, so he memory charmed a random family to take her."

** He's the only person /known/ to have survived the killing curse. It's entirely possible there were others who no one ever heard of outside their small village. Or no one realised that's what happened, since maybe they were unconscious at the time and then the curse rebounded, so they woke up next to a dead body.

And then of course there's the fact that there are tons of other ways to kill someone with magic, whereas the killing curse is difficult and frowned upon. Perhaps on many of the other occasions the protection was given, the attacker used a different spell.

** I don't think so. Beside the point you made, it's a rather lame excuse. I personally like to think that Harry is kind of Death's champion. Voldemort created several horcruxes, so Death didn't let him die so he could kill Voldie.

*** I really like that idea! I like to think that Harry masters Death in DH and, because Death is timeless, Death always knew that it was going to be mastered by Harry and prevented Voldemort from killing him, that's how he survived that night... kind of confusing paradox but it made sense in my mind... oops...

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Swords and Sorcery]] has quite a clever explanation for it in a recent chapter, but you'll need to wait for the site to come back up before you can read it.

It ties into the fact that as the Secret Keeper, Wormtail became in a sense the Potters' doorman, meaning that Voldemort was an officially invited guest, thus incurring magical backlash by attacking the host; plus, when Lily begged him to take her instead of Harry, that was sort of a negotiation between the guest and the host, and he then proceeded to /accept her deal/ by killing her.

** I fancy the explanation that there is a magic to softer concepts, such as love, sacrifice and music etc, that magic isn't limited to some latin sounding words with a corresponding wand movement.

Also, Dumbledore's explanation is a simplified version of what he theorised to have happened, but it isn't necessarily the definitive truth, and I feel that the narrative is all the stronger when it leaves what really happened half a mystery.

** "love" is a euphemism for experimental sacrificial blood magic. Lily's love saved Harry, but then she bought the farm. Strictly speaking, no love or farms were directly involved.

**** Someone has to be the first one to cast any given spell. And magic that requires a willing human sacrifice for every attempted casting, successful or not, would be rather hard to get right.
