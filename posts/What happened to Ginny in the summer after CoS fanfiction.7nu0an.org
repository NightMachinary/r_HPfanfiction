Hi, i'm searching for a fanfiction that has multiple chapters and describes what happened without going out of canon (not that i don't like those stories i just want to know what happened to Ginny without harry in that summer that they went t visit bill). So as you can see i really want to know what Ginny went through to become stronger after the experience. ~From your local friendly Hufflepuff


** Weasleys won 700 Galleons after that school year. Although they spent most of that on a vacation to Egypt, I couldn't help to think they also had spent some of that on a healer for Ginny. The trip to Egypt could be part of her healing too. There might be advanced magic there that dealt with possessions.

I don't think this aspect of canon elements has ever been explored in fics, despite me reading lots of Ginny related ones. Most readers just take what Ron said about that summer for granted and 100% true, even though Ron was a thick-headed 13 years old boy who couldn't possibly be privy to all his family's secrets.

*** Also, consider that Bill is Ginny's favorite brother, and a certified curse-breaker, so he probably helped her get past it.

** Linkffn(Ginny Chronicles Part 2: The Lioness Within)

It's not complete, but the chapters there cover pretty much the whole summer and trip to Egypt. The author also has a part 1 which goes through Ginny's first year. I'd definitely recommend both stories.

  How does Ginny evolve from the girl who sticks her elbow into a butter dish into a woman who leads the DA in a secret underground rebellion? The Lioness Within will take Ginny through her second year as a student. She will learn to face the impact of Tom's possession and find a new internal strength.

** Well, in Cursed Child, Ginny mentions that Harry really helped her by just playing gobstones (or something) with her after it happened. Obviously that won't cure her, but probably helped with the recovery.

Somewhat on a tangent, but the fact that we don't really get anything more that a quick allusion to what Ginny dealt with post-CoS kind of makes me angry that Rowling wrote it all from Harry's limited POV. Rowling did this a lot; hinting at a really interesting separate story and then just not doing anything with it because it isn't Harry's POV or Harry just doesn't care. I'm torn between thinking this shows how great a writer she was and that she wasn't as good as she could've been.

Basically, Rowling is saying "yeah, that is a really interesting story to tell about a character we've all connected with, but I'll never write it. Instead here's CC and Fantastic Beasts.

*** I will disagree here with the second part of the post. I cannot imagine HP written with multiple POVs. It would be so long. And there always will be stuff that just has to be omitted. Also those 'blank spaces' just create a perfect opportunities for fanfiction.

This is just my preference, but I mostly prefer single POV fanfics/books. I like the 'unknown' it creates. It leaves the space for the readers imagination. I just don't need to know everything.

**** I agree. I'm not necessarily saying the book should've been multiple POV. I guess I would've preferred a more aware Harry or scenes that allowed those interesting side stories to be expanded upon. In Ginny's case, it would've been nice to actually show a conversation (perhaps after the battle) between her and Harry where it sorta all comes out, her experiences after CoS, her thoughts about trying to get over him, and her experiences at school while he was gone.

Perhaps my issue is that Rowling has explored her world beyond the books but seems to be against actually exploring her secondary characters from the series through fictional writing. I feel that if you are going to establish that very interesting things were happening to other characters during the books, and you are continuing the write about this world, it might be worthwhile to actually explore these stories. Obviously she is under no obligation to do so, but it's my personal preference.

And I cede that keeping things a mystery is great for fanfic, but I wouldn't mind some more canon.

***** I understand that. I can imagine a book full of those little stories that couldn't fit in canon. It could be fun.

But I don't feel so strongly about it as you do. I don't know why. It took me a really long time to read Cursed Child. I don't reread canon books anymore. It has been over 10 years since DH came out and I just have feeling the series ended there and then. 10 years ago, I would love explanation about what happen to Ginny after CoS, or how DA dealt with department of mysteries consequences. Snape's return to DE in GoF. Year 7 would be awsome too. Even Year 8... But now it just feels like a closed chapter. So I guess I just don't need Rowling to come back to it. Personal preference :-)

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

** What probably happened was that, once Molly was certain there were no permanent physical or mental side effects from the possession, she begun a daily litany of nagging, recrimination, guilt-inducing rants, reminders to "be careful" and disappointed looks.

After a few weeks of this, Ginny decided that being possessed by Voldemort wasn't really that bad.

That's when she got over it.
