That is a story that hasn't straight up gone in to the realm of "not even Harry Potter anymore", but neither is it slumming in "boring canon rehash"

Examples: blindness, again and again, Harry Crow (cringes)


** My rec has to be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). It really captures JKR's whimsical tone and magical setting, with a largely different plot and characterization. You really should read this

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

*** eh, I'm sort of mixed on this - while it's certainly well written, and does capture the field of a large magical world, it doesn't do a good job of making the reader a part of it. it feels like the author is just making stuff up as they go along, and as the user there's no real way to anticipate anything that happens.

like, in my opinion, the best stories are the ones that establish the rules and mechanics early on, and then use them in interesting and creative ways later. untitled tome just feels like it just invents new things just moments before it uses them - I know it's not the most accurate description for it, but it has a sort of consistent deus ex machina feel to it.

** Hmm that's a good question, but I would think that it is very subjective which feels like it has a "feels like canon"-vibe while also deviating in some way.

*** Welp for me it's: if Harry is drastically more powerful than canon but still ends up being used in a resurrection ritual at the end of book four= bad.

If Voldemort's horcruxes are completely different objects that they were in canon = also bad.

** On the subject of Harry Crow (may it be purged from the internet) I actually found a 'Harry raised by Goblins' story that was quite good. The first half where he grows up with the goblins is every interesting and well fleshed out, and when he goes to Hogwarts the tone changes slightly and the fic captures the whimsy and wonder of the magical world in a manner reminiscent (but less serious even) than that of the first books.

linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)

It's written by the same guy who wrote the 'Lessons with Hagrid' story about Hagrid being the other Occlumens in the castle strong enough to keep Voldemort out, so you know it's gonna be good.
