** [[https://www.nhsborders.scot.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/our-services/general-services/underage-sexual-activity-interagency-guidance/sexual-activity-and-the-under-sixteens/][According to the NHS, between a third and half of all teenagers in the UK have sexual intercourse before they turn 16]]. So, yes, 14 year olds having sex isn't exactly abnormal in the UK.

Whether characters are having sex at 14 or why that is important for a story is another question.

*** I wonder how this stat would change if you ONLY sampled kids in boarding schools. Figuring out a way to be alone with your SO in a normal school/home situation (especially before you drive for non_city folks) is something of a challenge depending on your parents.

Living in a very sketchily supervised ginormous (magical) castle for 10 months a year with your SO has to be an entirely different game. And the maturity difference between 14 and 16 greatly depends on the people involved. AND the majority of fics write these 14 year olds as super mature.

For my part I'm older, and I don't have any particular fascination with young girls, so I tend to picture 14/16/18 year olds as the same thing. As for the OP... if it bothers you, don't read those stories. FF and AO3 are pretty good at telling you in advance I think.

** most of those are written by hormonal teenagers who are at that age group and want to write about people their age doing sexual things that they themselves are curious about. Also, it isnt really all that uncommon for actual 14 year olds to become sexually active around that age. As an adult, is it disturbing to think about? yes. does that change the fact that it happens? not at all.

** Well it might not be normal, but it definitely happens. There are plenty of stories on Reddit here about 14/15 year old teen moms and shit. It's a thing that DOES happen. And I think there's value in telling stories about those experiences. Just, you know, you don't need to go into the nitty gritty details of the actual acts and shit. Which is where fanfiction gets weird as hell. If the actual story focus was the pregnancy and the difficulties...but fanfic authors seem to really want to focus on the sex, which is weird as hell.

*** Exactly. Not all of us were late bloomers. None of my friends managed to hold onto their v-cards through high school. I think it's bizarre to imagine a bunch of teens at a poorly supervised boarding school NOT going at it most of the time.

**** And some of us who were late bloomers believe(d) that we were abnormal or deficient. From that standpoint, a main reason for a teenage character not to be having sex in a story would be to emphasize what an undesirable reject that character is (or believes themself to be).

** Aside from what's been mentioned already:

1. These people can do magic. They literally have inborn superpowers, well before the age where they're mature enough to handle them. What do you think that would do to your inhibitions? I know what it would do to mine.Rowling consciously avoided some of the implications of that, particularly the sex-related ones, because she's grossed out by the idea too, and has specifically said that (and I paraphrase) the main thing she objects to regarding fanfic is the underage sex. (Are you Rowling, incidentally? heh)
2. People in general overvalue sex, wish they had more of it, and wish they'd had more of it in the past, such as when they were teenagers (if they aren't any longer). Fanfic writers can do it vicariously by having their favorite characters get it on as soon and as much as possible instead.
3. I think it's quite impossible to be creepy to a person who does not exist in our reality. No matter how much lust they trigger in the real world, Harry and co. are never going to feel the slightest effect from any of it.

** Please stop reading things you object to and then complaining about them. It's like a guy who goes to a doctor and asks for help fixing the fact that punching himself in the nose hurts. You knew (or should have known) those fics wouldn't be to your liking, and you read them anyway. Whose fault other than your own could it be when they disgust you?

**** So the correct post title would be more like "please warn readers when you're going to write 14 year olds having sex." People will write what you ask them not to out of spite, but everyone is for more thorough warnings.

** Unfortunately, fanfiction culture these days has swung way, way in favor of encouraging people to write whatever they want, no matter how degenerate it might be. AO3 practically encourages it, and [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] will downvote you into oblivion for suggesting that any story, topic, or depravity isn't worthy of unconditional praise.

** Because teens write fanfiction too, and particularly this kind. (Guilty as charged.) And many adult writers wish to revisit these days too. (Again, guilty...) I understand your position but it is what it is, people turn to FF to let out their emotions and this is an emotion.
