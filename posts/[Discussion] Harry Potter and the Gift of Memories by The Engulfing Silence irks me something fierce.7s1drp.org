I was just reading through, and I couldn't help being frustrated by the story. From what I saw, the writing is technically proficient, but it's horribly lacking in other ways.

Harry starts off as a 10, nearly 11 year old in this story. Apparently, he nearly has a six-pack, has martial arts training and can use his magic, and by virtue of his eidetic memory, is something of a genius. That's fine. I read stories about martial/magic arts child prodigies all the time. He also seems to be mildly sociopathic, courtesy of the Dursleys before he learned how to use magic and threatened them. Also fine.

But what I can't stand is how he acts. Harry reads like an edgy teenager, left to stew in his own agony for a couple of years, not like a serious, slightly disturbed child prodigy. The choice to mention his physique is unnecessary and disturbing. Mentioning that he is the top student (of a primary school) and that he could probably pass secondary school right then with top marks sounds like edgy teenager showboating. His relationship with Lisa (who is not Lisa Turpin, is probably a Muggle based on what I read up to, and is about the same age as Harry) seems like a bf/gf relationship between at least teenagers, instead of a normal (or a bit closer) friendship. He walks her back home, and in a later chapter, spends time with her in a way more synonymous with being in a relationship than with two childhood friends who haven't seen each other in half a year.

I understand that Harry's supposed to act beyond his years. Given his background, Harry should read like the less sociopathic second coming of Tom Riddle, or as an overly serious child. He remembers everything, but since he apparently isn't horrifically traumatised by it all, he's either still a child in mentality, unable to comprehend some of the things he's witnessed, or he's been forced to grow up. But he's neither of those things. He is just merely edgy teenager.

And the little flashbacks at the beginning of chapters! I don't want to read about an edgy boy trying to get martial arts training. I died a little inside each time. Then he acts as a verbose know-it-all in chapter seven, from when he tries to do some investing to when he talks to Andromeda about newspapers libelling him.

And the worldbuilding! Awareness of his magical core causes Ollivander to have to make Harry his own custom special wand! Ancient and Noble Houses are the Founding Five, which the Potters just happen to be! It takes all that is magical and destroys it. There's nothing wondrous about the world in this fic.

I didn't make it to even halfway. I've read properly up to about chapter 8, skimmed to maybe chapter 13, and skipped to chapter 22 to see whether the fic gets better (it didn't, that was the chapter with Lisa).

I feel like this description could roughly apply to a couple of thousand fics on FFN.

*** I don't really mind that. As I wrote, I've read many stories with such prodigies. At this point, given proper portrayal, they often come off as endearing, even cute. Of course, this fic doesn't portray Harry that way.

***** I've already read those fics. I was simply bored and picked randomly from my to-read list. The premise sounded palatable, and I thought I'd take a chance. It just got disturbing and was a failure too fast. At this point, I'd say I'm at stage III or even stage IV, having read almost all of the well-known good fics that I search around for lesser known fics and stumble with fair frequency across mediocre or downright terrible fics.

****** That was when I started branching into crossovers and other fandoms entirely. I've been crushing Naruto fanfics the last 6-7 months.

No better feeling than when you find a fandom with it's own share of gems waiting to be read.

Side note: try going through the DLP almost recommended if you're truly out of fics. They're not bad.

***** Does /Untitled Tome/ get a central conflict? I read maybe fifteen chapters (maybe three chapters after Harry joins a dueling team), and while there were allusions to conflicts in the world, it didn't look like Harry would get involved in them before graduation. Which seemed like it would be around chapter 220, barring major time skips.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

** I've skimmed all the stories in this universe so far. With all the over the top, ridiculous things that happen in this, it would've been a very fun story if the author had the slightest hint of self-awareness. A tiny infusion of crack and/or self-mockery would've made this a SoTerribleIt'sAwesome!fic. Instead, the author treats it likes he's writing encyclopedia Britannica. So on top of the all the WTF happenings, the writing is actually dry (though technically competent), as if the author is writing a Jesus biography that has to maintain a somber tone throughout.
