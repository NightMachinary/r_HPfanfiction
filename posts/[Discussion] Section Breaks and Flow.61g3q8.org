Happy Weekend!

Something I've noticed with far more frequency in fan fiction than other fiction is section breaks. The scene ends and the author puts a horizontal rule or some other combination or tildes and hyphens to indicate an abrupt cutoff.

For example, the Firebird trilogy. There are constant scene changes marked by repeating the story's name (as if we forgot).

There is also a high quantity in the fandom of "summary" stories. Stories that need to cover a certain amount of ground before the meet the main story, like The Changeling or even Sisyphus, or others that start as canon rehashes. They briefly describe a divergence from canon, then cut to the next.

Now contrast this with JKR's writing. Perhaps the entirety of Philosopher's Stone, there are +no+ 42 (edit: hmm I never noticed any. Maybe that's because they were well hidden) breaks. She instead uses transitions around the seasons. And Harry's entire first day at Hogwarts spans multiple chapters and many locations, introducing a variety of characters and still keeping an engaging pace.

Why do you suppose fanfic authors resort to abrupt changes? How does it change the feel of the work? How would canon be different if it was much more choppy?


** Philosopher's Stone has 42 scene breaks. The first is in [[http://imgur.com/qrLrekA.jpg][Chapter Two]].

Scene breaks aren't a fanfic thing. They happen in published fiction just as often, but they're easier to overlook because of how they're indicated. In most fiction, they're marked simply by an empty line between paragraphs (and an asterisk only when the break falls at the end of a page, to avoid confusion).

They stand out more in fanfic because of how we mark them. FFN didn't always allow the use of a horizontal rule to mark scene breaks, but it also had restrictions on paragraphs consisting entirely of non-letters (and even just the same letters, such as "x x x") so authors were forced to come up with crative ways to indicate scene breaks -- hence the Firebird trilogy's use of the title.

** In published works, each chapter represents an event to further the plot. POV changes, if they occur, change with each chapter.

In fanfic, the bar for writing is much lower. I've seen very long chapters broken apart into scenes with tildes and asterisks, but this could easily be worked around by adding transitional writing (like JKR does with the months and seasons). This requires more effort than a fanfic writer is really going to care about, since it's basically filler writing and most readers won't really care too much about it. Fanfic authors usually don't have editors, so changes can come off as too abrupt.

In canon, scene changes seem to have the previous end with dialogue and a sentence or two and then "Over the next few weeks Harry felt *[something related to previous scene]*_." This is a more seamless transition and is just better writing. Choppy canon would be jarring and edited to fit publishing standards.

As for me, I'm ok with infrequent breaks consisting of any combination of asterisks, tildes, dashes and o's in fanfic.

** Fanfiction is a fundamentally different genre then the Harry Potter books, without even getting into the various types of stories such as adventure, romance, humor, mystery ect. First, you as a fanfiction writer have a great deal of worldbuilding already done for you. It would be foolish to retread the same ground that JK Rowling already laid for you unless you are going to take it in a significantly different direction.

As an example, in a lot of fics certain parts of canon are outright skipped, such as in linkffn(Oh God Not Again! by Sarah 1281) the author completely skips most of Harry's shopping, because we can safely assume it happens much the same way as it does in the original books. However, because the author wants to change the dynamics of the relationship with Draco, that scene is included and plays out very differently. In my own stories, whenever something is going to happen more or less as it did in the books, I just skip right over it, instead covering new ground or changing things. This leads to a lot more more abrupt breaks as you're skipping over chucks of time.

Another point to consider is that in some writing styles, especially those from multiple points of views, there are many more abrupt breaks without smooth transitions as we move from different characters perspectives. Many fanfcition writers opt to look through the eyes of other characters, as even familiar scenes play out differently when looked at through someone else's eyes. There also isn't always a good, smooth way to move to another character without a lot of cruft and while some people like to inflate their word counts, others prefer to keep things more barebones.

And of course, there is always the writers style to consider. Some writers strive for a smooth, flowing narrative that eases the reader along. Others want a more abrupt, choppy narrative that is more startling and challenging. It can be a conscious stlylisic choice and not simple laziness that is found in many professional works where the author wants to be jarring. It's the same in other media such as movies. Some have smooth cuts that make the movie flow together well, others have smash cuts and abrupt scene changes because they want a different audience reaction.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** The big difference is how it's published. Rowling published all her chapters in single books (obviously) while fanfiction writers usually publish a single chapter at a time - once a week if we're lucky. This means canon could spend an entire chapter on one thing while fanfiction writers would be deluged with reviews asking why X didn't get a mention in this update if they tried it.

Another difference is that canon is centred solidly around Harry (I think there's only one chapter where he doesn't appear - Spinners End in book 6),while fanfiction often has strands in many different places at the same time. Take Divided and Entwined by Starfox5, for instance. The latest chapter had nine scenes spread over four days in multiple locations. The sections are essential to keep the story readable.

The Riddle House, The Other Minister, Spinner's End, and The Dark Lord Ascending are the only chapters that Harry isn't in.

***** Yeah, I agree with what you were saying. I'm not sure if this is true, but I read somewhere that JKR first tried to have non-Harry POV scenes through his weird dreams and visions, but decided it would be easier and simpler to have separate chapters in the beginning of the books.

That is a very good point. To elaborate on that, I will use the third book as an example: the edition I have has 22 chapters and 435 pages of the actual story, that is a bit shy of 20 pages per chapter, and with the book's word per page count it is more or less 5 thousand words per chapter. It is not unusual for some fanfics to get updates over twice that size, and sometimes even four times, and while I do understand that this is an issue in and of itself I will note that chapter changes kind of are scene breaks too so Madame Rowling's books get /those/ scene breaks more often than the fanfics do and it's better to have non-chapter-change scene breaks than to artificially inflate scene length specifically to avoid their usage.

** Nitpick: JKR definitely does use scene breaks, even in /PS/. Depending on the editions that I have, there are either blank spaces or symbols employed.

As far as her transitions go, yeah, she knows her way around them. She cuts the clutter and condenses the story to the important parts, especially in the earlier books.

#+end_quote

Lack of skill level and/or editing.

Fan fic writers don't have a market or editors to worry about -- though the latter can be remedied by betas or self-edits -- which is why you'll run into clunky scene transitions (among other things). Rehashes are a symptom of the same problem, as well as operating as a crutch (/I don't have to plot this part/) and word-padding (/have another copy-pasted Sorting Hat song, everyone/) to springboard off into the real meat of the story.

It often makes it lethargic and less engaging.

Most people reading in a fandom already know the stations of canon, so it would be best to summarize known things and then move on to the interesting bits.

Maybe it would have been a /little/ longer. Mostly it would have just given JKR's editor a fit.

** Most authors don't have the time or drive to do a "full" rewrite, which I think is totally fine. I prefer reading just the highlights over a low-effort rehash which borrows entire paragraphs from canon.

*** Another option is to straight up not tell the reader what the point of divergence is, maybe briefly mention it in the author's notes, and elaborate once the full extent of the changes are clear (whether a few chapters in or just at the end of the story to tie up lose end)

** I think it's rather underestimated itt that chapters themselves constitute scene breaks. Personally, I find scene breaks to be a valid writer's tool, regardless of the professional/amateur writing distinction.

** Some of the stuff I wrote has section breaks, some hasn't. No links provided because it's not fanfics and that's that.

That said, I can tell you from experience that it relies on the kind of story you have, on the exact narrative you give it, and on the narrator's position in the story. With a slow-paced story that simply tells a tale and it is all narrated by one of the characters, sure, it is easy to narrate that time passes every single time. A mystery story with something to hide is likely going to flow better with marked scene breaks, though. An action story is probably going to use scene break markers if the narrator is a third-person one and possibly but not necessarily the same if it is narrated by a character instead. An adventure story could go both ways. A fairy tale, likewise. A story that consists of a series of vignettes, like “Cauterize” by Lady Altair (a story often praised for simply being well written, I will note), simply won't go well if you don't use scene break markers.

Going further, how does it change the feel of the work, you ask? Well, a scene break conserves the speed of the story, so to say, as opposed to a narration that time passed which makes it slow down in the reader's perception. Additionally, a scene break conveys that “time has passed” and that only if you are actually shown that it did whereas a narration that time passed conveys that /and/ additionally that “nothing noteworthy has happened in the meantime” which can feel fairly jarring when used after particularly ... hmm, let's say “emotional” moments, because surely, if something noteworthy happens during the time skip, that very thing would be noted, and anything cliffhangery or simply that emotional is something the reader will not expect to be dismissed just like that. Of course, one can still narrate the time skip in those cases if they know what they are doing, but it's simply harder to do that well and I do believe it might be somewhat intimidating to some people.

So why do people resort to it? Because it is a legitimate writing tool. That you might see it too often for your liking is one thing, and that some people who are just unilaterally bad writers use it is one thing as well, but in the end it is used simply because it exists and can be used in that way and both over-saturation of its (or any other thing's, really) use and the fact that some dreadfully awful writers are aware of its (and, again, many other things') existence are problems frankly unrelated to that tool itself.
