I believe the main character was Dennis Creevey but I could be wrong because it's been awhile since I read it. It's basically about how he is a photographer now and he does this piece for all of the survivors to display their scars caused by Voldemort. It's beautifully written, and I remember specifically how Neville, instead of having his picture taken he sends in a picture of his grandparents. George has just the picture of himself. I think there was a separate chapter for quite a few DA members and Order of the Phoenix members. I tried googling but found nothing : ( I hope some of you can help!
