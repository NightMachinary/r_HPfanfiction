Hogwarts starts at university age instead of 11, with the typical student ages while attending being perhaps 18-25.

I think it would be particularly interesting to see portrayals of how Harry could have developed without the magical world in those critical years, as well as how he would react and integrate into it at that age.

Any recommendations?


** I outlined a fun fic where Hogsmeade is a college town with Hogwarts University at its center (although Hohwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry still exists, HogsU came much later), and Harry is a transfiguration prodigy and is the first person to unlock multiple animagus forms (and published a paper so now anybody can do it) and is researching self induced human transfiguration (kind of like Krum's shark transfiguration in GOF, or the T-1000 from Terminator 2 if you take it to the extreme). SIHT (humorously pronounced "SHIT") was used extensively in his bid to defeat Voldemort, so seats in his lectures are extremely sought after, and he has to weed out all the people there just to gawk at him.

His ultimate goal is to unlock the secret to magical creature transfiguration, so he frequently goes on archeological expeditions to track down myths and urban legends about people (past or current) with the abilities of magical creatures or magical animagus forms.

He has a lovable, misfit band of research assistants including Charlie Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Rolf Scamander, a druid, and a native american (who was previously the apprentice of a shaman in a tribe with spirit animals).

It was going to take a shot at explaining the phylogenetics of magical creatures when they came upon a "Jouney to the Center of the Earth" style hidden population of exclusively magic creatures where there was enough biodiversity and isolation to establish an evolutionary tree (although since magic is involved it would be closer to a web, looking more like the evolution of bacteria who have horizontal gene transfer).

I never got much past the outline, but it was a fun idea.

*** i would definitely love to read something like this. I hope you find enough inspiration to write a full length story like this. This is a completely new take on the story!!

*** It certainly sounds like it could be interesting.

I'm a little surprised that I've never seen this idea before. It's a pretty great way to sort of... legitimize, I guess, the whole multi-animagus trope.

** Muggleborns would be at an incredible disadvantage is my first thought, although a fic where they are, in fact, really well-equipped thanks to modern-day educations being so much better than what they would get in medieval times and applying all sorts of Muggle skillsets to magic would be interesting.

Edit: Added to this is if Muggleborns enter the world as adults, a lot of them wouldn't even tell their parents. So Petunia and Lily would have grown up together, Petunia might not have become so crazy bitter and jealous, and maybe not so obsessed with 'normality'. So maybe Harry has a less abusive childhood.

*** Muggleborns could definitely be at a very significant disadvantage. At the very least, the culture shock would be much more intense.

As far as the actual magical education goes though.... it depends. In an AU like this, you could pretty easily say that wizards are simply not developed enough both magically and mentally to start learning and casting magic until a certain age, so wizard-born kids actually aren't all that ahead of muggle-borns.

Yeah, there's a few interesting ways this could be portrayed.

**** Even if they don't get to actually cast spells until they're adults (an incredible idea to play with by the way) just the fact that purebloods/half-bloods grow up knowing about the magical world and seeing their parents cast spells/make potions etc. gives them an advantage over Muggleborns, IMHO. Like how kids who grow up in literate households have an advantage over those who don't even if they're not expressly drilled in academics. Although, if they aren't studying magical theory, what ARE pureblood kids doing during their childhoods? Even if they study the same subjects as Muggle kids, or the equivalent, they still do grow up knowing about magic if not able to cast spells.

If magical kids just sit around having years of constant summer vacation, then it could be a huge culture shock when they go to school though. It could be that the work ethic of Muggleborn students counters the pureblood advantage of growing up in the magical world. That would be hilarious - pureblood kids being these hippy-dippy artistic types with no sense of economics or scheduling since magic makes it so they don't need to worry about scarce resources and they have like two decades of free-range roaming and playing.

** Not a fanfic, but The Magicians by Lev Grossman is basically that (but set in the states and obviously no HP characters) mixed with a more adult version of the Chronicles of Narnia. It might scratch that itch if you haven't read it already.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and Hogwarts U by zArkham) has this as its premise; unfortunately, it's unfinished and never gets behind new student/Muggleborn orientation. The author is still active, so maybe they'll return to it someday...

  What if Hogwarts had to wait to start till student's were 18 when their magical cores matured? With magicals going to the Saint Schools for primary/secondary, they have a big lead on the Muggleborn in everything but magic. Follow Harry as he leaves Stonewall behind to enter into Magic where the rules seems stacked against the Muggleborn/raised. AU with alternative sortings. Harry/?
