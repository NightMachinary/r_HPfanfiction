Fic where either Hermione and Ginny are sluts or even both.


** Are you just looking for smut? I mean I won't judge if so, but might as well just say so.

** This is one of the weirder requests lmao. You should look into Weasley!Bashing fics. They usually feature such a Ginny but on the downside you are going to read a terrible fanfic.

You could find a H/Hr fic where Hermione does behave slutty but being a school slut is too OOC.

***** Well tbh if someone like Ginny went to the high school I went to she would eventually be seen as the school slut so really if you think about it your not bashing your just being really immature.

******* Its less the number but the fact that she had someone who's opinion of her is considered relatively reputable showing open disdain for what would be construed by the rumor mill as her promiscuity that even if it was one boyfriend by the time the week was over she would be considered the school slut via the game of telephone that occurs pushing everything into hyperbole.

Think of it like this:

Beggining rumor: Ron was telling everyone about his sister kissing random people in the hallway

Followed by an "o my god you should have seen her she was practically having sex and she didn't even know his name" and further into hyperbole until you get to someone who actually dislikes her and bring a new dimension to the hyperbole like an "I saw her leaving (placeholder male name here)'s house at xx in the morning" and from that point on the second she does something with anyone that can be construed as even slightly intimate or Ron says something about her involving something that can be construed as slightly intimate (I would have said involving anyone but him but then I remembered back in my day where this basically happened with this one girl and then her cousin was brought into thing leading the whole thing to be dropped like a flaming bag of high powered explosives but knowing magical Britain even a sibling wouldn't cause this shit to drop) she becomes the official school slut.

As for school I went in America.

******** Ok what the shit am I getting downvoted on this for I legitimately speak from experience? I mean one little statement by a friend or family member gets out of hand and either the person is well liked in which case nothing happens, isolates the self when people start the whole "stare and whisper" bullshit in which case nothing happens, or things keep getting out of hand and bam you got a school slut until that's not bullshit happens and kids be kids.

** The Dark Lord's Equal mentions Ginny as "the BC5000... Which is quite the accomplishment...as there are only 104 broom closets at Hogwarts."

She's also a rather bad lay. That's her only significance in the story, really.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
