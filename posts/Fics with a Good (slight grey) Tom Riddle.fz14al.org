Yes, slight grey, if its no objection. The Core of the Story should be Tom in a influental Position like a Crime fighter or something like that and the "slight grey" would be, that he would use not quite legal Methods to reach his Goals...but only as a last possible way. His Maingoal might be, like in Canon, to make the Pureblood line and status prevail, but not as brutal as in Canon.

â€‹

So much for this. Another point would be, that he might be in a Relationship. Possibly with Bellatrix and like in Canon, she is a submissive follower, eager to fulfill his Will. But it can also be, that he shares the Bed with Bella just for fun, while he is lost with an other Woman, but she is out of reach (because she dont love or desire him or because she is married and cherishes her Husband and marriage, despite she might develop feelings for Tom over time. Whether those are romantical or lust doesnt matter. But maybe there are other Reasons for her not being available). Said Woman can be Narcissa for example and she is either with Lucious or an other Man. Whether this cause jealousy from Bella or not....i will leave to the Fic.

Or Tom is in no Relationship, but has many (including Canon ones) Women and Bella is just one of them, but she is the most eager one to please him.


** I am kind of working on a story like this. It's set after Hogwarts and is supposed to show a first attempt at wizarding world domination, but not through mass violence/killing. Goal is still the same, story has not gotten to his methods yet, but will shortly and they will be very different. It is mostly a relationship fic with an OC though, and that's all the first few chapters posted so far really deal with. Doesn't sound like exactly what you want, but in case you are interested -
