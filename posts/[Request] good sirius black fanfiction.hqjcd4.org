Can you recommend some quality multi-chapter fics about Sirius Black? Maybe something who explore his past? First wizard war, his issues with the black family or the marauders era, things like that

What i hate: SiriusxOC, SiriusxMarlene, SiriusxMaryMcdonald, SiriusxDorcas or any het ship with him

I don't mind Wolfstar, or any slash, but as i said i'm not searching a story about romance


** Styx linkao3(18456680) and Blackpool linkao3(14760663) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]], both Regulus-centric but explore his relationship with Sirius and their life at Grimmauld Place and with the wider Black family. The author also has further stories (mostly centred on Remus) about Sirius in the Marauders era

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thirty2flavors/pseuds/thirty2flavors][thirty2flavors]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thewhitebirds/pseuds/thewhitebirds][thewhitebirds]] have lots of drabbles/oneshots about the Black family (featuring Sirius as well as the wider family!) that I love

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]
