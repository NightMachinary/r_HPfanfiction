Obliviator Margaret Stanton : File 138 Henry Moore

Henry has been in therapy for years. Perpetually constipated and afraid to use the public toilets. Ever since he was five years old, And he had watched a man going into the toilet and never come out. He feared the watery Vortex would suck him in like it did that man. Dragging him to a place known as the ministry.

Additional notes: Arthur Weasley Really needs to work on his subtlety. I have had to Obliviate the muggle Henry Moore 926 times. I'm starting to worry about the poor muggle's health. I'll have to consult Saint Mungo's if I have to obliviate him again.


** Additional Note: I would advise moving this particular ministry entrance. I've had complaints from ministry maintenance that they've had to come and clean this particular entrance over 2000 times. Apparently muggle repelling wards fail in times of urgency.
