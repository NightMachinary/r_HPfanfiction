Hey guys, 3 months ago I made a post about a plot I had and all, so I took what most of the people said and did, I wrote it down (Not complete) but a bit of it and I could really all your opinions. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TM2_Pp9JjCUJZsFhD5-N9SIsl81sr001QlJAZcaeaS8/edit?usp=sharing]] is what I've written till now and I would love it if you guys could give your suggestions and criticize my work, just to put it out though - I'm not really fluent at English.

Also in my last post I said that the OC is the son of Bellatrix and another deatheater or Voldemort but I threw that out of the window completely and changed his parentage but he is still raised by Bellatrix as a LeStrange.


** Okay, repate after me:

It's *Lestrange*. Lestrange. Not LeStrange. I don't know where this came from, but:

- It's pronounced Lestrange in the movies, not french (something like Le Schtronsh)
- In the book it's written Lestrange.

#+begin_quote
  eft of Andromeda's burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange. “Lestrange ...” Harry said aloud.

  And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore's Pensieve

  “I did,” he said glumly. “Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't mention it ... that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds.” “Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered Hermione, horrified.

  Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.
#+end_quote

Seriosly, is it so goddamn hard to look up the names of your characters? Like seriously, wtf?

#+begin_quote
  The name 'Lestrange' echoes the French phrase l'étrange, literally "the strange one", referring to Bellatrix's mental disturbance. In Old French, estrange means "foreigner"[8]. The surname may allude to English journalist Roger L'Estrange, who was known for opposing religious toleration and for being involved in plots against the government of William and Mary, similar to the Lestranges' intolerance about blood purity and involvement in the Death Eaters organisation.
#+end_quote

(from the HP wiki)

I'll get to the rest now, but this immediately is a big minus for me.

Edit: If you want us to review on Google docs, enable commenting. (Top right, share - Everyone who has the link *can comment*) Without that suggesting stuff and commenting is very tedious. There is a reason that every beta I've ever done (in either direction) used GDocs :)

Edit 2:

Okay, a couple death-sins right there:

- In the third paragraph you make grave mistakes in terms of spelling and grammar:

#+begin_quote
  A white-blond boy of *the* same age +w+as the younger man watched this take place with a grim expression on his face, as he saw his cousin sell his soul to the devil himself.
#+end_quote

And even without that the sentence is extremely clumsy. Let's try to rework it.

#+begin_quote
  The expression of one of the bystanders, a white-blond boy of similar age was grim. He just had watched his cousin sell his soul to the devil.
#+end_quote

It's still a bit clumsy because I have to introduce him as bystander, since you don't pain the picture of the scene at all. "Puff, bystander!"

Then there is the next deathsin:

- Including a Hogwarts letter in full will make my close your fic in 99% of the cases. I have seen it in 1000 fics, and most of them weren't good.

Then there are some smaller things:

#+begin_quote
  “Key?” The Goblin simply replied after a minute of being silent and extended his hand.
#+end_quote

A minute of silence and ignoring the customers is a lot. How does this make Harry feel? Like this is very awkward in real life. If you want to include it, you need something around it:

#+begin_quote
  The goblin did not have seemed to have heard Hagrid, and simply continued working. Harry looked at Hagrid uncertainly, who just shrugged his shoulders and indicated Harry to wait. Harry nodded. After what seemed like an eternity the Goblin looked up and struck out his wrinkled hand. "Key?"
#+end_quote

Every sentence should have some kind of purpose. Introducing or developing the characters, painting the setting, evoking an emotion. Your sentence simply confuses.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid said searching for the key in this huge clothes and after a bit of searching had a satisfied expression on his face as he found the key and put it on the goblin's outstreched hand
#+end_quote

This sentence is very clumsy.

Then you have some other problems, like the Goblin asking for a key twice.

Try to find a dedicated beta, and even before you give your story to them, try to read and edit more over it. A lot of the stuff that I just pointed out would probably be found by yourself if you come back to your story after a break. If you don't think you'd find it, read it aloud. This helps you to read what you actually wrote, not what you think you wrote.

I'm definitely not going through the rest without gdoc-comments.

*** My bad with the LeStrange thing, I definitely should've looked it up on the wikia or pottermore site.

Thanks for the review though!

***** I just did! Thank you so much for the help, I wish I would've replied earlier but I was actually at doctor's... so :c

Also I had a request, if you are not busy, would you be willing to help me polishing the plot a bit?

****** Sure, but going over plot is (imo) better in a chat atmosphere. Do you have discord or IRC? If so, in the sidebar is a chat where I'll be on for a while to reach me.

** Eh... What exactly is it that we need to give feedback here? You basically reharshed canon almost word by word without adding anything new. The fact that Harry ended up in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor is also nothing new in this fandom either.

If I want to read canon I would take the books out of my shelf. An advice when writing fanfiction, we've all read the books, so please don't remind us of all those details. If you for some reason have to do so, do it in a short paragraph or two.

All that was worth reading here is the first three paragraphs and the last one.

*** I wanted help with my grammar and I originally wanted to post this when I had written around 6-7k words but I thought what if my English is horrible, so I posted this earlier and asked for a beta to help me with correction. Also, I'll definitely keep that in mind, first time writing this so uh I apologize if it isn't good in sense of story itself or how I describe it.

Thank you very much though.
