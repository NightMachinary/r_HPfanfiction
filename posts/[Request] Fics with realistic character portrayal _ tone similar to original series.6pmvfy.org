** AUs with canon-like characterisation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After one betrayal too many, Harry and his friends decided to (literally) burn down the Old Order. Trio characterization and tone of the story feel very much like in the original Series.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** linkao3(Hell to Raise by Tozette) in my opinion has a pretty similar tone to the original series when it comes to how its written. sadly it is also incomplete and hasn't been updated in over two years but it's a really good read

  All Harry knew that day was that his Aunt Petunia had begun to scream. When he came from his cupboard to see what was wrong, he found her sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles. She was gibbering as that evening's three-kilogram chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled through the window and out into the back yard.----------------In which Harry Potter animates the dead. Dumbledore disapproves. Other forces... not so much.
