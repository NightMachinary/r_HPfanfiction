A recent one I got, posted on [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7037925/1/Living-Dangerously][Living Dangerously]] was clearly by someone on a very bad day:

*Can i read a version of this story where there is no recently made up words? I mean what the fuck is "Body shaming" doing in my 1990s harry potter world? Boys ogle girls and girls ogle boys it is normal it has happened as long as there has been humans. If it makes you uncomfortable deal with it without being a utter twat and a hypocrite.

Fuck this shit, fuck 2020 and fuck you all*

He may have some point about my dialogue use, I don't particularly care, but this was on chapter ONE of a forty-part story. By far blew me away from the sheer over the topness of it!

All stories will get bad reviews, that much is for sure, as its impossible to please everybody. But I want to know if anyone else has had some obsurdly negative or just ridiculous reviews that have stuck with you? Complaining about silly things, like the galleon to sickle conversion or accents not being geographically accurate. Stuff that amazes you people can get annoyed by. Doesn't have to be just HP based!


** Probably not my weirdest but yesterday someone left me a bunch of reviews on several of my fics that were solely really shit story ideas. The worst by far was:

"Here's an idea. Percy coming home late after curfew and finds a not so pleased Audrey in the living room couch with her arms crossed glaring at her husband. Audrey decides to punish him. Spanks her husband 12 times. Molly and Lucy are at the Burrow for the weekend. It's just Percy and Audrey in the house."

Honestly I'm almost impressed at their audacity in writing out their highly specific fantasy to me as a review. The story they posted it on is lightly Percy/Audrey but it's more focused on them bringing down the Ministry from the inside - there's no smut and certainly no dominatrix style fetish stuff. I've never written anything like that before and baffled as to why they think I would.

Its like buddy, good to see your enthusiasm, but either go write your own fic or review mine

***** I will say that I have posted the occasional harsh "review" on FFN when I was either having a bad day or let something trival get to me. I dearly wish I could delete or at least edit some of my reviews, but FFN doesn't allow me to do that.

The end result is that I rarely review any more.

** It's not a complaint, but earlier this year I posted a chapter to one of my works which garnered a rather strange response from two Guests.

[[https://i.imgur.com/6WPBkhk.jpg]]

Combined, those reviews contain more than 8000 words. The chapter itself was only 6000 words long.

Probably the most baffling reviews I've seen this year, but I can't fault their enthusiasm.

** I just lately saw that someone had commented twice, recently, on a 10ish year old M rated fic complaining about the cursing (but no complaints about the graphic sex or drug use). Even weirder, the cursing is something of a plot point: the female protagonist is sheltered and a bit prissy and hates that the male protagonist swears so much, and one sign that he's cleaning up his act to be with her is that he tones the profanity down a lot.

Idk if the author even checks reviews on that story any more but it made me laugh a little.

  I think it might help the dialogue if you replaced "said" with more descriptive things. For example, when Harry was protesting the gift from Hagrid, instead of "Harry said", you could have said "He protested" or "Harry protested." Instead of "said" I have also seen writers using the character doing an action, or a facial expression of the character. I just think it ads more life to the interacting between the characters in dialogue.

This one (for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13622330/1/Harry-Potter-Grandson-of-God][this story]])is just not great writing advice, but it seemed well-intentioned. Just by an amateur writer. Naturally I ignored it but it stuck with me because I feel bad for the person who wrote it.

  This is deep you really have some smart jokes in there, especially the really subtle jokes requiring a solid grasp of theoretical physics and Narodnaya Volya literature. These aren't just jokes, they say something about LIFE.

I don't visit that site regularly, but I have seen some of the cringiest stories ever being praised for being mature by /a lot/ of their users. Not all of them, but /a lot/.

** Body shamming /was/ a thing in the 90s. It was a /big/ thing in the 90s. Maybe not as big as it is now---recent history isn't my forte, I‘m more late 1400s to mid 1800s, but still---but it /definitely/ was a thing.\\
Literally where is their reasoning? It's like queer people, they didn't just pop up in the last twenty years. They've been here since the dawn of fucking time---Alexander sodding Hamilton was bisexual!

****** not sure about the 90s, but 'queer' wasn't used till recently, although my best guess would've been late 90s or so. Faggot was definitely being used. so, here's a story. my ma was born in the early 60s, and there was this boy across the street. one day, mare was like 'did you know [enter name] was a homosexual?' so, yeah, that's a first person account of what words were used. she also told me about the standard 'playground insults' used. one was queer. ergo, 'you're so queer' or 'that's so queer'. not in the gay sense, but the 'that's weird' or 'your weird' sense. obviously, i shortened the story, summarized it, so im not writing one big reply. im not really with the recent era, again, i do more Victorian, regency, etc. eras. the old ones.
