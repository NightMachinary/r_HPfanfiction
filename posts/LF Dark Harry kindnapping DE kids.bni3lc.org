#+begin_quote
  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.

*** Sigh... On the one hand, the author hasn't bought into the canon-contradicting fanon that Ron and Hermione didn't write to Harry during the summer after GoF completely. On the other hand, the author stretched it as far as he could:

#+begin_quote
  "I really don't think I do. You see, you both do look a good deal like my two best friends, but I've come to the realization that they both may be held prisoner somewhere. What other excuse would my best friends have for not writing to me since early this summer, and even then only giving the barest details?"

  Ron and Hermione both looked at the floor with expressions of deep guilt.

  "We're really sorry, Harry," said Ron. "But Dumbledore asked us not to write too much and then told us to stop all communications."
#+end_quote

And, of course, you've got Dumbledore's Greater Good (with capital letters, too).
