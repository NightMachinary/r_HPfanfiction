I think Neville, Luna, Malfoy and maybe... Daphne?

I remember being surprised that it was actually good. Don't remember much of anything about the plot.

Edit: *their


** There are a LOT of these. Do you have anything at all to narrow it down?

*** Are there really a lot of fics that have so mamy people travel back in time? I've seen a couple with just the Golden Trio, but never so many people travelling back.

**** I'd have to look them up because I never actually sorted my bookmarks at all and now (seven years of fanfiction later) I'm kind of scared to, but there is one where almost everybody is a time traveller, there's one where Luna, Harry, Draco, Daphne, and I think Neville, all go back in time to their 6 year old bodies. Harry's a lunatic and assassin.

It's not Stunning Shifts as linked below, so there's two with that cast.
