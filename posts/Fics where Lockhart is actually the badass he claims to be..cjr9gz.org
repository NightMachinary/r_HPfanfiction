*** I was hesitating to read this fic because I thought Lockhart was still as blunderingly bumblingly braggadociously blindingly bad at stuff as in canon, which I thought would either make part of the story kind of hand-wavey or just be depressing in regards to how Harry was raised. But with this comment I think I'll just read it.

** Battles with Basilisks is pretty fun. It's a one-shot alternate ending to COS, starting when Harry and Ron go to Lockhart to get him to help rescue Ginny. I love how the author manages to turn Lockhart genuinely brave and competent, and STILL keeps him perfectly in character. Plus, Harry and Ron get added snark.

  This story comes from the abandoned "Amalgum" by (10,700 words) who has graciously released the story to anyone who likes the idea and wants to finish it. I've noticed very little fanfiction using Lockhart as the hero and I thought his premise had much merit. I have considerably expanded and reorganized my version.

  Yes, I know that the correct term is amalgam, not amalgum, when referring to a mixture or blend to two dis-similar materials. However, Amalgum was the original spelling used by and so I continued to use it.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

It's a bit in the background, but Lockhart, Aberforth, Krum's and Fleur's families and a few others are fleshed out a lot more and especially Lockhart and Abe are really badass. Lockhart manages to survive a Death Eater raid and Abe single handedly performs an international rescue mission.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
