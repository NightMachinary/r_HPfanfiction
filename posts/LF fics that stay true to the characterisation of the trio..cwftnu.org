Harry Potter isn't some random God-like wizard with a bajillion titles. He is simply just Harry; when he is introduced to the Wizarding World and told he is famous in canon he is shocked beyond belief. This is because the Harry Potter of canon didn't like to be all high, mighty and important (unlike many many fanfics).

Hermione Granger isn't an insufferable bookworm. Sure, she loves books and is great at school and research but she's a Gryffindor to the core. She didn't hesitate to put herself in a possibly life-threatening situation even in the first book (going to the 3rd Floor corridor). She believes that bravery and courage, Gryffindor values, are far more important than simple book-smarts.

Ronald Weasley isn't a jealous prat. He plays possibly the most important role in the trio. Without Ron, Harry and Hermione would've probably gone mad with their respective crazy personalities. Ron is a damn good wizard and he brings normalcy to the trio. He is the best friend of both Harry and Hermione and allows them both to relax through his own good-natured personality and snark.

Are there any fics that characterise the trio like this?

I don't really care if fics are gen or pairing except for Harry/Ginny because I just don't quite like it.

*** Now that was an amazing read. Original concept, great writing, realistic characters and a well executed plot. I particularly appreciated how the author didn't just only develop Harry's character but made everyone feel like real human beings.

Thank you for recommending this.

**** Seconded, I hope they continue (last chapter was posted this month) the series, although the author admitted that they are bad at updating.

**** I wish there were more fics like this where Gryffindor are BAMF by virtue of more than bullheaded idiocy. Acts of derring-do are never successful unless supported by cunning.

  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you? Hidden in plain sight, in the one house they least expected, Harry Potter becomes what he was always meant to be. Hogwarts beware, the Dark Lord's equal is rising!

I was thinking more in line of a Hogwarts fic but I'll give it a read anyways.

Thank you for your suggestion!

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword) is probably the most well-characterized trio in the fandom, and really emphasizes the connection between them.
