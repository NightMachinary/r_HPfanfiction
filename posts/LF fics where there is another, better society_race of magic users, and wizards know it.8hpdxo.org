Are there any fics where wizards actually aren't the dominant power in the magical force, and they are actually aware of higher powers (whether that be mages, fae, etc...) that they have to defer to and simply cannot fight in the same way centaurs can't fight wizards? To be clear I'm not looking for stories where those higher powers are things like gods. The plot of a few fics I read back in the day were about Harry is discovering he's some kind of uberwizard called a 'mage', and switching schools, discovering a whole new society, etc... In the kind of fics I'm hoping to find, Harry would have known mages existed all along, wizards would be governed by an overarching government body lead by mages, would live in a magical society dominated by mages and their interests, and would worry about radical mage political groups lobbying to restrict wizard rights the same way canon Centaurs must have been disturbed by Voldemort and his followers wanting to treat them like animals.

Bonus points if the two groups simply cannot produce viable offspring together. I'm not looking for stories about a super-powerful subgroup of wizards. I'm looking for stories where dominant force in the magical world is completely removed from wizards, where the chance of a wizard-mage/fae/etc... hybrid existing is the same as the chances of a house elf-wizard hybrid existing in canon.

Are there any fics like that out there?


** It doesn't really fit with your prompt but The Song of the Trees linkffn(2859327) does feature a magic society that wizards erased all knowledge of out of fear.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
