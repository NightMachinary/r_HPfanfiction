** I remember there being a (Ravenclaw!Harry?) story where he keeps leaving cat treats for Mrs. Norris to keep Filch out of his hair. He comments on it when the Chamber of Secrets gets opened and Mrs. Norris gets petrified, saying something along the lines of "I know it wasn't you that did this, I saw the cat treats you keep leaving."

No idea which fic it was, though.

EDIT: Found it, the series is called "Harry Potter and the Consequences of the Trip to the Library in Primary School" and it starts here: linkao3(12915570)

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.
