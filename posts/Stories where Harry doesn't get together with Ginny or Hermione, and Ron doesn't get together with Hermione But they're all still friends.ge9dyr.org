I think it would have been more interesting if Harry hadn't of been with Ginny, and Ron hadn't been with Hermione. And I know that some people like Harry/Hermione, but I don't see it working out for them either.

I think it's pretty realistic for the trio not to be in a relationship with each other, I love Ron/Hermione, but so many of the stories still have them focused on fighting with each other. I don't mind Harry/Ginny, but they're both extremely stubborn in stories, and I just don't see it lasting. While I imagine Harry and Hermione having arguments with each other if they were a couple since they're both stubborn in their own way and have different opinions on things.

So I'm looking for it to be canon compliant up until the epilogue. No Harry/Ginny, no Ron/Hermione, no Harry/Hermione. I'd love for the three of them to be best friends still. I wouldn't mind if Ginny was close to them as well.

No Weasley bashing, no OP Harry, No Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly more smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings, can be on any site.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).


** Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) eventually becomes Harry/Luna, Hermione/Neville, Ron/Lavender, and Ginny/Colin. Since it's a fic that starts before first year, relationships take a while to develop.

I do have to warn for minor Lord-Potter. It's one of the few Lord-Potter fics that has it make some degree of sense, but it's still Lord-Potter. He's mainly smarter because Hermione's family adopts him and he has contact in the Wizarding World earlier.

Protection from Nargles: linkffn(7352166)

Another Harry/Luna fic, this one starts at 5th year and is almost entirely a relationship-focused fic. Ron and Lavender are heavily teased, Ginny has Michael Corner...

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

*** Note also that although Harry has some justified power-ups in this story, like a supportive family and more awareness of wizarding etiquette, the villains arguably have /more/, like an entire team of dark sorcerers at Voldemort's level but with different specialisations.

*** That part was so much no in the story, not done well at all, though tbh I didn't like the Hermione and Cormac stuff either, though I felt really bad for Lavender, Rowling did her wrong. It was like she was created just to be a foil for Hermione and Ron.

Quick Edit: Though maybe after the battle where Ron and Lavender were both grown up more, I could see it.

**** Yes! :) Ron needs someone who can boost his confidence and give him more self esteem and less jealousy through affection and attention yes, since he was always second best and hand me downed in everything. :) Lavender could have done that for him. Hermione just dismisses him and snaps at him all the time for it.

***** I love Hermione, don't get me wrong, but it always felt like she was tearing down all Ron's negative traits and never applauding him for his positive traits. Though they both fought each other in canon way too much.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
