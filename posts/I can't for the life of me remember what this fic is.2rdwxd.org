I read this fic maybe two years ago. Got halfway through the sequel, and had my laptop stolen. Didn't have my bookmarks synced, and can't remember what the name was.

The basic premise was that Harry meets an OFC over the summer that moves in next door(I believe her name was Gabriellia? At least it was something similar). He is marked by her father (though he doesn't know it at the time, believing them all to be muggles) with some kind of protectionist tattoo that gives him strange magical abilities, but also messes with his mental state, making him rather unstable.

Eventually the tattoo is removed, and Harry finds out that the entire family is magical, and has some magical inheritance that involves a stone, dragons, and the power to literally vaporize cities. Draco ends up a vampire, Harry knocks up Cho for some reason (but doesn't know about it til late in the sequel), and Voldemort has a horcrux in the form of a white cloak, that contains all the innocence and goodness from his soul that he cast out. I read right up until the point when Cho was apparently going to die (according to prophecy) in the forbidden forest wearing the cloak, during an assault on Hogwarts.

The story was 500k+ works long I think. Google has been no help in finding it unfortunately.


** Did a little poking around for you. Never heard of the fic, bit is it [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=157211][Burden of Becoming]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=209929][Harry Potter and the Birth of a New Sun]] by caduceus?
