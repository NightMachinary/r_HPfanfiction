** Quirrell. He was turned into a horcrux like thing then had his face burned right before he died.

*** I have to agree. He was possessed, and was essentially burnt alive by not only a student, but also abandoned by Voldemort the second he knew he couldn't touch Harry. Essentially setting everything in motion

** Lupin. Gets married, has a kid, and then he and his wife are killed. Not only does it suck for Lupin and Tonks, but now his kid has to grow up an orphan. Brutal.

*** Hmm while I do agree it was a tragedy about Tonks and Teddy, I cant sympathize with Lupin due to him attempting to abandon them until Harry kicked his arse for it

Lupin was always a coward, he abandoned Harry, he abandoned Sirius and he tried to abandon his own Wife and child during a War in which they were both being hunted down for merely existing

There was a reason even James and Lily viewed him as a potential spy and never told him the truth about their protections, Lupin only ever concerned himself about his own self until other people had to put him in check

** Crouch Jr. In a world where the afterlife exists, having your soul sucked out is the worst thing that can happen to you except getting stuck in Limbo like Voldemort did.
