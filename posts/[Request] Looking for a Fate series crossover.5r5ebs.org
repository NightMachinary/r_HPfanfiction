I'm looking for a specific Fate/StayNight (or Fate/Extra, could be either) crossover with HP.

Harry received a book from an old man (obviously Zelretch), and, after a particularaly bad day, violence from the Dursleys included, uses his own blood to perforn the Servant Summoning Ritual, only to receive a Saber AND a Caster (Arturia and Tamamo no Mae, respectively). I saw it quite a while ago and can't find it anymore.

Oh, and if someone knows anymore good Fate/HP crossovers aside from Fate's Gamble, I'd appreciate it.


** A Fate/HP crossover I would recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/reader][Swords and Sorcery]] on SpaceBattles.

** Crosswinds of Fate is the only crossover of the two I've read that I freely recommend. There's also one on SpaceBattles about YA Shirou becomes young again and goes to Hogwarts after dimension travel. It has a Fem!Harry, but no pairings.

There was also one where Harry gets summoned as a servant, but he's a fictional character in that world- I remember liking it when I read it, but I haven't read it for a while so can't recommend it. Same with a fic where Harry is raised as an Emiya.

What do you like about Fate's Gamble? I tried to start reading it, but couldn't stand it

*** It's a “guilty pleasure” story. Don't question people's liking of it based on stuff you'd judge normal stories with, it just doesn't work.

*** Honestly, I don't know. I started reading it because Zelretch kicked it all off, and I love that bloodsucking troll. I guess I wanted to see where it'd go, and it ended up involving several of my favourite Type-MOON characters. Type-VENUS, Altrouge, Arc, Len and Tamamo among them.

I grew on me, you could say.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
