:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a post when something reminded me of this one fic I can't remember the name of. I can't find it on ao3 or ffn or maybe I'm not able to find it because I don't have the right name.

The fic I read has Harry being reborn as Reghar Targaryen's younger brother. Here Harry and him are goals+ BROTP‚Ñ¢ ‚úîÔ∏è and the fic is hilarious. Also, Sirius Black is reborn as a younger stark brother.

Harry, now known as Jaherys along with Sirius and Tyrion form the best and most awesome squad. They clean up Summerhall and rebuild it for Reghar.

Harry : (not in this order) Fixes the magic/curse that went wrong in Old Valeria. Campaigns to abolish slavery. Creates a new kingdom that's a sister house to his own. BRINGS BACK THE DRAGONS AND RIDES BELERION. 10/10

((The author kind of wrote themselves into a tiny corner because of the paring (Harry and Kal drogo) because that's meh. ))BUT the fic was awesome and hilarious in every other way especially the BROTP b/w Harry and his brother.

I've forgotten the fics name if anyone remembers please post it below. Thanks.
