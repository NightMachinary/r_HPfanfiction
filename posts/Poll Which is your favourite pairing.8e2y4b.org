** If we just look at Books, Ginny:

- Strong, almost never cried, and Harry couldn't deal with crying girls.
- Pretty, as Pansy Parkinson said in HBP. Harry seemed to only go after 'hot' girls (Cho previously).
- Quidditch fanatic.
- Shared an evil sense of humor with Harry, whether it was about mocking Fleur or pranking Ron.
- Shared the experience of having Voldemort in their heads.
- Knew when and how to put Harry in his place (Christmas of Year 5).
- Fanatically loyal to him and devoted to his cause, braved terror and torture during Year 7 at Hogwarts, led students (with Neville) and drummed up enough manpower to win the Final Battle.

--------------

If we go into fanfictions and AUs, then it really depends on how they are characterized and how circumstances bring them together. For examples, I really like those pairings in following fics:

- Harry and Hermione in "Stages of Hope"
- Harry and Bellatrix in "Delenda Est"
- Harry and Luna in "The Accidental Animagus"
- Harry and Daphne in "Betrayal"
- Harry and Susan in "Final Protocol"
- Harry and Tonks in "Harry Potter and the Metamorph"

I'd like very much to read a good Harry/Fleur fic in which Fleur is not part of a harem and someone who is a power of her own.

My favorite non canon pairing is however Harry/Hermione/Ron. Trio friendship and love is one of the best aspects of the Series for me, and I think menage-a-trois is hot.

**** I have recommended [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), quite a few times during past week already. It's an excellent fic all by itself, even though it doesn't go explicitly into their romantic relationships.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), goes explicitly into their relationships, but the main plot is about fighting zombie battleship BismarckMort, with the help of a recalled HMS Hood.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain.

  Harry/Hermione
#+end_quote

Sadly, this pairing written in a believable way is way too rare. Either Harry is completely OOC and she is arm candy, or Hermione is just bossing Harry around. Also, both are almost always way too attractive. They were meant to be average, not porn stars.

Is it too much to ask for a close to canon characterisation of these two if they are shipped together?

**** This is surprisingly rare, since most authors feel like the more "emotions" they put in, the grander the love. That being said, there are a few I can recommend.

linkffn(4924843; 3752722; 9376485; 7418877; 6201549; 6557422; 8847585; 7502511; 6212250)

The first five are more comedy focused, the others are more serious. As you can see, I only know one-shots because most longer stories just overdo things. I don't want to read a drama trying to reach Romeo&Juliette's level of angst, tragedy and stupidity, I want to read of two friends who eventually become more without some soulbond, instant proclamations of undying love, will-they-won't-they bullshit or grand, exaggerated gestures.

There's also linkffn(5485394), and while smut, it has a better romance plot than most romance stories on FFN.

**** More action ≠ More interesting story.

If I can tell by paragraph 5 that it will be a Lord OP Harry story, I can predict the main "twists" with 95% accuracy. That does not make a story more interesting. Same goes for adding depth by coming up with some pureblood culture BS. Perhaps it is because few authors come up with even remotely original plots or even a canon twist that hasn't been done 652985 times. Action does not make a story interesting by default, the same way explosions do not make a movie good or more interesting.

** I'm okay with:

Harry/Ginny - she was literally made for him. She would do almost anything Harry asked and they'd hardly ever argue, and Harry would need that. However, I'm not a big fan of it because Harry shouldn't have to marry Ginny to feel like he's a part of the Weasley family. Also when I write Epilogue-compliant stories, I have to base her on OotP-Ginny or I'll go mad with such a boring character.

Possibly Harry/Fleur - she can definitely hold her own, otherwise she wouldn't be selected for the TWT.

Harry/Tonks - once he's graduated from school. He could use the excitement she'd bring.

But I prefer an in-canon OC (Harry/Daphne, Harry/Susan, etc.). They're characters that can be developed however you wished, and Susan even has a similar background to Harry (losing quite a bit of her family), so it wouldn't be hard to make her compatible.

***** Yes, but by the same logic, characters like Tonks, young Bellatrix Black would not result in an OOC Harry. Hell, you can write Harry/Hermione with him in character. Short of People like Voldemort, Snape or any of the Malfoys, Harry does not have to be OOC for it to work. It resulting in OOC Harry is just bad writing.
