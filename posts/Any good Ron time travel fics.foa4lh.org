I've read a really good abandoned fic where Ron pretends he's seer, and I honestly just want more Ron content. I don't care about pairings, anything or nothing is fine. Preferably something that touches on Fred's death


** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

Ehhhh, it fits in some ways.

The problem is that Ron for some reason is hated by many in this fandom, for mo actual reason. "Hs Is A BaD FrIeNd!! HaRrY HeRmIoNe MaKeS MoRe SeNsE RoN Is AbUsIvE"

Which is fucking stupid.

*** Thanks! I agree, the Ron/Weasley bashing gets annoying. I especially hate when they bash Molly. Like. Bruh Molly is a bamf.

**** Agreed. I think it's because of their movie adaptation.

For my sanity's sake I treat the books and the movies as separate universes, like how Marvel comics and the MCU are separate universes.

  A soul from our world is thrown into the body of Ron Weasley in the exact moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Teenage hormones, dark lords, and missing memories is a hell of a combination. SI

** Linkao3(A game of chess by kirinin) is one of the best finished time travel stories I've read and focuses on Ron time traveling back after the war was lost. Concise, well-written, and the ending might surprise you

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
