everybody knows that you need to have the intent to kill to successfully cast a killing curse. But what if you didn't have the intent to kill, only the intent to injure. since people are smart enough to not try and shield against an ak, you could probably get your opponent on their toes very fast in a duel, do you think it would work?

Fanon. Canon only states you need "power behind it".

The only Unforgiveable we are told requires a specific mental state is the Cruciatus.

*** Bellatrix spoke spoke generally of unforgivables and said you need to mean *them* if she meant just thr Cruciatus she probably would have said it.

  “Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson ---”

**** 1. I think the context is clear that she's talking about the Cruciatus specifically. She elaborates on the phrase "you need to mean them" with the words "you need to really want to cause pain".

2. In DH, Harry successfully casts the Imperius curse without any specific intent/mental state, showing that Bellatrix's statement can't refer to the Unforgiveables generally.

3. It's not clear that Bellatrix is correct even about the Cruciatus. In DH Harry is able to cast it successfully with righteous anger. He goes on to say Bellatrix was right but this just appears to be Harry misunderstanding Belltrix's point, because once again he has fuelled the Cruciatus with anger rather than sadistic pleasure.

My view is that Bellatrix is describing /one approach/ to casting curses - perhaps an approach which delivers particularly powerful results - but it is not the only way.

I took that as her meaning you need to mean them for the unforgivables in general, and "you need to really want to cause pain" as an example of what that means for the cruciatus since thats what Harry tried to use.

Harry also thinks he did a bad job because he didn't mean it. And follows up by using it again after recalling what Bellatrix told him.

Thats debatable, him torturing somebody for spitting on his teacher and then saying he meant it, is certainly closer to sadistic pleasure than it is to righteous anger.

****** Sorry, you're right. I went back and read the Imperius section of DH; I recalled the bit where Harry throws it around like candy and it works perfectly fine; I didn't recall the bit later on where he casts it again because his victims have all gone blank rather than behaving properly.

Really need to do a proper HBP/DH re-read - have read those 2 far fewer times than the earlier books.
