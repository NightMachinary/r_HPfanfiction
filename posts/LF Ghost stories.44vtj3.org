The ghosts all have so much potential for great stories, like the Bloody Baron and Helena - both pre and post death. Then there's Binns, the Friar, and probably others. Any out there? Any writers think it's worth writing?


** Yes. Could be excellent. Give it a shot and let me know, I'd like to read it.

*** Aw, I unfortunately can't write, I lack the focus, the dedication, and the organization to write a decent plot, research known canon, and the writing skills to not sound like a 14 yr old aspiring writer. I'd embarrass myself and disappoint people when I eventually got bored and abandoned it. I just like reading.

It just occurred to me the humour in the oft-repeated Slytherin idea that Gryffindors are hot tempered and prone to physical violence...yet their own house ghost is a hot tempered murderer who committed a crime of passion
