I remember reading a Fanfiction a while back now that I'm sure I enjoyed, but for the life of me I cannot find it again!

I'm sure it was either a Hermione/Sirius or Hermione/Severus, fairly sure it was post war and they had a baby girl who was a child of prophecy and the ministry of magic tried to take the baby away. I'm sure that Draco was in it and gave her a bracelet to be able to track her. It's au definitely as I think Lupin survived and there was a group of death eaters determined to take the baby.

Please help me find it again! I've gotten utterly fixated on this and cannot for the life of me find it anywhere!


** Not sure, but try using the “what's that fic” flair instead.
