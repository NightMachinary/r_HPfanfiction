So when I write a story, I use a sort of comic book character-esque naming process for chapter titles. Like Batman, all my titles follow a theme. Well I'm writing a WBWL fic, but one where the two brothers are like Weasley twins close, if not more. If I could get suggestions for 'two' or 'double' themed phrases or words I'd be very grateful. So far I have these:

Better Than One

Double Trouble

Seeing Double

Double Take

Two Timer

Thick As Thieves

Two Cents

Fool Us Twice

Two Minds

Two Can Play

Two's Company

Dual Cores

Thank you!


** Two Can Keep a Secret (for a chapter with a death)

Twice Shy (for after a betrayal)

Twice as Nice

A Stopped Clock is Right Twice a Day (with time turners?)

Think Twice

Lightning Never Strikes Twice (for a chapter with a suspicious coincidence?)

Cheap at Twice the Price (for cheap purchases or very worthwhile ones)

Two in the Bush (from a bird in hand is worth two in the bush)

** Double Exposure- when a photograph film frame is used twice, ending up with a ghost of one picture on top of the other. Suitable for many themes.
