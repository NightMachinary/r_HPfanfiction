This year I'm competing with my girlfriend who is doing a '50 books challenge', her aim being to read 50 books throughout the year. I've decided to put my own spin on it by reading 50 HP fics this year, as they're the only thing I read nowadays (due to having an app on my phone, and my phone constantly on my person).

I'm looking for recommendations of fanfictions to read (preferably that I can download from FF.Net, as thats all the 'Fanfiction Pro' app allows) and add to my favourites/list for the year. I've got a fair amount saved on my profile ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2015563/Possum-Hefner]]) but I like reading series', or books with sequels. Anything over 100K preferably (I like launching into something thats 300k+, to really sink your teeth into) and complete, or long enough to not matter if its abandoned.

I'm not adverse to Slash, but I don't really enjoy it unless its subtle. Asides that, I don't have any turnoffs and pretty much enjoy all the cliches and crossovers.

I think this is actually the ONLY firefly crossover that doesn't die within a few chapters.

** This is a list of the longer stories I've read that have stuck with me. I tried to include finished ones or ones currently in progress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Maruader's Plan]] by CatsAreCool (in progress): Sirius decides to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and makes protecting Harry his priority. AU GOF.

The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1536120/1/Secrets][Secrets]] by Elizabeth Culmer (finished) CoS according to Ginny: Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year. How did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending. COMPLETE!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] by Thanfiction (finished, didn't like the sequel “Slaugh”, enjoyed the third “A Pecctas” but it's unfinished and hasn't been updated in years) Originally posted as the Dumbledore's Army Series: A novel following Neville and the D.A. through the 7th year at Hogwarts under the reign of Snape and the Carrows. Contains ALL previously posted sections.

Warning: Author is batshit crazy.

Warning: Scenes of graphic, questionable consent and non-consent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4413791/1/Paradise-Lost][Paradise Lost]] by madame.alexandra (finished) Lily Evans's seventh year. Head girl. And sure, Potter as head boy was a drawback, but she could get over that. She had everything going for her--until someone ripped it all away. JL Angst--WARNING: Rape. COMPLETE.

The two must plan a wedding around their fighting friends, warring families, and each other's stubbornness. EWE, post-war, disregarding Remus, Sirius, and Colin's deaths and the fact that gay marriage is not legal in the UK. Rated M for later chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9069869/1/Labor-of-Love][Labor of Love]] by QueenyMidas (finished) After their beautiful wedding, Draco supposes he has to hold up his end of the bargain on the topic of 'offspring'. On top of that, their friends seem to be going through struggles of their own. Their family seems to be being tested once again, leaving many to wonder if it can weather the storm. EWE, disregarding Sirius, Remus, and Colin Creevey's deaths, sequel to MBFPW.

EDIT: I think some of these are in your favourites already and I know some of the more popular ones are often recc'ed. I figured I'd include them anyway for anyone else looking for something to read.

** So... I've worked through a list of my favourites and took out all that I found in your given list, so these are left (all Complete and on ff.net, most with 100k+ Words) :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's boys]]

Well... okay, this is only 84k words long, but I wanted to highly recommend it anyway! If you can think of a fic with nice Dursleys, this is the one! Also, it's pretty funny with some sad moments too. A little bit too focused on horse races, but other than that... awesome!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis][Psychosis]]

This fic is quite dark and a bit on the gore-y side sometimes (it has Harry hurting himself quite strongly), but I really enjoyed reading it (well, as enjoying as reading about a "mental illness" and a pretty broken Harry can be) and it /is/ over 200k Words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]]

Timetravel fic where Snape comes back to Harry's first visit in Diagon Alley. Everything is pretty AU but as far as I remember (my last read has already been a while) I pretty much enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]]

Kind of similar to "To Shape and Change", also mentor!Snape and stuff, but also really great, also it has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5843959/1/The-Best-Revenge-Time-of-the-Basilisk][Sequel]], that also has more than 100k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]]

Well, that one does have Slash inside, although the romance (if you may call it that) is very slow moving. There are a few sex scenes iirc, but you can skip them easily. And the story is so very good, it's definitely a good, long read! (It also has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][Sequel]] that is just as long, but on hiatus.)

Hope there is something for you. :)

*** I haven't actually read any of these, so thanks! I think if you like dark!Harry books, then read 'Aspirations', it was written years ago and is a tad long, essentially diverting around book 4 when Ginny is the only one who believes Harry about not putting his name in the Goblet of Fire, and that begins a long downward spiral...........

***** I was talking about breeding darkness. The only ongoing author approved sequel is the one by Danyaelle-same [sp?]. At the moment, I think all of Athey's ficts are abandoned [if it was a hiatus she would eventially come back to them. But The Darkness series is confirmed abandoned]. I have kind of given up reading them.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095379][The one I am talking about is pretty good]]. Same tone and stuff. The only annoyance is that you have to wade through the chapters anthey posted to get to the original stuff. She updates on the regualr and all but man is that annoying. Oh well, it's good to have if Athey winds up deleting her ficts or something....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexander Quick and the Thorn Circle]]: First in a series of four so far. Fifth is currently being written. About an American witch, very much in the vein of the original Harry Potter books. Very good stories, and pretty much stand on their own as they don't include any HP characters. Same world though. Alexandra also has the same exact birthday as me which is awesome.

I also liked Innocent which has two sequels and is a WIP. It is a 'what if Sirius cleared his name amd raised Harry' type story.
