I'd really appreciate it if anyone could rec me some (preferably long) fics where the character grows up in an orphanage/care home/the foster system. Thanks!


** I asked about this too a little while back - orphanage fics are such interesting stories, aren't they? :)

I got some good responses - some that were just the usual 'Harry was raised by someone else with minimal paperwork', but there are a few that involve care homes and orphanages and such.

**** Sure, happy to help. I'm hoping you get a few more orphanage-specific than I did with your post. Like I said, they're such interesting stories. :)

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.
