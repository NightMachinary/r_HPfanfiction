#+begin_quote
  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

**** It not particularly bad. Definitely should be read, and the next reading should be the reviews debunking the faulty science. Anyone with a scientific mind will enjoy the discourse. Academics are likely to hate it though.

***** Bruh, yudkowsky is a joke. Like I wont even go into the fic, but I work in the same field as him, and everyone thinks hes such a blowhard. Like Ive had to listen to him at AAAI 2015 in Austin, and he just comes across as that kid who always made shit up, and just overblows everything he talks about.

His papers are actually pretty ok, even if I dont agree with some of the conclusions drawn (like complex value systems for AI, a field I am deeply invested in). But his writing in MOR sounds just like he talks, and its not a fun read--especially when theres so many people I have to listen to that sound just like him on a daily basis.

****** Well having to work with him will definitely make it harder to separate his fic from himself. I suspect it's just a niche kind of thing I enjoy. I used to watch a lot of ancient aliens theorists too just to see the bullshit they were making up. Like there are some cultures I wouldn't bother reading about if I didn't get faulty information and then read about it to correct myself.

*** HPMoR is a mostly awful fic, but I don't understand downvoting you for answering the question. HPMoR IS a fic that deals with just that. Downvotes are for irrelevance, not disagreements, and HPMoR is a 100% relevant fic to mention.
