I'm looking for a Dumbledore who will:

- Choose a more suitable childhood for a boy who is destined to kill or be killed.
- Removes or circumvents the DADA curse
- Makes better decisions in regards to staffing

And so on.


** Blueowl's fic The Trusted Hero linkffn(11155084) is excellent and demonstrates an intelligent and supportive Dumbledore but it doesn't quite fit your criteria as it takes place after Voldemort's resurrection. It's a spin-off from the fanfic 'The Hidden Hero' by Evebb (which I didn't really care for.)

Another competent, supportive Dumbledore is in White Lies (And Other Misdemeanors) by AzarDarkstar linka03(565778). It's also post Voldemort resurrection.

Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter linkffn(8215565) demonstrates an intelligent and cagey Dumbledore who has very, very good reason for the "mistakes" he makes and is quite clever in how he circumvents the issues and helps Harry.

#+end_quote

And what, precisely would be a "more suitable childhood for a boy who is destined to kill or be killed"? Raising Harry as a child soldier? That might give him more "power", but that would be power that Vodemort knows very well, and certainly not "power he knows not".

Not giving him to his closest blood relatives? Lily's blood protection --- which just stopped an unstoppable curse and slew one of the two mightiest wizards in the land --- would be forfeit. Who would protect Harry then? The Ministry, which is on its last legs from the war and has no shortage of Voldemort sympathizers? The Order, which has just been shown to have at least one Death Eater spy trusted by everyone?

With difficulty, cunning, and stealth. Once by hitching a ride on someone else's soul -- I'd be shocked if the protections anywhere else would catch that. Once by enchanted diary -- that's an honest miss; the wards should catch dark artifacts. Once via a vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement, and at that point Snape was installed as headmaster, which presumably gave him the authority and ability to alter the protections on the castle to allow a horde of Death Eaters and Voldemort himself in the front door.

That's three times over the course of five years, even when cherry-picking the most hectic period possible.

You forgot about polyjuiced Moody, which was probably Dumbledore's worst showing in regards to infiltration of Hogwarts.

I do agree with you however, that one of most powerful wizards (if not the most powerful wizard) in the world would have been a much better guardian for Harry than his abusive, magic-fearing relatives, family though they may have been.

****** A character's competence should be judged on what they did given the information and resources they had available (and had reasonable ways of knowing they had available) at the time. Ordinary magic available in canon favors the attacker over the defender. Only epic-level magic like sacrificial protection or Fidelius could have protected Harry adequately, at least given the information available to Dumbledore at he time the decision had to be made.

In particular, IIRC this was while Bellatrix was still at large. Dumbledore had no way of knowing that she would be caught torturing the Longbottoms. What if she weren't?

#+begin_quote
  His father, rather. Parents can have other people help out with parenting, and they can have babysitters for their kids, and they often have jobs.
#+end_quote

Yes. However, that would mean delegating Harry's protection to other, weaker people. People who might, by the way, be compromised the way whoever betrayed the Fidelius was.

It would also leave Harry in the public eye of the wizarding world, making him a political puck, and forcing Dumbledore to expend yet more effort protecting him from that as well.

Well, yes, if you're allowed to conjure competent OCs on the good guys' side /ex nihilo/, things get a lot easier, and you have to make much fewer trade-offs. In fact, why don't you conjure a second Dumbledore while you're at it? Actually, why stop at two? :P

Brilliant idea! If only such magic were mentioned in canon and were easy enough to be used on all the ways items can come into Hogwarts! (The closest thing is Thief's Downfall, which is something only Goblins are shown to have --- and they have /one/ of it.)

*Edit:* Actually, it turns out that as [[/u/FreakingTea]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eyewe/a_more_competent_realistic_and_grounded_dumbledore/ctlgyh3]]) points out and as [[/u/wordhammer]] ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eyewe/a_more_competent_realistic_and_grounded_dumbledore/ctlmlod]]) quotes, Secrecy Sensor, a magical device that can, apparently, be used by a Squib, does exist. So, indeed, that may have been preventable with adequate security measures. Funnily enough, it might have failed to detect Tom Riddle's Diary, since Ginny wasn't actually /sneaking/ it in.

#+begin_quote
  That's three times over the course of five years, even when cherry-picking the most hectic period possible.
#+end_quote

Also, fake Moody in GoF and Sirius in PoA. I'm counting 5 times in 6 years. You are right, in OotP the infiltration was overt and lawful, so, perhaps, not /every/ year, unless someone got a ministry official with an Imperius.

As for it being a hectic period, fine, assume no successful infiltrations in the prior decade. That still means, at this rate, 2-3 successful infiltrations before Harry turns 11.

And, if you want to have multiple lines of defense, remember that every line you add degrades and restricts Harry's childhood.

Dumbledore had an explanation after the fact for the Harry-burns-Dumbledore effect, but he didn't seem to understand what mechanism the protections would take beforehand. That means that, for any mechanism by which Harry could have come to harm, Dumbledore could not have rationally relied on Lily's protection to defend him from it.

The primary protection Harry had was that the Death Eaters were stupid. They were too stupid to nab him when he left the Hogwarts Express. They were too stupid to follow him from the Hogwarts Express on brooms with invisibility cloaks to find where he lived. They were too stupid to look at Ministry records to find him, even when they took over the Ministry in all but name.

A protection on his house would be pretty useless. The Death Eaters could easily have transfigured the sidewalk in front of his house into a deep pit and put a glamour on top so he wouldn't notice until he fell to his death. They could have set fires all around his house. They could have gotten a dragon and plunked it down on Privet Drive. They could have transfigured the surrounding neighborhood into a giant basin and filled it with water to force Harry out. They could have slipped Dudley a handful of cash to swap Harry's blanket for a cursed one, or one that's been exposed to someone with dragonpox, or to put a potted devil's snare under his bed.

In order for the protection to actually work, it has to have some sort of mystical effect that prevents people from /thinking/ of ways to track Harry down and hurt him. I won't accept a spell that forces an entire nation to hold an idiot ball. It might even be canon (it wouldn't be too dissimilar from the canon Fidelius charm), but it's too powerful and too frustrating for me to accept in anything I write.

#+begin_quote

When Dumbledore is available, they can go out, and Harry can enjoy Diagon Alley, parks, movies, playing with other children, what have you. Otherwise, he has to stay at one of several Fidelius safehouses (which can include the grounds as well as the house) with at least two guardians (who have taken Unbreakable Vows to protect him) and Fawkes (who is instructed to move him to an even more secret safehouse, or possibly to Nicholas Flamel's house, since Flamel has managed to protect a source of immortality and great wealth for five centuries). And we'll throw in three house elves if we can find them -- two on defense and one on evacuation.

If Dumbledore is often available, that's not terribly restrictive. If Dumbledore is not often available, that is moderately restrictive.

Well, there you go. And then, a whole bunch of Death Eaters got off; and who knows how many avoided capture, not to mention unmarked sympathizers?

Canon does not give explicit reasons why neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort spammed Unbreakable Vows to enforce secrecy and obedience, but making them an "I Swear on my Magic" fanon type mechanism for making commitments and verifying truth would break the whole of the story and the setting, so there have to be some. Unbreakable Vows being used sparingly is as canon as their existence in the first place.

Even that aside, history shows that while the Boy-Who-Lived was a celebrity, the number of people willing to actually lift a finger to help him --- much less risk their lives by taking an Unbreakable Vow and serving as his bodyguards --- was very limited.

#+begin_quote

Being able to shift around competencies like that is called "specialization", a cornerstone of civilization as we know it. Say that I cloned myself and gave my clone my dish-washing competence, while retaining my Internet debates competence. Now, we could, collectively, debate on the Internet and get the dishes washed, at the cost of housing and feeding two of me instead of one. In the wizarding world, these latter costs are negligible. So, yeah, you're giving Dumbledore significant extra resources here.

Yeah, epic magic is like that. It's sort of like the Fidelius Charm: it doesn't matter /how/ it prevents an attacker from learning the secret (except through the Secret Keeper).

Well, that, or, you know, epic magic that requires human sacrifice, cannot be invoked deliberately by the sacrifice, and is triggered by once-a-decade circumstances; epic magic of the kind that blocks unblockable curses and kills unkillable wizards, prevents them from finding hurting Harry, /especially/ when he's living with the Dursleys.

Again, this is epic magic that works on holistic, conceptual level. Yes, it would stop all of these workarounds.

It's telling that the only ones who were actually able to attack or endanger Harry while he lived at 4 Privet Drive were non-Death-Eaters: Umbridge, Durslesys, Aunt Marge. (There was also Dobby, of course, but he was halping.)

A Harry who grows up in the wizarding world grows up as a child celebrity and a political puck. Dursleys are highly suboptimal, but considering how little effect their abuse actually had on his development (I treat it as a literary equivalent of cartoon violence), a maximum security childhood interspersed with celebrity outings would have probably been worse.

Also, Harry Potter is important, but he isn't /that/ important, and would be even less so if Dumbledore were more proactive in other areas. Every one of these resources could be better used for some other purpose.

Quite possibly the only way to defeat Voldemort isn't that important? It's a bit more than a minor let-down if Voldemort wins.

It's a matter of thousands of lives, with a chance of costing millions.

Unless Dumbledore was a seer and had prophesied that Harry would defeat Voldemort for certain, and that that wouldn't require any special training, or unless he was a blithering idiot, he must have known it was woefully insufficient to shove Harry out into the Muggle world and give him no training to kill Dark Lords or survive against Death Eaters.

Well, sacrificial protection is something that one can't really plan for or rely on, since it requires pretty specific conditions, as well as several often improbable actions from the attacker. If it happens, you use it. If it doesn't, you have to do something else.

Again, he doesn't need to know details, no more than he needs to know all the possible mundane ways to discover the secret when casting the Fidelius. Notably, he does understand it enough to augment it (since he refers to a "charm I placed on you") in OotP.

More precisely, he is just the one Voldemort believes in, which gives the prophecy power over him. But, tyrants create their own enemies, as Dumbledore explains out, and Harry wasn't the only candidate either. Also, a big factor contributing to his importance is the sacrificial protection that he carries, as long as he lives with the Dursleys.

Yes. That's why if sacrificial protection (with some unpleasant relatives) weren't available, you might consider some security measures, even if you wouldn't rearranged the world to make it happen. However, sacrificial protection is there for the taking, ans it's the only protection that /nothing/ Voldemort or his agents can do to circumvent. Indeed, if Harry is that critical, it's doubly important to keep him at the Dursleys, because nothing Dumbledore can do can match that.

#+end_quote

The "Harry needs special training!" argument was already addressed in my original post. Harry has the potential to defeat Voldemort because he has the power that Voldemort knows not. Being better at violence is a power that Voldemort knows better than anyone.

Also, no amount of training given to a child who, while he is plenty talented, is not as talented as, say, Snape and Hermione, to say nothing of Voldemort and Dumbledore, can make up for forfeiting the sacrificial protection, especially if you are planning on sending Harry to Hogwarts.

    Having a larger number of people involved in projects with each of them being specialized adds communication overhead and makes planning harder.
  #+end_quote

  It's still an extra resource.
#+end_quote

I suppose that counts even more since the Order of the Phoenix doesn't seem to plan at all or even communicate much. The overhead in planning and communication just vanishes when you don't talk to each other.

My disbelief in this far-reaching magical protection comes from the fact that the existence of such magic in a magic system is so unbelievably broken, and the ability of a character to rely on it is so damaging for a story's tension, that no reasonable author would actually create a magic system that gave everyone in an entire country the idiot ball. And even if you get past that, you're left having to write a ton of idiots. Assuming that's what Rowling intended and assuming that she wrote Dumbledore to realize the extent and potency of Lily's protection, it would certainly behoove him to put Harry with the Dursleys. I just can't credit it.

*** Ok, so we've established that Harry must be left with the Dursleys to protect him from Voldemort. But why not give him sufficient protection from the Dursleys themselves? Have someone more competetant than a batty old squib to stand guard, have tutors visit and teach him. Give the Dursleys incentives to treat him fairly, whether financial rewards or monitoring of some kind (carrot and stick).

**** That's a better question. My headcanon is that epic, conceptual magic like sacrificial protection can be finicky: how much pressure, monitoring, and magical interference would the Dursleys tolerate before simply kicking Harry out; and if they were coerced into taking and keeping Harry in, how could love-based protection survive that? Petunia did not like taking in Harry one bit; but she did it anyway, of her own free will. This is important.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

Its just this non-reaction by everybody. Also, the demon character annoyed me to no end after the first dialoge (and I highly suspect it to be a self-insert).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
