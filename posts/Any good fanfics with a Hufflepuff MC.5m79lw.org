I've searched to no avail. There seems to be no Hufflepuff MCs in any fanfiction, which kind of saddens me and I'm sure my fellow badgers feel the same way. Perhaps I'm not looking in the right places, so I seek your help. (Can you imagine, a Hufflepuff not good at finding...)

To be clear, I don't mean fanfictions where Harry Potter has been rewritten and some major character is in Hufflepuff. I'm looking for an original character, romance fics between a OC and canon character are okay. Thank you!

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** I've written a half complete Susan/Justin HBP/DH romance that is 100% (AFAIK) canon compliant safely buried in my gdrive. It must be a stage new fanfic writers go through; writing something canon compliant out of JKR respect and admiration (missing moments, nearly OC characters, or pre or post epilogue). Sort of like the DLP post on stages of fanfic reading. I always found Justin to be an excellent potential MC. There is the implication he comes from muggle wealth, perhaps even some archaic peerage title. Being able to throw money around and buying respect, despite being muggleborn just seems like a really interesting aspect to explore.

** I've got you fellow badger! Well, not really, since there are so few fics to choose from, but here's a nice long one with multiple canon characters:

Finding Himself by minisinoo: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF]])

IIRC, Rozarka on Archive of Our Own has written a bunch with Cedric and with Zacharias.

You also might have more luck looking for specific characters - e.g. Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Tonks etc.

Also, a lot of fanfiction sorts Teddy into Hufflepuff so maybe try some next gen fics as well.

Also, try writing yourself! We need Puff characters, and maybe we'll have to write them ourselves :)

I swear I just read something amazing with a Puff in it, and I can't remember...

** Not exactly the Main character but the core group of friends in my Tamblin stories are Tamblin (the MC, and OC, and a Ravenclaw) and three Hufflepuffs (Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, and Cascata Vega, another OC). Cascata in particular is a very central figure to the plots.

here's the first (of five): linkffn('Tamblin Demosthene and the Artiste's Alcove')

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

** Hmm, there was one where Cedric loved and was instead just courses in the graveyard - it ended up being Cedric/Hermione. An older fic - the sequel was abandoned before the sixth book came out I think. The name is escaping me at the moment - it's not the Psychic Serpent, I just remember reading it around the same time.
