I just reread Draco Dormiens, the first novel in Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy. The works have been deleted by the author, but if you look for them it's easy to find PDF versions. If you look more deeply, you can also find well-formatted epubs to use with e-readers.

It's impossible to talk about these books without addressing the controversy surrounding them, but I'll do so at the end of my review. Let's talk about the story first.

As I remembered it, Draco Dormiens is an excellent fanfiction novel. It's not a long novel, at around 70.000 words, while the other two books in the trilogy are much longer.

It only follows canon up to Goblet of Fire, since it was written before Order of the Phoenix. The premise is this: During a Potions class, there's a weird accident with Polyjuice Potion and Harry and Draco become indefinitely bodyswapped. The need to keep this a secret, the even greater need to find an antidote and avoid a conspiration against Harry's life, and a love triangle where both Draco and Harry are interested in Hermione, power the plot of the novel.

The relatively short length suits Draco Dormiens. It's a YA romantic comedy and it's also an adventure novel, and the two things coexist together quite well. The plotting is tight and fast-paced and it never feels like fluff. I think this is an advantage, because even if you are not a great fan of YA romantic comedy you can enjoy this story.

At the time I originally read this, it made me look at the character of Draco Malfoy in a different way. Not that I thought a redemption arc for him was likely to happen in canon, but it made me think that it would be cool if it did. What's the fascination with Draco? Well, as depicted here he's sophisticated, snarky, fashion-conscious, strong, bright and sharp. A bad boy on the surface, with some seriously evil relatives, but not evil himself. Of course, canon did not go that way. Canon!Draco turned out to be pathetic rather than dashing. He fought on evil's side but turned out not to have the stomach for it, and ended up demoralized and happy just to survive. A more realistic Draco, I think, but probably not as attractive or interesting as the one in this fanfic.

As an adventure story it's good, and as romantic comedy it works too. It's a pleasant read, but I wouldn't have wanted canon to go that way. The price of having this fine romantic comedy is placing Draco, Harry and Hermione in the spotlight and leaving little room for other characters. A clear victim of this is Ron, but at least I liked that there was no Ron bashing. Ron may be under the spotlight less often than in canon, but when he is, he is quite cool too.

The characters were all a bit OOC, but not enough to make them feel like different people. Hermione tended to flirt more than in canon, but she was still Hermione. Draco was the most OOC, of course. It's an idealized Draco rather than the pathetic Draco in canon. Harry was also Harry and his always snarky relationship and gradual bonding with this version of Draco rang true. Among the secondary characters, I was surprised by how wise Sirius was. Not the grudge-holding, act-before-you-think Sirius from canon.

All in all, a very good read. Definitely of professional quality.

Now let's talk a bit about the controversy...

Some context: It's difficult to explain to those who were not there how huge the Draco trilogy was in the early 2000s. This and a very limited amount of other fandom works at that time opened people's eyes to the possibility that fanfiction could actually be very good, that in some senses it could be as good as canon.

I was disconnected from fandom for years, reading mainstream work, but when I came back I learned of the vicious controversy that these books had ended up originating within fandom. Probably you are aware of it, but if not here's an overview:

[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Draco_Trilogy]]

[[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Cassandra_Claire_Plagiarism_Debacle]]

Make of that what you may. Reading the evidence, and as much as I admire her and am grateful to her for entertaining me for so many hours, there's no question that Cassandra Claire acted wrongly. I'm not sure whether it was a cunning plan to gain prestige and get a professional contract or whether it was just the naivety of early pioneers of fanfiction figuring out what was allowable and what wasn't... I mean, if fanfiction is not for profit and it is all about taking someone else's characters and world and using them to tell stories, is it so wrong to use snarky one-liners from other works and put them in your characters' mouths? But if you do that, is it so much wronger to use a few descriptive passages from other works? ... Slippery slope indeed! If you go that way, where does it end?

Still, even though she did wrong, I'm not quite ready to lynch her. Perhaps she was dishonest, but perhaps she was just a young but talented fan writer making mistakes while trying to get out the best fanfiction she could, or perhaps it was a combination of the two. In any case, I still have to respect the talent and the extenuating work of writing such fanfiction novels. I mean, I could steal quotes from Blackadder and Buffy and other places, and still I would not be able to put together a coherent and well-written novel. Writing is a lot of work, and writing well takes work and talent. If someone argues that this novel would be nothing without those quotes, I have to respectfully disagree. There's solid writing here, beyond the borrowed elements. On the other hand, those quotes made the characters funnier, so part of the admiration she was getting for her fanfiction should have gone to the real authors of those quotes.

So that's enough about the writer. I'm reading her fanfiction, after all, not marrying her. I understand if some people are turned off by this controversy, but I have always found it easy to separate the author's behavior from the quality of the story.

TLDR: I enjoyed this fanfiction a lot, despite the plagiarism controversy around it.

So what do you think?

EDIT: It's not slash fanfiction. Sorry if I gave that impression. I did not want to mention how the triangle ended up, so as not to give spoilers, but the (very vanilla) romantic elements were Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione.


** I've never read Draco Dormiens, but I heard that beyond using quotes and passages from other texts, her characters in Draco Dormiens were basically copied and pasted into her Mortal Instruments series and that the plotline was kind of similar too. Just wondering if you had any thoughts on that?

*** I haven't read any of her professionally published work, so I can't comment on that.

However, after reading Draco Dormiens I think that it would be easy to use a similar dynamic between the main three characters in an original YA fantasy fiction. After all, this triangle was not part of the Harry Potter canon, and then you can have these archetypes:

1) The "bad" boy hero, who turns out to be good, although he still enjoys being difficult, sarcastic and snarky.

2) The "good" boy hero, a more classic teen fantasy hero, who has a rivalry with the bad boy and can keep up with him in terms of snarkiness.

3) The smart girl hero, meant to be a proxy for the female teenage reader.

Both boys then fall for the girl, and she's attracted to both of them and agonizing over which one is right for her. The three are forced by circumstances to join forces against a common foe, and that makes the two boys start developing a grudging respect for each other, and ultimately forming a brotherly bond.

I mean, this is YA 101. If you get that in the hands of a competent writer it's difficult not to appeal to the target audience.

In that sense, writing the fanfic could be seen as training for writing the original series. It does not seem wrong to me. I mean, triangles like that are commonplace in YA literature, what makes the difference is how well they are written.

Of course, with the original series the author cannot plagiarize any lines or passages from other authors...

*** It's been years since I've read either the Draco trilogy or City of Bones, but from what I remember, only Draco's character was basically copy/pasted in to CoB (as Jace?). There's one scene that was lifted word-for-word out of DD and put into CoB, but I recall Claire herself saying she did that because she like the scene so much she wanted to use it in her "real" book. Some people were pissy about that for some reason, but she wrote it, she can put it wherever she wants IMO.

The other two main characters weren't any more similar to Harry or Hermione than your standard YA character tropes that [[/u/farseer2]] described.

I do remember people running around yelling plagiarism before she published and it was just her fanfics, though, which is a bit silly when she admits she didn't write those lines, credits who did, /and/ it's fanfiction to begin with.

** I remember enjoying this in my early days, but really falling out with it when I realized all the cleverest, funniest bits I really enjoyed were directly ripped from other sources. Like, dozens in a chapter, entire lengthy conversations between characters. The color of humor wasn't even hers - it was ripped from dozens of more talented people with zero credit. It really discolored my opinion of her writing - when you can't tell if what you're enjoying is just copy/paste repurposed. How am I supposed to think her characterization of Draco is good when so many of the snarky words she put in his mouth she pulled out of someone else's character's?

Overall meh. When all the memorable pieces of your story were written by someone else, I think you're less a talented writer than someone with a good eye for putting together what people like. That she's clearly very good at.

*** You're welcome. I think this fanfic is interesting because it's enjoyable and also because, if you love Harry Potter fanfiction, this is part of the history of the genre, and it had a large influence in attracting new authors and readers and defining some of the tropes.

Of course, it's also part of the infamous history of the genre because of its fall from grace due to the plagiarism controversy and the bitter war it caused among the fandom.

It doesn't seem like that big of a deal in retrospect, but it really rubbed me the wrong way for years, so I refuse to read anything else she's written. Especially knowing that her published characters are basically her HP ones, renamed.

**** Luckily (for me) I hit a wall at some point and stopped being interested in the genre, so I'm not even tempted. I secretly judge other bookish people for reading her books, especially the fannish type, but I realize that's probably me holding a silly grudge for way too long. I just keep away from her myself.

It's a shame, I want to be happy for and supportive of fic writers who become published career authors. But I only really know about the shitty ones, lol.

*** TBH, I do still think it is a big deal within fanfiction. It's notable that when it came to the more popular excerpts, they were either altered slightly or short. Longer excerpts were from lesser-known works (at least, to her target demographic). I think that very consciously points towards plagiarism and, worse, that she didn't care so long as she thought she wouldn't get caught.

Ultimately, she's a professional, established author and has put a lot of this behind her. But I can't help but wonder what, in her original works, might she have plagiarized if she cared so little for crediting artists before.

That makes sense, actually, if it was published prior to OotP. In GoF, Sirius took risks to talk to Harry, but their conversations were full of good insight and advice. It's when he's imprisoned again that he slips into angry, sullen, grudge-holding borderline prick. For understandable reasons.

I haven't read any of Claire's stuff - either fanfic or professional - and I still remain skeptical. But I enjoyed your review and commentary.

** This is quite interesting. I got into both reading and writing fanfiction pretty late in my life, probably around 2008 or so, and I haven't had the chance to really look up its evolution and how it came to be. I mean it makes me think of how the Fifty Shades series was basically initially a fanfiction based off Twilight. I adore fanfiction and I know of some fanfiction that are almost if not just as good as canon. I also have not read Draco Dormiens and it seems like the perfect plot that I would enjoy so now I have another on my reading list!

** What I think people have forgotten is that it was way more than just a couple of Buffy and Blackadder quotes. I recently reread the original blog postings that were written by the person who caught the plagiarism, and what they caught was huge passages that were taken from a published series of books that were out of print at the time. This person actually posted CC's passages next to the book's passages, and essentially proved that CC would have had to have the book in her lap because it was that verbatim. Once that broke, others started pulling more and more things that were taken as well as not cited in CC's little author notes. Almost every fic she had, every really cool scene, the funniest lines, etc none of it was hers. It makes you wonder how she got her publishing deal.

Facts: The Mortal Instruments was also a title of a Ron/Ginny fic that CC wrote. Jace is Draco. Clary is Ginny.

** I never really had a huge hateboner for CC. I read the Draco Trilogy long after fanfiction left the leatherpants!Draco phase behind and found it to be... good. I have issues with it, of course, but there's lots of cool ideas, and some genuinely good writing in there. I don't know how that might have carried over into her original fiction.

As I recall, she always credited the single lines she borrowed from things like Blackadder, so I didn't see a problem there. What was apparently the problem (though I only know about it secondhand) was her uncredited borrowing from The Hidden Land by Pamela Dean. Apparently (and this is supported by comprehensive documents "exposing" CC is you care to look for them) she lifted entire passages from that book into her fanfic, without crediting this time. That's the part that ticked people off, as far as I know.

As for copypasting characters into her original fiction, I can confirm that's true. Having seen the movie City of Bones, there's a scene in it that's easily recognizable from the Draco Trilogy, I think from the second installment.

That said, I don't have a problem with this. The parts of her fanfic that she created (like that scene) are hers, regardless of being placed in JK's world. I think it's fine to transplant something into original fiction if you think it's good enough.

*** Yes, I agree with this. I do not care that she used some one-liners from Blackadder or Buffy in her fanfiction if she credited them. Fanfiction is about borrowing and doing something cool with what you borrow, as long as you don't make money and don't try to take credit for what you borrow. The uncredited "borrowing" is just wrong, even more so when it's more than a single quote, and you are taking a whole passage, as she did in chapter 9 of the third book.

Having said that, and while it's good she was exposed, for me this does not delete the merits that this trilogy has, and I certainly do not wish the author any harm in her professional career. She did wrong but she has already paid for it, in my opinion, with all the bitter criticism she has received.

** I read the Draco trilogy as she was posting it in the early 2000s, also why I didn't pay attention in class a lot. It was and still is one of the amazing fanfics I read! It has its own place for me, but truly opened my eyes to where fanfiction could go. Also my friends and I used so many of those jokes as inside jokes it was a bit crazy.

I don't agree with what she did later with her own novels, and they never really appealed to me. I have to agree it's definitely one of those grey areas of plagiarism.

For me there's no gray area in plagiarism: There's no excuse using someone else's work (intentionally) and not giving credit or marking it as a quote. I understand inspiration and sometimes we don't remember where we got an idea from, but as soon as you start to copy things word for word and presenting it as your own there's no excuses: you're scum.

** I read these as they were being published back in the day (am An Old), and I do think that the plagiarism "controversy" is a bit blown out of proportion. Claire was about as above board with using lines from other shows as one can be. The end of every chapter included a list of which lines were from which shows to the best of her ability. She did admit that she collected quotes and didn't always write down where they were from, but when we're already within the realm of using someone else's IP (fanfiction), I don't think it's such a great crime to use other sources, too. Especially since she /did/ cite hers.
