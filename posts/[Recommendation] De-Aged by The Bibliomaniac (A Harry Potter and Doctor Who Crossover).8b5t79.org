I actually stumbled upon this gem awhile ago when I was looking for something new to read. I never read this kind of crossover before, so I immediately dived into the story. (Jack was also the Doctor's companion at this time period too.)

Anyways, the Doctor and Jack was hit by a de-ager gun, a weapon used by assassins that “literally youths [someone] out of existence because it doesn't leave a body,” the Doctor stops the process before anything too disastrous happens. However, both of them ended up de-aged to children. In a Doctor-like fashion, he let the TARDIS take them somewhere to find a treatment for the two of them. Thus, they ended up going to Hogwarts set in Harry's third year. Though, the TARDIS gave their cover as first year Hogwart students.

The author's take on this story is truly original and unique in many retrospects. It feels like Doctor Who in terms of story telling and dialogue. Yet, it mixed with the magic of the world of Harry Potter. I also practically adore the character interactions with their wit and humor. Overall, I seriously recommend this fic if you love Harry Potter and Doctor Who. And even if you never heard of Doctor Who (I highly recommend you to check out the show), take a chance with this fic.

  The Doctor and Jack have found themselves to be 11. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix, so the Doctor decides they should attend Hogwarts until they can find a way to return to their proper ages. Here, they make friends, confuse professors, and desperately try to avoid disturbing fixed points in time. Updates on a monthly basis.

** Huh, I saw this once when looking through the HP and DW crossover archive thought it would be cheesy due to the summary. Guess I was probably wrong.

*** I skim through the reviews to see what I am getting into. They usually help in giving me the feeling of a fic.

**** I usually avoid doing that as they reveal major plot points or twists for the story most of the time.

***** True, but to be honest, reviews do not usually encompass a plot point enough to reveal anything major for me. Unless it's a death or something like that.

But, the minimum of the first 3 chapters reviews are enough not to spoiler much anyways.
