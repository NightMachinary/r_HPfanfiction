Hi, I need new reading material and these categories have been of great interest lately. So far, I've really enjoyed stuff like /Red Right Hand/ by Nautical Paramour and /Game On/ by PenguinBuddy. Thanks!


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red) is a great OC-centered story. As for SIs, linkffn(A Curse of Truth) is quite good, as is linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal, and Other Morals). linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) is also a sort-of-self-insert that doubles as a great "raising Tom Riddle" story, although it unfortunately updates /veeeery slowly/.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
