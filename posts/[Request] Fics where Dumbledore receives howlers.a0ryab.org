Aside from witowsmp's /The Time Meddlers/, are there any fics where Dumbledore ends up getting howlers (red ones, not black ones.)? Reason's not that big a deal, as long as he's getting yelled at by an animated letter and envelope.

*** Using a howler to ask someone to pass the bacon... if that isn't audacity, I don't know what is.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
