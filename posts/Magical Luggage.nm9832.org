Well I'm asking for recommendations as well if anyone knows anything similar to this.

I read in some random fic years ago that a wizard's trunk used to grows with them. Like they get a basic wood and metal trunk, when they leave home for the first time and spend years updating and modifying it with what they learn and need during the course of their education according to old culture when pre made stuff wasn't available in stores.

Like in early Hogwarts days, when Hogwarts was just started and children had little to call their own, so they were taught runes, Arthimancy, enchanting and similar stuff as basics and they had to do their own magical crafting because nobody could do that for them and it was sort of a tradition to create and upgrade your own trunk and mainly trunks were used because basic materials, wood, leather and any type of metal (quality of leather and precious metal was basis of differentiating between rich and poor) used to make them was most successful in holding enchantments and runes.


** These fics have some magical madness about wizard space and trunks. There's no self updating trunks I don't think

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
