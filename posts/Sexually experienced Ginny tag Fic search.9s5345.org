** I'm assuming AUs or post Cannon fics? Because otherwise it would have...disturbing implications.

*** Why? She could have slept with Dean, what's so "disturbing" about that? I thought it was pretty normal to cash your V-Card in secondary school (Hell, I was one of the few people in my own school, despite that fact that it was a sheltered little school in a rural area, that held on that that till I was 19, most others had already done it earlier) and it's not "disturbing"! It's normal and perfectly ok IMHO if both parties consent (note: Statutory rape laws can fuck off! I disagree with the concept - as long as you aren't molesting people before puberty, because puberty is all about sexuality IMHO! You become fertile during it and as long as you don't forgo protection? Go for it!) and if protection (I bet wizards have something - potion, spell, whatever!) is used!
