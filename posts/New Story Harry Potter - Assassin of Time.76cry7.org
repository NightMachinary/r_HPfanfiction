** A small tip: paragraph length. Your paragraphs are really long, the last of them would probably be better if you cut it in half, and the longest one could even stand being quartered. And it's not like you don't have opportune places for that. What you have now seems wall-of-texty, and as much as I like proper walls of text even I am aware that having paragraphs be too long can be very detrimental.

Other than that, there are sentences that would be better off being connected with a comma instead of being separated with a full stop. This one, for example:

#+begin_quote
  The wand was now obliterated. Its life force extinguished by the overload of Voldemort's magic.
#+end_quote

I'm not going to comment on the actual story since that's up to you but that's about it as far as the technical side is concerned.

** If you promote your story, then promote it. Posting a link, especially to mobile version where you don't even see a description, isn't a true promotion.

Convince us to read it, tell us what kind of fic it is, oh and most importantly, actually write a substantial fragment before linking it.
