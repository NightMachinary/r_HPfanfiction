Hey, so I started the Prince of Slytherin ffn, and really did love it..... until I got to the point where Harry first spoke to Hermione. I'm pretty sure I read this fic when I liked Hermione, but now, I just want a different female friend. So, does anyone have a fic like Prince of Slytherin with a pairing like Haphne, HarryxLuna, or even Hinny? I'm not asking for it to be exclusively Slytherin-Harry, just that it maintains at least a few of the main tropes. Thanks!

​

Edit: I accidentally wrote H/Hr, I really meant that I just wanted Hermione to be a non-entity or a bashed character ig

*** The author has stated their intention to make it H/Hr, just that it will be a while before characters wind up actually dating.

**** The author has said in his discord that he's not sure about who Harry will end up with, he's also saying that he might make Harry Aro/Ace instead

**** Wrong he's stated he doesn't know if Harry will be in a relationship or not, and he isn't sure who the girl will be

**** Avoiding Hermione altogether is really hard, as she is one of the most important characters in canon.

***** How about avoiding her as a friend? Like, maybe her being bashed (pls no downvotes) instead of being a friend?
