You'll like this if you enjoy slightly cracky fics, really good worldbuilding, Muggles/Squibs not being complete tools or enemies, strong Harry/Hermione FRIENDSHIP, good trio dynamics all around, underground Muggleborn culture, Death eaters defecting, and having a Harry that can think for himself.

Fair warning, it paints Snape and the other DEs in a slightly sympathetic light, real-world plugins (Eminem and Harry Potter books), and somewhat unrealistic character interactions. There's also a bit of Muggle(born/raised) focus.

Overall, I liked it. Just over 60k words and 19 chapters. Unfortunately, it's abandoned (last update was in 2014) but it's a refreshing change of pace.

  The Death Eaters have come for Harry Potter but this slightly crazy Gryffindor has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.
