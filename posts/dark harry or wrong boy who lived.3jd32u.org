Most of the stories with this concept are mainly slash and I'm not really fond of slash. So I was wondering if there are any stories with slash where I can skip the romance parts without skipping the plot.


** linkffn(5353809)

You've probably read it, as it is one of the most well written and most recommended fics.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Have you read linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin)? It was recommended in a thread the other day and I couldn't put it down. It updates quite frequently which is nice and the writing is pretty good! It features wrong boy who lived and slytherin!harry who is quite darker than in canon. He's not crazy dark though. And there is no slash (though right now it's only in second year).

  Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

** Well I assume you probably have read this already, but in case you haven't there is linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived).

Some quick details, Neville is the boy who lived. I felt that it has some great action and was a great read. Harry is not dark though you can argue that he plays with that line as the story progresses. There is a very distinct shift in tone from Act 1 at Hogwarts and Act 2 when they are out of school. It is my favorite Other Boy Who Lived story

** I am a stalwart proponent of Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc, which starts with linkffn(Saving Connor). Harry isn't super "dark," but wrong-boy-who-lived is certainly in play. The slash doesn't really start until the 4th/5th book of the 7, and the author is usually extremely good at identifying the subsections of their chapters that contain slash (as well as certain triggers).

Also, it's a long read, if that makes a difference one way or another to you. Edit: After adding it all up, the Arc ends up being just over 3 million words.
