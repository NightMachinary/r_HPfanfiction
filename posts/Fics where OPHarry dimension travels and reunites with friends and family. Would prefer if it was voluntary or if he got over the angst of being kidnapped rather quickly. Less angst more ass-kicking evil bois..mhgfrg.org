#+TITLE: Fics where OP!Harry dimension travels and reunites with friends and family. Would prefer if it was voluntary or if he got over the angst of being kidnapped rather quickly. Less angst more ass-kicking evil bois.

I'm bed bound for a while and I feel like I've read every fic of this type. I know you guys are good at the obscure, so I'm hoping for some help. <3


** So for a lot of ass-kicking with dimension travelling jumping in at the start of the second of them, I really like the Hero trilogy by joe6991 starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero). For a second OP Harry fic by the same guy - but without dimension travelling of the type you mean - try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) and its sequel. Personally I prefer the second, as he had grown into the style more by the time it was written

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] one of my fav Gen fics. Summary Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

*** This is a great recommendation. I've already read it, but I loved the fic and recommend other people give it a try, as well.

** ... fates gamble is like that... kind of? It's eventually God harry. But I find it's well written, and he goes through a lot to get to it. 5he part I'm talking about is in the second book of it. Tho he really only gets to enjoying his mother's company and his twin sisters (obiously OC's) but he foes have a family. It is a crossover with the Fate universe
