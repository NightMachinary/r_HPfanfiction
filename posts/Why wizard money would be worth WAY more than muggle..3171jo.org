Fucking time turners. You could win the lottery if you had hard times, play the stock market, whatever. You're telling me to enterprising muggleborn has tried this? Or if the time turners are only under ministry control, then no Department of Mysteries employee?

Second scheme, drug smuggling, when you can have a endlessly deep bag, apparition, and the confundus charm plus obliviate for authorities. Think about how easy that would be.

Felix Felicis. Greedy people's perfect day might very well involve finding silly amounts of money.

Anyone else have some magically fueled get rich quick schemes?


** I think that a lot of the get rich quick schemes would be foiled by the Ministry. They have some kind of system that flags magical use in front of muggles. So that makes it a lot more difficult.

Arthur Weasley's job is to intervene when muggles end up with magical artifacts, and there are two ways that he could be alerted: 1. Police reports, news articles, and other public sources 2. Detection of low-level magical activity (i.e., not a spell but some kind of magical object) in a muggle environment.

So it follows that either wizards have an efficient method of identifying anomalies that are characteristic of magical involvement, and/or have an automatic way of detecting any kind of magical use in muggle environments.

So if you suddenly come into a large sum of money and you're a member of the magical community, maybe there's someone that flags it for further investigation.

However, the average wizard knows very little about the muggle world. They would not be capable of smoothly interfering. Most wizards don't know that muggles hold lotterys, that they enter by purchasing a ticket with several sets of numbers at certain type of shop, and that the winning numbers are reliably printed in muggle papers every morning.

It's always been my theory that one of the reasons that the government does not push for increased integration/understanding of muggles is that the less wizards know about muggles, the better for keeping them in check. A wizard walking around in a cloak is a risk to the statute of secrecy, but it's minor compared to the damage that a wizard who knew how to efficiently game the muggle system could do. The Ministry doesn't want a wizard on the run to know how to purchase a plane ticket or for wizards to realize that they might be able to use magic to rearrange a few numbers on a financial statement.

** Buy antiques in poor condition from pawn shops, Reparo the shit out of them, flip them for massive profits (old perfect condition stuff is probably worth a lot)

Transfigure aluminium or some other metal that is easy to transfigure and worth scrap money, accumulate alot of it, sell to a scrapyard. If you're feeling unethical then you can probably put a spell on it to make it heavier and worth more.

Imperio a rich person and steal their stuff.

Find a drug dealer and rob them

Set up a car repair shop, and during nighttime or when noone is looking then use generous applications of reparo (probably requires knowledge of engines and stuff) to fix stuff quicker, and color changing spells for "repainting") You can probably get work done like 10 times faster, and with the cost of repairs you would make tons of money quickly. You can set your prices lower than the competition since it will be so much easier for you.

*** This could be pretty interesting.

Imagine: Mundungus Fletcher, fed up of wasting his time getting busted for petty theft, goes undercover in the Muggle world. He buys broken collectables on the cheap, repairs them and sells them in disguise at auctions.

Fast forward a few years, and Fletcher gets comfortable - /too/ comfortable. A Muggle-born witch or wizard spots him on an episode of /Dickinson's Real Deal/ and reports him to the Ministry, who obviously can't do anything because he wasn't actually seen doing anything.

Fletcher gets wind of his 'untouchable' status and - being Fletcher - gets reckless, hiring a crack team of Transfiguration, mind magic and Dark Arts experts to wreak havoc on unsuspecting Muggle markets.

Dawlish, now a disgraced mid-level agent in a forgotten office jointly commanded by the DMLE and DMAC, sees a golden opportunity to restore his honour.

** You could poke holes in the HP universe all day long. Why in the world do people with the ability to bend reality to their will have to take shitty jobs? Fucking bus conductor? Pamphlet maker? Why does anyone need money at all? Why the fuck can't you conjure food, duplicate gems... what exactly is the purpose of magic at all? For a bit of convenience now and again?

The answer, of course, is that JKR wrote Sorcerer's Stone for 10 year olds and didn't expect for things to poked to death by millions of not-ten year olds years later.

** A common get-rich-quick scheme for super!Genius overpowered wizards with too much time on their hands is breaking the goblin enchantments on galleons, melting them down, selling the gold in the muggle world, and exchanging the currency for galleons. Made even more efficient when muggleborns get an artificially low exchange rate so they'd actually be able to afford anything.

Of course, the reason this one is a bad idea is the same reason Spain bringing back boatloads full of gold from the New World was a bad idea. Insider trading by means of legilimency would work much better.

Edit: Am I the only one thinking Lord Voldemort might have taken advantage of some muggles to fund his war effort, especially in the beginning back when his followers were still kissing his hand, not his feet?

** Permanent conjuration of silver is a nice dodge - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11130409/1/Griphook-and-the-Strong-Form-EMH][Griphook and the Strong Form EMH]]

Robbery would just be too easy with compulsion and obliviate charms. The imperius would'nt even be needed. So the aurors would have to be quite efficient to keep a lid on things. The linked fic has a nice idea of passing information back in time to flag oddities. Maybe a form of divination to avoid time travel paradoxes.

** Even assuming that every wizard was an outstanding citizen who wouldn't dream of stealing from Muggles, I still think that wizards would consider Muggle money worthless. With the power magic provides, food production is likely much more efficient, and any service that the Muggle world could provide (besides prostitution ... hopefully) could be fulfilled by a house elf. Technology is uninteresting to wizards, clothing is different, and honestly I can't think of much wizards would want from the Muggle world. So I definitely agree that wizard currency should be worth much more than that of Muggles.

** Obviously there are countless ways for wizards to make a lot of money in schemes. From the ones you listed to anything as basic as Imperio/Confundus charming some muggles to give you the money. However, as far as I know there is little in the books to suggest you could exchange pounds for galleons. I know you can exchange galleons for pounds, at least a lot of fanfics embrace this, but there is no reason for the goblins to buy pounds off you for galleons. Surely any schemes we could come up with the goblins can think of and thus have no reason to accept your pounds for gallons. There are some stories which suggest buying a lot of gold or silver in muggle world and then smelting it down and selling it in the wizarding world. However, why would this be worth much in the wizarding world, wizards can just conjure things or transfigure or such. I am assuming galleons and sickles have some sort enchantments on them that you can't just make them if you have the metals, the same way we cannot just rich because we have paper and ink. I view it as in the wizarding world you are primarily paying for services or magics on items, not the raw materials.

It's the exact opposite. Hermione's parents are exchanging pounds at the bank in /The Chamber of Secrets/. I don't remember anybody ever going the other way.

*** The reasoning for converting muggle money into raw gold, silver and gemstones is based on the assumption that you can't just transfigure things into them. Otherwise the Philosopher's Stone wouldn't be considered remarkable for being able to do so. The goblin tellers in Gringott's are actually shown evaluating gems and precious metals, and they can't all be coming from Egyptian tombs.
