If you inversed an Fidelius that not the world forgets the idea of a location, but that a location forgets the idea of the world, then you have a place where anyone in it can't even think about the idea to escape. They couldn't even think that there is a world outside their cell.

**** I mean, it's only bright and fanciful due to the tone of the earlier books. It already is a dystopian setting before you even throw a Dark Lord into the mix.

- The sole prison is a hellhole where prisoners are malnourished and guarded by nightmares that literally suck all the happiness out of them and torment them with their worst memories constantly.

- The government is hilariously corrupt, with wealthy families able to obtain influence fairly easily (case in point: Malfoy, despite being an (acquitted) terrorist, became one of the Minister for Magic's most trusted advisors in a decade.

- The justice system is a joke, especially when they have such powerful tools as legilimency and veritaserum available to determine the truth. Granted, clever enough wizards could find ways around them but there could also be clever enough wizards on the prosecuting side to ensure that they don't.

- Also, they chucked an innocent man in their hellhole prison for over a decade before he broke himself out, and never actually declared him innocent. Granted, it was wartime but even that is no excuse for almost a decade and a half of complacency after the war ended - that is covered by the previous point of the justice system being shit. Not to mention, once he re-entered the public eye, not a single person thought to go over his case files? Not a single person went through them to try and determine what he was up to, and discovered the lack of a trial? In fact, maybe someone did discover that, but were hushed up by the rampant bribery and corruption in the Ministry.

I could probably name more things but all of these points do not paint a very good image of the Wizarding World as a society - I could also talk about the rampant 'No-Maj' segregation and bigotry in Wizarding America, but the only evidence for that was a long time before the series began and times could have changed (not to mention the films not being canon Harry Potter books), so things could be different in the present-day wizarding America.

For instance, many high-ranking military officers in the American Civil War went on to become (or rather, stay) prominent regional politicians. More recently, the same thing happened in Northern Ireland and many former IRA leaders became high-ranking officials as part of the peace process. As with Malfoy, most of them have at least some plausible deniability.

****** This is preposterous.

First of all, while we naturally do have some issues with corruption and the like in the real world, they are by no means anywhere near the scale of the HP world. As another commenter mentioned, it's like if Osama Bin Laden had paid off the US to rule him innocent, despite everyone being fully aware that he was never innocent, and he then took up a position as Head Advisor to George Bush.

Second of all, the vast bulk of the corruption and similar in the real world exists in large part because of things that magic can easily fix. Criminal justice failings happen because we can't prove truth or a lie, we can't see other people's memories and we can't compel people to follow the law - veritaserum, penseives, unbreakable vows, legillimency etc all fix that. Corruption and bribery and the general evils of the monetary world all come down to scarcity, a concept that makes far less sense in the HP world. Etc etc. This means that not only is there more corruption and the like in the HP world than the real world, but it makes less sense and could be much more easily defeated if someone bothered to try.

This is like saying 1984 is indistinguishable from the real state of Britain because we have lots of security cameras. Nonsense

Also I don't think any of it was done maliciously but more trying to come across as a 80's sex comedy, and if you try to watch most of those anymore they don't tend to hold up well.

***** It's not really the same point. The point being made is that (in HP) a secret isn't just a piece of information that few people know; it's an independently existing entity. Something either is or isn't a secret; if it is a secret, then it exists in a person's soul. The Fidelius acts by taking that secret and hiding it in someone else's soul.

So to cast the Fidelius, first you need someone who "owns" a secret.

** It really depends on how the Fidelius works, exactly:

If it removes and conceals the information itself - If it can apply to /anything/, even the very concept of "escaping from this prison" might be hidden from the prisoner. If only information of the form "Location X exists", hide the existence of the prison from the prisoner, or, failing that, the existence of the walls or the grounds around it (So as far they can think, they are floating in a pocket universe or something).

For that matter, perhaps one could Fidelius the prisoner's knowledge of how to use language, or walk, or the existence of their arms or legs, or of magic itself.

​

The weaker alternative is that the initial casting removes the information from everyone but the Secret-Keeper, and locks away the location in a pocket dimension, with the information of the existence of the location being the 'password' for entering, with the ongoing Fidelius effect, simply preventing others from speaking it.

Much in-universe experimentation would be needed.

** sounds about right, not only that but it wouldn't be too hard to accomplish. the secret keeper (likely the prison warden) would probably have to remain inside the fidelius due to both the inverted nature of the charm (and also for convenience sake regarding prison transfers, intake and release of prisoners, etc). it works with both prevailing theories of the charms function as well. if it works via altering individuals perception reality then any one inside the ward would be affected in the desired manner, and if it functions via spatial manipulation and pocket dimensions then it most likely be mechanically identical to a normal fidelius (likely also taking an identical amount of magical power to cast as well), merely checking for knowledge of the secret to exit instead of to enter.

it would also be immune to external forces breaking out prisoners as all would be jailbreaker's would be unable to escape as soon as they entered.
