Title says all, just want smut that isn't necessarily realistic or thought provoking, just something I can shut my brain off to. No slash please and I don't care what characters are involved as long as they aren't blank slate characters (Daphne, Katie Bell, etc.).

*** I feel like the biggest idiot on the planet for not knowing that there was a version of this fic that was fully explicit. I /just/ read through the version on FFN, and I remember thinking "Heh, this is a fun little fic, it's a shame they gloss over all of the smut..." Pff, FML.
