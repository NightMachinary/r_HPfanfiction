** Powerful Harry, but not ridiculously powerful.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2345466/1/Dumbledores-Army][Dumbledore's Army]] and the sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2379367/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spiritus-Crystalus][Harry Potter and the Spiritus Crystalus]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry distrusts Dumbledore, he transforms the DA in anticipation of the coming war. Ships! HPGW HGRW RLNT SSOC. Pranks and Humor, angst. OOTP Spoilers. Rated M for language, violence and mild sexual situations in later chapters.

  Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2771223/1/][Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny]] is quite popular, but I thought it was a bit overdone.

** Almost all the fics I posted in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/vlkso/lets_lay_down_our_favourite_hp_fan_fictions/][this thread]] have a powerful Harry.

  PART I: Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer.

Harry is transported into another evil!Harry, which explains how he suddenly becomes much stronger. It's one of my favorite HP fics. Downside is that it was supposed to be a trilogy and it was abandoned during the second part, but the first part is finished and it can be read on it's own.

*** This story is /amazing/. And the second part is also amazing and worth reading even though it isn't finished. Seriously, anyone who hasn't read this fic should.

** I don't know if I'm right with this powerful!Harry stuff but [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] is an amazing fic (I will warn you though, it's about the length of an actual novel and has mature language and violence). It was written before the Half-Blood Prince was published so technically it's now an AU fic. But I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Without trying to spoil it too much, something happens to Harry to make his magic incredibly unstable and more powerful. Disregard this comment if you've already read it!

** You may have read it, but try The Sacrifices Arc by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]].

It ships HP/DM, but it's tactfully done and doesn't come in fully until about the 5th book. It's whiny at times, but definitely powerful!Harry in a very different, unique way. The story is really well done; read it for no other reason than the beautiful, wonderful interpretation this author has of pureblood rituals/dances. Easily my favorite part of this 7 story epic.

*** It is pretty good, but I feel like it used the same thing over and over again: "Oh noes, Harry is locking his emotions away, oh noes! Stop him!" I get that it would be tempting and all, and that it would be really bad if they burst out, but the pools Snape taught him didn't seem that different from the box to me. Otherwise, the HP/DM is basically pointless but doesn't really detract, and it's too long (averages at 900 pages per book on my Nook).

I skipped those parts, true story. I couldn't stand hearing the gears of character development grinding to a halt.

*** I liked that fic a lot, but the HP/DM was pretty much the polar opposite of tactful. I also skipped/skimmed the repetitive parts, and most of the HP/DM.

**** I guess tactful might not have been the best word choice.

To me, the HP/DM seemed as if it belonged; I hate reading extremely contrived HP/DM. It wasn't garish or fake, and I think it was tactful in that sense.

It was rather explicit though, so tactful in that sense? No. But (I thought) it was rather well done, so I accepted it.

My favorite too.
