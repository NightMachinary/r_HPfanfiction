Harry never noticed but there was always an animal watching him as he grew up. He didn't remember it but once when he was very young it had attacked Petunia when she was about to hit him. When he goes to Hogwarts he picks it up from a pet shop in Diagon Alley (she picks him to be honest)...


** For the life of him, Severus Snape could not figure out how Potter's pet Lizard kept getting into his potions classroom. He couldn't prove it, but he was certain the thing was moving things around his classroom.

Albus and Minerva refused to do anything about the creature. It wasn't that Snape had anything against Lizards, except maybe that it was not one of his Snakes who had deviated from the standard cat/owl limitations. It was that the Potter boy had once again gotten special consideration.

It hadn't been bad during Potters first year, although the creature did seem to prefer to prowl the dungeons, but it was the natural grounds for a reptile in Hogwarts. Now that he was in his second year, his pet seemed to be acting up. Snape had found scales in his potion cabinet. No amount of animal proofing of his classroom seemed to work. It was not being brought by the boy - Snape had ensured he fully understood what would happen if he was caught with it - but it still seemed to find its way in whenever it liked.

​

Normally Snape would have simply ignored it, but he had caught it staring at him with an air of... disappointment? ... in its eyes. Rationally, he knew he was anthropomorphism that was, as Dumbledore put it, a harmless case of Hogwarts Fauna. But those eyes seemed to piece him, and he was certain the beast was responsible for his missing potion ingredients.

​

Snape shrugged. It was only a lizard. He would visit Filch in the morning for some additional reptile poison.

**** Based on the idea, I made an implicit assumption that the curse kept her in animal form was keyed to Snape. After all, if she was a gift from Voldemort, it would make sense he would set the spell up that way, and Snape would have no clue since Voldemort died before he could tell him. Since she couldn't get to Hogwarts, she had no way of trying to break a the curse. Thus the first year, she would be pleased to see Harry finally away from the Dursleys, a chance at breaking her curse, and his awe of joining the magical world. I'd imagine a bit disappointed on how her ex-friend turned out, but willing to give the benefit of the doubt.

However, in the second year I would imagine her pissed: Her youngling was put in danger at the end of his first year and there seemed to have been a lack of competent adults to step up. He was then sent back to his bad home situation with no attempt to resolve that issue. And ignoring him on the Dobby thing. Plus, very quickly in second year it is clear he will be in danger again, and no-one is dealing with it. Further, the second year is where Harry first really has to deal with ostracization and bullying, which none of the adults tried to solve. I'd imagine 'concerned but hopeful mamma lizard' would give way to 'pissed and proactive mamma lizard' :P

While Snape could easily brew something that would secure his classroom, there would likley be a few dead adventurous students who, for some inane reason, think that braving Snape is less risky that a trollup through the Forbidden Forest.

***** Haha I like it: Filch the Mad Chemists

I am operating on assumption that 'reptile poison' is a magical solution that targets only reptiles or maybe super-resistant magical reptiles. So even if students were waddling through it in the corridors or inhaled it by accident, they would be OK as a mammals.

We know that animagus, while looking like an animal and registering as such by werewolf senses, are still very much wizards at their core (just look at rat-Pettigrew lifespan or bug-Rita intelligence and memory). Lily would be quite alright even if she didn't know to avoid it or they tricked her to taste it.

Please notice that the same could not be true for reptile-mammal hybrids...

** Harry stroked the fur of his cat.

He had first seen her just about a year when he was 10 years old. She had been thin and gaunt looking, and Harry had fed her his lunch, which was nothing more than measly leftovers.

Since that day, Harry had always spent some time with her, stroking her flaming red fur, or staring into the depths of her emerald green eyes which were a lot like his. Or just playing with her.

She had been his constant and only companion for a year, until he had received his Hogwarts letter. Thankfully, the Hogwarts letter had mentioned that he could bring cats. It was not until the train ride when a very rude and bossy bushy haired girl had asked her name when he realised that he hadn't named her at all.

He had been sorted into Slytherin. He didn't know why it was a big deal, but the rest of the school had made a big deal out of it.

He didn't have any friends in Slytherin, or in Hogwarts. A blonde haired boy named Draco had offered to be his friend, but he reminded Harry a lot of those arrogant, stuck up and spoilt kids from school and had declined his friendship.

Now, he found his cat as his only companion again. He was also faced with the daunting task of naming it.

"How about Edith?" He finally asked, although his thoughts were elsewhere.

Harry had always felt that she was more intelligent than many made her out to be. It was as if she could communicate with him without even speaking. As if confirming his thoughts, she whipped her long tail against his leg and shook her head. She seemed almost... Human at the moment.

Harry sighed in frustration, but not because she had disapproved of the name. "Why can't I have a normal life? Why was I the one who had to grow up without parents? Why did I have to get sorted into Slytherin! Greatness be damned!" He said.

She gave him a sorrowful look and rubbed her head against his leg twice. It tickled, and caused Harry to giggle. This was another one of those things she did that he appreciated. She couldn't speak, but that didn't stop her from lifting his spirits.

He looked at her from behind his round rimmed glasses and it clicked. Her eyes, her fur, and her sleek, long body reminded him of a person.

She had once clawed Aunt Petunia for attempting to hit him, and she had felt so protective that he had felt wanted for the first time in his life. When he had used a bad word in front of her, she had scratched his leg and smacked him up the head with her tail as if admonishing him. She had seemed so... /motherly/ at the moment, and that was how she seemed now too.

"Lily" he said

The newly named Lily's eyes widened just a bit, before she leapt on him gracefully and rubbed her face against his chin for a few times. Harry could have sworn that he saw humanly sorrow, pain and happiness all at the same time on her face.

Harry slowly laid down in his bed. Lily always sept at the foot of his bed, but now, she was curled atop his chest. Harry wrapped the blanket around himself and Lily, and they both fell asleep.

Hope you liked it! I made Harry a Slytherin because I wanted to show him as being lonely and without friends. Feel free to continue this.

*** Maybe since it's just a fanfic you could adjust it to be intent to sacrifice your life with a love so powerful it overtakes any other emotions you/the sacrificial person is having in that moment? That way Lily gives Harry protection w/o dying. Or you could adjust canon to having James take Harry upstairs and Lily stays downstairs and gets turned into an animal and then James makes the sacrifice. Or you could say Harry doesn't have any protection like he does at the Dursley's in canon and just say that for some new reason Voldemort's curse just rebounded.

#+begin_quote
  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

** Wait, but if she transformed to escape, she wouldn't have been able to take Harry with her unless she was a really big animal (maybe a kangaroo?) so :

a) she would have done as Voldemort asked so he could let her be and go directly after Harry (I think he would like the idea of Lily living with the knowledge of what she allowed to happen), and

b) without Lily's sacrifice would Harry even survive? I don't know if James death would be considered a sacrifice or if it would be enough.

******** I'm just gonna eyeroll at these down votes.

Lily's sacrifice protects Harry. We only know that that sacrifice is kept tethered to the physical world because of Harry living with relatives that share his mother's blood. We also get a glimpse of Lily's corporal soul protecting Harry during Harry's escape from Voldemort in the resurrection scene at the end of GoF. Some of the protections seem to wane until Harry's near someone that shares his mother's blood. That's how he survives the Killing Curse for a second time. It wasn't just the Deathly Hallows that protected him. It was most likely a combination of factors. Having all three Hallows acknowledge Harry most likely boosted the protections.

So what am I getting at? If Lily doesn't die, this all falls apart.

The way to have her be Harry's "animal" companion would simply be to have her posses or influence any animals near her son. Said power is heightened when Harry gets the Invisibility Cloak, and is strengthened even more when all three Hallows acknowledge him.

***** u/StarDolph:
#+begin_quote
  There a specific way that the sacrificial protection works. You need to be given the chance to survive (i.e. stand aside), refuse, and then voluntarily be killed in the line of duty in trying to protect the person.
#+end_quote

That part is easy to get around: You simply make the key to the magic the willingness to die after being given a chance to survive, instead of actually requiring death.

Most fanfics already have Lily doing some sort of magic or ceremony to set up the sacrificial protection (as an easy way to explain why it doesn't happen more often / is better understood), all you have to do is make the cost the 'willingly going to your death to protect thing'.

And how did Lily know she would be given the chance to step aside? Or are you saying that the protection is a complete accident? That's possible, but for those who say it's something Lily did with a ritual, how did she know she would be given a chance?

As far as the "other mothers offered their lives for their babies," the difference is that Voldie came to the Potters for the EXPRESS purpose of killing the baby. All the others were mere targets of opportunity.

** Instead of attempting to escape lets have It so Lily has a huge temper and after being disarmed transforms into her animal form and just attacks Voldemort. He traps her as an animal because a big fuck off jungle cat is easier to control than a powerful witch who might eventually get ahold of a wand and he was just surprised enough that he didn't think to use the Avada Kedavra. Because lets be honest unless she could take her son with her there's no way Lily "Id die right here for my son" Potter would just run away
