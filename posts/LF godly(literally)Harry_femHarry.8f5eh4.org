*** Yeah, and the 'godly' might also imply religious fervor instead of godlike powers.

** What if James or Lily had secretly been one of the gods you mentioned. Loki has been known to take female forms, after all, and is not adverse to doing the same to their brother.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** Would still fit into my badly worded criteria then. I basically only require both parents to be gods.
