I just find it hard to imagine that there wouldn't be alternative food items on offer for those wanting something a bit more filling for the multi-hour long train ride from London to the Scottish Highlands.

**** Your tastes have changed since you were a small child.

The trolley hardly appears in the books, in book 1 (I remember that) and book 3 (I don't remember that, but the interweb tells me it did), and we only see its interactions with children and as a source of anti-Dementor chocolate. Yer average 13 year old wants sweets. Don't believe me? Just look at what was available in school tuck shops before the current silly fad of attempting to persuade children that lettuce is food. The tuck shop at my school, in the 80s, sold /nothing/ except what I'd now call sugary crap, and at the time that was just what I wanted to spend my money on. If it had sold delicious healthy carrots instead then I would have just taken my money into the local town and bought sugary crap there instead.

**** You're not weird, you're just not 11 years old - and as such, your tastes and sensibilities have changed from there.

My 11-year-old self would /absolutely/ have had a lunch consisting entirely of sweets. My current self, not so much.

As an aside, railway catering usually isn't great - it's of the "people-fuel" variety.\\
I imagine most children on the train will have a packed lunch made by their parents, which would most likely be preferable to typical railway-catering fare (Honeydukes' best excluded).

** In most long haul journey / boring long stay somewhere (train, plane, and whatever else takes a full day or more to go from A to B, or hospital stay) the catering comes out at set time with the meal options suitable for that time, it's usually every couple of hours to keep people entertained, but will light option to avoid "bloating" ( train ad plane toilets are not comfortable). So the first time we hear about the food trolley, is at the beginning of a long trip, my guess would be "mid morning snack /cuppa tea" (10-11 am), hence the candies. An hour or two later, they would probably come out again with "lunch" (possibly warm and cold options) between 12 and 1pm (but we didn't hear about it because Harry and Ron are too full of candy that first time, and the following years it's too mundane to mention) , then at 3-4pm there might be another "mid afternoon snack /cuppa /more candies", and then nothing 'till they reach Hogwarts when they'll have the welcoming feast (arrival at around 7pm? ).

** We know they do. Pumpkin pasties are savoury, and would (assuming that a wizarding pasty resembles a normal pasty) be quite substantial.

The sweets are at the front, because a train full of kids who've just been let out of their parents sight and given a bit of autonomy with their pocket money WILL want sweets, but there's at least one canonically present savoury item that would do as an actual meal. I see no reason not to have others as well.

Perhaps sandwiches (toasted or otherwise) or soup. Hot chips. Curry or biryani, given how popular takeaway Indian food is in Britain. Other savoury pastry/pastry adjacent things like a sausage roll or a small shepherd's pie.

The snacks might include fruit. Or...if you can deep fry a mars bar, I bet you could deep fry a chocolate frog.

In 2021, yes, but Philosopher's Stone came out in 1997 and that takes place in 1991. Was Indian food as prevalent and well-liked as a staple of British cuisine then as it is now?

Susan Bones was a Hufflepuff, yes? They didn't spend much time socializing with Hufflepuffs for some odd reason. I can tell you about half(at the very most) of my classmates names. I've been with them all for, like, 4 years(5 in some cases).
