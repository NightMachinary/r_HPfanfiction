I'm hoping there might be a few fics along the same lines as this one I read a few years ago and sometimes think about from time to time.

It was a really good one shot, about one of the next gen kids turning out to be a squib, and so going and making a life for themselves in the muggle world. That was the basis of it. They have muggle interests and friends/relationships, and they've found happiness and fullfilment outside the world they grew up in. Even so, they have a relationship with their magical family and there's no issue of /wizards superior/ or /muggles superior/.

It was a really interesting exploration of both worlds and of the characters. (I think the other next gen kids all developed issues with being in the spotlight that the squib kid didn't and the writer played on that too?)

If there are any stories out there similar, I'd really appreciate a link!
