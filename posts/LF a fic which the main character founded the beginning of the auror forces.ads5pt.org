The main story was about a young lass who was muggleborn and was hired by various people to complete tasks. One I think was a Diggory and mayor of a town. She was good friends with someone who worked as a healer. I believe it was fem slash with perhaps a ?Rebecca Gryfindor who was last of the Gryfindor line and ran a bakery in Hogsmead.

Pretty sure it was on ffn.

Other than that the details are fuzzy but I remember it to be well written and that I enjoyed it so would like to read it again. If anyone knows it, I would be very appreciative. I shall continue to look in the meantime ☺☺

Update: it has been found! Thank you all.


** I have one wild guess as I haven't read it yet. Is it linkffn(Starnlicht)?

*** Yes this is it! Thank you so much. I'm so impressed you could find it based on my hazy rambles especially without having read it yourself!

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
