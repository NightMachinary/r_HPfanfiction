:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
After that meeting with Harry in Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore remains stuck at King's Cross station with the ugly baby Voldemort. He sees other people arrive and depart from the station. He keeps on waiting for his train but it never seems to come. He is disgusted by BabyMort.

Many years pass and all the while, Albus was aging backwards until he got to a point where he didn't know who BabyMort was anymore. This enabled him to feel sorry for it and pick it up from the floor. Finally, his train arrives and young Albus gets on it carrying BabyMort with him.

I am so annoyed that I can't remember the title of this story. I remember that it had illustrations in it. I hope someone could help me find it.

  Remember the train station purgatory scene where Dumbledore leads Harry away from the flayed baby? That scene needs fic. Originally written July, 2007.
