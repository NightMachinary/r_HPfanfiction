Are there any fics where Harry is noticeably unattractive?


** It blindness Harry's scar covers his eyes and it's described as being horrible, jagged, ugly and marring his face. Idk if its exactly what you're looking for since it's not really something that's brought up much but it is mentioned a few times.

**** I mean, messy and unruly hair, malnourished, short, cheap glasses, ill-fitting clothes.

Plus, despite his heritage and fame, had basically 0 attention from females until book 4.

I'd say he has more thing that subtly point out that he isn't exactly a looker than otherwise.

James Potter was described as tall 3 times in the series. Average height in UK is 5'10. So Jmaes Potter was ~6'0. In the end of DH, when Harry is walking to his death, it says that he is the same height as his father.

****** Being fanciable for doing heroic things does not take away from the fact that a person looks like a slob.

I mean, he has hair that refuses to be tamed and sticks up (since we read him trying to flatten his hair), he wears glasses with circular frames (seriously, wtf). Messy hair can be attractive, but even then, it's usually styled into looking that way - but Harry has hair that sticks out all over the place, which is just bad (can confirm, my hair can misbehave a lot).

And since we never actually see him buying his own clothes in canon (lol), one might argue that the muggle clothes he wears are all hand me downs from Dudley who is quite large - ergo, he doesn't dress smartly either.

All of these things make a boy quite unappealing to look at.

This is what you ought to note, actually. Lennon was an icon in the 60s and early 70s - his style had been "out" for the better part of 2 decades by the 90s.

Boys wearing round frame lenses certainly weren't doing themselves any favours in my childhood when I was in school during the late 90s and the early 00s.

********* River Phoenix, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo Dicaprio wore round or nearly round oval-shaped lenses in the 90s. Round lenses were fashionable then, at least in LA where I lived at the time. I had a pair and remember this being the style.

The issue with Harry's glasses was not their shape but rather that they were cheap and in poor repair.

I went ahead and actually searched for images of those actors wearing glasses, and I found maybe 2-3 images out of 40-50 that had them wearing circular framed lenses. And maybe it's my view of them in 2019 that's causing a bias, but I found those few pics rather cringe-y.

This would certainly not add to his appeal in the looks department, you're right on that.

One suspects that this would leave Harry looking deformed and somewhat short of fetching.
