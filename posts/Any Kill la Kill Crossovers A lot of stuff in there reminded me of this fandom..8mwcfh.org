Been moving through an episode or two every couple days and the flashbacks to hilariously overpowered edgy politically adept middle schoolers really reminded me of potter fanfic. So yeah, anyone know any good crossovers? I'll also take /any/ wrong boy/girl who lived type crossovers regardless of quality because those are easily my favorite part of fanfiction.


** All of the Kill la kill Crossovers are "X Character finds Harry and raises him" but never get too far and the other is a oneshot about the Sorting. Unfortunately so, Harry x Ryuko would be a good pairing.
