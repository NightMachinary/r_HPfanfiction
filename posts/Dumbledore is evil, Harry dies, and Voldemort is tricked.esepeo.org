:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, I read this fic a long time ago that I wanted to find again. All I can remember is there was a chapter where Voldemort tortured Harry in front of Dumbledore to get information, but Dumbledore is silent and calm. I remember Lucius was there, and I think there was a bit of fingernail removing. Ultimately, Voldemort kills Harry, and Dumbledore just laughs, saying Voldemort "saved him the effort" of killing Harry and that it was his plan all along. Unfortunately, I can't remember what happened next.

**** Here's the author's rewrite of that fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10577338/1/The-Exposed-Truth][The Exposed Truth]]. I finished reading The Truth Revealed last night and then found it. I'm at chapter 4, and it's almost like a whole new fic; it's not just rewording things, unlike most rewrites. Things that made zero sense in the original (Voldemort locking Harry in his own bedroom???) are changed, and as of chapter four, events have gone completely differently.

The Exposed Truth is still an interesting ride though, just in a different way. And I can speak from experience that reading the original and then the rewrite isn't too tedious. Actually, I'm enjoying it. Which is rather surprising, since I'm usually against friendly relationships between Harry and Voldemort or Snape.

Edit: Never mind, it isn't as different as I thought. It makes more logical sense and is better on a technical level, but some of the more colourful parts of the story were removed entirely (such as Nagini being Harry's mum). Later chapters do feel like you're re-reading the original, until you get to the parts that actually changed.
