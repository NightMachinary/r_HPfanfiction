** They cant because magical britain is a separate entity from the uk at least thats what they make it sound like in the books. The closest they have to that is the ICW and even then article five doesnt cover civil wars if it did nato would have stepped in during the coup in Turkey last year

*** I'm not here for the /"can't"/ I'm here for the *"CAN"*

There is a reason this is a request and not a discussion

**** The issue is the request doesnt make sense and i doubt its been written the closest thing you will get to this is a lord harry fic or other stories where he goes to france and or america and get them to join in. In most stories the icw just blocks all communication with magical britain. No need to get upset because i am pointing out a flaw in your request when im off work i will look but for now thats all i can say

**** The thing is, no one would write that kind of story because the premise is a giant plothole.

Besides the fact that a single Royal Marines company would be enough to turn the Battle of Hogwarts into a Turkey shoot with infantry weapons alone (so there's no need for artillery or air support, much less foreign aid), it makes no sense for magical Britain to be a signatory or have a similar Treaty with other magical governments because NATO was a reaction to the budding cold war and there is no indication that there was any kind of magical equivalent to it.
