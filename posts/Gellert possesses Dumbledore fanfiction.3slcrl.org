anyone ever seen a fanfiction where it's revealed that gellert is possessing dumbledore and controlling him like a puppet? In canon with the whole twinkly eyes thing and how some of dumbledore's actions seem to contradict themselves it made me wonder since gellert was still alive if he was in fact possessing him from a far and he used what dumbledore believed in love to control him

ever seen any fanfics like that?

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
