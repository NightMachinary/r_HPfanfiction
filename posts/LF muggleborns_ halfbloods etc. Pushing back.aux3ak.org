Personally, when I'm blatantly insulted and disrespected, I often get angry and someone's violent. This reaction is stronger when the insults are based on my heritage or other factors i have no control over.

If a twelve year old soiled brat at my high school had gleefully called for my peoples genocide, I would have confronted him or if his family is as dangerous as the Malfoy I would have ambushed him and taught him a lesson.

If the school I went to didn't do anything to curb this kind of behaviour, I would probably get fairly spiteful fairly soon.

If my government was filled with people with such people, I would at the very least be distrustful of it.

If three government started implementing Nürnberg/ apartheid propaganda and laws, it would probably trigger a fight or flight response.

I'm also petty sure that if I or any other 11 year old boy were to be invited into a world of magic they'd at least develop an intellectual curiosity in combative aspects of magic, first because explosions are awesome and later because the existence of dark wizards, vampires, werewolf, dementors, dragons and most other nightmarish creatures you can imagine.

Didn't anyone prepare for the likely eventuality of pureblood aggression before the war or at least before the fall of the ministry?

Did muggleborns magically acquire wizards blind faith in Dumbledore and Potter?

Was Hermione the only talented muggleborn still alive from the last 3 generations?

Did no one snap after a lifetime of victimization, discrimination and outright violence? I mean even if you're a shitty wizard (Pettigrew) you can still do horrible damage..

--------------------TL;DR I'd like to read a fanfiction where marginalized groups fight back either during the war or just schoolyard stuff.

*** Not the best example and in canon I agree, guess I got used to the fanfiction version.

Point is, anyone can - blow up a gas line - drop a ceiling (like Lockhart did by accident) - go Longbottom on a cauldron.\\
- drop something heavy on another's head like Ron

You wouldn't have to be Gryffindor about it and you wouldn't have to be a powerhouse or a genius.

******* So factor in that Muggleborns were being specifically targeted whether they were in the Order or not, and the high likelihood that plenty of them just booked it out of Britain rather than fight, and you've got your reduced numbers of Muggleborn Order members that survived to see canon.

******* In Harry's year, there are exactly 4 confirmed Muggleborns: Hermione, Dean Thomas, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Sally-Anne Perks.

As for the Order itself, we actually don't know the blood status of many members: Caradoc Deareborn, Benjy Fenwik, Hestia Jones, Dorcas Meadows, Emmaline Vance, Sturgis Podmore, and etc... First names can be deceiving: Hermione is a Muggleborn, while James is a Pureblood. Last names offer no conclusion either: Black, Jones, Potter, Smith, and Vance are all common Muggle names, too. BTW, there is a Pureblood family named Dagworth-Granger.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
