Someone be willing to write this as a prompt every time I Try to it Just comes out sounding Like the worlds most boring essay about eggplants.


** I would give the advice, if you want to write a really good prompt, don't make it extremely specific right because the point of the prompt is to give a small idea and let the writer take it wherever they want. In my opinion, a prompt should be 2 or 3 sentences max. If you have something very specific in mind already, then it seems to me like you have a good foothold to write it yourself. A good foothold and plot idea is a really good start to writing it.
