So... I can't be the only one to think "Hey, Using James & Lily as Inferi against Harry is a line that I haven't seen crossed yet!"

Are there any fics where Lord Voldemort not only crosses all lines, but shits all over them while sacrificing a live fetus or something.

(Not looking for fetuses)

If possible completed, or at least updated in the last 3 months.


** The Return of the Marauders linkffn(The Return of the Marauders): Voldemort revives James to use againt Harry and the Marauders

The World I Leave Behind linkffn(The World I Leave Behind): Voldemort tortures Harry in the Chamber of Secrets for a year to remove the Horcrux, and uses the Imperius Curse to its /full/ ability. At one point, he imperiuses two muggles, and orders them to slit their own throats if Harry doesn't surrender.

Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy linffn(Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy): Voldemort has an alternative to Horcruxes here that somehow is /more/ horrible than murder-created soul anchors.

The Hero Trilogy linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero; Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero; Harry Potter and the Soul of the Hero): there are too many horrible Voldemort moments in this trilogy, but an example is that Voldemort captures and tortures someone because he /knows Harry is watching/, then lets them be raped and killed, and finally impaled on a fence.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** No one reads my fics, for good reason as they're slash, but I have a plot/draft where Harry gets captured (he joins Voldemort) and is tormented by people with the death of his mother. He is essentially in a cage designed as an illusion of a house. He thinks his free and has lives each day as he would. When his mother dies, the illusion resets and it starts again with him waking up and going downstairs to help her with breakfast.

He remembers every death, albeit slightly, and pieces it together and his mind doesn't reset properly and he believes she's dead. He believes that people killed her and begins to slaughter anyone in his path. He refuses to believe that she's alive, and that the version he is seeing is another illusion, but still protects it, regardless.

He is eventually killed, and mutters that he will finally join his mother, and that his work is done, who is kneeling over him.

I dislike happy things and everything I write is tragedy. I love it.

Not what OP asked, but I decided to contribute, anyway.

Edit: I detest Reddit for the fact people downvote and don't explain why. I really don't care, but I'm human and downvotes show that you think my post didn't contribute or was spam, which is what the downvote feature is for. You simply should not downvote because you dislike something. Feel free to downvote me, but take the time to explain why. Was it because I mentioned slash? Was it because I was bouncing ideas for OP to respond to? Was I being too edgy?

Really wish the mods would remove the downvote feature on the subreddit, to be honest. I see it way too often for no reason at all. Maybe 1/10 a person is downvoted for valid reasons. Meh, whatever. Lmao.

*** I did not downvote you, but I do feel somewhat sympathetic here, so I will try to channel some of the others here. If I am downvoted too...well I hope that I at least helped you out.

First, calm down.

Secondly, most people who post ideas or outlines for stories here (and other subreddits about writing) tend to get downvoted. Not always, but most of the time. The reason is generally because the request was about specific stories with a given idea. I have lots of ideas for psychological warfare in my fics, whether they are published yet or not, but I do not post them in 'Request' flaired post.

You have to remember, people are checking this for interesting things to "read," not for unpublished summaries parts or the whole of a story. Something like [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] might be more appropriate for that, or you could make your own post here.

And no, people generally do not automatically downvote you because its "slash." There are plenty of good slash fics out there (ex. The Sacrifices Arc, Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise), but its not to many peoples taste (only ~3% of the population is arguably homosexual, and fanfiction is often a form of wish-fulfillment for readers, no offense anyone).

I hope this helps, even a little. I understand that it can sting to be "put down" on the internet, even if you don't understand why.

**** I'm not even mad... not even bothered. At the end of the day, it's internet points that don't translate into my life whatsoever. What annoys me is that downvoting proves you disagree with something, and not stating /why/ you disagree is nothing but cowardice. It's disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing. Even then, I'm not surprised because that's how the world is.

Ah, yes, but the fact is that what I mentioned could already be completed and I was waiting to see. I have millions of words in drafted works, things that are complete and could stand on their own two feet with a teensy bit of editing. I didn't post what I did because I wanted to tease OP with a fic idea. I posted because I wanted to see whether it was an interesting concept and if I should use my time editing and posting it. The answer was quite obviously a firm, “No”. You see, I don't like to bombard people with fics that may not suit their taste, hence why I posted a little summary, to see if OP would have liked to read it. Yes, I spoiled the end, yes, I pretty much ruined the plot, but that's what OP desired. It was tragedy. People like to know whether the fic they're reading won't lift their spirits.

I disagree, not that there are some /rare/ popular slash fics, but that they're not downvoted on principle. Go browse the sub and find any fic that is requesting slash. It'll be downvoted. It's so bad that people needed to make their own subreddit so they can browse and post slash fics without having them bombarded with downvotes. Is that a fair thing? Why is the community so segregated when most of us are here for the same thing?

Now, go through the subreddit and look for Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, or a harem fic and you'll find the same copy and pasted, lacklustre romance, awful storytelling that has been posted again, and again, and again. I mean, people even read Hermione in Slytherin stories that are copied and pasted from the original book with /small/ changes and praise that like the author is talented. There is no reason for Hermione to be in Slytherin, except to be with Draco.

I veered, but I can assure you that slash is instantly downvoted. The titles of the posts are often clear in what they want, but people downvote them regardless. As I said before, the downvote button is for *trolling and abuse only*. Not because someone wants to read something /you/ don't want to read. This is what annoys me the most.

On a closing note, I hardly care. I stopped contributing to this sub ages ago. I run a few ideas by on threads, but I'll never post them here. It has hit the point where I don't want anything I have written, whether good or bad, to grace this subreddit. I mean, why would I? This community has been one of the worst I have ever been involved with.
