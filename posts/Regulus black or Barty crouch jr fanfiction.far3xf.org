** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] features Harry Potter reborn as Turais Black, Sirius and Regulus's older brother. Sirius and Regulus both feature heavily, although as far as I can remember Barty Jr. doesn't show up. Harry is the MoD.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

One of my favorite time travel fics (because it's closed loop which makes the most sense) where Regulus becomes a superhero and helps Sirius.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
