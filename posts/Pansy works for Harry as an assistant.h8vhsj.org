:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Heya, I am looking for a post-Hogwarts fic were Pansy Parkinson works for Harry Potter. She was either an assistant or a secretary. I just remember that he saved her from a bad situation and now they are sorta friends were she nags him when he is not taking care of himself. I think it was a Draco/Harry fic but I am not sure.. Hope anybody knows this fic. Cheers


** /Wizard for Hire/? Harry does odd jobs and Pansy is his assistant. It's not Harry/Draco though so it might not be the one you're looking for.

  Do you have a problem that needs fixing? Who better to call than Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world?

** I think it's PANSY REDUX. It's Harry/Draco and Pansy works for Harry. It's at Hex Files archive.

  Harry had his fill of conflict so he developed a little business and used his spare time for a bit of do-gooding. Daphne got her mastery and became a healer. They had shared a moment or two but Harry made a mess of it, to his great regret. Why did Daphne seek out Harry when she needed another perspective? Was there an ember in those ashes?
