I've been thinking about crossover between Harry Potter and other series' - specifically, crossovers where the 'worlds' of the two series are separate until the crossover, and the plot of the story primarily takes place in the Harry Potter world.

I've read a lot of these, but they very often follow one of two formulas - the characters of the other series become either students or teachers at Hogwarts. Frankly, I'm getting bored of it.

My question is, what crossovers have you read that use the premise I stated above, but do something other than the characters becoming students/teachers?

Edit: That title makes no sense. Should have probably said something like Harry Potter Crossover Search... not sure where the Beginnings came from.


** Well I'm into crossovers.

For me the important thing is how well the two universes mesh, for example I see a lot of potential on Harry Potter/Star Gate (roughly the same time-line, could be the same universe because of the Mascarade) not much on Harry Potter/Naruto (completely incompatible universes)

that's not to say that incompatible universes crossover can't be done right for example Uchiha Fokuro and Auryn are good Harry Potter/Naruto, so are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9245090/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] and Crumpets aren't my Style (HP/SG)

I'm right now reading The Denarian Renegade, even trought is a Powerfull!Harry fic is well balanced and the universes mesh well

So some recomendations if you havent read the

I've seen a lot of HP/Avengers HP/Sherlock HP/Merlin but never bothered with them they also seem to be really popular
