** I've never read any, there's no other universe I feel could work properly, except maybe His Dark Materials. If one caught my eye I'd probably give it a go, but I feel like there's enough to explore in HP.

I suppose people who like crossovers are just looking to combine their favourite elements of two different world's, which I imagine can feel quite exciting. It also offers the chance to transplant favourite characters, which could be fun.

***** Well a lot of crossovers are just like, a character or two that gets themselves stuck in another franchise's universe or vice versa. In that sense, the universes don't really have to blend since they never actually interact, just the characters.

But I mena, it's like you said, people mostly just wanna have Hermione Granger interacting with Tony Stark, or Bella Cullen with Luke Skywalker and see what happens.

***** I've been trying to think of one since I read this, and I can't. Even alternate dimensions don't guarantee a seamless cross - Star Trek, for example, has established alternate dimensions (the Mirror Universe is proof of at least one), but since magic and technology in HP do not mix, it would take a /lot/ of work (and technobabble, probably) to make them blend for longer than a one-shot or crack fic. So I really can't think of another fandom so easily blended with HP....

Thinking about it has made me think of Narnia's Wood Between the Worlds, though, and made me want a Narnia/HP fic using it. :/ I have no idea what would actually happen, though.

** I don't doubt that there are well-written crossovers, but merging two universes together always feels awkward to me, even if it's just one character who enters a different universe, so I don't really enjoy crossovers.

** There are some very well written crossovers out there. The Black Prince is one example that comes to mind right away.

True, the majority of crossovers that use HP as one part fail when it comes to balancing magic to magic/technology. Harry Potter magic is incredibly overpowered. Very destructive spells, mind reading, levitation,... it all comes without cost. There is very little magic that actually takes something from you. It is also instantaneous, very cause and effect and amazingly powerful stuff (relative to other universes) requires very little actual knowledge. Wingardium Leviosa alone could wreck some serious havoc in /a lot/ of other universes.

This balancing is often what separates an average to an excellent crossover. The Black Prince, for example, tackles this issue by making Harry forget about most of what he has learned in the original universe.

Shadow of Angmar, another great piece, takes his tools from him. Without a wand, Harry has to rely on the bit of theory that he knows to do magic with potions.

Or the enemy adapts. A lot of Avenger crossovers have SHIELD develop anti-magic equipment. Star Wars crossovers often use the vastly superior technology of the galaxy to challenge Harry.

Anyway... int the end it comes down to the same thing. Do you like it? Read it! Don't you like it? Close the tab!

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on. Harry is taken before he can make that choice and is thrown in an unexpected afterlife. Now he is on a mission to fight his way back to his own world.
