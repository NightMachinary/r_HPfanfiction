I'm looking for a specific story. It's not from FFNet; it's from the outside perspective of a muggle, he lives next door to Hermione and she seems really melancholy, they become fairly good friends and she tells him about a boy she left. Then later in the story Harry comes in and is revealed to be that boy there's a brief confrontation before that's actually explained though.

I believe the author wrote this story from two different perspectives, once from Hermione's, and once from the muggle's. It's post-war with Voldemort having been defeated.

Forgive my vague description, it's been years since I read it.


** Haven't come across any fic like that, but if I do I'll link it here.
