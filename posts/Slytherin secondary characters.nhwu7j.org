There's a lot of slytherin characters in HP that don't have personality, so the fandom make personalities for them. Here are my headcanons/fanon

Tracey Davis - Good at flying and a chaser, horrible at Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions, love and it's very good at Transfiguration, thinks History of Magic is boring and Charms is interesing. She is nice, respects everyone, is very patient and is friends with Daphne Greegrass. She is very short, white skin with some sunburns, cute, medium-sized messy brown hair and light brown eyes

Daphne Greengrass - Basically the oppsite of Tracey at class, good and Potions and DADA, thinks History of Magic is intersing (not the teacher), think Charms is boring, hates transfiguration and etc. She can be nice to the people she likes and super annoying to people she dislikes. Tracey is helping her become more respectful. She is tall, has long, straight blonde hair, white skin and dark blue eyes

Pansy Parkinson - Her parents divorced, she never go back home in Christimas because she pass one summer with her mother, then with her father, then with her mother... Loves makeup and "Witch Weekly", not so bad but not so good at almost all subjects and receives a lot of gifts while it's at Hogwarts because her parents want her to spend the summer with them but she don't want to make one of them feel bad. Pretty, medium height, white skin, short black hair and black eyes

Millicent Bulstrode - She has problems because she is unattractive but is a good person, she is Tracey Davis friend and talks to Astoria Greengrass sometimes. She is smart, likes flying, don't like Quidditch but loves watching Tracey playing. She isn't very patient and it's not afraid of using muggle strength. Short black hair, brown eyes, white skin

Astoria Greengrass - She has a golden heart, helps everyone that needs help, is smart. She looks like her older sister, but a lot more kind than her. Imagine Pansy's reaction when she finds out Draco likes her

Blaise Zabini - Dislikes Draco a lot, and goes to Slug Club because accidentally make friends with Cormac McLaggen. Cold and unexpressive guy but smart. Dark skin, hair is almost completely shaved, dark eyes

Theodore Nott - Draco's best friend, has the same thoughts as him. Hates the Golden Trio but doesn't like to bully them because of the times they attacked Draco and his gang. Same height as Draco, but has a longer brown hair and light green eyes

Vincent Crabbe - Likes Draco, but Draco founds him annoying. Following the canon, he's dumb and doesn't has much personality, uninteresing kid.Tall, white skin, black very short hair and brown eyes. Draco miss him a little after the war

Gregory Goyle - Not like Crabbe, he's actually good at some subjects, doesn't like bullying the trio but stays with Draco and gang because they are their only friends. Tall, black hair, and light brown eyes. Become a better person after the war

Marcus Flint - He hates gryffindors and is determined to win in Quidditch at all costs, even cheating. Marcus is very anti-social because he is always planning how to win, thinking how to win and training. He never made real friends, some kids on the team tried to make him more calm. Tall, dark brown hair, dark eyes

Adrian Pucey - Quidditch obssesed kid, when he tried to enter the Quidditch team, he tried in all roles and was the best in all of them. Chaser, he doesn't cheat and believes in fair play. He is attractive, black hair, black eyes and white skin

I'll edit to do more later


** I imagine Tracy, Daphne and Pansy being the less popular and less capable at skimming than the trio from Mean Girls. Tracy is the ditzy hot dumb chick, while Daphne is pretty plain, uninteresting and not that good in school given she is not mentioned being in any NEWT class (after all the only reason Harry ever noticed her was because she had the same first letter of her last name as Hermione).

Pansy is not as pretty as Tracy but a little prettier than Daphne, she is definitely the brains of the group (she is actually in NEWT Potions) and the most vocal so obviously the leader of her gang. She has an unrequited crush on Draco but Draco keeps her around because he loves the attention.

None of them come from important families (as most fics would depict them) nor are they that smart, as Slughorn shows no interest in them. In fact the whole Rita Skeeter thing was Draco's plan, who for all his faults appears to be the Slytherin brain in his year, and they just went along with it.

Millicent is not part of Pansy's gang and she is usually disregarded because she's not pretty and has a weight problem. Due to her size she appears intimidating but she's a good person at heart.

Astoria does appear to be a good person if you consider the Cursed Child canon. In all the stories I've read she's said to be in Ravenclaw and it seems that many people kept her blood curse as canon despite saying Cursed Child should be treated as fanfiction. For this reason that remains my headcanon. She is also way nicer than Daphne and I like to believe that the romance between her and Draco started developing when she joined one time her sister in the hospital wing who brought him his assignments as he was recovering from Harry's Sectumsempra. As a matter of fact from that point on we see Draco starting to depart from his family's ideas and I like to think she might have had something to do with it.

Blaise Zabini is the sarcastic and aloof guy. My headcanon is that the pureblood nobility doesn't exist and most pureblood families have ruined themselves over generations of inbreeding and most are more or less in little better condition than the Gaunts. However Zabini is the one student who is nearly as rich as Draco due to his mother inheriting wealth from her dead husbands. He also inherited his mom's good looks so therefore girls fawn over him but most get tired after a while of his distant facade. He is reasonably good in school but doesn't have Draco's leadership skills and is also not as outgoing.

Vincent Crabbe's personality was shaped for me by a fic in which he had a secret crush on Draco. Was it romantic or simply idealizing him for his family's prestige, money, leadership skills, brains I don't know, but one thing that prompted him to turn against Draco in the Room of Requirements was seeing this idealistic view being shattered which caused a lot of resentment on his side. As opposed to you, I think he's smarter than Goyle as he is reasonably competent with curses in the duel in the Room of Requirements but he is also the more sadist and violent of the trio. Draco might have treated him like a goon in life but he did consider him his friend and was sad over his death.

Goyle is the stupid one of the trio and he is essentially a brute who know he has nothing (no family prestige, money or brains) other than his intimidating size. He always feels like he has to live up to his family's past glory but is just unable to prove himself in any way other than through the most Muggle way. In reality he is not as violent or sadistic as Crabbe, doesn't care much about blood purity (as neither Crabbe or Goyle are mentioned among the sacred twenty eight), doesn't care much Draco or Voldemort but sees them as convenient avenues to restore his family's former prestige.

Marcus Flint is indeed the most brutish of the Slytherins and I think he is basically the reference Harry uses when referring to the Slytherin quidditch team as a bunch of violent brutes. My view of him was shaped by Mudbloods of the Death Eaters where he has an unhealthy obsession with Katy Bell who is way younger than him to the point he has to make all his girlfriends dress up in Gryffindor quidditch uniforms and call themselves 'Katy'. That might be an exaggerated view of him but I do imagine him as a brute with a soft side to the point he can be very inappropriate.

Adrian Pucey always seems to be portrayed as the good guy of the Slytherin team in fics that I've read but being that he is always I minor character, I haven't really given him much thought.

Theodore Nott is actually stated by JK to be a good friend of Draco's probably through their fathers' being in the same gang. She even said she wanted to write a chapter from Draco's perspective interacting with Nott in order to show how Draco is with people he doesn't dislike and supposedly humanize him? I imagine him to be a mini-Draco but not as rich, not as influential, not as smart and more shy.

*** Even if I don't like these characters, I feel like Rowling would write them the same way. Mostly of HP characters are a stereotype, but they are good developed so it doesn't matter too much

Harry is the stereotype of a hero, Ron is the stereotype of a best friend, Hermione is the stereotype of a bookworm and the list goes on. But these characters are more than the stereotypes. But if you look at thr minor characters...

Draco is 100% generic bully and bad-written, Crabbe, Goyle and Dudley are the "fat dumb guys" stereotype (I hate this stereotype so much) The others would be like this too. The girls would be "pretty dumb girl" stereotype, like Karen in Mean Girls

**** Yeah but they are written from Harry's perspective who views as brutes and bullies because they have an antagonistic relation.

****** I would think that the youth magical nazi division wouldn't have consisted of very nice people but still people nonetheless. However if the story is limited to Harry's POV that's as much as you'll get. If JK would have expanded the story to other characters' POV maybe it would have been different. Harry feels pity for Voldemort when we learn his backstory. And in similar fashion, take for example A Song of Ice and Fire (not the GoT TV show but the actual novel). At first Jamie is perceived as an incestuous asshole but as soon as the story starts introducing chapters from his POV he becomes a fan favorite.

******** True. But the story was originally intended as a children's book with cartoonish villains. And no matter what JK says I think she initially thought it that way. It was only when she saw that her fanbase was growing together with the characters that I think she decided to make the characters more human and morally ambiguous.

** I love these! Funnily enough I have almost an identical head canon for my Adrian Pucey (Quidditch captain, obsessed with winning, is a little more likely to cheat/play dirty than say Oliver Wood), also conventionally attractive but can come off as a bit creepy/obsessive when he likes someone.

I have a fanfic centering around a Slytherin OC with her two best friends being another OC and Daphne Greengrass. My Daphne is more of a follower than a leader, pale, dark hair, quite pretty, mostly is sweet, but also quite naive and just loves going along for the ride.

I'm trying to plot out a story centering around Astoria and I'm really having a hard time thinking of what exactly she would be like. I keep thinking of her as more quiet and reserved than Daphne, but I really /want/ to write her as head-strong, confident, and very kind/open-minded re: blood purity (basically giving a great effort to unlearn the prejudices she has grown up around, especially after Voldemort's defeat, but not without her biases bubbling up every once in a while). I like to think that she and Draco had a semi-arranged marriage, with both of their parents still holding blood-status in high regard, but Astoria really influenced Draco to challenge his biases and grow as a person (not without their fair share of arguments and setbacks along the way). I did not like Cursed Child, but I adopt Astoria's blood curse as head-canon; it's an interesting sub-plot that I plan to explore more in my fic.

It's very fun to discuss the minor character's personalities, wants, and ultimate fates. Great topic!
