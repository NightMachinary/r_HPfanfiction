Not !Godlike. Looking for Harry as an actual god or child of the gods such as linkffn(10218541). Useless brownie points if he is a child of Death. If it's a crossover, Percy Jackson only please.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him.

** ...."godling"?! And here I thought "elfling" was the silliest fandom word...

/(looks up the word "godling")/

Oh. Apparently it is a real word. According to the dictionary, a godling is a minor, inferior or local god. And apparently there's a species called godlings in Witcher 3, which looks like a creepy, grey-skinned child with round yellow eyes and a slightly wrinkly face...

Wow. You learn something every day!
