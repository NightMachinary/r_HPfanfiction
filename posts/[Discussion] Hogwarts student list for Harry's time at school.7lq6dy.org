****** Not that I've been able to find out. Mind you, I'm perfectly willing to accept her as a canon character, largely because thanks to her appearance in the video games she actually has some sort of a personality. That's more than you can say about Sophie Roper, Sally-Anne Perks, Kellah Kane, or even Daphne Greengrass.

*** I think so, the Slytherin team is comprised of all boys, probably because it wouldn't be 'fit' for a pureblood lady to play sports and it seems that all the other house teams are mostly boys playing. So naturally, we would know their names.
