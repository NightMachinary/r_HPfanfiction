no slash pls tho


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/][Out of the Night]] by Raining Ink is an old fic about Harry learning what it truly means to be a 'Dark' wizard. He gradually embraces that part of his life while struggling to keep the secret from almost everyone.

This fic excels with its thorough worldbuilding and has a strong cast of characters to expand on canon. It has some tropes (pureblood culture, inheritances), but in my opinion they are well executed. I also like that this fic avoids some of the worst pitfalls of Dark!Harry stories: no dark magic addiction, Harry doesn't suddenly develop an edgy personality and a taste for violence, etc.

Sadly the fic was abandoned years ago, but it's a great read and I recomend checking it out.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

****** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is the WBWL series I was thinking of. In that fic Harry and his friends gradually experiment with dark magic over the years, all in the name of learning to protect themselves. By 5th year Harry is rather proficient, but he has to hide it from everyone outside his friend group.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095391][Harry Potter and the Descent Into Darkness]] is a classic slash fic by Athey that would fit the prompt. The fic is tropey as hell, but I give it some slack because it was one of the earlier fics that popularized those tropes in the first place.

******* thanks! Saw mention of Sarcasm in another thread a bit ago actually and 2/3s through part one. Descent is one I think I've seen bounced around and haven't gotten to yet.

** Need to come back to this, I've been looking for the same thing. ANYWAY.

linkao3(20049589)\\
This one's a new one with almost daily updates and a little over halfway posted. Right before 5th Year starts, Harry manages to access the Black Library. Unrelated, thanks to the incident with the Dementors, he was accidentally expelled, and later re-admitted, but he has to be resorted. Between that, he starts to figure out quite a few things.\\
*EDIT*: I'm dumb. It's Drarry. It only /just/ started to hint at that bit in the most recent chapter and I completely forgot about it.\\
My apologies, OP.

Second time, even. It's apparently not remotely uncommon for this sub to see a request of something that we may or may not see a lot and think 'hey! I've got the perfect one!' completely missing the fact that it's one they already read or a bad pairing or...\\
I've done it for Stealing Harry.\\
Twice. *sigh*

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he'd been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
