I dislike fics where he gets to hogwarts and is suddenly king of everything and has a harem of basically slaves

i want fics where harry is pushed to become stronger either by his friends or his teachers or simply because of the pressure of being the boy-who-lived i dont want him to simply be strong in fights instead i want him to be a gifted student because truthfully it annoys me that after 2 attempts by voldemort to kill him and/or get a body he still choses to be a lazy angsty ass rather than try to stay alive

also i dont mind the power he knows not being love because it makes sense and not just in a self sacrifice way but that people are willing to do a lot for those that they love

** This was one aspect of linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) that I really liked, among others of course. Sure, Harry is really powerful, but by no means is he the very best and he regularly gets beat down or outmaneuvered and has to claw and scrap his way up.

**** Thanks for letting me know about the bot. I don't think it's abandoned yet, but only because it was 2 years between updates between chapter 51 and 52. Hopefully we can get an update soon though. :)

** I agree. This fic is simply amazing where Harry learns about his family, and learns to be better. I recommend it. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood]])

*** Honour thy Blood is 100% an absurd Harry story. He's not king of anything, but as soon as Arcturus tells him he's been slacking, he immediately becomes a god of magic and outscores Hermione on everything with about 2 weeks of work. The story is good, and the actions scenes are great, but Harry is definitely absurd.

***** It's been a while since I read it. Still seems absurd considering he got an O in literally every OWL including the useless ones. Whichever way you look at it, Harry is overpowered to the point where the war is easy mode.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
