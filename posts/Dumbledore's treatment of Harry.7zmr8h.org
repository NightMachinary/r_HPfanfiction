** Read manipulative/evil!Dumbledore much?

I'll try to answer some of your points:

1) Dursleys: firstly they are his only living relatives. By all laws and custom they really are the only legal and reasonable guardians for Harry. Even if there were other choices Dumbledore chooses healthy and alive Harry over potentially dead and blinded by fame Harry. Secondly how was he to know that Dursleys would not provide the best care for Harry? He is not a seer, nor is it his job to oversee Harry's life every moment. Despite all the verbal abuse by Dursleys Harry grew up reasonably healthy, strong minded and did not show any overt signs of abuse or neglect. Ministry? You are joking right? Ministry that is full of self -serving politicians, Voldermorts lackeys, ... Harry would have ended up with Malfoys in no time and then met an "accident" very very quickly. Leaving him with say Weasleys could have easily ended up with all of them dead or tortured to insanity. Anywhere Harry was placed would be a huge risk not only to Harry, but his carers as well.

2) Snape is a bad teacher with a grudge, but despite all that his students performed reasonably well. Even Harry. I think Dumbledore believes a bad teacher is a good lesson for life. Not all people need to be sugar tounged and bend over backwards. Despite all his flaws Snape was competent man and protected Harry in his own way. Besides Snape had to act in certain ways to make sure all the death eater kiddies would tell their parents what a great evil guy he is!

3) You accuse Dumbledore of orchestrating every hardship and fight for Harry? Get off your high horse. Dumbledore is only one guy (clever and powerful I grant you), but he hardly is capable to control and predict everything. I doubt he planned Lucius to unleash Basilisk or for Harry to sneak after the stone. Harry is to blame for lot of his own mischief. If he just went to professors / adults rather than charge in hot headed into situations ...

4) Train Harry? This one makes me laugh every timeI see in Indie/Powerful Harry stories. First and foremost Harry is an average guy - not exceedingly bring nor overly powerful. His attitude to studies is same as any other average teenage boy. He does well enough, but never brilliantly (except dada I suppose). Voldemort had life time of experience and a genius mind to boot over Harry. There is no one book Harry can learn and suddenly outclass grown wizards. Ultimately it is Harry who is to blame for his lacklustre academic performance than anyone else.

5) Even Dumbledore is stumped by Harry being placed into the tournament. He doesn't suspect fake Moody and the cup forms unbreakable magical contract so Harry has to compete. Of course we can guess at what the penalty might be. Loss of magic? Death?

6) Dumbledore set Harry on a path that he hopes might end with Harry winning (which it did). He knew Voldemort will go after Harry no matter what. Harry's life was in danger as long as he was alive. Harry could have chosen to run and hide, but he didn't. Dumbledore hardly forced him into anything. Like the line in the book - Harry chooses to go and fight head held high rather than cover and hide.

7) I very very very much doubt Dumbledore wanted to die. By his own admission he too was interested in conquering death. But when he knew his time was limited he chose to go out in a way that best aided fight against Voldemort.

Ultimately Dumbledore is flawed, is wrong at times, does make mistakes, is bit machiavellian, is outsmarted at times. Having said that he truly does try to give Harry as normal childhood as he possibly can given the circumstances. And then plans a way for Harry to ultimately win and live his life free of Voldemort.

**** He doesn't, really. He just says "I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years." This can be taken in a number of ways, of course, but it's not an "I knew your aunt and uncle would lock you in a cupboard and neglect/abuse you for ten years." He could just as easily have been talking about Harry growing up without his parents or away from the magical world.

If there's anything we know about Dumbledore, it's that he'll happily take any insult or accusation onto himself, but he doesn't like it when anyone else is badmouthed. Note that during that conversation, when Harry is raging at Dumbledore, Dumbledore's reaction is to tell him "you're not angry enough at me, you don't know all the terrible things I've done, so let me make sure that you blame me for everything that's even remotely my fault." Also note that Harry several times tries to focus his anger over on Snape and the Dursleys, but Dumbledore keeps telling him "no, no, don't be angry at THEM, be angry at ME, focus all your anger on ME."

While Dumbledore was not the sort to tell an outright lie, he was no stranger to tell the truth from "a certain point of view." And I don't think it's out of his character to exaggerate how he "knew" Harry wasn't going to be happy, just to make sure Harry is angry at HIM and nobody else.

***** How is that not exactly what I'm saying? He knew Harry would have ten dark and difficult years. No one describes an alright life like that. You wouldn't describe Teddy's life as dark and difficult because his parents died. That's absurd.

Dumbledore knew Harry would suffer at the Dursleys. The specifics like living in a cupboard, maybe not, but he knew he'd suffer. It's hardly up to interpretation.

********** Eh. People are too eager to cry "Dumbledore knew the Dursleys would abuse Harry and he still left him with them cause he's an evil evil man" and point to that bit of conversation as proof. Personally, I think we're seeing a similar situation to Petunia's rant about how Lily was always turning teacups into rats: Perhaps based on the truth, but by no means the whole truth.

I think Dumbledore was hoping for the best. After all, Petunia had been polite in that letter to him, and even if Lily and her sister were estranged, there was a hope that Petunia, upon finding her nephew on her doorstep, would take pity on the child, take him in and raise him as her own.

On a related note, people also say that McGonagall tells Dumbledore that the Dursleys will mistreat Harry, but she doesn't. She just objects to the Dursleys because they're Muggles and the great Harry Potter should not live with Muggles, because mere Muggles won't understand. And she gets kind of peevish about a one-year-old throwing a temper tantrum... you know, like one-year-olds DO.

I don't blame Dumbledore for dismissing those arguments, but at the same time I can see how they might have, in retrospect, caused him to blame himself for not listening to McGonagall, and as such say "I knew Harry would suffer in that house." And as such, when Harry is raging, and Dumbledore prefers him to rage at HIM instead of Snape or the Dursleys, he uses this and says that he "knew." Which from a certain point of view is true.

I'm not saying my interpretation is the canon facts... just saying that things have to be seen in context and it's never a good idea to just jump to the worst conclusion immediately. That way lies knee-jerk character bashing and far too many terrible fanfics that fall over themselves trying to scream the loudest about how their least favourite characters suck.

That's not what I'm saying. I'm not jumping to the worst conclusion, but there isn't any good conclusion to jump to from Dumbledore's own words. It's silly to just throw away his words as half-truths --- no, less than half-truths. He knew Harry would have a shit time at the Dursleys.

That was a decade before he gave Harry up to them. Again, hope isn't enough. He should have checked on Harry, at the very least.

You're talking like Dumbledore took it for granted that the Dursleys were monsters. There was no reason for him to assume this, other than that they were Muggles. Your "snake pit" parallel is flawed at best.

Not saying he acted without fault, I'm just saying it's a stretch to say that he knew the Dursleys would be abusive.

*************** I read exactly what you wrote. It's just that the quote /does/ dismiss everything you wrote. Do I need to give you the definitions of the words "Condemn" "Dark" and "Difficult"? Surely not. It's not an exaggeration to say Dumbledore knew Harry would have a shit life. You don't use those words positively.

If anyone is dismissing anything here, it's you. You're just throwing away Dumbledore's words as if they're nothing because it's convenient to your argument. Just because he's secretive and deceptive doesn't mean literally everything he says is false.

What reason would Dumbledore have to lie about that? The "He wanted to place blame on himself for Harry to rage at him" excuse is weak. Harry had enough to blame Dumbledore on. There was no need for Dumbledore to make something up to get Harry to blame him. Hell, Harry isn't even raging when Dumbledore admits this.

I'm not saying Dumbledore's evil. He had a choice. And though he knew Harry would suffer at the Dursleys, he thought Harry wouldn't be safe otherwise. I personally think that's a load of shit, but whatever.
