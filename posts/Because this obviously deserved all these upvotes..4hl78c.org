** I know that everyone says Draco isn't as bad in HBP but I completely disagree. You might pity him because he's being forced into a lot it but no one forces him to so recklessly try to kill Dumbledore and almost kill two other people in the process. He never shows any remorse over almost killing Katie or Ron so it always makes me wonder what people would say about him if he actually did kill either of them by mistake. I don't think everyone would be as quick to redeem him

*** I have written fanfiction in which I redeem Draco Malfoy, and I totally agree with you. I play with him because he's not Harry, whom I am a bit in awe of---he's a bit fiddly for me to manage. Draco seems more straightforward to me. And I was a teacher, and I know how brutal some kids can be, and then they grow up to feel wretched about it, or to mould it in their minds as having been different, but they are not vile baddies as adults. So a seventeen-year-old turd is not a turd for life. But doing a close, revisionist parsing of these books looking for St. Draco is more than I can bear. He is gleefully awful in the first four; in the last two he's no better but in over his head. That doesn't make him good; that makes him sympathetic to me only because as a teacher I had to care for all sorts of unlike-able kids.

** Have you never heard of the butterfly effect?

The smallest detail can always have the biggest change. Let's say that Harry did shake Draco's hand and they soon became close friends. Best friends, even. Harry would have had some influence on Draco regardless. He would have still been an asshole as people's personalities don't change. But I highly doubt he would have been such an open asshole. I'm sure if Draco learned that Harry was a Parselmouth and told his father, Lucius would be at Harry's feet as it was a trademark of the Dark Lord. Who knows? Butterfly effect. It's ridiculous to discredit the idea, as it has merit.

Also, OP, what gives you the right to bash someone like this? I swear this place was for sharing of fanfiction and ideas, not petty bashing.

Now, to look at your post in it's entirety.

"He's at his worst in the first three years"

What has OoTP got to do with that? The person CLEARLY said the first THREE years.

Third box.

What a great argument you provided. Clearly, the theory has some merit, but it's a movie thing and it has been somewhat adapted. It does make sense as Draco's character does seek after redemption. It does make sense, but I doubt that happened. I believe he just ripped the book because he could.

Fourth box.

The phrasing on this one is horrid, both by your and the person. Dumbledore did seek to 'help' Draco, but didn't seek him out.

Fifth box.

Addressed this one first. :)

How do you go from shaking hands to becoming friends... even best friends? They could never be friends. Can you even imagine if they tried to start a conversation after shaking hands? It couldn't last a minute:

Draco is literally a racist. He wants the mudbloods to die. He and his family are some of the closest supporters of Voldemort (you know, the insane murderer guy who killed Harrys parents). Not to mention that a person with an upbringing like Harry can't relate to an aristocrat like Draco at all: These things that Draco values mean nothing to someone like Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing --- last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. ... I hope it's Granger,‚Äù he said with relish.
#+end_quote

This is Draco Malfoy. How could Harry ever be friends with him? Unless you are thinking about fanon-Draco, who is an entirely different person. It isn't just the case that Harry wouldn't want to be friends with Draco, Draco also wouldn't want to be friends with Harry (and even if he wanted to, he still wouldn't because he listens to his father).

I'm sure Draco could be de-programmed and redeemed, but merely shaking hands or being nice to him and having a talk certainly will not do it.

**** redemption isn't something done to you, it's an inside job.. afaik.

most growth happens in response to living through the consequences of your actions and changing to avoid the fallout of a life like Draco's. Shielding Malfoy from the consequences of his actions doesn't offer him redemption, it makes Draco choosing differently less likely.

There's truth to this, but it can also be helpful to know that there are people who will support you if you defect. Someone like Regulus Black probably expected no other reward than death, yet he still chose to oppose evil.

**** Hmm. Maybe it's only me that sees a handshake as a friendly gesture. Draco offered his hand in friendship. If Harry shook it, then that's what it would be, a friendship. As for best friends, you never know. Look at Ron and Hermione.

Putting the sins of the father on a child is worst thing you can ever do. Find me a paragraph where Draco has openly stated that he wants all Muggleborn students to die.

My mum's a homophobe, yet I'm not. It's amazing how children aren't perfect replicas of their parents. What amazing knowledge that I have never seen before. Who knew. Just because my mum hates gay people, doesn't mean that I will. The same applies in the scenario.

Draco was raised to be that way, even if it isn't mentioned, it's shown multiple times. Everything regarding Draco is father this and father that. Do you even think for a moment any of the asinine garbage Draco spat while a child was his own thoughts and beliefs?

Noooope.

Your standards for friendship seem a tad low. I shake hands with lots of people - most of whom I don't consider friends, barely acquaintances. I even shake hands with people that I don't like or consider my rivals - sometimes out of politeness, sometimes for other reasons.

I just posted a quote where he is quite happy to see Muggleborns die. I think it's a fair extrapolation that it is something he desires in general.

Good for you. How is that relevant? Draco /is/ a racist because he says racist things. Draco /became/ a racist because of his parents. Are you comparing yourself to Draco? Do you say homophobic things? If you do you should re-evaluate your claim that you aren't a homophobe.

Yes it's a pity and I sympathize with a child like this. It's not entirely his fault. Yet Harry is not the redeemer of humanity (especially not at age 11-12) who will try to save everyone, see the goodness in their hearts and try to befriend them in order to turn them from their evil ways. He will listen to Draco and see nothing but an asshole who wants bad things to happen to Harry's friends (bloodtraitors and mudbloods).

No no no, all you have to do is shake hands with someone and you're 100% friends for life. This is why Tom Riddle grew up to be a completely sane, well-adjusted, benevolent and productive member of society after shaking Dumbledore's hand as an eleven-year-old.

******* Writing prompt: AU fic where shaking hands forms a magical friendship-bond between wizards/witches. Tricking people into shaking hands with you is a common tactic to gain power. People who master compulsion charms are the most feared Dark Lords. Little known fact: Through their magical intent the magical friendship-bond can be perverted and dominated by squeezing harder.

  ‚ÄòYou'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.'

  He held out his hand to shake Harry's, and Harry took it.

  ‚ÄòFinally, someone worth talking to! Uncle Vernon told me all about making connections with the right people and avoiding the riff-raff,' he said warmly.
