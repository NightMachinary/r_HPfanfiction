:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey I'm trying to find this one fic that I found a long while ago. It was a Harry Potter and DC crossover. I'm not sure if it's under a specific DC tag. But I do vaguely know that the story had Harry as the Superboy clone. But it was a mix with Kryptonian and Tamaranean DNA. I can't seem to find it or the author. Can anyone help me please?


** I'd like to read this as well, so if anyone knows?

*** Not quite. It's close but in this it doesn't mention the mix with Tamaranean & Kryptonian DNA. That's how they were able to keep the green eyes of Harry. And Harry was able to escape because Tamaraneans (working off of comic book power structure) absorbed red and yellow sun radiation unlike Kryptonians who only absorb yellow sun radiation and receive powers. They were using red sun radiation in the pod. Anyways the story stopped after Harry escaped and was found by Clark. Also Harry was the second clone after Connor.

In hindsight it may have been just deleted in which case I'm sad because I liked the story.

Thanks for trying to help.
