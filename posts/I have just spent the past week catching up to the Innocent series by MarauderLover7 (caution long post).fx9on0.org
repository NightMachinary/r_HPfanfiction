and now my life is empty until that amazing author updates again. Which, following their standard update schedule, is at least a couple of weeks away.

I didn't even know this amazing series existed until a week ago, when I literally stumbled upon it in another thread, as a recommendation for a fic where Harry meets Hermione before starting Hogwarts. I almost didn't click on this fic, can you believe that! I thought it would be another Harmony fic, and only the fact that it's a Sirius-adopts-Harry story convinced me to take a look at it. That night was the first time I pulled an all-nighter to read a fanfic.

But the most important thing that this series of fics that taught me is this: there are still /so many/ hidden gems in the fandom that I have /no idea about/. It was a revelation on par with that time I stumbled upon The Aurors by FloreatCastellum or A Hero by Celebony.

*So, in the interests of maintaining my sanity in these interesting times, I have come to the community with a humble request:* */please/* *hit me up with* */your/* *hidden gems. Any fic that you love, that you keep going back to, that you wish more people had read, fire them at me.* Just, please, keep in mind the following points (TL;DR in ALL CAPS):

- *NO BASHING*. Not even of minor characters, or characters like Draco or Snape. There is nothing that quite destroys interest in a fic like bashing, and of course, most of the time, it's directed towards Ron or the Weasleys as a whole, and Dumbledore is thrown in for good measure. In this context, I might point out that expressing a character's flaws is not bashing. Exaggerating them, without suitable character development to back it up, is. Ron being jealous of Harry because of his own insecurities and not believing Harry about the Triwizard tournament is not bashing. Ron being jealous of Harry and becoming a Death Eater with no other explanation very much is. Dumbledore being a pragmatic bastard and trying to mould Harry into a better soldier is not bashing, though very much non-canon. Dumbledore being a manipulative and secretive bastard for no discernible reason other than to basically steeple his hands and disdainfully mutter "Greater good" at opportune times is very much bashing.
- *NO HARRY/HERMIONE.* This is just a personal preference. Nothing against Harmony shippers, many of them are wonderful people, it's just that I can't stand this pairing.
- *NO SIRIUS/REMUS, SIRIUS/JAMES, REMUS/JAMES, OR WORMTAIL/ANYBODY.* For some reason, slash pairings between the Marauders gross me out. (And the thought of Wormtail in a relationship should rightly gross everyone out.) Probably because I see them as brothers, just not by blood. All other slash pairings are fine. In a similar vein, *NO SIRIUS/LILY OR REMUS/LILY.*
- *FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO HADRIAN POTTER BLACK PEVERELL WITH THREE HEIR RINGS, TWENTY GRINGOTTS VAULTS AND SPECTACULARLY AWESOME FAMILY MAGIC.* Do I even have to explain this?

In addition, here are a few tropes I am specifically looking for, so if your fic has any of these, that's a great bonus (TL;DR in caps):

- *GOOD DRACO.* Either a proper redemption arc for Draco or a story arc that allows him to question the pureblood supremacist ideology he has been taught early on, which can then trigger a change of heart and worldview. (Sidebar: Marrying a wife who is "tolerant of Muggles" doesn't count as a redemption arc.)
- *CAPABLE RON.* I am hoping for a Ron that is capable in his own right, for example in Intensity where Ron masters wandless magic, and does a lot more besides. But, at this point, I will take a Ron that is not just there to make up numbers.
- *SIRIUS ADOPTS HARRY.* One of my favourite tropes, this needs no farther explanations, I think?
- *CHARACTERIZATION OF FLEUR IN A SIMILAR WAY AS IN INTENSITY.* Without giving too much away, Fleur, being a quarter Veela, is treated both as a subhuman and as an object of desire by her peers. She is prickly, has few friends, and a desperate need to prove she is a capable witch, not just a pretty face. Which is why she enters the tournament.
- *FAMILY BONDING.* Especially if it focuses on the Golden Trio bonding as a family, along with whoever other friends they manage to pick up. But honestly, any kind of family bonding is ok. Sirius adopts Harry and now Tonks is his cool older sister? Sure. The Weasleys adopt Harry, and now he too has 7 brothers and one sister? Cool. The Dursleys are not evil, not bigoted, and act like a proper family? Amazing. (Just to be clear, I have read A Very Big Dursley Family, and the last one was inspired by that). Even Harry has a long-lost sister, or cousin, or another family on other continents is good, so long as it's well-written.
- *DEEP DIVE INTO MAGIC.* Rowling's magic system was...vague, to say the least. And the characters' use of that magic system even more so. At the same time, it has a /lot/ of potential. So any fic that takes a deep dive into the magic system is welcome. Elemental magic, wandless magic, new shield charms, new offensive jinxes, curses, creative use of transfiguration in battle, just a straight-up treatise on transfiguration, anything that expands the limited glimpse of magic we get in the canon is welcome.
- *BE GREAT IF YOUR FIC TARGETS TIME PERIODS THAT ARE NOT SHOWN IN CANON.* Canon rehashes are fun, but you can only read the same plot so many times. I would love to read fics that target post-Battle, post-Hogwarts, Marauders Era, Next Generation, even Grindelwald's Era. Also great would be fics that target unusual situations (just the other day I was reading one where a nuclear strike collapses Muggle society, which has knock-on effects on Wizarding society because they depend on Muggle society for many essential things, such as food), or "For Want of a Nail" type fics. That said, this post was triggered by the void in my life left by a canon-rehash fic, so if your fic does canon-rehash well, instead of basically regurgitating canon, please, fire it at me.
- *GOOD IS NOT NICE. (OR, as Remus says, "at least stun if you are not prepared to kill.")*If the fic is set in the middle of a war, Grindelwald's War, the First or Second Blood Wars, whatever this is really important. I don't want to see the good guys just shooting stunners or disarmers and then catching crucios or Avada kedavras or nasty bone-breaking curses in return. If the good guys are not shooting to kill, they better be shooting to maim.

Finally, please don't recommend anything by FloreatCastellum, Celebony, or White Squirrel. They are all on my favourite author's list.


** - OK, deep dive into magic ... linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure), I am not sure whether I like it that much, it seems like too much Malfoy apologists, but author's views on magic and magical world are truly magical. Probably, not so much hidden gem.

- In your favourite authors list you have not mentioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]]. That would be very serious error. Start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and you will have enough reading for the whole quarantine however long it is. (also on FFnet and SIYE)

- I don't know how much hidden gem is linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here), but it is for me one of two candidates for the best fanfiction story ever. Period. Very much not funny though.

- And couple of stories which are IMHO truly hidden gems with just little readership, but worthy of every character they use:

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] ... next-generation story, the main heroine is Holly, daughter of Dudley Dursley, but it is anything like any other Dudley-has-a-with-as-daughter story you have read before.

2. linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee) and its sequels. I think it is completely unique pairing and it is very much adult story (not that there would be that much smut, but because it is very grown-up story where prominently stands infidelity, forgiveness and similar stuff; if you are looking for the battle scenes, sorry, that is not that story).

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie by Amaru_Katari]] ... OK, I can understand why this is not so popular: it deals with suicide in very very open manner. If you have any issues which can be triggered, you should seriously stay away from this. The author was himself (or herself, not sure) working through a suicide in her family, and it is very obvious. Otherwise, very much worthy of reading for its honesty.

4. OK, linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) is another not that much hidden gem, but if you haven't read it, you should.

5. And two more light-hearted: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1464478][SIYE Apparition Challenge (2016-1)]] ... you just want to read it, even if you don't know about this deep longing of your hear.

6. And linkffn(3124159) ... penguins!

*** To begin with, THANK YOU for introducing me to Northumbrian. See, this is exactly the kind of thing I meant when I talked about hidden gems. I only read the first couple lines of Tales of the Battle and I already know I am going to love it. And I had no idea that such a talented author existed!

I have heard of Victoria Potter before, but I was never inclined to read it. Mostly because Slytherin Harry fics so often tend to go down the bashing route, or even worse, become straight-up pureblood supremacy apologia, and it leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. But, since you mention it takes a deep dive into magic, I want to at least try it out.

Holly at Hogwarts... YES!YES!YES! I really love Dudley has a witch as a daughter stories, and because you say this is unlike any other, I am super excited to see where it leads. Plus, from what I can tell from the beginning, it seems to be pretty well-written, and it is a full series? Why does it have so little readership?

Petunia's Letter. Hmm. Interesting premise and the fic is short and sweet. I confess, I am /not/ fond of the idea of Arthur Weasley cheating, which is what the tags are suggesting, but the idea is intriguing, and the story seems well-written, so I will give it the old college try.

Gryffindor Tie. Yeeeah. I have already read this story. Several times over, as a matter of fact. And I remember the first time I read it and wished it had continued, and then realized the author was writing this to cope with the suicide of her/his uncle and then felt like an asshole for wishing that. I don't want to go back to this one until I am at another low point in my life.

Grow Young with Me. *Facepalms*. I...had caught up with this one months ago, then forgotten about it while waiting for updates. Thank you for reminding me.

SIYE Apparition challenge. This one is going to be utter crack, isn't it? Just what I need more of in my life currently! Thank you for this rec!

And finally, Just a Random Tuesday. One of my oldest and all-time favourites. Written back when FFnet itself was still young, and I had barely started to discover the HP series itself. I have already read it, of course, several times. It just warms my heart to see people still remember this and appreciate it, and recommend it to others. So thank you.

**** - Northumbrian ... I always believed that it is one of the most famous fanfic authors. Period. His stories are really good and his style, I would call it magicians' realism (NOT magical realism, which is crap), is really really good, and something I would like to write like myself.

- You skipped over Puzzle, and don't skip over it in your reading. It is really good piece of writing.

- Victoria Potter is more “all your friends are trying to kill you” trope, but the storyline is not what matters to me that much in this case (and I have my huge doubts about it, but it has not finished yet, so it is hard to judge), but the universe author developed. Including special [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSN6uKdap435i9IJY2w2STNon9zBfbTHb0nQSJUYqMU/edit?usp=sharing][fashion]], special magic, everything. Really great in that aspect, at least.

- Petunia's Letter. Yes, the cheating is more complicated. And, I am a Protestant Christian, so I am strongly in the “no cheating on your spouse” camp, but this is not trying to be apologetic. She does something wrong, she knows it is wrong, and she is not trying to excuse herself. As I said, it is really reading for adults, who manage to deal with complicated moral situations. True art starts where it describes even the ugly and painful parts of life.

- Appartation challenge. Yes, it is pure crack, but lovely and really funny.

Just some comments on Dudley-has-a-witch stories.

Most of them are absolutely horrible. After the initial obvious panick attack scene (“Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! She got the same letter as Harry! What will my parents say, what will my wife say?”) and emergency visit from Harry, perhaps with some more scenes of “Dudley discovers beauty of the magical world”, they completely run out of steam, and they are either unfinished, or you wish they were unfinished, because there is no content there.

Aside from Holly I know only about few exceptions (I am very much fanatic on the conversion type of stories about Petunia, so I went through many many Dursley-related stories):

- linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) ... this is story is rather brief, but very good, its follow-up is /slightly/ too much Snape apology to my taste, but it is still very much worthy of reading, because it has its own independent story.

- [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] and its (unfortunately unfinished) sequel are rather strange in terms it is no-apology PG-13 afternoon TV series of high-school drama from Hogwarts. Troubles with boyfriends (not of the main protagonist), exams, Quidditch and so on. If you like (as I do) Kipling's “Stalky & Co.” or if you followed American afternoon TV (as I haven't), then you may enjoy it.

****** And this one is a bit tangentially related ... linkao3(19475812) ... Dudley has a magical child, but it is expected, given his wife is a witch. There are couple of one-shots playing with this pairing (some of them are good; I told you, I read really a lot of Dursley-related stories), but this one is the only one where it gets some significant development. I am not 100 % certain with the result (see my comments on the story), but it is certainly worthy of reading.

*** I caught up with it today.

I had promised myself that I wouldn't, because I knew I would have to wait for chapters if I caught up, bit I couldn't stop myself.....and now my life is a gaping hole.

That's why I wrote this huge text post, right after I finished writing a half page review for Intensity.

** I'll probably get downvoted bc I already recommended it a thousand times, but check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

Many are put-off by the main pairing and while I was aware of the fic, I generally hit the back button myself for years, especially seeing the length and the fact that at the time it was unfinished. But this is unjustified.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

It is a great "who-dun-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

It checks several of your boxes, especially family bonding, Ron is an Auror and actually good at his job, Bill and Fleur make an appearance and there is stuff going on with the Malfoys that I don't intend to spoil just yet.

Over 525k words and completed. Slash. linkao3(4267422)

*** I just checked this out, and, despite the rather... /unorthodox/ main pairing, the very first paragraphs, with the descriptions of Harry's spell-working, were enough to hook me. I can already tell I am really going to like this story, probably even despite the main pairing. Thank you so much for the reco!!

** It doesn't hit /all/ of your points, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) covers a lot of them. It has really good redemption arcs for Draco and Snape (particularly Snape, who is as bitter and twisted as ever, Harry just out-stubborns him). Harry moves in with Sirius about halfway through after Voldemort tricks the Dursleys into kicking Harry out. Harry delves into some interesting experimental potions (naturally), although Snape remains the master and has a pretty cool part in the final battle. First and foremost, though, it's packed full of dry humour and one-liners.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
