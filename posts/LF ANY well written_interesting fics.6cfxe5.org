So, it's been a long while since I've been able to find a fic that pulls me in. Maybe I'm more picky, or just finished all the good well known fics, but anyway.

I'd prefer non-angst fics. Apart from that, I guess anything goes. Slash is fine, but then again, HP/LV or Snape just feels so unlikely or wrong that it puts me off anyway.

Good humor or crack will be appreciated, as will long stories. Good!Dumbledore is always nice, as lately Stupid/Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore feels like a trope on par with Lord gryffindor/Slytherin/black/Merlin's son Harry.

A few of my random recommendations if someone's interested (also shows my taste, might be awful, I don't know)

linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle; Timely Errors; Seventh horcrux; Fantastic Elves and where to find them; Prince of the dark kingdom; A black comedy; Make a Wish; A riddled universe; Delenda Est; Nightmares of Futures Past; Whiskey Time travel; On a Pale Horse; The evil overlord list; Forging the Sword; Lily and the art of being Sisyphus; 0800-Rent-A-Hero; Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer; Applied Cultural Anthropology; A walk in Your Shoes by Spirit007; What you Leave Behind; Flying (& Other Scenes); The Horror! The Horror!; Stages of Hope)


** I made a comment recommending a few long fics: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6c65m9/lf_long_400k_fics/dhsn2n5/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage]]. I strongly recommend the last one if you don't mind reading non-HP works btw.

To this I would add linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter). Updates every day almost without fail. Harry respawns an indeterminate amount of time back every time he dies. However, he isn't overpowered due to some interesting plot devices later on.

linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's sequel. Nice world building (of the magic system, etc) and very well written. However, it does make Hermione seem like kind of a fixer sue if you compare it to canon.

I recommend other smaller fics from the same author as above --- linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) is nice. So is linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) and linkffn(Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue).

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation). Very suspense fully written fic with time travel shenanigans (kind of).

*** I had just seen and downloaded your recommendations from that thread! I have actually read A little child shall lead them, and quite liked it. I don't remember Hermione Granger and the perfectly reasonable explanation but the story's already in my library.. will have to check it out again.

Thanks a lot!!

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I know some good ones.

This is one of the best Snape fics, and one of the best Luna fics, ever:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/]]

/Harry Potter and the Iron Lady/ is by no means perfect, but has enough differences to the usual Major Canon Divergence tropes that It still feels rather fresh.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

** Since you're open to slash, have you tried linkao3(secrets by vorabiza)? Long, well-written, definitely a unique plotline, /believable/ development of a relationship, Harry who's powerful but not overly so, and still makes mistakes. Plus some nice humor to lighten the tone occasionally.
