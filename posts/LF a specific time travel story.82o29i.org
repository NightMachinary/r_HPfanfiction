In the mood for some time travel after a major mistake makes me want to do it myself.

The only thing I can recall is that Harry time travels back to grimmauld place and he finds himself in the middle of almost the entire(?) Black family

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
