Are there any fics where Muggleborns are given - well - 'Magical' DNA tests when they enter the magical community by a competent wizarding government that realized that - as JK Rowling once stated - the Muggleborns are the descendants of Squibs and can thus potentially resuscitate dead lines and sway the power of the Wizengamot if raised properly? If not, because I know few authors write actual AUs, Dumbledore administers one for the same purpose - or a completely different one - because he's not an egotistical senile megalomaniac bent on world domination, which he - as you all know - gave up when he ended the threat of Grindewald. I'm not going to get into that - because it's not what I want /here/ and there are enough competent Dumbledore fics.

Err; *TL;DR*; The wizarding community knows that Muggleborns are actually descendants of Wizards - causing any of a large variety of hopefully non-cannon compliant changes to the story line?

Edit: Ya know, I'm not sure I titled this the right way...


** I think there are a few but they fall into the same problems that occur when Harry is Lord of everything at 11 and single handedly solves every problem ever. An eleven year old would never be trusted with power.

For this to work it wouldn't be Harry's lot that are involved. You'd have Bill/Charlie's age lot who had finished Hogwarts making the changes that affect Harry's life at Hogwarts. If something happens off screen/page then it doesn't fit properly. Then again which muggleborns do we know that are around the right age period? Are they all going to be OCs? The big changes if this was introduced in Harry's first year would be purebloods would potentially buddy up to 'guide' the inheriting muggleborns. You'd probably have Lucius Malfoy and co looking to be chosen as regents or some position where they affect any power inherited.

Personally I've never liked the idea of muggleborns being decended from squibs etc. Maybe I just like to dream but it make the whole thing seem so much more insular. Magic should be magical, genes and the like should be relegated to science which I don't like being involved with magic.

*** Yeah, but /Harry/ isn't a muggleborn - he would have no reason to be tested. People like Lily Evans, Denis and Colin Crevey, and such would be. I would imagine that this would /change/ the world that we know from being cannon. It doesn't have to be their /genes/ either, just who they came from - it can be all magic or involve muggle technology, the concept would be the same.

**** My points were never about Harry, other than the one regarding Lord Harry stories. The point regarding Harry's lot is more about canon events. The majority of fanfiction is canon done 'right' what authors think should have been fixed and its what most people read. The question is does this affect canon events or is this a whole different kettle of fish? If it happened to Tom Riddle (remember despite being a half-blood he was for all intents and purposes a muggleborn) and he became publicly known as the heir of Slytherin then does canon even happen? If it happen to Lily's lot then we know very little about them and the issues of their time other than Voldemort was killing people and others were disappearing so we can't really predict what could have happened. If its Harry's generation then sure there will be changes but no big ones till they leave Hogwarts. A few classes might be added but its just as likely the Wizengamot would vote that if the family has been extinct for a number of generations the revival is counted as a new family. As far as I'm aware we don't even know the make up of the Wizengamot or who makes up its body.

I understand you want changes but when, where, what and most importantly why? The Lord Harry is easy, wish fulfilment, easy power and make things solvable. If you want Denis Creevey to still be Denis Creevey then what is the point? Money is power, knowledge is power, power is what shapes and changes the world. Does he gain access to this or someone else? Do they access it or is it a vague promise for the future and the changes are all leading up to when they can be claimed? If its the latter the change will be people trying to gain influence over the young ones and Dumbledore trying to keep Hogwarts as a school for children with no outside influence. You'd end up with a political fic that mainly happens outside Hogwarts, Dumbledore vs Fudge and Malfoy. Readable but hard to write.

***** I... I wasn't going to give a more specific prompt because I wanted to see what people came up with. Me not saying anything lead to you making that list, which in itself seemed to say most of what I presumed would pop up. This is a FanFiction subreddit, I'm looking for FanFictions. If I wanted something /specific/ I probably would have just plotted it out myself and been done with it. I wanted to see what there was out there in the ways of recommendations, I don't seem to have gotten much in that regard - just people babbling about how they don't like AU's - or how the wizards are too stupid to trace blood back a couple generations in a society that hasn't changed in longer. If /you/ think the /idea/ was too vague, well - thank you anyways for the long list of /ideas/.

I guess, that the change can be from anywhere - humans are creative, I want to experience that.

******* It's alright. I get how difficult it is to give a tone to written words without the aide of tells in speech and whatnot.

You would imagine, that with over 700,000 Harry Potter FF's out there that at least one person has attempted to write this. It's kind of disappointing that there are still original ideas out there - makes me a little disenchanted with the HP community.

I mean, 20 some comments and not one recommendation - just people saying in a sidelong manner that AU's don't have a place here. I mean, I read this really cool incomplete HP/Avatar cross over where the 4 houses each represented an element and things where different in that universe, so his parents where still alive. It didn't get far enough for the conflict to develop beyond conflict with the self. But things where /different/ not a re-hash of cannon.

******** It's actually likely that the basic idea has been had and written, likely more than once, just never by a good writer. The limiting factor of your request is that those fics most likely sucked and/or were abandoned. They may exist but people don't usually save then recommend shitty fics. Like the other guy kind of said, it's a very broad idea and it's not necesarilly a good or bad one. The problem is that fleshing it out in a good readable way hasn't seemed to have happened.

This is my opinion so others may think differently but yeah there's a shocking amount of fan fiction out there but most of it sucks. You see the same stuff recommended over and over because that's the majority of what's worth reading. Maybe it seems like there's not much originality and I'd agree that authors often borrow too much from each other but there is definitely a ton of cool unique ideas out there. The problem is that so many authors aren't very good so a concept may be really cool but the rest of the story has no quality to it so people don't read it and learn about those ideas. Few people actually sit around and sift through the dregs of the fan fiction community and fewer of those people do it for the purpose of recommending mediocre stuff to other people.

** "can thus potentially resuscitate dead lines and sway the power of the Wizengamot if raised properly" this is fanon. We never see the importance of genetic bloodlines in automatically inheriting wealth or contemporary political power in canon- for example, Sirius left the Black estate to Harry, who is his godson but no blood relation, and there's never any mention of things being held back for Narcissa or Draco or Andromeda or Tonks because only someone with Black blood can inherit them. And he legitimately gave Black magical family property to Harry, like Kreacher.

We also never see if Wizengamot seats are inherited or elected, or if illegitimate or unnamed heirs can take inherited Wizengamot seats.

You'd have to change implications in canon for bloodlines to automatically count so much. For example, the Death Eaters would probably be kidnapping babies for their bloodline inheritance before murdering their families and then secretly raising them. Or giving love potions to 'blood traitor' last heirs of bloodlines and then killing them after a viable child is born/conceived. As it is, canon doesn't show us inheritance laws too different from the muggle world.

*** Yes! Which would be why it would be AU; "fannon" is how we view her work, what has been developed around what was originally there, and often what is most interesting. Thank you for the lesson, because I didn't know that and appreciate being able to differentiate the universe we have built upon the one we where given.

I want to see /how/ things change, what people believe would happen if Wizards knew that muggleborns didn't just appear out of nothing - that they really where different than humans because normal people didn't have the potential to mutate into wizards. It could start anywhere - all the way back into the time of the founders even. Maybe Salazar isn't run off the grounds because his words have more meaning - assuming that's cannon - and the whole of Slytherin changes, drastically altering the flow of events that shape the world. Maybe some characters are never born. Maybe Voldemort never exists because Dumbledore knew what Riddle was when he entered school - everyone did - and he is imprisoned for releasing a basilisk - if he ever does. Maybe the Chamber of Secrets is never even built - maybe the Slytherin common rooms aren't under the black lake and that slightly shifts the perception of the group enough so that people are scared but not terrified of being sorted there. Maybe Lily Evans is the descendant of [Insert Wizarding Family] and is treated different for it - her sister a Squib, not a muggle and thus able to interact on a small scale with the wizarding community.

I could go on? But at this point I'm fairly certain I lost sight of responding to your original point. Maybe I'll just make another post asking for actually AU AUs where the laws of the universe have drastically changed and the outcome - while involving similar characters - is no where near the same and the journey that brings them there bears little resemblance to cannon.

*** I meant "magical" - as in bloodline testing? I don't know, the wizards live longer - right? - if they didn't squander their lives with useless political maneuvers they would probably be more advanced - or at least be able to use preservation charms? Also, for a society that values blood so much - you would think they would care more about where they have come from. Also, you have the family trees like the twisted one in Grimmauld Place that records the entire Black family? Should I be more specific? I assumed that people would understand that I meant - as wizards - they would use magic to accomplish the task. Did you read the rest of the post? Or just comment on the title - because I retconned most of the 'DNA' bits in favor of an AU but I probably ordered it wrong so I might not get any helpful responses.

Edit: I am a rambling mess, sorry.

I meant that the Wizards would use a magical substitute for a muggle DNA test which would presumably be able to stretch back far enough to get the job done. They live for a very long time and are powerful - so the task of conceiving a potion or spell or rune array that could do this is not impossible.

The only fics that I could think of are your typical Lord Potter fics that sometimes feature this. However, since those are all basically one and the same, I couldn't hope to filter out the ones that actually have that - since, and here's a shocker - it never actually changes anything. Hermione could be the next Lady Ravenclaw in these fics, she will /STILL/ find herself crying in a toilet stall on Halloween when a troll comes into the bathroom.
