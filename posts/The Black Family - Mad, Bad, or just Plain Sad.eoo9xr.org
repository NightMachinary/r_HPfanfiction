So, a thread today brought up 'the Black Madness' and pointed out how it's an entirely fanon invention, despite having some implied basis in canon, and it reminded me of a fic I can't find. I'll talk about that at the end, as a request and a prompt in case this fic is just part of my imagination.

The main thing I want to ask is just a general request - any good Black Family fics where they are 'mad'. Any form of mental health difficulty is acceptable, whether specific or generalised, explicit or implied/inferred. No other limits, either. Slash, no slash, weird tropes like MPreg, 'crap' cliches like Helpful Goblins, Any character, any time, any world (by which I mean canon or AU). Just no neurotypicals.

I think the fic I recall was a Harry-goes-back-to-the-Blacks fic, though I am uncertain of that, but the main thing I remember was the treatment of the 'Black Madness' being really interesting. They were mostly having difficulty with emotional regulation where they feel everything and can't really suppress their instantaneous reactions like neurotypical people can - think River Tam from Firefly basically, where they can be calm a lot of the time, but when they get roused they're really all-in on it. A few had other issues, I think one was a schizophrenic, another couple were psychopaths, one IIRC was bipolar, etc, while Sirius and Andromeda played 'Straight Men' for the insanity. They still loved one another - even the psychopaths, disappointingly - but they fought a lot and were very passionate and mercurial folks between the colder emotional-stretches. They were all very infight-ey folks, to the Game of Thrones level of infighting, but there was a distinctly frenemies relationship where they loved one another as family, but would stab anyone of them in the back for advancement, yet they'd all band together to fight outsiders. I don't remember a plot, but I vaguely recall it being quite political. Lots of Machiavellian manoeuvring and cunning plots and debates over issues and such. The Black Madness might've even been a Blood Curse, which could've been the plot, but I could just be getting that confused with another fic.

If this isn't a real fic that exists, or we can't find it, consider it a prompt! The person I was chatting with wanted to see more good examples of the Blacks being examined as real and complex people instead of just flat, crazy caricature monsters too. So you know you've got two interested readers already, right? :D

PS - for those of you who don't know, 'straight man' refers to a comedic role wherein a person acts normally in the face of another who acts weirdly for comedic effect. Think the Abbot to the Costello.


** I'm actually doing an Andromeda-centric fanfic that's pre-canon. It's currently at 3 chapters with a little over 10K words total and the perspective slowly becomes more detailed as Andromeda grows older. Let me see if I can work the bot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21012335/chapters/49972808][linkao3(21012335)]]

I really wanted to explore the family as having several complex and somewhat individualistic characters. Sure, as a family they have plenty of issues, but I didn't just want them to be plain abusive. Just because they're a family of bigots doesn't mean they exemplify the worst kind of human beings in every aspect. That's unfortunately not how it works. I also really enjoy Andromeda's perspective for this as I think she overcame the prejudices much later than Sirius did.

There also recently was an incredible fanmade shortfilm that followed Bellatrix (though it had some focus on Andromeda and Narcissa as well) from before she became a Death Eater and bow she fell in with that crowd. [[https://youtu.be/0hrcRtu45TU][Here's a link for it!]]

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13381295/1/The-Choices-That-Make-Us][linkffn(13381295)]] which goes a little into the backgrounds for Andromeda, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Sirius, and Regulus that I really enjoyed reading as well. I wish it would have shown more of how they became the people they are, though.

Sadly I can't think of any other fanfics where the Blacks were a main focus that I really enjoyed the portrayal of them. However I haven't read that many of them to begin with. I'll definitely come back to check any further suggestions, though!

Edit: I can apparently not work the bot, I linked the stories directly instead.

*** You had my interest, but I read your first chapter and you very much have my attention. I love that little detail of Bellatrix being the one to coin Andi and Cissy. You, milady Eternal, have a fan. :)

**** Pfew, I'm glad it's to your liking!

Bellatrix has suffered a long time in Azkaban, but even in canon she had a certain aptitude for nicknames. Granted, they were meant to be mocking, but still. She appears to enjoy coming up with them. :D

*** I really like your fic! I'm always on the lookout for a good Andromeda centric story! I like how you weave in what's happening in the Muggle and Wizarding worlds politically along with exploring different Blacks. I think it's interesting to include names that were blasted off the tapestry - like Marius and Cedrella. Maybe it was just Walburga blasting off anyone she didn't approve of, rather than formally disowning them from the family.

**** I'm really glad you like it! Andromeda offers a lot of interesting perspectives. I'm pretty excited to explore the inner turmoil later on. :)

I do think Walburga takes extra pride in her heritage and as a result is much more sensitive to any slights against her family - or at least anything that goes against how she perceives it. The Weasleys are sometimes said to be blood traitors in certain circles, but at the same time they're still considered a pureblood family. They're even part of the Sacred 28. It could be that their status as blood traitors is more recent than the list of the Sacred 28, but the book is from the 1930s and it's implied that the Weasley family is rather substantial. I find it hard to believe all branches of the Weasley family became "blood traitors" within a few decades. After all, we had a few Blacks that were more concerned about equal rights, too, and that's mostly passed off as an individual phase. I think the rest of the Black family might not have preferred the Weasleys at the time, but that they still considered it a more isolated case that would rectify itself, so to speak.

Marius is of course more controversial - he was canonically blasted off the tapestry because he was a squib. I don't think /any/ pureblood family would be thrilled about having a squib: even Ron mentioned a squib cousin that held a job as an accountant, but that the family doesn't talk about him. My version of Cassiopeia simply ended up quirky in regards to dealing with Marius. Well, she's a bit odd in general. I think she enjoys being a little controversial, but she still holds firm to the family's ideals so everyone else usually tolerates her rather well.

Either way, I think the family wouldn't simply disown someone like Cedrella (unless they would be very outspoken against the family), but they would disown someone like Marius.

*** Totes! It is a little sad, a family ravaged by madness and evil like that. Very Lovecraftian undertones to that depressing imagery, hmm?
