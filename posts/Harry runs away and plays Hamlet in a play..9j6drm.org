This is a fic that I remember reading several years ago. In which Harry runs away from the Dursley's and is homeless. Finding a job reading tarot at the back of a pub with a shady owner. His friend a homeless girl asks him to audition for Hamlet. He doesn't get the part but is cast as the understudy to the main actor. His friend is cast as Ophelia's understudy. On the opening night the main actor elopes with the girl playing Ophelia and Harry is forced to play Hamlet for a night. Right after the play Hermione and the Weasley's arrive forcing him to go back to Hogwarts. I think the title was something about an alchemist though that could be wrong.

The other fic I've been remembering has Harry going back in time meeting Merlin who is amazed at his ineptness teaching him wandless magic and woodcraft. They go to a Wizard city where wand users are discriminated against. There are dragon riding wizards and elves. Harry gets in to a duel with a Malfoy like scion over a girl and is forced to leave the city.

Any help would be appreciative. Thanks
