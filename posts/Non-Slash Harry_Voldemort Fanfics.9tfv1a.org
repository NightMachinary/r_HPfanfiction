Every fanfic I've found with them both has slash, not really interested in that.

Fics similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]]

** Both of those fics portray Voldemort as an ambiguous enemy who harms Harry as much as he helps him. You might like these fics as well.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]] - (110k+ words, dead) Voldemort is cautious when reacting to the prophecy. He kidnaps Harry after murdering his father and then begins experimenting with possible methods of circumventing the fate laid out for them both.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - (169k+ words, ongoing) Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and discovers that Harry is a horcrux in the process. He abducts Harry and begins to rebuild his old powerbase while coercing Harry into apprenticeship.

- [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9408516/1][Hit the Ground Running]] - (120k+ words, complete) Fic by [[http://fanfiction.net/u/836201][Tozette]] originally on FFN. When Harry is ten years old the horcrux in his head awakens as a result of a near-death experience under the tender care of the Dursleys. The premise is similar to /Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux/ but only covering events up to the end of first year, and with much larger departures from the stations of canon.

  Prophecy brings nothing but ruin, and half a prophecy is even worse. Lord Voldemort is neither fool nor weakling; he vows to break away from the prophecy's accursed magic. He is ready to defeat Albus Dumbledore at his own game. After all, Harry Potter is just a boy. AU, sort of Mentor!Voldemort.

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the new world is far more dangerous. Death himself has come to claim his due. Dragons, fairy lords, sorcerers and a town under threat, it's practically your average day. A story of Harry and Voldemort in a dark and dangerous fairy-tale world. No relationships.
