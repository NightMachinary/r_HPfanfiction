In a world where the Malfoys never served Voldemort and Narcissa was Lily's best friend throughout Hogwarts, the Potters aren't alone the night old Voldemort comes for a visit. They're babysitting young Draco Malfoy while his parents go out for date night.

This is how Draco Malfoy is proclaimed by Dumbledore to be The Boy Who Lived later that night. Whether he's actually the BWL or this is a wrong BWL story is up the author.


** Fun fact is that Draco was also born as the seventh month dies, wasn't he?

*** Nope. June 5th. So as the sixth month begins.

**** Perhaps, except that whole interpretation of it is a mess. Seventh month since when? There is no reason to believe it had to be the seventh calendary month. I wrote about it in linkao3(22663204) ... we don't know exactly when the prophecy was given, but if it was November 1980, then seventh month from then, would be June 1981, right (which would fit Draco)? Or what about seventh month of the parents's marriage, that would be juicy scandal, right? Or do you know that the seven months is considered the shortest possible length of pregnancy for baby to survive?

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).
