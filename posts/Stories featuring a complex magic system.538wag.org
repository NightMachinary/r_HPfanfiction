Alright, my final post for the day!

EDIT: Harry-Centric please!

Over 70k+ words!

*** A system with well thought-out and self-consistent laws that makes all kinds of conflicts more interesting to play out. Think of chess rules, for example: a queen can move in any line she wants and is valued for 9 points by herself, but if she's put in a bad position a 3-point knight --- or even a 1-point pawn --- can blind-side and kill her.

So a complex MS would make strategy much more important in magical battles (v.s. simply shooting laser darts at each other from a wand and dodging, for example); but it would also make mundane scenarios much more abusable as well. Getting information out of someone in the middle of a ball going on, stealing from headmaster's office, finding ways to destroy an immortal creature or becoming immortal yourself, etc, etc.

** Wizard of the Kaleidoscope was pretty complex once it started rolling. Really you should look into the Irregular at the Magic High or Fate/Stay Night fandoms for this though

**** I could've sworn it was finished, but I read it years ago.

I was thinking of writing something with a similar level of complexity but it's a daunting task. The cosmology alone blends a bunch of different anime together

** I really enjoyed the magic and world-building in linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold). It has a variety of new species and races, and a very complex blood magic system (best one I've read). It's about 250k words, and has a sequel. There's a third story, but it's seemingly abandoned, since it's been years since the last update (2009). One of my favorites though.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Jbern's fics are a bit more detailed and he (the author) has created a few spells. So the fights aren't just shooting colourful bolts. Bungle in the jungle has a very defined ward theory too.

** Yo check out the Albus Potter series it's super good and has a crazy magic system that's not so crazy it's unrealistic compared to canon magic. Linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) there's 7 books so its a really good read.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** Complex magic systems are so boring, I always thought that Magic shouldn't be limited as it already is something that is "impossible". That is why I never understood the limits to Transfiguration, Conjuration etc... it's not like Harry takes interest in it anyways.
