I'm looking for Harry or the main cast spend some time with dodge training. Mostly I just want to read someone chucking impossible objects at people to train them to dodge spells. Maybe dodging has become a subconscious reflex on the same level as breathing so even when Harry was knocked out, dead eaters couldn't take him down.


** Isn't this what quidditch is?

They are flying who knows how fast in all directions with a pair of iron balls able to track movement and ram into you.

Anyway, that would just be a dumber version of what was goin on at Hogwarts while the trio was out twiddling their thumbs and bonding with a hunk of Voldemort's soul.

** Bonus points if they're forced to dodge ridiculous things in training, such as Killing Curses or Banished trucks.

** I do know a story that employs it but its a slash fic so you might not like it:

[[https://kibatsu.livejournal.com/14375.html][Nights of Gethsemane by StarCrossed]]

And its parallel piece, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10190042/chapters/22629575][Invictus by StarCrossed]]

** The key to dodging spells isn't agility; it's prescience combined with Legilimency. I can't see how an unconscious Harry could still dodge spells, but he could enchant some floating thing to intercept incoming spells and sharp objects for him.

** Bonus points if the dodge training is something that Piccolo would do.
