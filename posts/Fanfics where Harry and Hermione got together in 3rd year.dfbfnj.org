I'm looking for good fanfiction stories where Harry and Hermione get together in 3rd year onwards.

T to M rating preferred.


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2886471/1/More-Important-Than-Any-Broomstick][2886471]]) is the first one I could think of lol.

***** If I was looking for lemon fics there are dozens out there that are easily found.

I'm looking for something something well written but isn't constrained by lower ratings since language, violence, and other mature themes aren't usually found under ratings under T.

#+begin_quote
  It's Christmas in Harry's third year. When Hermione causes his new Firebolt to be confiscated, he realizes that she is more important than any broomstick to him. Continues on from there through their fourth year. Technology is 10 years ahead.

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.
