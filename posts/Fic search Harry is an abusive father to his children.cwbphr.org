** If it wasn't for the second paragraph, I'd say it was Cursed Child.

Good luck though. If you can remember said characters involved, that'd probably jog some memories.

*** I mean, it's not uncommon. Although this is a bit extreme.

Harry's frame of reference of what is a healthy family isn't great. So it's a bit like Britney Spears, who admitted to giving her sons cough syrup and alcohol to get them to sleep just like her parents had done to her, and it was through court mandated parenting classes that she learned how to be a parent.
