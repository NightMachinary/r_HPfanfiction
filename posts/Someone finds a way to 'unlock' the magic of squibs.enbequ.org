Coupled on top of the theory that muggleborn are witches and wizards descended from squibs... a spell or a ritual or something that unlocks the magic of squibs and those from a line of squibs.

Imagine something happening that gave Petunia and/or Dudley access to magic or Arabella Figg or Filch, etc.

People who accepted that they just weren't going to be able to do magic suddenly being able to do that which was always out of their grasp.


** There's a scene like that in The Arithmancer. Hermione, Harry and Ron develop a method which allows Filch to brew a potion.

** Mischief's Heir by Mad Fairy has that, but it's waaaay at the end of the 450k word series. It starts with linkao3(4629198)... it uses something other than a spell/ritual though to "unlock" magic in squibs. The crossover element can be more or less ignored, whatever you learned about the MCU via osmosis is plenty to get by.

Disclaimers: The series begins as an over the top crack fic with flaws turned up to eleven. It eventually goes away and turns into a more serious story by the end of the 2nd installment (and a pretty damn good one at that) but the first installment won't be everyone's cup of tea until the author does a fair bit of backpedaling. That's not to say that it stops being cracky - it doesn't - but it's more like the Thor franchise ridiculousness instead of the in your face stuff that was there early on..

** Weirdly, Voldemort as the Leader of a Pureblood Regime does this in Nose to the Wind. Harry is a squib and Voldie works out how to give him magic.

There's also that Nonjon 'Where in the world is Harry Potter?' series where Dudley gets magic and beats up some Hogwarts kids with it. I can't remember which one of the three its in, but here's the link to nonjon's profile.
