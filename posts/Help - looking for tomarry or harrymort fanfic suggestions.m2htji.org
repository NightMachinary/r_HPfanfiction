I've literally read mostly all the tomarry/harrymort fanfics out there, but I'm looking for a completed story with about 100000K works min with good happy ending.

Any help would be appreciated, I'm just looking in general for a 50-90 chapter tomarry fanfic that will fill my time.

#+begin_quote
  Harry walks to the Forbidden Forest with a newfound sense of self-preservation, a skill he knew once in early childhood but had somehow lost upon arriving in the magical world. But it was back with a vengeance, and Harry would not relinquish it again. He would survive, dammit, if it was the last thing he did. AU from “The Prince's Tale” on. Eventual Harrymort.
