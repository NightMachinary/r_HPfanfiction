This is an incredibly specific request and I'm sorry.

I'm looking for fics where, when they reference Muggle music at all, it is accurate to the canon timeline.

Harry and co in Hogwarts listening to Nirvana and Jane's Addiction or NIN or anything else popular in the 90s: AWESOME. GIMME.

Harry and co in Hogwarts listening to The White Stripes or The Black Keys: ehhhhh.

Harry and co in Hogwarts listening to Katy Perry: noooo.


** hey, I totally get it, I looked up UK charts from the 90s and then researched when songs were released just to double-check that I'd gotten the timing right

I think the most music references are in this one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21563551/chapters/51408658]]

** Well, I have Harry using the REM song "Everybody Hurts" to time cooking sausages long enough as well as listing to the BBC news about the war in Rwanda. Both are very minor mentions in the first 25 chapters of the fic which is 145 chapters and counting. But I really enjoy looking up those details.

** All The Young Dudes starts in 1971 and references a ton of rock music from that era, especially David Bowie. Sirius collects records and it even shows Remus watching specific performances on Top of the Pops. .

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** linkffn(Severus Snape and the Art of War) is period-accurate to the era it is set in -- not just in terms of music, but also events in general -- weather, historical events (from serious things to more mundane stuff like music concerts), etc.

** There is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][A Very Slytherin Harry series]]. The first work is linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree).

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12029172][Pyrite]] Snape has a turntable and a big collection of vynils and Harry likes it, he then gets a Walkman on his birthday so the music topic is mentioned pretty often after that.

  There was a mix of muggle albums: The Clash, GBH, Conflict, Subhumans, Crass, The Pogues alongside more obviously wizarding made ones: The Hobgoblins, Thestral Sight, Sickles Over Galleons.
