** Harry doesn't tell his life story to every person he meets, as soon as he meets them.

** I think one key point time travel stories often miss is how fickle time can be - seemingly insignificant change can have tremendous consequences. I like stories where this idea is explored and where time traveller changes the future without realising it. In other words the more time you spend in the past -less predictable and knowable the future is.

For AU stories I like where change originates from a single decision. So as a reader we can understand the AU and consequences of the change make sense. Lot of stories do bunch of random changes without any seeming reason. Generally I consider it a sign of weak/bad plot.

** I think many authors when writing Alternate Dimension stories, like ones in which James and Lily are alive, focus on the angst within Harry rather than on the relationships he's forming with the people around him. It's always a version of "They aren't your real parents, don't make the mistake of loving them" etc etc. I think this is boring and detracts from the very point of making an alternate dimension story in the first place.

Harry's greatest wish ever since he could remember was to have a family. He suddenly gets the chance, and because the author thinks it adds depth and angst to his character, makes him avoid forming bonds with his parents.

One of my favorite stories, and definitely best alternate dimension story is Jono's Stranger in an Unholy Land (we don't talk about the abandoned sequel). I think it was superbly done, with Harry coming to the gradual realization over a few chapters that he was on an alternate earth -- one in which his parents were alive. When he finally came face to face with his parents, his first instinct was to rush into their arms, not to hide and avoid them.

Of course, it wasn't perfectly done. I felt that he got comfortable with them too fast. But it was still so much better than hearing him whine for chapters on end about his conflicted feelings about his alternate parents.

That, in my opinion, is the key to making an alternate dimension fic where he meets his parents work.

** For time-travel, the key is to not keep the timeline intact. Not even when the characters are stupid enough to try that. Explore the butterfly effect, and go wild. Don't create a closed time loop either - that's among the worst kind of "what you do doesn't matter" story, like "it was all a dream".

For both kind of stories, being consistent and keeping an eye on actions and consequences in worldbuilding are key. If Lily and James are alive, what was Harry's childhood like? What is their relationship to Severus? What is Harry's reputation? And so on.

** Jensen Ackles, who plays Dean Winchester in Supernatural, once responded to a comment that some of the episodes were really meta. He said that he didn't care what situations they threw him in, as long as he would never have to break character. As long as it was Dean dealing with that situation, not Jensen.

I think that's the key to writing great dimension/time travel stories. Whatever situation you put Harry in, have him respond to it in a way that fits his character.

** The key to writing any good story boils down to three things: Interesting characters, interesting things for them to do, and good writing. That's it. You can write the dumbest premise possible and have it succeed as long as you do that well.

That of course is one reason time travel/alt dimension stories fall flat on their face. By trying to retread canon they don't give their characters anything interesting to do and the story becomes a boring slog.
