Idk just popped into my head. I know it would probably not fall to Ron first but work it out I guess


** The reason it goes to Harry and not Ron/any Weasley, or to Draco(whose mother is a black by birth) is because Harry is Sirius's godson and named heir, at least that's the normal justification in fics that do the Lord Black thing in the first place. Harry has the required ancestry and the vote of the most current Lord Black, not just the ancestry.

*** See I never got that, because Sirius died as a runaway criminal, so he never got to be Lord Black. But surely that actual Lord Black before him would leave the title to someone in his will, right? Most likely Draco, as he is the closest male heir to the main Black line.

Also, I thought Sirius was disowned? Or was that only on the family tree but never legalities?

Anyway, point is, someone had to hold the title while half of the remaining family was in prison or disowned, right? So someone was asurely aready Lord Black.

**** The thing I see often is he isn't disowned just blasted off the tapestry, which isn't the same thing. The lord thing is often shown as being older then the modern wizarding law so even if they charged him with a crime(which they never did) it wouldn't matter because something along the lines of "how dare these newfangled jumped up petty bureaucrats think that they can tell MY family who is and isn't the Lord". Sirius was also never actually charged on anything so the lordship would automatically go to him as the oldest most direct heir.

** Fanon may say that, but I've always found it stupid. Everyone is related to everyone in magical Britain, because the magical population is too small. If just having a relative of a line is enough to make a claim, then Bill and Charlie could sue Lucius Malfoy for child support as distant and neglected nephews.

I'm pretty sure Harry becomes Lord Black because he:

A.) Has some Black blood in him.

B.) The previous Lord Black says he's the next one.

That seems to be the most common feature of the "Harry becomes Lord Black" subgenre. Sirius wills it to him. Sometimes Draco attempts to sue and claim otherwise, by saying he's a closer relation. But I don't think I've ever seen a single fic where that ever works. Harry always wins in the end.

So it's not so much closeness to the line as it is because Sirius Black said so. This is literally always the reason I've seen. I think there's only maybe two fics where it goes to Harry because he's supposedly "more related." In the vast majority of them, it goes to him because Sirius made Harry his godson and named Harry his heir.

Now, hear me out.

What if Sirius decided to prank Ron by willing him the Lord Black title, because Ron's jealousy of his godson is pissing him off, and he decides to be the mischievous genie and give the person wishing for something exactly what they're asking for?

** Is this because of Black's family tree in which Dorea Black marries Charlus Potter? In that case, James' parents were Fleamont and Euphemia, and his family must not be the only Potters out there. Even if they are related, this doesn't mean that Harry's direct ancestors are connected to Dorea Black, making him a Black by default. Charlus could very well be Fleamont's brother or cousin, for example.

Speaking of Black's family tree, has JK ever commented on Walburga's and the Black sisters' birth dates? Their fathers were 13 at their birth. Considering Sirius' birth year (1959), Walburga's could've been a mistake. If she were born in 1935, her father would've been 23 and she would've been 24 when her first son was born. Since Cygnus (her brother) was born in 1938, it would make sense. However, his birth year also means he was 13 when Bellatrix was born and, since Walburga was born in 1925, maybe his birth year was a mistake and it should've been 1928, making him 23 instead. It looks like one of those was intentional and the other was wrong.

I'd guess it's partly because it's easier for witches/wizards to track down the Weasleys, who are more well known and have more people knowing where they live, than a pair of muggles. It's also questionable whether Hermione's parents would be willing to leave their home and their work to hide in London in a magical house for who knows how long.

But regardless, if Sirius really was concerned about people keeping safe because he was related to them, then he would be bringing in people like Andromeda - who's far closer in relation to him than the Weasleys.
