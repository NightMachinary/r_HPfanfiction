linkffn(Percy Take the Wheel by Kitty Smith) linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw)


** For some reason I feel uniquely qualified to answer half of this question.

I was inspired by linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff), linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) when it comes to the zany antics. For perhaps my favorite portrayal of Lockhart ever I recommend first linkffn(When In Doubt Obliviate) and then linkffn(Oh God Not Again). I also wrote linkffn(Revan's Rotten Holiday) but it's not finished and is a KoToR story.

If you are willing to venture outside of fanfiction, Hank the Cowdog is one of my all time favorite humor series. Especially the audio books read by the author. Ciaphas Cain HERO OF THE IMPERIUM was my guideline for how I believe Lockhart should have been really portrayed and my Lockhart is channeling everyones favorite Imperial Commissar really hard. Except instead of being a dirty coward, he's a flamboyant fop who happens to be really good at his job.

The greatest movie of all time is of course, Princess Bride, from which I have cribbed a lot of material. What About Bob is another fantastic comedy movie I watch frequently to get in the humor writing zone.

For feel good family stuff, it's hard to beat linkffn(Something That Will Last by Popehippo) which is a Mass Effect fic but one of my all time favorites. For Harry Potter I recommend linkffn(Harry's First Detention).

For melt your mind awesomeness, just watch Tegan Toppen Gurren Lagan. or, read linkffn(Shinji and Warhammer 40k) which is beyond amazing and finally updating again. Or if you want something not fanfiction, anything by Brandon Sanderson tends to have super amazing fights and powers. Steelheart is a good place to start for that.

**** I LOVE Percy Take the Wheel and Percy in general. Check out linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter) - it has a really great Percy with character development (seriously he gets awesome) and the other characters and story arcs are all great as well. The story is mostly lighthearted but it's on a cliff hanger right now. Updates infrequently. Still worth it!

****** That story has been on my reading list for ages! I haven't gotten to it yet because the premise seems similar to linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky) which I love, and for some reason I've always been weary of reading fics that have similar premises to ones I really like.
