** Well, I don't know if this would classify, because she isn't the mother, but grandmother. and she isn't OC, but she's really uncomon as a pairing, imo. linkffn(What we Lost)

There's also another fic, which I don't remember the name, but will check my files for it, and let you know when I do find it, that's about Harry getting a muggle girl pregnant during his teens, and only finding out when he's an Auror.

EDIT: Found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9721378]]

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

**** Yeah, but when its hard to find something, sometimes, speaking from personal experience, I'd settle for less but with similar idea. It's a suggestion eitherway, so he can read or not, I'm not bossing him around. And if you've noticed, I did suggest another with an OC. There's no need to be pedantic for no reason.

***** Yeah I suppose, like when I'm so desperate for a crossover with something that I'll read it even if it's 60k and incomplete.

** IIRC, that's a sideplot along those lines in linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle), which is really good in general.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
