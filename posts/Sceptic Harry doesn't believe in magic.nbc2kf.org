Problem is he just defeated voldemort and destroyed the horcux in his seventh year he just still believes it just fancy science and mind tricks and illusions


** From a certain point of view, sure. Sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, and the other way round. But if he denies that if waving his wand a certain way while saying "wingardium leviosa" the right way will make an object levitate, he isn't a skeptic, he's an idiot.

** As we know, "A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic". Harry's denial of magic is so illogical it makes him one of the greatest wizards ever.

Compare with Voldemort's best bit of antilogic, pushing for pureblood supremacy while a halfblood. Or with Dumbledore's... everything.

** So Harry has a philosophy that explains all evidence of magic as something else, no doubt an extremely robust one since it has served him well through multiple years of schooling. I can certainly think of a few philosophical arguments one could make to explain such a dichotomy.

Or maybe he has no knowledge of critical thinking and his philosophy is either the result of a logical fallacy or simply not grounded in reason. Either way, nothing unusual there, World views without a basis in reality remain more popular than the alternative here in the real world.

In any case, I'm with you so far, my question is what is your story actually about? Where is the conflict?
