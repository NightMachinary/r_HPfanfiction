I don't mean like what they'd smell but what would they smell like to a person that likes them. I'm having trouble deciding.

  “And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione enthusiastically, “and it's supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and ---”

  But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.

That may seem stupid, but I think they just smell like themselves? Not a fragrance linked to the person they liked, but the fragrance of that person.

If we take the example of Harry (the same than Canon who is in love with Ginny). When being in front of a Amortentia, he would probably smell Broom Polish, not because Ginny like broom and may use it, but because /he/ loves flying. But he would also smell another odour, one that is Ginny, maybe it could be the smell of the shampoo she uses, or maybe it's her "natural fragrance", like after a Quidditch training, but in any case it would be "Ginny's smell".

​

Because of that, I would not look too far into "what does this character smell" when using Armortentia. I would just use one of the 2 following scenarios, depending of whenever the person smelling the potion is conscious of their feeling or not:

- If the person knows she is attracted (like Hermione in HBP) : it would just be "/It smells like X (Ron in this case)/", without really bothering justifying it.
- If the person isn't you conscious of their feeling, or is denying them, I would use the fragrance of an item used by the person their like. So there could be a "revelation moment" later, something like :\\
  "/Armortention has a touch of strawberry for Harry even though he doesn't like them that much. Later he understand that it's the same smell that Ginny shampoo and is forced to admit he likes her/".\\
  And even in this case, I wouldn't really bother justifying the smell, Strawberry, Vanilla, Lavender, it doesn't matter in the end as long as it's linked to the girl. I would just try to make it a bit "realist" (I once made the mistake to buy a shower gel that smelled like Taurine, I don't think it was the kind of thing you could buy in the mid nineties).
