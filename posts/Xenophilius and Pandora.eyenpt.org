Are there any stories about Xeno and Pandora when both are alive? Particularly if their dynamic mimics that of Odd and Stormy in Odd Thomas (Dean Koontz novel series, and also a moderately good/meh movie with Anton Yelchin). A fortune-teller machine told them they'd be together forever and the both of them believe it fanatically. He sees dead people and demons and she's very supportive and sensible and bohemian about the whole experience. They're exactly as cute together as you might expect.

I'll also accept other stories where they play a strong supporting role. Generally anything more than 'I saw Xeno and Pandora at the train station twice a year' is good. As always, no other filters, any pairing, het or slash or femslash, weird shit accepted, cliches and tropes as you please.


** 1. Lovegoods family are one of very few nice things about the beginning of linkffn(13170637). And I don't mean that further down the line whole story is better, just contrary, later there isn't even nice story like the saving of Pandora Lovegood.

2. No Pandora Lovegood, but I really liked Xenophilius Lovegood in linkffn(11858501) as a lawyer saving the main heroine.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.

** I don't think many people here have read Odd Thomas. Most of us are more into fantasy than horror-suspense.

*** True. Though I myself have only read the first one. Mentioning the novels was just for reference, so anyone reading would have a better idea of what I was talking about.
