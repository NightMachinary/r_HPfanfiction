** HP and the Temporal Beacon features /extensive/ time travel, albeit through a means other than a time turner.

I don't remember which collection it was in, but I remember a one shot in which Harry was a metamorph like Tonks, had some gender identity issues, and wound up coopting Hermione's time turner to allow the assumption of many different personas (both male and female).

** Have you tried painless_j's thematic list on time travel? It's a fairly extensive list of older time travel fic of all lengths, genres and pairings. Her website has been down since August, but a mirror can still be found [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326030804/http://painless-j.net/blog/2007/10/17/themed-list-time-travel/][here]] or [[https://archive.fo/P1yjw][here]].

The list hasn't been updated since 2007, so a lot of the links have probably stopped working by now, but there's a lot of good stuff there that you probably wouldn't find otherwise.

** linkffn(Time on my Side by Mark Geoffrey Norrish) is a short fic where the time-turner adventure at the end of PoA gets complicated.

In linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House by Belial666) and sequel, the protagonist (an (even more) ruthless replacement of Hermione) does interesting things with a time-turner.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(Hermione's Plan by chemprof)

Harry/Hermione use a time-turner in the summer post 6th year to train for the war (they use it several times a day, every day, for most of the summer)

linkffn(I miss you by chemprof) Hermione's parents removed her from Hogwarts after her petrification in second year. Harry got her time-turner instead, and used it a bunch of times until he defeated Voldemort.

Other Peggy Sue fics:

Unfinished, but fun, is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), which is unfinished.

And of course, the most famous (but now a bit dated, and unfinished) is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan).

** I've got a couple for you: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2114097/1/]]) has a Harry who has control over time, I don't however remember to what extent he used it as it has been a long time since I read it.

HP and the Descent into Darkness linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Descent_into_Darkness]]) and it's sequel has a Harry who makes extensive use of a timeturner. Ath(e)y is a writer of excellent dark Harry fics, though she rarely finishes one.

There are several fics where Hermione makes much more extensive use of her time turner than canon implies whether in third year or somehow keeping/regaining it later. Can't remember any specific fics off hand) and some where she uses other forms of time manipulation. Slexenskee's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10942056/1/crawlersout]]) is a good example

Finally there are many fics where Harry, with or without others, uses various means of time manipulation to have more time to prepare. If you're interested in those I'd need to spend some time figuring out what to recommend.
