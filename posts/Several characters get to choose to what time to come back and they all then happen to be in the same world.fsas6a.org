Influenced by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5409165/1/It-s-For-a-Good-Cause-I-Swear][this naruto fic]].

For example, Harry goes back to when Tom Riddle is just an infant and raises him to be a good man.

Severus wakes up before his 11th birthday to find that he lives only with his mother, they are still friends with Lily but they go to the magical primary school. The Minister for Magic is Tom Riddle. When they go to Hogwarts, the relationships between Houses are much better and the DADA professor looks like Harry Potter.

Hermione and Ron wake up to a different world.


** This is a pretty cool prompt! I'll raise you one more:

I read a time travel fic about Ron, where he got sent back 100 years and was found by.... Aberforth Dumbledore. He ended up becoming Albus, just as a way to find his place. There was no Albus in the original timeline, it was always Ron.

**** Sorry, I can't find the exact one. I know it was on fanfiction.net and it was incomplete.

A quick Google search shows there's actually a bunch with that theme though!

Sounds a bit like the fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot][Reboot]]. It's a modified reptilla28 challenge. Snape goes back further, and when Harry/Hermione wake up (at the same time), it's the same thing. But they all know they were timetraveling to the same place, just not the times.

Edit: Part of the "Holy shit" was them going to sleep with Snape as grudging accomplices, and waking up with him as a favorite Uncle.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** I have read a "Harry raises Tom Riddle" fanfic.

Harry travels through time and saves Merope's life, he marries her and becomes Tom's stepdad. But in this one Tom still kills Myrtle and Harry is faced with a dilemma, bc he swore to kill Tom if this happened. But how can you hurt the child you raised and learned to love?
