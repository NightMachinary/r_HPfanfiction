Abandoned before things get real, but what is written is pretty much what you asked for.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

** I wouldn't call it "fanon". We know very little about Occlumency training, and even less about the mechanics of successful Occlumency, so everyone's got a plausible, canon-consistent headcanon.

Mine is that Occlumency does, in fact, involve a form of dissociation; and advanced Occlumency does involve learning to construct and project whatever personality one wants the Legilimens to see. That's something that certainly can go wrong and blow up into a full-on dissociative identity disorder.

linkffn(Note to Self by jacobk) explores just how far Lockhart would have to go to fool Dumbledore.

  Gilderoy Lockhart was a successful con man, but that's all he was. So how did he talk Dumbledore into hiring him? And why was he such a failure as a teacher that a bunch of twelve year olds could see through him? One shot.
