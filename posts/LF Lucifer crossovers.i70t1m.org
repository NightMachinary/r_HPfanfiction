** I've thought of this one before, especially after that episode where SPOILER Alert - the mom reads all the lawyer books in like a day or 3 and says it's all so easy. I imagine Harry or someone reading every single book in hogwarts and diagon alley in like a week or 2.

  Maze knew there was something different about the bone-thin child in rags she'd seen rummaging through a trash can for food. She was going to find him and figure this out. He shouldn't be any harder to track down than a rogue demon after all, his appearance was quite distinctive. Scruffy black hair, round glasses, and a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Rescue!fic, complete.

** Unfortunately in short supply, beyond city of angels (already linked by someone else) the only half-way decent I can remember was a one-shot in which Heaven makes it so Lucifer has a son (Harry) which would somehow bring the end of the world as a way of compensating for him ditching Hell (starts on season 1 and don't consider anything from beyond it, so it ignores most of the lore of the show

I still have to find a good one with the Lucifer from the comics.
