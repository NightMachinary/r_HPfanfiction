Synopsis: Harry Potter triumphed over the final battle against Lord Voldemort, but just as everything appears peaceful, he soon realized that it isn't over as it seemed. Something deep inside him feels wounded and is drastically withering away---a sign that his life is in grave danger. The truth of being a Horcrux will set off a chain of events that'll test his strength and will to survive. But the question is, how far will Harry have to go before he accepts his grim fate?
