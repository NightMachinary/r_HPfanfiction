**** It's actually fairly active, but it's relatively small so its the same 5-10 people posting, including myself.

But even though it's small, we all have a fairly comprehensive knowledge of H/G fanfiction so we'd be just as likely to know the fic you're talking about. Plus we'd be more likely to actually see your post.

I'll see what I can find. The whole "Harry leaves England" plot is fairly common so the story doesn't immediately jump out at me.
