:END:
I'm honestly at a loss and have searched everywhere. Does anyone know the name of a Harry Potter/lotr crossover where they summon the fellowship to Harry's world to help with the war. Most of what I remember is that lotr weapons can block spells and I think Legolas jumps in front of an AK meant for Harry. Any help would be appreciated.
