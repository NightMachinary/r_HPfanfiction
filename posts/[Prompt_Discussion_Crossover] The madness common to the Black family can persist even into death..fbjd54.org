One member of the family was odd even by Black standards, enjoying Muggle culture and insisting on wearing outrageous striped Muggle suits. After being poisoned by one of his more aggressively anti-Muggle relatives and persisting as a ghost, he took being posthumously cast out of the family in stride: No longer able to call himself a Black, he went solely by his first name, one completely in line with the family's preference for astronomical names.

As his mother would often shout after his latest bout of antics: Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!


** OMFG!!

That's... that's just so in line.... yes! I can see that.
