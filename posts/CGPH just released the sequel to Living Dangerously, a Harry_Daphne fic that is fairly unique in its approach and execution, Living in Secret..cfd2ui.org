*** A few things, and another couple major things that would be a massive spoiler if I were to say. Mostly is because of the fact that in most fics with Harry/Daphne, either Harry is "independent, badass, Dumbles, bashing, Lord, suave" or Daphne is secretly a muggle-lover that is repressed in Slytherin because of the DE juniors. And in LD, this isn't the case. She's a pureblood and was raised as such, she's not exactly one of the best persons in the world, where rainbows flow out of ass when she farts. She's flawed, and so is Harry. They're both egotistical with their relationship (which begins as a secret, because of reasons), and Harry even does some stupid shit because of Ginny (in here, they started dating in year 5 and not 6).

There's a couple more things, but as I said, it would be major spoilers.

**** Yea, what you described is pretty much what I was told when someone recced it to me. While it is all true, I could not get into it, like at all. It feels like in their quest to make the characters realistic and avoid clich√©s, the author skipped over any desire to make the relationship even remotely realistic. Noone would behave like they do, except low-functioning sociopaths of course. Maybe that was actually the goal of the author, in which case, kudos! Because both Harry and Daphne are absolutely horrible people in this. And after reading the summary of the sequel, and then going to read the last chapter of LD, I feel myself strongly proven correct. Well, half way anyway, because Harry does not feature a lot. But at least Daphne staying the horrible person I read about in the first 20 chapters and not having changed at all has been confirmed.

Based on only reading like 60% of the story before I could not take anymore, I would not reccomend it to anybody looking for a romance fic. If you are looking for angst, more angst and then some angst on top, give it a try. But be prepared that the author has the characters stop acting mature for their age and relapse into behaving like actual children whenever they want to generate more angst.
