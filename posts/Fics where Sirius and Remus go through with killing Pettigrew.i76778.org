Can be Harry doesn't stop them, Harry isn't there, anything. I've seen a few fics that try to make Harry darker but as soon as he tries agree with Remus/Sirius on the whole murder his parents' betrayer thing, they decide that a bit too dark for Harry and go along with canon sparing. Which, considering how bloodthirsty they were getting for a hot minute, I think it's a bit out of character. Anyway, looking for fics with Wormtail getting murdered by Sirius and/or Remus.


** These would be a great read.
