In my story I try to remove all the cliches I do not like except Potters bashing:-

- Dumbledore is not bashed.
- Potters are not abusive, just neglectful.(There is a difference)
- Harry's brother Daniel is not bashed.
- No Lordships or secured Wizenagamot seats.
- There will be a part with blood adoption. Blood adoption will not change how the person would look. Well, the Wizarding World is blood based like in Gringotts a blood test would reveal ancestry, likewise when someone is blood adopted the results in their blood ancestry test would change.\\

Summary: Harry Potter was born in 1977.Daniel Potter, his younger brother born in 1980 is declared the Boy Who Lived after a bout of accidental magic, Harry finds himself in America with an old couple, the the age of 11,he goes to Ilvermorny and studies peacefully till his last year until his name comes out of the GOF and he has to face the demons of his past. WBWL.
