I mean i see so many fics with Hufflepuffs being shown as either wimps or not being brave, Gryffindor and Slytherin constantly shit on Hufflepuff while Ravenclaw are shown to be these geniuses. I mean Hufflepuff had such amazing wizards look at Newt and Madam Bones or Cedric ( who was the freakin Hogwarts champ). Also badgers are like super brave and tough... and i just saw a video of a Honey Badger being badass and fight six lions and another video of a honey badger who is an escape artist and so damn smart (search ‚ÄúStoffel the honey badger‚Äù on youtube you wont be disappointed). I just hope to see a fic where Hufflepuff are shown in all their badass glory.


** There's definitely at least one sorting song where Hufflepuff (the person) says she'll "take the rest" after Gryffindor/Ravenclaw/Slytherin have picked out their favorites, which implies it's basically the leftovers instead of people with their own merits. It's not hard to see how this can lead to a middling reputation, both in and out of universe.

** It's the old 'nice guys finish last' trope. Everyone bets on and pays attention to the hare, but never the tortoise, basically. And all the other Houses are more dynamic and 'doing stuff' groups, more like the hare than the tortoise.

Slytherin are cunning and ruthless and ambitious and manipulate situations and are interesting because of that.

Gryffindor are reckless cannon-fodder hotheads who run into danger and are interesting because of that.

Ravenclaws know a lot of stuff and are interesting because of that.

Hufflepuffs are hard-working and loyal and slow and steady tortoise types and that's not as interesting when you're trying to write big, heroic stuff (which this fandom seems to often favour). The most you can get is a 'look to the East, it's the rohirrim!' thing and that's just not really something you can make a long story out of. Can't really montage Hufflepuffs working hard in a written fic, and loyalty only really makes for inspiring "We stand with you!" moments and tragic-inspiring "He turns up waiting for the master that'll never come!" long-term stories.

And I've never seen a Hodor/Gray Friar's Bobby/Hachiko type fic made that really plays on that sense of loyalty.

Plus, that kind of weird discrimination is kind of a British meme. Ask a British Secondary School student what they think about Gingers and you'll get a similarly illogical discrimination as 'Hufflepuffs are duffers'.

If you take the house traits prima facie, then the brave go to Gryffindor and those with a love of knowledge to Ravenclaw. So in that sense, a student in Hufflepuff whose definitive trait is "bravery" is just not a Hufflepuff: He'd be a Gryffindor. And similar for primarily academically inclined ones. I agree that Hufflepuffs have their own qualities (a work ethic and an innate sense of community or fairness will get you places, surely), but whenever I see people argue "X House can be Y Trait, too" I think they're missing the point.

The worst instance of that was the utterly unironical assertion in one story of "not all Slytherins are bad, some are brave and noble" or some such, where the author remained completely unaware he had just declared that "not all Slytherins are bad, some are Gryffindors".

The point of the house system, the way I see it, is to display *different ideals of what is good and right*: And therefore measuring one house by the standards of another (e.g., Hufflepuff by how brave -- or not -- they are) does both a disservice (and also creates a worse story due to its limited perspective).

The bottomline here is this: No, Hufflepuffs aren't as "brave" as Gryffindors. /And that's okay./

this can kinda be applied to canon, because that's how I read JKR having Dumbledore say "Sometimes I think we sort too soon," about Snape.

**** True, and she also said in a comment Pettigrew should have been a Slytherin.

I try to ignore Rowling's House of Evil; -- as you say, it's the same kind of reasoning as my quote.

But I do think it's funny that her setup is better than her own judgemental perspective on it. An ideal based around ambition, self-preservation and selfishness is, if nothing else, /interesting/. Too bad it's strictly placed in a context of absolute values that coincidentally are Gryffindor's.

** Do you want the Watsonian explanation or the Doylish one?

*Watsonian*: Hufflepuff generally has the reputation to be the House of the less talented witches and wizards. It is mainly due to the fact that Hufflepuff herself had the policy to accept any student, and not just the one she liked, making her House the one for "the rest".\\
Contrary to the other Houses, Hufflepuffs also rarely boast about themselves (it's not "in their nature"), which often makes the house fade into the crowd, especially when compared to drama Queens like Gryffindor and Slytherin (one of the reason why the Hufflepuffs went so hard on Harry in GoF is because he stole the attention they finally got after so long).

*Doylish*: For most authors, Hufflepuff (and the qualities it represents) are just less interesting than the other Houses. Diligence and Loyalty sure sound nice, but that's quality you see more often on a supporting cast than on a protagonist (especially in a fandom likeHP, full of "power trip" stories). People prefer to have their MC "Brave" , "Cunning or "Wise".\\
In Canon, Hufflepuff is also not paint in a very good light. We first hear about the House when Draco says that he'd rather go back home rather than staying there, and they don't really have any good moment in the series (they are afraid of Harry in CoS, angry at him in GoF, and rather dull the rest of the time).\\
The House also lack a strong character to represent it. Madame Bones is barely a character in canon, Nest is from Fantastic Beast which is often ignored, and Cedric is a special case since he is "the martyr" that had to be perfect no matter where he was from. There isn't any Hufflepuff that stays close to Harry during the series, either as an allie or enemy, while even Ravenclaw has at least Luna.

Also, while the Honey Badgers are really cool, Hufflepuff is represented by its cousin, the "European Badger", which is kinda "Meh" when compared to the other symbols.

** Because Tonks being in the Order is the only time we see a Hufflepuff do something truly good. They were massive dicks about Cedric and the Chamber of Secrets and even the Hufflepuff poster boy, Cedric, was kinda a dick since Harry outright told him about the dragons and in return Cedric didn't even say what Harry had to do with the egg, nevermind just telling him the riddle.

** In fanon or in canon?- in canon IDK why but someone (I think Ron or hagrid) explicitly says that everyone thinks hufflepuffs are a bunch of duffers (actually using the word "duffers")

In fanon, because it is canon- if you want to see a hilariously refreshing, super cracky break from this depiction I highly recommend linkffn(the worst muggles imaginable)

** Well, Hufflepuff's traits are sort of leaning towards being the 'leftover' house. Everyone who'll ever amount to anything is hard working, but to get to Hufflepuff, you have to not be brave, nor cunning/ambitious, nor exceedingly smart.

Also, pretty much every single Hufflepuff we've seen besides Tonks was an asshole, Cedric included.

** The HPMOR universe gives big props to Hufflepuff. Here is the Sorting Hat trying to sell Hufflepuff to Harry (who insists on Ravenclaw):

#+begin_quote
  "Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are well aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not frightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems may take decades to solve -"

  I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms! Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!

  "And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a camaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you could rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that is broken."
#+end_quote

Here's Harry declining a points bonus from McGonagall for reporting a nasty secret he discovered:

#+begin_quote
  Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of and they can't. How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for reporting a whisper he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be fair at all."

  "I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff," said Professor McGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange respect.

  That made Harry choke up a bit. He'd honestly thought he wasn't worthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to shove him anywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he didn't have...
#+end_quote

And this is from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14984261/chapters/34726769][Secret of the Patronus]] (a parallel fic in HPMOR AU). Harry and Neville have been drinking:

#+begin_quote
  Neville sighed, staring into his blue martini, thinking of Luna's blue eyes. "I'm so pathetic."

  "You're not," said Harry, who'd given up on sitting upright. "You're great. I'm the one who sucks at being a human. Neville, did you know...the Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff?"

  Neville raised his eyebrows. "It did?"

  "Yes. And I rejected it. I said, 'Hufflepuff has nothing to offer me.' But you know what? That was a tremendous mistake, the first in a long litany of errors that I've committed, and continue to commit." His eyes were red, as he sniffled. "Hufflepuff is the best house. It's full of hardworking, intelligent people who actually care about humanity, and don't just say they care. They would have noticed I was antisocial and tried to befriend me, showed me how to be warm instead of cold. I could have reached my true potential as a scientist, and achieved everything I ever wanted there, because they helped me, not in spite of it."

  Neville was tearing up. "Hufflepuffs might not be the smartest or the bravest, but we do have some pretty amazing people. Oh, and also the best snacks. Like Christmas time sugar cookies a la mode, and tea time biscuits and buttered crumpets, and fresh baked muffins every Tuesday morning."

  "You get muffins?" asked Harry.

  Neville nodded. "And double chocolate fudge on Wednesday game nights, milk shakes for Saturday musical theater night, and made to order crepes every Sunday-"

  "Holy Asimov!" Harry gaped. "What kind of scam is this? The House Elves don't even make me toast when I ask for it."

  Neville shrugged. "Dunno. Maybe you could try saying please?"
