Nor is it funny that it's similar in America. Certainly not 50 times a fic.

It genuinely took me >5 years of fanfiction and this subreddit to find out that it's supposed to sound similar in America.

"Hi i'm Harry and before you ask, i'm not"

You have no idea how many times I read something like that and thought I was missing something...not what? Not what Harry? Not fucking what? Not Harry?


** I get that its not funny but how tf do brits pronounce hairy

*** Hah-ree/Ha-ree for Harry, Hairy rhymes with Vary (Hair like there, ry like ree). Dumbledore is a pretty good demonstration of it, in the movies.

***** The British pronunciation of the 'a' has no trace of an 'e' sound.

*** It is set in England and many fan fictions are set here, so it wouldn't make sense for it to be treated like America. If the fanfiction says it's set in America and that they have accents it would make more sense but there still would be a large amount of people that wouldn't understand the joke or anything related to “hairy potter”
