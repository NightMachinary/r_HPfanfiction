Harry travels through cities with various supplies. All Weasleys are dead but Arthur Weasley, Ginny, Bill and Fleur. Arthur wants Harry to get Ginny out of the city and to Shell cottage. Cedric helps them escape and dies in the process. Either Fleur or Bill is killed when they get to Shell Cottage. Looters and raiders are an issue and danger.
