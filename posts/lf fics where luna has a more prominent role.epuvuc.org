i really like luna in this where she simply views the world differently rather than be a seer or something

are there more fics like this? or just more fics in the same style as this author? because i really like how harry is portrayed in all of their fics


** I offer my own sample for consideration, Retroactive.

** There are plenty of Hunna stories, and there she has from definition more active role. I actually like linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) (has been the bot fixed?) and its sequels, and of course classics in this trope is linkffn(7352166;7725072), and although she is a seer, she is much more than just that in linkffn(7548963).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]] maybe? It's not yet finished, but Luna's maybe the third/fourth character (Ron and Hermione as leads, Harry a decreasingly important entity). Currently unifinished but it seems to be updated regularly.
