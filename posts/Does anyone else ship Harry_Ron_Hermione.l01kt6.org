Like, I dunno if it's just me, but I sometimes feel like Harry/Ron/Hermione is one of the best, but moset underrated ships out there. I mean, the top two ships regarding the golden trio are Romione and Harmony, both of which have fans constantly arguing about their ships.

I personally support Romione, though I understand where Harmony is coming from, and don't really have any 'hate' for it.

The only problem is the Ron bashing, something which I absolutely loathe, because I am a Ron fan as well. IMHO, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are the Soul, Mind, and Heart of the entire series, so I always avoid fics where any of them are bashed, no matter who.

So, I believe that Harry/Ron/Hermione should get a lot more love, especially because it doesn't bash any of the golden trio. I just wanted to know if there are others who ship this, and if yes, could I get some good fic recs fir this?

(I am also a lover of angst, happy ending or not. Guess I'm just a person who loves making themselves cry)


** I don't actively ship the trio, but one of my favourite ever fics is a trio ship! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]] linkao3(16957743) - big angst, even bigger twist

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

The Trio getting together makes the greatest sense. It's a pity JKR didn't dare to go unconventional.

** Where I live, there's specifically a saying along the lines of "if you can go through a disastrous camping trip and still be on good terms, your relationship will outlast anything else".

The Trio did all that, plus more. It's one of the few realistic poly-ships in the fandom, for that reason alone.

  "Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

This can be read as Harry/Hermione/Ron (as it was written) or as a platonic trio friendship fic.

  Lavender keeps asking nosy questions and rumors have reached Harry's ears.

  "Don't you ever want to make other friends? Don't you ever get tired of them?"

  In a conversation with Dumbledore's portrait after the battle at Hogwarts, Harry finds out that he is and always has been a homunculus---a substitute body made to carry the Horcrux so that little Harry Potter, who lies asleep as a baby under powerful charms, wouldn't have to. Harry struggles to process the news, the fallout, and the discovery that he might disintegrate at any moment.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

** No, for two reasons. I can't see Ron and Hermione lasting for more than a weekend. Other than Harry and fighting Death Eaters, they have nothing in common, no shared interests and are pretty opposite of each other personality wise. Opposites attract, hence the weekend I give them, but you need more common ground to build a relationship on. And their previous interactions (especially books 3,4 and 6) would not help with making them a couple.

Secondly, I don't see Ron settling down for a relationship after the war. He now is a war hero, famous in his own regard. He achieved something his brothers did not. And since he made it, he reached his dream, he will live it. VIP invitations, picking up a different fan girl each weekend, big parties, a Quidditch career based on his fame. And not only does the whole sleeping around thing prevent a serious relationship, I also see him as the only trio member who embraces that fame. Hermione might use it occasionally for the sake of reform, but Ron will live that life, and I don't blame him for it the slightest.
