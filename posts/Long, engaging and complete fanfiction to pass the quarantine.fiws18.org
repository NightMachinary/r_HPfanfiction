  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Here are some of my favorites-

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1]] It's not completed and is still ongoing. First few chapters started of like those cringy WBWL fics but got really good. Probably the best fanfic I have read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1]] This one is completed. You may not like the first chapter and the entire story has a lot of grammatical mistakes but it's definitely worth it. Has great world building just like the first one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1]] I haven't finished this one and I am currently reading chapter 38. Really great if you like time travel stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2008185/1]] It's the first book of a series and I have really enjoyed it. Pretty sure that the entire series is finished.

**** Huh? Prince of Slytherin is sitting at 940,000 words right now. What is your criteria for a long fic?

Edit: The entire canon series was just a bit over a million words, which means PoS is approaching its length. Mind-boggling, considering that it's in its third year.

***** At least 1.5 million or more, Fat by TheTrueSpartan has achieved more than PoS in a little bit over a year.

2.2 million words in just over a fucking year!

Now, Fates quality in the beginning isnt as good as PoS which has remained same quality throughout, but still currently Fate is my go to story.

And PoS is long beciase of the set up, TSM is trying to get a payoff at the end of the fic.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** A very good fic about the time of the Horcux hunting but from Bill, Fleur and Percy's pov Linkffn(The Order of Mercy)

This fic has no ship. A fun Hobbit crossover in which Harry is a Dragon (Animagus but not quite)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2761430]])

All other fics I have are slash but all of them are good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

All of these below are Novel length fics with either Draco or Snape as a Mc/focus point (I recently got a bit into Snarry which kunda suprised me because it was never really my ship)

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

A Draco/Charlie Weasley fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1907331]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

20 K fic but pretty funny. Oliver Wood centric linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14291154]])

Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint fic. It focuses quite a lot on professional Quidditch post-Hogwarts. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20568335]])

This one is a brilliant fic. Voldemort pov. it really explores how Tom Riddle became Voldemort. (Flight) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

Linkao3(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil)

Great Wolfstar series. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045]])

About 200k so I thought I'd link it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/433140]])

Very good fic.(In somno veritas) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

Very interesting character study. Voldemort and Harry Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15562401]])

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
