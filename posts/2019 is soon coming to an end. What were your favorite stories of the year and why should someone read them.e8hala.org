Mine goes to "The Archeologist" by Racke linkffn(13318951)

Harry wakes up one day in an alternate reality in his female counterparts body.

Good writing, "original" premise (mild crossover with Bloodborne) and a total joy to read for me.


** A quick review for /The Archeologist/, after quickly binge-reading it:

It was a decent story. Neat premise, neat execution, and compete, which is very nice.

However, the author doesn't really like dialogue, apparently, as they state in an author's note. So the story ends up feeling a lot more of a summary of what's happening, rather actual descriptions of what's happening, a lot of the time.

In addition, the author exposits Harry's backstory, /a lot/. One third to a half of the fic is probably just exposition on the backstory. It's a good backstory, mind you, but it's a bit annoying to read a several paragraph tangent before getting back to the real story for a few paragraphs. Before going on a backstory tangent, /again/.

Should you read it? Maybe. The mild Bloodborne cross is tastefully done (really so that the the author didn't have to invent someone for Harry to go from scratch), and Harry's OP without it actually ruining the story. Getting power balance right is very difficult, so it was nice seeing the author pull that off.

I would try a chapter or two, to see if it's for you. But if you get excessively annoyed by the exposition, you might end up not liking it. I get really annoyed about this, so the only reason I finished the story was because of how short it is.

*** It's very interesting for me to see the backlash about exposition. I've started to develop a pet peeve over dialogue that doesn't ever DO anything, and this is so far the opposite direction. I don't mind the writing style at all, and it opens my eyes to see others disliking it.

**** I know what you mean about dialogue. God knows I've read too many stories that consisted of too much dialogue.

The reality is that you need a balance. People talk in real life, all the damn time. So you need dialogue. People notice their environments, and perform actions all the time. So you need description of the active moment. Yet, you can't show every single active moment. Sometimes, you just need to skip some of these moments, and get to your story. So you need exposition.

Thus, balance. If the entire story's exposition, then what's the point of writing? You may as well just publish an outline. If the entire story's dialogue, then nothing happens, and all people do is chat, so what's the point? If the entire story's active actions and description of the moment, you're never going to finish your story, and it's going to be fucking boring and never get to the action.

I was just calling out the imbalance where I saw one, same as you, and same as the author, even if the imbalance is in different directions. Part of the problem, I think, that I could tell from the author's notes, is that the author hated dialogue too much. They just developed an aversion to it, from reading prior imbalances, I think, which has overly affected the story.

Which sucks. Some solid revision could make it far more of the enjoyable. The plot and what not was super solid. It's just the actual writing itself really needs an editor.

There was a reason I was able to get through it. I just wanted to warn some people that they might get bored, really fast, if they were particularly adverse to that type of writing.

** Man 2019 has been a long year, and I have seen some really good Harry Potter stories being written this year. One story that came out this year was linkffn(13133746), Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent, it was a very good story that explored spell creation and relationships. It offered a lot of depth to Lily and Jame's sacrifice that I can appreciate.

Go to the story URL. I picked up some random one from this thread.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407891/1/]]
#+end_quote

You can ignore this entire part:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/]]
#+end_quote

Up to /s/. That leaves

#+begin_quote
  13407891/1/
#+end_quote

Then you can ignore the part at the end, /1/, as it's the chapter number. If you change it to 2 and hit enter, you go to the second chapter. This might be missing in oneshots, that doesn't matter.

So what you're left with is

If you search for the fic on google (or use a hyperlink on any other browser page) hold your finger on the link until a box pops up giving you the option to copy it. You can then paste the full URL into your comment and reduce it down to just the fic id#, or with the full URL you can just save some time by calling the bot with ffnbot!directlinks.

Not sure about the app, sorry - I don't use it. But as for it defaulting to the app instead of the browser, I assume that's because you clicked the equivalent of an option like 'always open fanfiction.net pages in the app,' which should be editable from some settings menu if you want to avoid that.

***** You know, I dunno why but I just never saw this comment when it came across but I always love recommending things when I can...

So my top 5 WIPs right now...

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff...

Alexandra Quick series, I actually did a total re-read of the entire series and have almost caught up to the progress of the 5th book, but it's been really good so far, much better than the 3rd and 4th books: linkffn(13353323)

Intensity, which is the 5th book of a series by MarauderLover7: linkffn(12899733)

The Granger Principle by Starfox, a unique story that has its faults with the relationships its struggled to build, but a good story premise: linkffn(13312738)

The Paths We Tread, a very raw and rough series but has had some good characters, especially Bill and Arthur: linkffn(12177988)

I will say there are a few others I'd recommend and would bump a few of the above out of my top 5 but they don't get updated frequently enough:

the always amazing Grow Young with Me by Taliesin9: linkffn(11111990)

A Mother's Love by 24 Love Geek: linkffn(9641978)

Part 3 of the Child of Hogwarts Series by AimeretVivre: linkffn(12462574)

There are a lot where simply the act of destroying the diary in Book 2 brings a huge chunk of Tom's soul and sanity back (the trope often goes hand in hand with the one where each Horcrux carries half of Tom's current soul, meaning just after the diary he gest back 50%).

It's been ages since I read those stories, so I can't really recommend anything, much less assure quality, but you should be able to find quite a bit if you look for it.

**** Partial Review of Crushing News: I really really wanted to like this because I have been looking for a good old best friendship turns into more story. (I love that tension!). But I couldn't make it through. The characters were too OOC - or maybe better stated as OOTS (which I'm hoping could mean Out Of Time Setting). Can't imagine canon-compliant HP ever calling himself a "flagrant recidivist" or reacting in "hot-faced abashment". (And yeah I had to look up the word recidivist). I decided to pretend that they were characters in Pride and Prejudice Era Hogwarts, or maybe they were both raised in Downtown Abby, and that helped--for a little while at least.

I gave up when I read this line though: "Don't be silly. Of course I will talk to you," she warbled innocuously enough, hugging her books still more closely to her chest. "What's up?"

I think it was the warbling that did me in.

** Linkffn(Archmage of Arda) is my favorite fic of the year, if not one of my favorites of all time.

It's a crossover with LOTR. Besides the Shadow of Angmar, it's the best lotr crossover I've read. Harry ends up in Middle-earth after second year, is very powerful, does a bunch of cool shit. My favorite part is where he breeds magical animals, and also creates a sort of pilgrimage-holy-site-thing out of his grief so that people can find forgiveness for their sins. It's Harry/Arwen.

And best of all, it's FINISHED. Or at least part 1 is. There's supposed to be a sequel. But it works as a standalone fic. I hate reading incomplete fics and it satisfied me enough.

I'm also gonna mention linkffn(Tales of Three) since it has some of the best writing I've seen in fanfiction. Features a great femharry. But it's short, slow updating, and hasn't gotten to the meat of the story, so it's more a fic I wish there was more than a favorite finished fic.

  A fire burns deep within Iris Potter, and such things must be tempered --- even if it's with Albus Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. After a disastrous end to a school year, the two find themselves tangling with old enemies, eldritch magic, time travel, and that which should have perhaps been left well alone.

** Unfogging the Future is the best Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle fic I've read. (Also the worst.) It has a great original plot, a murder mystery with lots of clues, so it's worth reading twice to catch the clues you missed the first time.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]])

And Styx is wonderfully creepy and poignant. Walburga and Orion really didn't do a good job of childproofing their house when they had kids.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes.

** Linkffn(13326497)

Because it is one of the rare crossovers with amazing writing. Crossovers have a reputation of being bad, which mostly stems from the fact that often they are just born out of an idea like "hey, I bet putting Harry into the whatever universe would be fun" by random, not very talented people who then just start writing. Nothing wrong with that, being creative is for everyone and should always be encouraged. Everybody starts somewhere.

So anyways, because of that I did not have a lot of hope seeing this fic being the first and only story by the author. But they went on to prove me wrong. Great writing, interesting plot and good pacing. And it is very different to most other HP/MCU crossovers. The author has written 417k words in just over 5 months, and updates every few days.

EDIT: Archmage of Arda, already suggested by another comment, is definitely seconded by me.

*** I disagree with this recommendation - the writing is quite stilted and awkward, but the biggest thing is way too much telling instead of showing. I basically stopped reading after I saw

- "Harry then proceeded to make small talk with the two men, like he was simply catching up with some old buddies. "

Like, why not just include the dialogue? There's only one reason I can think of, and it's that they can't write it, and that's not promising for the rest of the story.

Also there's this incredible line that had me dying -

- "And that's when the food arrived. Harry started working on the serious business of mastication (chewing)."

Edit: unrelated to this is that I hate any interpretations of prophecy as binding and immutable, it's without question my least favorite fanon invention.

And if you stop reading everything that has something like what you describe, you won't read any book till its finished. I mean, first example that comes to mind, you would have stopped reading the LOTR trilogy before they arrived in Bree, because the dialogue during their meal was shortened to just a description of topics instead of writing the actual dialogue.

***** Unfortunately I have to second what he said. I'm only at chapter 7 and this is far from the worst I have ever read. Also, seeing that this is apparently the author's first work and the have stuck through it for 400k words makes me hopeful.

But there are quite a few issues with the writing, like how Harry emoted in a way that carried forward the plot or gave out a lot of information to characters or the reader, but that felt more often than not totally unbelievable. Big parts of his talk with the ancient one were between cringy and eyer-rolling.

That's not to say that I don't see where the author was going with it and there is potential in it, as the plot itself (or the little that I have seen from it) doesn't look bad. But he does quite a few missteps along the way and some of them can take you out of the story.

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

*** Mhh, would have put this one more in the "disappointment of the year" category. So much promise, a creative take on the "back in time to fix things" trope with it being Ron and him not knowing everything that will happen. And then the author goes for one illogical thing after the other after he arrives at Hogwarts... This comment chain has a good explanation why me, and tons of others dropped the fic:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dztikv/what_is_something_that_really_killed_a_fic_you/f8a97kl/]]

**** Yeah, definitely depends on what people find most important in fics: personally good writing and consistancy in logic and characterization makes the fic really appealing to me, alongside how well the author develops multiple plots, but I guess having a major change from canon is enough for a lot of people to stop reading. Oh well.

***** Yea no, a major change from canon is a huge plus, major AU has been a fovorite of mine for 19 years of reading HP fanfiction. But only if its logical. Absolutely nothing that happens after Ron arrives at Hogwarts is logical in this fic. He goes from being well written and in character to to total, 180 degree opposite, without any explanation or reason. And thats just a sign of bad writing. I thought the comment chain i linked explained all that pretty well, but guess not.

****** It was logical, actually. Ron's character did a 180 when he was first struck by his visions, and his main focus then was to save Fred, and everyone else. He was so focused on that, he became a worse swot than Hermione. While that is understandable to me, you can't argue that's not in character with canon Ron. As that person said, Ron clawed his fingernails out to save Pandora....but that wasn't bravery, that was doing what needed to be done. The Hat sat on his head and had this discussion with Ron where he told him he needed Slytherin to help him succeed.

So Ron taking that to heart and trying to fit in with Slytherin isn't out of character. It's Ron doing what needed to be done.

And in the comment chain you linked, someone explained (spoilers) That he isn't a seer, he's someone who is stuck in a time loop with a demon/mad god in his head put there by the personification of Fate, in an effort to destroy Voldemort in order to save the entire universe being wiped out by the personification of Death because of Voldemort's attempt at immortality has pissed him off. Fate can't interfere directly, I think, the most she can do is bind the Entity and put it in Ron's head, with the stipulation/condition it becomes free once Voldemort is dead. Every time Ron fails/dies, the Entity has the power to "reset", and it feeds Ron the visions in order to influence him as it's actual power is initially limited. Ron ends up with significant brain damage, and a chronic stress disorder, as well as significant scarring because of it, which is mostly why he turns into such a cunt.

It's certainly not without issues, but I disagree the sorting is actually badly written.

****** Spoilers for the fic, which I also saw in your mentioned comment chain, later on, it's explained that Ron has been looping his lives for more than 400 times, being manipulated by an outside force until he manages to kill Voldemort, and being a Slytherin had gotten him closer than any other house, so he was manipulated into being one.

There are a few parts that happen later that I might agree might not make the most sense, but getting sorted into Slytherin? That's where the story starts getting interesting though!!

I'll understand if that seems to have gotten too out there for a lot of people. The reason I've been recommending it quite a bit around the sub is that I genuinely think it may be one of the better works in the fandom, most strongly on the merits of its pacing and writing, which, again, is probably a matter of what you prefer.

** Bloodborne you say? Well I have a new story to read. (Bloodborne is my favourite game of all time, I even got to new game + 9 I was so into it.)

Anyway, for me it would be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132670/1/][The Stag and The Flower by ReluctantSidekick]] a post war Harry/Fleur romance fic (still in progress). It technically started in 2018, but it was at the end of November and majority of the story was written this year. It has a few story elements that bring the concept of Character bashing to mind in reference to Bill and Ginny, but it does so in as unobtrusive a way as possible, and manages to have it not seem to extreme by having appear in the story very infrequently. The characters are well written, the relationship is believable (always crucial in romance) and the plot is thought out and well paced. It has elements of the more tropey wish fulfillment fics as a part of it, but manages to avoid being cringe-worthy by not taking itself super seriously. The fate of the world doesnt rest on Harry and Fleur picking the right Bouquet, and as such it preserves the suspension of disbelief through the more unlikely sections and maintains immersion.

On the whole, Id say the story is a 9.5/10, and I 100% recommend it.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]]) is really good. It's a WIP, but currently there are updates guaranteed from a week to three weeks. I've been following this story since the summer and everything about it is amazing. I love the characterization, how the author writes, pretty much everything that happened in this fic. It's a Harry/Draco slowburn, and the drarry hasn't started yet, but the lead up to it is great, and you can see the formation of a strong friendship from early chapters. The story has Dark!Harry, but focuses on the differences between dark and evil, how being a Slytherin doesn't make you evil, how changes can be good sometimes, and so many more things. Harry is resorted in his early fifth year in a genius incorporation of canon and comes to term with his new placement in Slytherin. I won't tell you much about what happens after that, but it's really great and I've been loving it since the first chapter. I will tell you, however, that there are so many plot twists that you'll never get bored. Happy early new year!

** Technically linkao3(A Game of Chess by Kirinin) started last year, but almost all of it was released in this year. It's a pretty rare read: a Peggy Sue with Ron as the sole protagonist. It does an impressive job of dissecting some of the most common tropes in the fandom while still being well-written and has a unique but satisfying ending. It was a total dark horse in my opinion and deserves more attention.
