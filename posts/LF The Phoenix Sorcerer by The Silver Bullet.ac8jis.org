I just saw that the author completely deleted it because of toxic reviews and pms, which is honestly disappointing, but understandable that sometimes such behavior drains ones desire to write. That said, does anyone know where I can find a copy of the story, I never got to read the most recent updates.

Edit: thanks everyone, it appears that the author decided to put it back up, which I am immensely grateful for.


** Not going to link it directly because the author deleted it, but many things, including fanfiction.net links, are archived on [[https://archive.org/web/][The Wayback Machine]].

** What was so polemical about it? If the mpreg stories don't get lambasted, then what could this poor person possibly have done?

*** Apparently people got pissed that the main couple broke up as a part of the plot and then didn't immediately get brought back together with absolutely no problems whatsoever.

Edit: it was like Sueric and the Kikyo/Inuyasha shippers all over again. All it needed was someone hunting down the author and attacking them to satisfy crazy shippers bingo.
