I find that in any canon rehash or AU story I come across, Neville isn't anything at all like he is in Canon. Neville is a prodigy in Herbology. He becomes a Herbology professor. He marries luna. His life turns out very nicely.

But when Authors get there hands on him they turn him into Harry's slightly less cool clone. Neville NEVER showed any sort of hint that he had hidden power. He barely showed any accidental magic as a child. By the time fifth year rolled around he could barely perform the disarming charm, and had to attend multiple lessons from harry to get it right ONCE.

The one thing I will say in neville's favour that authors do get right is his outstanding moral fiber. He has always stood up to and for his friends. He just isnt magically powerful. And that's not a bad thing. Harry is a DADA prodigy, buddy has always been amazing at it. I don't understand why they insist on changing neville to harry's equal. I don't want two harry's, I want diverse characters not the same guy with 'sandy blonde' hair.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk

******* It's something random people like to say about Rowling's comments. She actually only made a few "weird" comments:

- wizards shit wherever before toilets existed (the weirdest one, also maybe her attempt at meming?)

- Dumbledore is gay (which is hinted at in the books)

- You can imagine Hermione however you want (this one made the righties really, really angry)

Like, I'm all for clowning JKR based on her transphobia, but people need to stop making up random shit like "she's making all the characters gae!"

Really, she should have just come out when the whole questioning of her wokeness started and said "I wrote the books in the 90's while I was penniless. No publisher would have accepted a book with openly gay or lesbian characters in it. Feel free to headcanon the characters in whatever way you want, most of them were written ambiguous for a reason" and it would have been fine.

** Sorry, that's just not accurate - Neville didn‘t seem like a ”good wizard” because for the first 5 years of his school career he was using a wand that *did not pick him* not only that but he spent his childhood with relatives trying to “scare” the magic out of him - that would make anyone a little nervous - not the least a boy who has been lead to believe he will never be as good of a wizard as his father - honestly he had an abusive childhood and Uncle Algie is lucky he's a kind soul.

​

And not remarkable?

First year he stood up to the trip at the end of the book because he *knew* they were going to get in trouble if they went out that night (he was right!)

Fifth year he believed in Harry enough to go with the group to the Department of Mysteries where he did pretty damn well considering he was 15 and using a ”bad” wand. Seventh year while Harry and Hermione were starving in a tent this is the boy who spearheaded the Hogwarts resistance and figured out the best ways to use the RoR to protect his fellow students - not to mention *HE* is the one who spoke up against Voldemort when everyone thought that Harry was dead AND he was the one who killed Nagini.

Oh, and he married Hannah Abbot not Luna.

*** Why does everyone assume that using his father's wand crippled his magic? It is implied that none of the Weasleys had their own wands when they started Hogwarts and Ron's was literally broken for the entire of second year and still did fine in classes.

I feel a far bigger factor would have been one of his teachers systematically bullying him to the point that Snape was his boggart in book 3. Add in that the rest of his yearmates at best ignored him and at worst actively picked on him. I think at one point in book 1 he is stuck outside the common room after the Fat lady left for the night because Malfoy had hexed him so he had to go to the hospital wing. Also apparently in book 3 Neville had been locked out of the common room on multiple occasions and had to spend the night on the stone floor and nobody, not even his roommates had noticed. It is amazing he didn't drop out.

**** Actually in book 3 McGonagall locked him out of the common room as punishment for losing the list of passwords, after Sirius broke into the Gryffindor tower and slashed Ron's bed up with a knife. They were actually stolen off his bedstand by Crookshanks, he didn't even lose them.

Somehow McGonagall thought it was appropriate to force a child to wait alone in an unsecured hallway that a knife wielding mass murderer had already broken into twice and sliced things up in (first time was the Fat Lady's portrait). He could have easily been murdered or kidnapped and held hostage if Sirius was actually a former death eater trying to kill Harry.

Regarding the Snape boggart, I think Neville's deepest fear was of not being good enough for his family, to live up to his parents' memory, of not fitting in with his community, of not being a real wizard. His family basically showed him through actions that they would rather have a dead child than a non-magical child. That's fucked up. When Lupin told him to imagine his grandmother's clothes, Neville expressed fear the boggart would turn into her instead. Just. . . yikes. Snape's bullying was just a reminder of everything his family had done and said to him about his worth.

*** I agree so much on that when it comes to Neville. His biggest problem with magic was his low confidence and self esteem which were caused by his upbringing. The main reason that he started to get "better" is because of how he was srarting to get more confident and not because he got a new wand.

Most fics don't patiently waddle through 4 years of disarming and tickling jinxes, and it's pretty easy to get Neville there by pretending he is being held back by lack of self esteem and a bad wand (which he was in a way in canon too).

It's the same reason why Harry is always "powerful" or ridiculously good at DADA theory, when in reality he just has a cool head under pressure.

I agree that it'd be nice to find a different way to power him up, just kinda hard to come up with a new one when he's kinda the only character in canon who does the "training montage" trope to become much much better.

** Neville uses a wand not attuned to him, in a world where the very first thing we learn about wands is that "the wand chooses the wizard" meaning Neville is being handicapped the whole time he's at Hogwarts using his father's wand, and he STILL manages, barely, but still, most fanfics gives him a attuned wand, which would by logic help him quite a bit, but true thats quite possibly fanon.

Neville shows quite a bit of a hidden power, like being able to lead a semi-resistance against the Carrows and other aid he gives over the books, he also manages, like most of the DA, a Corporeal Patronus, this with said handicap of using his father's wand, not a wand chosen for him, by him, whatever

You are right in that fan authors often uplift Neville, but quite honestly, in any fanfic where Ron's a spy for the death eaters or Hermione would sell Harry out for a book, the author's are messing around with the characters. the Canon rehashes are literally "what if things were better" and we know Neville isn't living up to his full potentional with bad self-confidence (which hurts his skills, like it does people in real life) a missadjusted wand (like a righty using tools for lefthanded, but worse) and more

And he STILL manages in canon to be a great guy with great moral fiber and the courage to stand up against Voldemort and tell him "So what if our saviour is dead, we'll still fight" he has the HEART of a hero, all the fanfic writers do is give him the tools to be one

****** Hello again - I've found it.

It's a Nemesis13 special, which, personally, I think is fine.

However, it's also a 2015-era, so it's also kinda dark.

It's also unfinished, and will likely remain that way - it's a Nemesis13 special, after all.

  Why are no authors satisfied with letting Neville BE Neville?
#+end_quote

Because the actor was good looking.

Both Draco and Snape are treated far better in fanon than they deserve. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants]["Draco in Leather Pants"]] is a well-known trope. Warning: You'll be sucked into a vortex of lost time.

** Because it's the author's story and it's how they like it. Creative freedom is theirs. The question I have is why are so many people in this fandom so butthurt over characters being ooc in fics? It's fanfiction, not a replica of the books.

** I'm working on my own fanfic, where Neville is thought to be The Boy Who Lived, and I'm trying my best to avoid that tendency. His dynamic growth as a character is what makes him amazing. It's what makes him Neville, not Harry with a different face.

** I try to avoid any tagged Neville fics because of this reason, so annoying. The worst is when Harry starts bringing him out for exercises....

Just keep him as the half hearted background character he is. Soooooo many fics just bring him into Harry's core friend group for fanfics sake.
