It doesn't seem like this subreddit is very active at the moment, but I'll give it a shot.

There used to be this fic on checkmated called '12 Fail Safe Ways'. I think it was by Michellypie but I'm not certain. It was woven through Deathly Hallows from the point of view of Ron and Hermione (alternating each chapter) through the lens of the 12 Fail Safe Ways book.

The story starts with Ron stealing a kiss from a sleeping Hermione and being caught by Fred and George. They then give him their 12 Fail Safe Ways book. Each chapter begins with a excerpt from the book itself (and the rules aren't listed in order, which I thought was cool), and then a situation that involves that rule.

The fic ends with a very cute proposal where he lists 12 things Ron loves about Hermione.

Anyway, if anyone knows where to find this fic since Checkmated is dead, I'd love to reread it sometime. Thanks!


** I've managed to get the first 12 chapters using the waybackmachine internet archive, but can't get the last chapter. Did you want what I've managed to get?

*** i couldn't get on it. some people say they can get on and read thngs, just can't submit, but i couldn't access it.

well there is one way to access it that kind of worked for me. you use [[http://archive.org/web/web.php]] and then put in checkmated.com and you can look at the site in an archived version. only problem is not every chapter of every fic is saved.

i was able to get all 13 chapters of 12 fail safe ways from this thread though, so i can send it to you if you'd like. or if you have a particular fic you remember, you can describe it here and maybe you'll get lucky as well :)
