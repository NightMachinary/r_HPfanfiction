It must be absolutely mind-boggling (and somewhat terrifying) to see someone do things that are supposed to be impossible. A person who can change the Wizarding World, like no-one has ever done before. This must be particularly "disorienting" in Peggy Sue fics, where a teenager revolutionises societies and laughs in the face of unimaginable powers. Are there any fics that explore the concept of seeing these types of fic through the eyes of the supporting characters (or simply not through the POV of the main character)?


** This sounds like Lex Luthor's opinion of Superman, heheh.

** Honestly, in a super Harry story, it would make sense that Dumbledore would be frightened of his power and want to reign him in and control him. You have someone who seems ready to abuse their power even more than Voldemort, and Dumbledore has now seen two young men with great power grow up and plunge Europe into war and chaos. How could he NOT try and prevent another disaster like this?

A story like this told from Dumbledore's perspective, where he is a tragic hero figure, would be excellent. You could go one of two ways: where Dumbledore succeeds but is villainized by everyone but Harry, who allows Dumbledore to be villainized as ultimately what Dumbledore wanted was for Harry to be on the straight and narrow, and if that takes him being remembered poorly, he would accept it. Dumbledore died knowing he succeeded, and views his life as well spent.

The other is that Dumbledore fails, and Harry ends up as the Dark Lord's successor. Dumbledore is remembered well and used as a rallying cry against the new Dark Lord, but had to die knowing that he allowed three Dark Lords to rise in his day and that ultimately his life was a failure.

*** Third way. In the end, we find that dumbledore never died, that he was partial successful, that he curbed the war, but it was still successful. Instead of a dark lord, we have a gray lord. Instead of a dictatorship we have paradise. And have the story end with dumbledore writing "all it cost was my relationship with one of the greatest men i had ever known. " then have dumbledore put the quill down, stand up and be directed out of the room as if he was a prisoner.

**** That would be an excellent ending as well, the perfect mix of failure and tragedy mixed with hope and success.

** The fic that sprang to mind when I saw the thread was linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by leadvone). Dumbledore is concerned about young Harry's skills and attempts to frame him so he can be sent to Azkaban.

It's a bit of a divisive fic, but I like it well enough for you what it is.

** I know right. Imagine being student of Jogwarts abd hearing about HP killing a professor, saving some, killing big ass snake and protecting school, driving dementirs away, winning a deadly tournament against 3 year older kids, leading a revolutionary army so much so that whole ministry targets you, and killing the darkest lord with du disarm spell!

Unbelievable!

Of Its not than why does Haryy sometime using at an incompetent adult surprise you? After all in canon Harry had to do all these things only because adults were incompetent.

Is it really this hard to believe that a kid who can drive 100 dementoos away could be taken seriously?
