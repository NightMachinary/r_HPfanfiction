** A fremione AU filled with angst and fluffy and quite a but of smut to but... eh, were human.

But don't trust me. Check the comments. :)

Including:

"fuck that hurt"

"This was so sad and so beautiful and so percet and I can't even find the words to explain how desolate and hopeful it made me feel all at once"

"You absolute monster who reveled in ripping tears from our eyes and feelings from our mushy centers. This was stupid beautiful"

  DH spoilers. Hermione's wandering train of thought as she washes the dishes. 'Ron will kill me if he sees me cleaning without a wand. You're a witch, act like it! he'd say. He doesn't understand that I need the distraction...' HHr.

  Fred has died - but this Hermione decides that the world cannot go on without the Weasley twins together - that it needs the both of them to heal itself after the war - and makes a trade: her life for his. When Fred returns to his family, he lives for her.

Complete. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Trio-centric.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Draco shifts his head as he turns to look at Scorpius, his cheek touching the pillow. "Did you know that..." He pauses, his throat convulsing, and it sounds audible in the silence, besides Michael's steady, even breathing from the other bedroom.Scorpius is staring back at him, in wait of something new to learn, a beautiful and intelligent child. He has Draco's mind. He has Draco's eyes and nose and mouth and hair. He is his. All his. All he has of Michael are his wild curls and the green of his eyes, and sometimes he looks into them and imagines that they aren't Michael's, but someone else's.Draco leans his head closer, biting the quiver out of his lips before he breathes a laden and shuddering exhale, and he whispers, "You are my star in a big black sky."
