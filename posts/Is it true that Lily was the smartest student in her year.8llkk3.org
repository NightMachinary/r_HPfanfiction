I often read in fanfiction that she was described as such and people claim it is Canon. Is it fanon or Canon though? She's always smarter than Snape and the Marauders in fanfiction but was it ever stated in the books that she was? I'm using it for a fanfiction and would like to stay true to the books because I have always viewed them as smarter than her by a huge margin but I need the evidence that she was so I can follow Canon and reading all that fanfiction has confused me

Thanks for your help =)


** It was said in Prisoner of Azkaban that James and Sirius were very smart. It was only due to their brilliance that they were able to become animagi at such a young age. They helped Pettigrew become one. In Order of the Phoenix, Sirius says he doesn't need to study for the next exam as he knows it. Slughorn just says that Lily was brilliant at potions. But, it is difficult to compare say who was the smartest among them all. We can say that they were smart in some subject but it cannot be stated as a general statement.

*** Thank you

However, as a general viewing of the who do you think was smarter: Sirius and James or Lily?

**** On Lily's side, we have Slughorn claiming that she was a prodigy in potions, but it's not like he doesn't potentially have other benefits to ingratiating himself with Harry.

On the other hand, we know that Sirius, James, Remus, and Peter we're all capable of the animagus transformation by the end of their fifth year, and Remus is also capable of casting the patronus. Canon makes a much stronger case towards Sirius and James I'd think.

***** There's nothing to suggest Slughorn ever overhyped anyone (other than himself). His statements regarding people like, say, Snape at Potions were spot on, so his statements about Lily can't really be doubted.

**** Canonically, James and Sirius were both deemed the best students in their year. Lupin called them the best in their year; McGonagall thought highly of them too, and the group dynamic of the Marauders always seemed like James and Sirius were the ringleaders of it.

So based on stated canon and stuff that can be interpreted from the books, I assumed the order of intelligence was along the lines of: James=Sirius>Snape>Lily=>Lupin>Peter. So James and Sirius both being above Snape, with Snape being above Lily, then Lily being at bare minimum equal to Lupin (if not a bit smarter than him), with Lupin being significantly more talented than Wormtail.

I think most of the exaggeration regarding Lily's intelligence is this misconception that the head boy and head girl must have good grades to get the position. While Lily's grades were likely much, much better than Harry and Ron's grades, I don't think she was made prefect and head girl due to her academic performance or magical skill. Same with James as head boy. I think she and James became head girl and head boy due how much Dumbledore trusted them, coupled with their social popularity, and they would be role models to younger students.

I never understood why people thought Lily was just as smart as James and Sirius. Not only does canon state that James and Sirius were the best students in their year, but HBP arguably implies that some of Lily's Potions talent was attributed to her initial friendship with Snape. However, that is subjective since it depends on your interpretation of the text.

Throughout HBP, Harry uses the Advanced Potion Making textbook like a crutch in Slughorn's class and Slughorn attributes Harry's "skill" to Lily. But since we later learned that Snape was the Half-Blood Prince, and Slughorn attributed Harry's Potions skill to Lily, the parallels between both these things almost suggests that Lily (at least prior to their sixth year) relied on Snape to help her in Potions similarly to how Harry relied on the Half-Blood Prince throughout HBP.

*I know that Lupin's "brightest witch of your age" comment to Hermione gets blown out of proportion by some people, but I don't think its much of a stretch to argue that maybe third-year Hermione was actually smarter than third-year Lily when it came to basic intelligence (i.e. not magical talent or dueling ability).* Then again, just because Hermione is smarter than Lily wouldn't make her more talented. Based on DH and stuff that can be interpreted from the books, Lily could probably replicate Bellatrix's feat of dueling Hermione, Luna, and Ginny by virtue of being much more talented with magic than Hermione (but a bit less intelligent).

*TL;DR: James and Sirius are significantly smarter than Lily. Snape is also much smarter than Lily, and James and Sirius each significantly outclass Snape. At best, Lily would be equal or better than Lupin. Even if Hermione is massively inferior to Lily when it comes to magical talent, I'd argue Hermione might have equal or greater intelligence.*

***** Hmmm, since we see Lupin casting wandless magic the first scene we meet him and we see him duel and is generally there being magically active I am more inclined to place him ahead of Lily. Although I am curious of why you chose to put her ahead of him?

***** What makes ou think Lupin and Pettigrew were less talented than Snape? It never felt that way. Nor that Pettigrew was less talented than Lupin for that matter; he was just more cowardly, but in terms of magical ability he was actually quite competent.

** There is never a straight up ranking presented in canon, but it's safe to say that Lily had certain smarts/talents/abilities that she truly excelled at. It's hard to say what makes one person smarter than another, but here are some thoughts from me on the subject.

○In his pensieve memories Snape witnesses Lily as a very young, muggle-born child demonstrating a high level of control of her magic abilities, even before she's told that she is a witch. We only really have Harry and Tom Riddle's experiences to compare this to, which is complicated by Harry's abusive childhood and Riddle's general psychopathic tendencies. Harry seems unable to control/actively channel his magic before Hogwarts. Riddle (objectively a talented/smart person) has a lot of control over his magic.

●Lily was chosen head girl. While not every brilliant student can be head boy/head girl, it rests in part on academic achievements. This is a wash, however, as Lily and James were both Heads. We don't know if Lily was a prefect (we know Remus was, but iirc he doesn't say who the female prefect in their year was).

○Lily excelled in Potions, and probably Charms based on her wand and Ollivander's comments about it in Philosopher's Stone. Meanwhile James and Sirius (at least) excelled in Transfiguration (animagus), and possibly Charms (seriously, how did they make the Marauder's map?). We do not know anything else about their academic achievement, though Slughorn spoke of Lily's academic/magical prowess in the general, not just Potions specifically, and Hagrid did the same when consoling Hermione in CoS.

●Lily seems to have more emotional maturity than James, both based on memories from the pensieve and the fact that James and Sirius were bullies (not just to Snape). Lily managed for some time to navigate a friendship with Snape (in spite of being in very adversarial houses), but also knew to end this friendship when it became unhealthy. She stood up to immature bullies on her first train ride to Hogwarts, without stooping to their level. This exhibits social intelligence, and in my opinion it signifies a smart character.

○Remus says that James and Sirius was smartest in their year, but remember to consider the source (their best friend, who admits to hero-worshipping them/not standing up to them enough).

In this Tumblr-post "everything" about Lily and James from the books is documented: [[http://fleamontpotter.tumblr.com/post/56108763672/quotes-from-all-the-books-about-james-and-lily-i]] When reviewing this, thinking of the context (who said it, to whom, to what end, etc.) can help you better interpret the characters. I never give much thought to who's smarter/better, as it's usually not something clear-cut and definable (unless you're in the same class as Hermione...). Hope this is somewhat helpful, in any case.

*** Is it ever actually stated that if a wand is good for a certain area of magic that means that the owner must be excelling at the subject? I also always thought that Lily was Head Girl and just so memorable and lovable not because of her intelligence or power or skill, but rather because she is just so uncommonly kind and a great person that she was placed there, which puzzled most of the girls ahead of her because 'she was nothing special'. That's what makes Lily distinguished to me, although that's just my headcanon.

**** I just assumed that the wand choosing the wizard rests on a skill-compatibility. Especially since James' wand was "excellent for transfiguration". According to the wikia (so not completely reliable) academic achievment plays part in the head boy/head girl decision. It's obviously not like it is in public school where the student body elects them, or if it is then we never hear of it. This being said, I find Lily being head girl way more believable than James being head boy, seeing as James was in constant trouble for shit.

***** Hmm, we never actually hear much about Lily's personality and she seemed pretty much like a mashup between Ginny and Tonks from the memories, at least to me, but we might never know aside from the memories and the people talking about her so I guess the rest is up to interpretation.

My headcanon for the wand being good at certain magic types is that it chooses someone who is weak at that subject therefore elevating their abilities there. For example, someone who is bad at potions will be chosen by a wand that is good for potions, which helps with the bonding and strengthens the connection between them. But that's just how I interpret it.

****** I don't see how Lily was like Ginny or Tonks at all. There's literally no similarities. Ginny wasn't explored much. She was, er, sporty, could be bad tempered, brave? Not really resembling Lily. Tonks even less so, she apparently got into too much trouble which is why she never made Prefect or Head Girl, unlike Lily. Kinda clumsy, but good natured.

Lily, really, is supposed to be a well-adjusted Harry. As a few characters noted, despite being a dead ringer for James in terms of looks, in personality Harry was far more like Lily.

******* I think you're being a bit unfair towards Ginny. While I agree we didn't get much we also did get enough for parallels. For example, Ginny was witty and very cheeky and Slughorn also said the same of Lily. Lily was described as vivacious and she was good-natured, which is Tonks. From the memories she seemed like a bit judgemental which could also be said about Ginny. Lily was also very brave as we're constantly told, which Ginny and Tonks were.

I don't personally think Ginny is funny but I do think Tonks has a nice sense of humor and Lily was also described as funny. Of course there are different types of humor but I always viewed hers as goofy.

Who's to say that Lily never got in trouble? Maybe she did, who knows, but was secretive about it and was good at not being caught because from the flashbacks of her as a child she seemed pretty mischievous and had a sense of adventure - something Gryffindors have and so do all the ones we know, including Ginny.

Besides, who's to say Lily wasn't sporty? She didn't play Quidditch but is that literally the only sport there is? Maybe she enjoyed karate or was an excellent gymnast. It isn't about Quidditch only.

She also seemed very extroverted and outgoing. She strikes me as someone who would much rather chat with others or party than isolate herself and read a book.

But we're never told much about her so it's yo for interpretation. I'm not saying she was exactly like them but the closest thing I cab describe her as is a mix between them

No I wasn't. I didn't criticize her, I just pointed out the fact that she wasn't like Lily. When was Lily ever described as cheeky? Never. She wasn't shown to be judgemental in Snape's memory, she rightly chastised Snape and James for being incredibly mean and arrogant (respectively). I don't even think Ginny was shown to be judgemental. The rest of it is you making up possibilities that we have no reason to accept.

********* Slughorn described Lily as cheeky. He said that when he told her she should have been in Slytherin, he used to get cheeky answers in return. He described her as bright and very funny and vivacious. And Lily was not a rule-abiding wet blanket, you seem to be ignoring or are just rather oblivious to Rowling having said she uses underage magic and used to get back Ministry letters because of it. That's not Percy Weasley or rather some strict student who only knows how to follow the rules.

She was right in cutting off Snape and scolding James, wym? Actually, Lily was pretty unjudgmental, you do have a point. Once I get back home I'll look this one up in the books and supply you with the quotes.

Lily is honestly almost a name instead of a person, so any interpretation of her personality counts. However, I am curious as how you view her other than a well-rounded version of her son =)

So she could've broke rules but was secretive about it and that could be an aspect she shared with Tonks.
