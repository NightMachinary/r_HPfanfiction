I don't know if there are any fics with this premise, but would appreciate recs if they exist.

So if Sirius had been made the secret keeper, the Potters would have been safe. However Pettigrew would still have been passing information, Voldemort still would have been at the height of his power, and James/Lily/Harry would have been holed up in their house.

from canon we get the impression that Harry was the first stumbling block for sometime. If Harry hadn't incapacitated Voldemort in 1981, would he simply have continued to rise?

It's not like Voldemort's going to forget or give up, so they've basically got to cross their fingers that the war will end. But since Harry is the key, there's a good chance that it won't. It's possible that Dumbledore would be able to figure out the horcruxes, get rid of them, and vanquish Voldemort, but in canon he doesn't really have Voldemort to distract him from doing research about Voldemort. if he's trying to prevent people from dying "left right and center," he won't have as much time to work things out and may or may not succeed before Harry turns 11.

And then what happens? Would Harry be sent merrily on his way to Hogwarts, despite a full-fledged war all around him? It seems like it would be easy to target him.

Would he be trained?

Obviously James/Lily didn't do anything in canon to prep Harry, but at some point you start realizing that this kid would benefit by being taught some self-defense skills.


** A long series staring with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]] is one that answers several of your questions.

Summary: Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** Maybe I'm just a drama llama but I think that since Peter had no problem betraying Lily and Jame, he'd have no problem telling Voldemort who the SK is. I also don't think that Sirius could survive 10 years without being found and captured, expecially since he would tell Peter where he could be found in case of an emergency. So Voldemort would probably capture him and torture the secret out of him and it would all be business as usual with the rest of canon. Well except for the part where Sirius would be dead or insane.

*** Eh, canon Sirius was the loosest of canons, but you can't deny that he was equal parts loyal and resilient. I can see him slipping up and getting captured, but I can't see him spilling the location, regardless of how many times Voldemort says crucio.

**** The hard thing about torturing someone for information is actually not the getting them to speak part but the filtering out the truth part. While under intense and prolonged pain people will say anything and everything they think their torturers want to hear, no matter the consequenzes. Nothing against Sirius but I don't think he could withstand that. He might bite through his tounge before saying anything but then he'd be dead and I don't remember if a Fidelius holds if the secret keeper is dead.

***** When a secret keeper dies, each person they told the secret to becomes a secret keeper. Dumbledore explains this to Harry in HBP- when Sirius died, all the members of the Order became secret keepers for grimmauld place.

*** Scenario; Sirius is the secret keeper for James, James is secret keeper for Sirius. Remus and Peter keyed in, but Peter wouldn't be able to spill anything to Voldie. If Sirius didn't leave and do 'stupid stuff', like in OoTP, this solution would essentially be flawless.

Seriously, I see no holes in it. How isn't the Fidelius considered overpowered as all hell?

**** It is overpowered as hell. Just like so many other things in Harry Potter. There are Timeturners and the Luck potions and invisibility cloaks and Moody's eye which, btw can look through the cloak of death if you remember 4th year... The HP universe is broken

*** That's why you should read Promises (as mentioned and linked above). Sirius is secret keeper but has been missing for years. Captured by Voldemort, thought dead by all his friends for most of the first book. Great trilogy.
