During the last few weeks I have had the urge to read fics where Harry has long hair however I have not had any luck finding any so now I'm asking here. :D

​

I am looking for all fics you can think of where Harry's hair reaches at the very least to below his shoulders. Other than that I don't care what you find me.


** Linkffn(Taking Control) it's supposed to be a ‘sign of maturity.'

Linkffn(Hail Odysseus) most of the authors fics depict long-haired Harry at some point

Also, have you considered fem!Harry stories?
