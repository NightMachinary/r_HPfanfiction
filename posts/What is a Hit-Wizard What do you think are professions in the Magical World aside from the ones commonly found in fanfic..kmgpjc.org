So nearly every fic I've come across, they mention a Hit-Wizard. I really don't understand what that means. In some Fics, they are hit-men, other Fics they are bounty hunters, and in some they are a different group within magical law enforcement. What do you think hit wizards are?

Also name a few professions that you think would be existent in the magical world? Aside from canon and the generic ones like - auror, potions master, curse breaker, dragon keeper, bar tender, shopkeeper, teacher, Quidditch player, business person, entrepreneur, stock market prodigy, real estate mogul. Preferably non-government jobs. ( Researching for a fic and I want to keep the jobs diverse as I look to do world building )

Thanks in advance!

*** It wouldn't surprise me if the change was because 'Hit Wizard' sounds too much like 'Hitman', and Rowling wanted to avoid all the potential associations with professional assassins that could be made.

** As far as I understand it, where Aurors are an amalgamation, so to speak, of Special Branch, MI5 and Investigative Branch; Involved in Personal Protection (Bodyguard), Counter-Terrorism/Surveillance/Intelligence, and Detective work, hunting Dark Wizards. Highly Trained and efficient specialists, and MLEP (Magical Law Enforcement Patrol) are uniformed Constables. Hit Wizards are the sort of bridging point between the two, responsible for Armed response, Hostage Negotiation, Crowd and Riot Control. Equivalent to Firearms Officers, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the like.

The Nature of the Economy in the Wizarding World, strikes me as something where 'shopkeeper' is a bit derivative, that is, there a lots of craftspeople and tradespeople. Wizarding Smiths, Carpenters and yes, Potters, though in my mind, The Potter Family and the Occupational surname have different Etymologies, just like the real world.

Other Occupations: Broomstick Engineer (something no-one brings up), the precision engineered racing brooms have to be designed by someone. Solicitor, Advocate and Barrister get brought up from time to time. I'm sure there must be Wizarding Fiction, so Author. There are plenty of international jobs that you could come up with. Jobs don't have to be glamourous, someone could work in a Fire Whisky Distillery or a Butterbeer Brewery, these are specialist jobs, for example a friend of mine is doing his degree specifically in 'Brewing and Distilling', so there is a market for it at least here in Muggle Scotland where Distilleries are everywhere and are a relatively large sector of our Economy.\\
There are lots of subsidiary jobs that need filling, don't underestimate the value of support staff.

** From the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  A Hit Wizard or Hit Witch was a member of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad that were trained to deal with highly dangerous combat situations, such as high-risk arrests, riot controls and presumably, hostage situations. As such they were the Wizarding Britain's equivalent of specialist firearms officers.

Can't really think of any professions right now, so I might come back and edit this later or something.

** I generally depict Aurors as the elite and Hit-Wizards as the rank and file. At least when it comes to combat, Auror = James Bond and Hit-Wizard = regular soldier. And on top of that combat role, Aurors have substantial abilities in stealth, tracking, and subterfuge.

My Hit-Wizards have an arsenal of basically two spells: the Blasting Curse and the Shield Charm.

As for other professions, here is my org chart of the Ministry of Magic in Victoria Potter:

Obviously that's just the Ministry, though. Does not include private sector jobs, of which there are numerous mentions throughout VP, especially in the Diagon Alley chapters (3 and 15).

** Okay, I think what happened was that hit wizards were magical cops before someone pointed out that Rowling had fundamentally misunderstood what "hit man" meant. And then, suddenly, we got Aurors or Dark Wizard hunters. Something like that anyway. But, of course, everyone acts like hit wizards and Aurors aren't the same thing (governments rename things all the time) so what is the difference?

Well, basically everything we know about the Ministry of Magic is some kind of citizen regulation enforcement. Like, I'm not 100% sure Arthur's part of the DMLE but he clearly has weight to throw around when it comes to drawing up charges (see: Moody) and he goes on raids or has raids conducted even before his promotion. So, in this sense, I take Aurors to be really narrowly defined... they're as close as canon gets to Light and Dark wizards that we find all the time in fanon.

Thus, I conclude that hit wizards are another part of the DMLE that do raids on behalf of other parts of the DMLE or Ministry departments in general (if Arthur isn't in the DMLE to start with). So, basically, they're like the Armed Offenders Squad in NZ, CO-19 in Luther or, of course, SWAT. They don't have any investigative responsibilities as such which contrasts them with Aurors. And they probably don't work very closely with the Aurors either as a kind of security measure (so, you'd have to corrupt the Aurors and Hit Wizards separately) or possibly departmental friction.

I think, but am not sure, that it's also possible that Hit Wizard is a generic term for combat wizard of which Aurors are a specific example employed by the Ministry... and there are free lance hit wizards available. Isn't the exact phrasing "Ministry Hit Wizards"? EDIT: I see below that this is quite far from the phrasing.

Also, CO-19 is actually [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialist_Firearms_Command][SCO-19.]]
