Where are some fanfiction out there with a butt kicking Harry. Something with fighting and he doesn't rely on his magic. This harry knows not to blindly trust people, but not to much teust issues. I disly that there are some that have him in a harem, which is disgusting. Also, I don't like the ones where they make him overpowered (OP) and better then everyone. He kinda his better then them, but he still runs into problem and his humble about his power. Where are the Harry Potter fanfiction like that ?


** Mastermind Hunting is a good one. Harry is close with the Dursly's because their good. And he's running from the government. He's really overpowered, but he his having trouble and the world his very dangerous so it evens out.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has a Hermione like that, she runs a resistance army against the Death Eaters since the Order is useless as long as Dumbledore has to keep his reputation as a politician. She doesn't just rely on magic and still kicks butt and kills Death Eaters left and right. Meanwhile, Harry and Ron get tutoring by Moody and Dumbledore and later are pretty badass too.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
