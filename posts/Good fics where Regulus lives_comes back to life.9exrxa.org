Looking for any good fics where Regulus either lives or comes back to life somehow. Any recs would greatly appreciated :).


** I know that there are several, but I can only think of three really well known ones and all are centered on Harry:

/The Art of Self-Fashioning:/ Harry-centric, Neville is BWL, Regulus lived and eventually teams up with Minerva of all people to help Harry. A pretty solid fic, even if my summary makes it seem odd. linkffn(11585823).

/Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is/: MOD Harry reborn as eldest Black brother. A fun fic, nice brotherly relationship with Sirius and Regulus, though Regulus is not the main character. linkffn(10610076).

/Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin:/ one of the most popular WIPs around right now. I think Regulus appears around ch. 90ish or so. linkffn( 11191235).

*** I would like to double down on /the art of self-fashioning/.

Regulus Black is probably my favourite character in this story. He is wonderfully strange juxtaposition of being the character most actively helping harry, whilst simultaneously giving him more verbal smacks than ANYone else.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

*** Second this rec. What's there is a great story, sad to think it will likely never be finished.

Imo, still well worth the read anyway -- and I don't say that often about (likely) abandoned works.

For for those worried about the bashing mentioned by others: from what I remember, it was minimal. A little exaggeration of character's canon tendencies that lead to some extra fights, but no character was made into a caricature in what's there. Even if you hate the bashing trope, I think you can still read and enjoy this story.

***** Eh, Sirius's family was at the very least emotionally abusive (the portrait screams about how he's a waste of space, useless, etc.) and it's implied that his parents were the ones who wanted Regulus to join the Dark Lord when he was only 16. If your family is a bunch of emotionally abusive, racist assholes I think it's okay to turn your back on them.

It's definitely Regulus's point of view and it kind of makes it clear that it is his views coloring his memory, especially when it comes to Sirius, but it's textbook bashing when it comes to Hermione. It goes beyond her being bossy, to downright comically intrusive.

  the portrait screams about how he's a waste of space, useless
#+end_quote

A portrait, an inanimate object, screaming at someone does not count for emotional abuse. If you're going into assumptions, his mother spent her last days a wreck - one son in prison, and the other missing, presumed dead. That's enough to send anyone round the bend. Also, the house is infested with minor dark creatures and the locket - that could definitely have had an effect on the portraits as well.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The emotionally abusive part is a big assumption. All we know is that Sirius hates the place because of their beliefs in blood purity - which is very strange because children generally follow their parents and family without question almost all the time. Where this resistance to blood purity came from is anyone's guess.

It is also never okay for elder brother to allow his younger brother do as he pleases without even trying to dissuade him - and from what Sirius says in canon, he didn't give a damn.

******* We're going to have to agree to disagree.

It does sound like Sirius gave a damn, and the portrait was said to represent Sirius's mother's attitude in real life (e.g. he quips something like how it is a realistic depiction of his mother's attitude, and if someone in real life used to scream at their 11 year old kid that they are worthless and a stain on their honor 24/7, it is emotionally abusive). Remember, his mother disliked him even before he was in Gryffindor, so this didn't start once he was older. Also, parents pressuring a 16 year old like Regulus to join the Death Eaters, a hate group that carried the risk of death, is extremely emotionally abusive.

So I strongly have to disagree on the Black parents not being emotionally abusive to Regulus and Sirius.

Various Black members were blasted off the tree for not being crazy racists, so it's possible Sirius picked up on how dumb blood purity was from Alphard (who left him a sum of money) or Andromeda, (when he saw that she was disowned for marrying a muggleborn).

** Hold my cup.

This is my list of Regulus Black stories. They also consist of Black Brothers fics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under there account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].

The summary for this one: "Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well."

Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die." Or: Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.

When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

** linkffn(Saving Connor Lightning on the wave)

He comes back in the Saving Connor series, though I don't remember which book it is. (Can someone help?) I really like the story arc that comes from Regulus coming back - it has a really neat bit of world-building associated with it involving magical portraits.

** Linkffn(11153333)

It isn't really a main focus of the fic but it does happen. Telling you that plot point is kind of a spoiler but it's interesting the way it plays out.

***** Call: ffnbot!refresh

Place: reply to the original post that has the ffnbot call you want to redo

Additional tips:

1) you probably should edit the original post, or it will be unlikely that re-calling the bot will do anything different a second time. Most likely you have a spelling error.

2) Alternatively, just change the title in the original call to the full url or the story ID number. Those are more accurate if you have the time to grab them.

3) at the bottom of every ffnbot post there is a "usage" link. Find this info and more there in the future if you need it!

4) once the bot refreshes, you can delete your ffnbot!refresh subcomment if you want and no one will ever know ;)
