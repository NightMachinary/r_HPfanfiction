I'm currently writing a Marauder era time-travel (main pairing Remus/OC). I'm about halfway through. My OC is from the postwar era - about 2010 - and she ends up using her knowledge to prevent as much of the war as she can. What do you, as readers, like to see in a time-travel fic? I'm just curious as to if any of you have tips!

** My takes:

- Don't make Frank and Alice Longbottoms classmates of the Marauders. They are most likely not as they are already star Aurors while the marauders are barely out of school.
- Don't write Lily as too aggressive, don't vilify James, and don't glorify Snape
- In 1976, Regulus should still be a diehard blood purist and Voldemort supporter
- According to the Black Family Tapestry, Bellatrix was born in 1951 when her father Cygnus III was only 13 years old! This is clearly bullshit and shows whoever made up that thing is awful at math. I think you can safely ignore it.
- But Tonks had to be born around 1973 because she was out of Hogwarts a year before Harry arrived. That means Andromeda had to be born earlier than 1956. Also, it makes sense alphabetically that Andromeda was the elder sister, not Bellatrix. If I were to write it, I would have Andromeda born in 1955, Bellatrix in 1957, and Narcissa in 1959. Then your MC will meet Bellatrix at Hogwarts in her last year.
- Your MC most likely doesn't know all of Voldemort's secrets, but her *primary objective* should still be the destruction of Voldemort and his sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums.
- As for how she could accomplish that without risking too much of her skin, consider the approach used in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]].
- I prefer that you do not bash Dumbledore.

** I generally enjoy temporal culture clash stuff. Someone from 2010 in the 70s is going to have remarkably different views on a lot of subjects and issues than everyone around them. Even leaving aside blood purity, your OC is coming from a world where Maggie Thatcher was prime minister (for all the good /that/ did), where same-sex marriage is legal, the yanks have had a black president and South Africa is no longer an Apartheid state.

*** Don't know why this received downvotes but I agree entirely. Additionally, I would also like to see a focus on wizarding politics. 1969 was the year of the squib rights marches, the following years were filled with pureblood riots and just generally a lot of terror and violence, very different from 2010
