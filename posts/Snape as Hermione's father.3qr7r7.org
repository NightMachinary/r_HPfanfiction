Hello all!

I recently found Keogh (linkffn(keogh)), and broke my one rule: reading a fanfic that is not complete. However, I enjoyed the idea of Snape being Hermione's biological father very much. Anyone have any other recommendations? Oh, and I'll take any Hermione/Cedric fics if you got em, too!

Thanks for your time!

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

** I think the only Cedric/Hermione I've read, but from what I remember of it, it was pretty good.

** (Linkffn(lily potter's biggest secret by strong hermione))

This certainly isn't classic literature... And the dramatic departure from canon character personalities occasionally bother me. But it's one of my guilty pleasure reads.

*** Yeah there were parts of it I just didn't really enjoy, such as her mom being so crass and pervy. I'm not a prude at all, and read a lot of smut, but it just felt really forced like a 15 year old was writing that. I'm more of a SS/HG pairing fan myself, but I thought a father/daughter dynamic was interesting.
