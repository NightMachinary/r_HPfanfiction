If you guys could stop one person from dying in canon, who would it be. For me it would be Fred.

** I would save Sirius because I feel like Harry needs a father figure in his life. Everything would be so different if Sirius was alive.

*** If I remember it well, Rowling first planned to have Arthur die when attacked by Nagini, before changing her mind and rather kill Sirius.

While I really like Arthur, I think his death could have been very interesting for the plot. Between Ron suffering his first "true" loss, Harry feeling guilty and even Percy not being able to reconcile with his father . . .
