This is something I think a lot of people don't really realise or at least acknowledge as much as they should.

Hermione Granger is INCREDIBLY impulsive, almost dangerously so. And I think, especially in fanon, a lot of people don't recognise or register this fact when discussing her or writing her.

Her solution to getting past Neville was to just Body Bind him and leave him there. Harry didn't immediately listen to her about the broom? She reported it. There's an annoying reporter making her and her friends lives difficult, better kidnap and blackmail her (keeping her prisoner for weeks on end).

Because she usually has a fairly logical response when questioned, I think people gloss over how reckless and thoughtless actions like these are. Anything could have happened to Neville whilst they were gone and he wouldn't have been able to defend himself. She is lucky that going behind Harry's back like that didn't irreparably damage their friendship (which is a discussion for another day) and yeah Rita Skeeter would have been fined for being an unregistered Animagus, but Hermione kidnapped a woman and kept her prisoner. She very well could have gone to Azkaban for what she did to Skeeter, and she would have deserved it.

Hermione is a brilliant, powerful and intelligent witch, cursed with a reckless/impulsive streak that miraculously didn't cause her own self destruction.

Because her characterisation and actions are written based on the needs of the plot, and it's inconsistent depending on the situation. This comes down to how JKR structures her stories - one overarching mystery over the course of the year, that her intrepid kid characters have to solve clue by clue, regardless of how stupid the adult characters have to be to make it to happen.

Sometimes Hermione's impulsive - coming up with a plan on the spot to lure Umbridge into the forest; running off to the library as soon as she has a clue about the basilisk without telling anyone where's she's gone; assaulting Ron with flying birds after she saw him make out with Lavender.

Other times she's the voice of reason and restraint, because /Harry/ is the impulsive one. Harry wanted to shout down Umbridge in class, while Hermione warned him to keep his mouth shut so they could run DADA behind the scenes. Harry wanted to rush off to the DoM, while Hermione told him it was a trap. Harry believed that Draco was a Death Eater, while Hermione laughed at him and said he was too young to be marked, so he had to be bluffing.

This inconsistency is the main reason why Hermione's character is so hard to pin down, and why every author portrays her character a different way. And the impulsiveness is not the only inconsistent trait JKR wrote into Hermione's character.

She's a defender of magical creatures - goes to work at Department for the Regulation of Magical Creatures after Hogwarts, but is still casually racist to a sentient being and Hogwarts Professor. In context, she's trying to make a point to Parvati and Lavender, but it's needlessly cruel for someone who believes non-wizarding magicals should be treated as equals.

    "I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?" asked Parvati.

    It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

    "Not really," said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. "I've never really liked horses."

    "He's not a horse, he's a centaur!" said Lavender, sounding shocked.

    "Either way, he's still got four legs," said Hermione coolly.

See it this way: if a centaur called a human wizard an "ape" or "monkey", that would be as offensive as a human calling a centaur a "horse".

**** One thing you never notice about Hermione in fanfiction, but appears all over the place in canon, is how often Hermione gets upset and teary, or cries. My assumption that it's because this character trait rarely made an appearance in Movie Hermione, along with being dismissive of other girls (Book Hermione mocked Lavender for being affectionate to Ron), or being awkward and frumpy (Hermione's Yule Ball looks were a one time thing.)

#+begin_quote
  "Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon..."

  "Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it," she said, flaring up at once. "After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?"
#+end_quote

Seriously, if you keep count, Hermione gets tears in her eyes dozens of times. Strange how it never really shows up in fanfic past the "Hermione runs off to the bathroom and gets cornered by a troll" plot point in first year. She's an extremely sensitive person with a prickly ego, and yet fanfic makes her out to be a stone-cold badass most of the time. Kind of sad, when I think women characters are best when they're written with emotions, instead of being relegated to a more generic Strong Female Protagonist role.

***** Thank you for pointing this out! I noticed in my last re-read of the canon that in the first few books, almost everything said by Harry and Ron is generally "Ron said" and "Harry asked" or "Harry said", but almost every. single. time. for Hermione it's "Hermione shrieked", "Hermione cried", "Hermione shouted". I am not sure how much of this is internalized misogyny, especially since all the female characters are written so poorly, but it really bothered me.

****** You forgot /"Hermione said shrilly"/. If you do a Search + Find on the ebook, "shrill" is consistently used as an adverb dialogue tag for annoying characters. Colin Creevey, Dobby, Pettigrew, Pigwidgeon, and most commonly, Hermione.

I wrote a post recently on the difference between male and female characters in canon:

"The HP source material lacks major notable female characters. If you count them up, most of the main plot-relevant named characters are men. Whether you like it or not, men drive the plot. Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Draco. They're all first-tier central characters, and all have distinct personalities, motivations, backstories, flaws, goals, and mannerisms.

When you look at the women in the series, you hardly get as much material. Hermione is the most well-developed female character, and then after her you drop into secondary-tier characters. Ginny (the instigator of the much-maligned "Chest Monster"), Luna (a victim of fanon), Bellatrix (a horrible person you have to work hard at to write a relationship around). And then after that, you get tertiary characters like Molly Weasley, Professor McGonagall, Dolores Umbridge, Rita Skeeter, Lily Evans, and Fleur Delacour.

Male characters are memorable with strong personalities, while the female characters often fall into "archetypes" or "stereotypes", where their personalities can be boiled down to Doting Mother, Wise Professor, Hot Chick, Manic Pixie Dreamgirl, or Evil Bitch. If you tried to apply the archetype of "Wise Professor" to Dumbledore, it would not be an apt descriptor of his role to the story, as much as "Evil Bastard" would be to Draco Malfoy - because /their/ characters are given a depth that is missing in the characters that use the archetypes and play them straight.

To give another example of the disparity of male/female personality development in the books, we know more about James than we do about Lily. They're the same age, from the same year, both parents of the main character, but James is so much more well-rounded as a character than Lily is."

It's incredibly rare to find a fanfic where Luna is her canon self, an eccentric conspiracy theorist with a good heart who's quick to snap at someone who treats her less than respectfully, rather than her fanon personality: a dreamy fourth-wall-breaking insane (but only in an endearing way) savant with zero flaws who's constantly bullied and helpless to do anything about it, but can and will do whatever "awesome" thing the fanfic author wants.

#+end_quote

I'm reading a fic at the moment that's working on developing Hermione as a subplot. It's pointing out these flaws: her crying, her need to be correct, her overly long essays (not following instructions), her impulsiveness, her double standard about rules... While it started off looking like it was going to go nuts with Ron and Hermione bashing, it took the time to knock sense into Ron about some things and is on track to do the same with Hermione. The following snippet takes place after Hermione picks at Harry until he gets fed up and leaves, leading to a lecture by Ron:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione continued to gaze at him as though she'd never seen him before. Ron eventually began growing a bit irritated as well.

  "What? I'm not allowed to have insights and know stuff? I'm not a dumb eleven year old kid that's never been away from home before anymore either. Maybe it's not just Harry you need to rework things with."

  Hermione started to look decidedly sniffly. Ron hit her with a calming charm. She looked at him with betrayed eyes and her lower lip wobbled. He hit her with a second one.

  "Stop casting magic on me."

  "Stop crying all the time. Blimey, that would have been the third time in just the last hour! Gonna sob all the moisture right out of yourself and then where will you be?"
#+end_quote

The calming charm thing is also a bit of recurring gag. There's a lot of crack written straight in it, and the author seems to hate Ginny (she's basically a caricature, or is so far at least), but I'm really enjoying the Mischief's Heir series and a large part of it (beyond the obvious primary plot) is how they're dealing with Hermione and her flaws. linkao3(4629198)

I thought the scene was to portray Hermione trying to not seem jealous, by making it seem like she thinks less of Firenze. Think about it, she loves classes above all else, it is literally written that she'd rather eat something disgusting than miss 'Alastor Moody's' lesson on resisting the Imperius Curse, despite the lesson being pretty much illegal - simply because it was too important and unique to not participate in.

I think she would be bursting with regret and envy for not having lessons with a centaur, a race known to not share their knowledge with mankind. That would be a one in a lifetime class, and she cannot attend it. So what does she do to not show her envy? She tries to downplay him, in her mind at least.

  "There you are, then," *said Hermione in a superior tone.* "They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death! And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better pop my clogs then!"

  "If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared to my Arithmancy class!"
#+end_quote

Hermione has previously belittled Lavender for her belief in Divination.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then--- "Was Binky an old rabbit?"

  "N-no!" sobbed Lavender. "H-he was only a baby!"

  Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.

  "But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.

  Parvati glared at her.

  "Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he, Lavender just got the news today---" Lavender wailed loudly "---and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock---"

  "Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think other people's pets matter very much."
#+end_quote

And now that Lavender is excited about Firenze being their teacher, she's again belittling Lavender on the basis that Lavender is only into Divination because the teacher is fit and shirtless. None of that is about envy. If Hermione wanted to, she could sit in on the Divination class, because it's not like Firenze will recognize a random student popping up. She's acting like that because Professor Trelawney destroyed Hermione's confidence in being "the brightest student in their year". Hermione's ego is wrapped up with her intelligence, which is why she cries when Snape calls her an "insufferable know-it-all", and why gets so annoyed when Harry does better than her in Potions with the Half-Blood Prince textbook. And why her Boggart is McGonagall telling her she failed a test.

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think it looks like a Grim," she said flatly.

  Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike. "You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future."

  "Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't like being rubbish at something for a change!"

  He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.

L and P are implying that Hermione is crushing on Firenze just like they are. Hermione is saying that they're not really compatible because they're literally a different species. To her, as a muggleborn, that probably seems like bestiality. Whether it is to a wizard or not, and how acceptable it is to mate with beings or beasts of different species, probably determines how racist her statement would seem to them.

There is. It's not racism for the sake of being racist, like what Pansy or Draco do when they spout off about Mudbloods. It's not even about being envious or regretful in missing an interesting class that the other students get to go to.

It's about Hermione's longstanding bias and dismissal of Divination as a legitimate subject. She considers it "rubbish", because it's not logical like Arithmancy, and Trelawney told her she didn't have the Sight.

#+end_quote

Hah, I'll run with that tangent. I was just thinking about how no one ever properly apologizes for stuff in this series. I mean I'm sure there's some examples of good apologies that I can't remember off the top of my head, but so often they end up like the example you mentioned. Someone does something kinda shitty, things stew about for a bit, and then the plot undoes or nullifies the shitty thing, and the person mutters an awkward "sorry, maybe?" and that's the end of it. The plot fixes the problem somehow, instead of the character genuinely apologizing and changing and growing, so they always feel really empty.

Harry's pretty quick to forgive, too, so he usually just shrugs it off. I don't feel like Hermione and Ron ever really properly apologized for the way they treated him in third/sixth and fourth/seventh years. Especially since Harry played a pretty small part in creating most of those conflicts.

And it's not like Harry was a saint through the series either, but he was a kid with a broken upbringing and no home who had the weight of the world put on his shoulders and a horcrux inside of him, all on top of the teen drama that everyone else had to deal with, so I can't help but excuse him for being occasionally shitty.

Anyways, I don't remember Harry or anyone else really receiving a decent apology. Um, I don't even remember how I started on this or where I was going, so rant over I guess.

Because if he didn't then the only sincere apology in the series comes from 1st year Ginny Weasley after the Chamber of Secrets. And I dom't know what that says about the series or JK but it makes me a little uncomfortable.

But I'm not sure even the magic of the killing curse is any different than the magic of the tickling charm.

There is no light and dark magic, only power and the will to use it. But that will is what defines the difference between light and dark. You have to want to hurt someone, /need/ to see them suffer torture beyond torture, in order to properly cast the cruciatus. The ability to cast the spell on a whim is what makes you dark, not the spell itself. Making an inferius might be technically challenging, but making one says more about you than about the magic involved.

**** Because it's a pretty glaring example of wizarding paternalism, a common theme in wizard/muggle relations in the HP books. It's something you see a lot in superhero media, where people question the inherent power imbalance between those with special inborn abilities versus the normies. But this power disparity is never questioned in the books themselves, as Dumbledore goes around confunding Mrs. Cole from the orphanage and threatening Petunia Dursley, and it's just accepted as "the best option".

What it comes down to is this question: /what gives Hermione the right to rewrite her parents' memories?/

Gilderoy Lockhart doing it was considered bad, and him being totally memory wiped counted as karmic. Did she even explain to them why they had to leave, or ask for permission? Their consent was never mentioned in canon. Would normal, grown adults even want their memories rewritten to make them completely different people? Probably not.

It's not even the first time wizards have treated muggles, the Grangers in particular, as beneath them. Well-intentioned or otherwise, wizards treated them as zoo animals.

But that is because people are only looking at situations with no emotional component. As soon as there is an emotional conflict with the logical answer she will argue against it until (and sometimes even /after/) proof is shoved right under her nose. Most people don't incorporate this and write her like a Vulcan

Some examples are:

The first time she learns about house elves. She doesn't even consider the elves are okay with it, even when she meets them. Her immediate emotional reaction is "Slavery is bad" and she goes full throttle into freeing them rather than finding a way to improve their working conditions or changing their mindset organically rather than attempting to force her views on them.

When they find out about the Hallows. She recoils at even the thought of talking to dead people and refuses to believe the resurrection stone is real because it is so abhorrent to her.

The HBP Potions Book. A book brimming full of hidden knowledge and she is against studying it and finding a better way to do things because it feels like cheating.

An absolute definite logical personality would probably accept that it's possible if not probable Crookshanks ate Scabbers but her initial reaction is to completely deny it.

*** I always thought Hermione was very clearly ISTJ. The examples you mention are consistent with *S*Js, who value tradition, prior experiences and beliefs. Slavery, resurrection and secret potions books conflict with what she's been taught and what she feels is right.

MBTI nerdery below:

- Quickly: what you're describing are basically Cognitive Functions. In short: we know everybody has to Think, Feel, Sense and intuit --- a binary forced choice between e.g. thinking and feeling is reductive and wrong. /But/ some people are more comfortable communicating emotionally, while others prefer to keep how they feel to themselves and express what they think needs to be done. The former are good at extroverted feeling (**FJs), while the latter favour introverted feeling and extroverted thinking (**TJs or **FPs).

In the case of Hermione, she falls in the latter category. She plans, makes decisions and persuades with logic (1), while internalising how she feels about the situation at hand (2). And this planning is heavily informed by her past experiences --- what she's read, what she's been told, and the rules (3).

I think the order in which she uses these functions is roughly 3, 1, 2, which makes her an ISTJ. ([[https://www.typeinmind.com/site][More here.]] The distant 4th part of the puzzle is creativity and seeking new experiences. She likes to do that the least, so it's her 'inferior' function.)

She puts her hand up for /every/ question.\\
She'll push herself into someone else's conversation and quote Hogwarts a History at them.\\
She actually enjoys attending Slughorn's parties.\\
We see her at her weakest when she is isolated from her friends (Book 3) or when she doesn't have any (book 1)

Hermione thrives off social interaction. She loves to talk, she loves to argue. We sometimes see her falling asleep at a book or knitting when she is left to her own devices but in almost every social interaction she is an unstoppable torrent of energy and rarely goes to bed early because she is exhausted from over-socializing, only when she's annoyed.

I feel she is often construed as an introvert because she likes to read but in my opinion she doesn't like to read so much as she likes to learn. And she prefers to do it in a social setting, but she can't because her peers are not able to keep up with her so she has to resort to self learning which leads to an excess of being alone.

After all given the option of learning defense on her own (She says she couldn't but come on) and co-founding an illegal defense against the dark arts club, she favoured the later.

***** I agree with you. Distinguishing between Introverts and Extroverts is a bit of an arbitrary and pointless comparison, imo. I can't even decide whether /I'm/ an Introvert or Extrovert.

In functional terms, Hermione's Extroverted Thinking and Introverted Sensing functions (1 and 3 from my previous post) are working in tandem. To use one of your examples, she's absorbed Hogwarts a History (3) and quotes it at everyone (1). In theory, whether she favours (3) or(1) should determine whether she's an introvert or extrovert, but she's clearly using both a lot --- is the difference even important?

I'm pretty happy to just call her an STJ and leave it at that.

** Well to be fair she was a teenager. Even teenagers that are smart and get good grades can be impulsive and/ or self- destructive. Though another popular anti- Hermione sentiment is that the charm (curse?) she placed on the list of DA members and humiliating Marietta was too cruel.

​

Fuck Skeeter though. Reporters are slimy greaseballs that get off on the misery of other people. I can see your point about the other accidents but I have no compassion for journalists like Skeeter. Plus she only blackmailed her not to write anything and later write one truthful article. She could have blackmailed her into taking her and Harry's side in anything she writes.

Is it really an anti-Hermione sentiment to think she went too far with the Sneak scar on Marietta? It wasn't an act of impulse, that could be blamed on teenage recklessness. It was a totally premeditated cold-blooded revenge. Hermione never told anyone beforehand that the parchment was jinxed, and while the pimples faded eventually, the scars left behind were /permanent/.

** I don't think "impulsive" is the right word. Hermione's most impulsive action in all of canon was probably sending birds after Ron out of romantic jealousy. A good heuristic is to ask "If Hermione were /not/ impulsive, how would she have handled the situation differently?"

For example, what would be the "non-impulsive" way to get past Neville? Or, would a "non-impulsive" Hermione called a mission abort when he refused to budge? And, what, precisely, would the body-bound Neville need to defend himself from /in the Gryffindor common room/?

Similarly, if the goal is to prevent Harry from possibly killing himself with the mysterious Firebolt, but he refuses to wait for a teacher to inspect it, what should a "non-impulsive" Hermione do if she values Harry's life over their friendship?

Now, with Skeeter, a more law-abiding character would have probably just turned her in, sure, but the choice to blackmail rather than report was very much premeditated, and she got something out of it, IIRC. Hermione's ruthless streak is well known.

** Great post! I would even say there's the argument there that she has deliberately invested in upping her skills in planning, research and preparation in order to offset her impulsive streak, to try and ahead of time cover herself.
