So, I've got some prompts that people might find interesting to think on during the various quarantine measures going about. Well, I hope they are, anyway: I try to think about the unexpected.

#1:

I posted this years ago in the Old Caer Azkaban, and I /think/ it was Dire Squirrel who ran with it for a page or so in a fic-snippet compilation?

Anyway:

A good while back, I had an odd thought about a plot where Harry was mysteriously transported to Korriban during the Resurgent Sith Empire's period, in his sleep and wearing only his dressing gown.

Because magic is so alien (a Lovecraftian-like element), it feels /wrong/ to Force sensitives: to them it feels just as wrong as the Dark Side, so he's mistaken as being a pretty powerful Sith Lord. As it's so alien, spells can't be seen but their effects can be: vocalizations are retroactively blanked from people's memories seconds after hearing them by the universe itself, as it basically goes "nope nope nope can't hear it lalala".

So, when he wanders into the Sith Academy from the desert, looking and sounding like shit because he's been wandering around in a desert, reeking of the 'Dark Side' to the point where a Dark Councillor would blush, and wearing nothing but a tattered dressing gown (''arcane robes''), he pretty much blends in as they just assume he's a Darth, and no-one is suicidal or paid enough to question just another eccentric Sith Lord walking around a Sith Academy.

You know, when you act like you belong somewhere confidently and people presume? Kinda like that.

He looks for a way home or just /anything/ to clue him why he came to be there, researching and vanishing out into Korriban to find old relics and tombs and the like, and to the Sith it looks like he's very dedicated to researching the Dark Side/Sith teachings.

He unintentionally begins to snowball a reputation when his magic allows him to do things thought hard or impossible to do, such as killing a Terentatek by blowing it into pieces with a charm or a bizarre reaction where it ends up being crushed by a weird Banishing/Summoning reaction, saving a group of soldiers or Acolytes.

Or when he inadvertently saves an slave-turned-Acolyte from being Harkun's next 'example' when he stumbles across them: Harkun thinks this mysterious Sith Lord has taken an interest in someone he thought was a weak User as a future apprentice.

Realizing that this 'Lord Azkaban' (Harry picked it in a panic because Azkaban was the grimmest-sounding thing he knew of) saved her neck, she vows to 'live up to his expectations' and dives into her training full-throttle.

As a minor sub-plot, Harkun feels intimidated, realizing that he might have just put himself on an aloof, cold Darth's shit-list for some reason.

It doesn't help matters when Harry, on accident, sometimes wanders into areas where she and the other Acolytes are training, such as the Interrogation Chambers and Lightsaber arenas, and his idle curiosity is mistaken as his checking on her progress... which fuels her determination even more.

Her observations of him even shape her training: if he relies on 'just the Force' and not any 'tools', such as a lightsaber, she pushes herself to learn the same way, to emulate him.

He begins to gain a reputation through misunderstandings and embellishments, and shenanigans ensue.

Harry is pretty clueless though, and he's doing his best to maintain his facade in a place he knows little-to-nothing about, around complete nutters... which compounds the problem, due to his behavior.

The time comes to take his 'Apprentice': baffled as fuck, he rejects her.

Angry, embarrassed (for obvious reasons), and filled with arrogance, she attacks him. Not wanting to hurt her, he pretty much 'confidently' beats her down with basic stuff like Tripping Jinxes and other 'humiliating' methods, basically schooling her to everyone else's perception.

She expected death for her failure: she's surprised when he helps her up.

It ends up, somehow, with her believing she had a lot more to learn, that he humbled her on purpose, and her being his Apprentice, following him around with a case of pretty much hero-worship.

His telling her to go do her own thing? ''Self-study'', vaguely guided by some comment he inadvertently made, related to the shenanigans at hand.

It all sort of snowballs from there.

#2:

This one is more in-line with traditional SW crossovers, and that it's tropey in that Harry is unable to age for some reason:

A seventeen year old Harry saved a younger Ursa Wren (around fifteen) from a fuck-up, basically keeping her wounded ass alive for a few days until she could be found.

During this time, he shared his hip-flask of firewhiskey with her throughout her delirious daze.

He left as the sounds of rescue became apparent, and while her memories were hazy, she never forgot the firewhiskey.

Years later, after Phoenix Squadron become frequent visitors during Rebels' events, she's shocked when she tastes firewhiskey, not tasted since 'that day', out of the blue during a celebration, poured into her cup: Sabine and Hera remark they got it as a thank you from a mercenary acquaintance of theirs, sympathetic to the Rebel cause, and it was his last bottle.

tl;dr: Ursa, now an adult, a wife, and a mother, meets Harry, still physically seventeen, which threatens to blow his secret. Events spiral from there.

#3:

Harry is a stoner, using the Wizarding World's version of weed.

Ravenclaw-Harry's the typical version of a teenage stoner, but does bizarre yet brilliant munchkin shit while blitzed.

His name comes out the Goblet, but people think he mistakenly put his name in while trying to use the Goblet to get high, or something, instead of signing up for the Tournament for glory and shit.

''Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?''

Harry blinked slowly, his bloodshot eyes focusing on Dumbledore. ''No, sir.''

A voice suddenly called out from the Gryffindor table. ''Harry, did you try to use the Goblet as a bong?''

''...Maybe?''

Katie Bell groaned. ''For fuck's sake, Potter!''

As a subversion of the straight-laced, authority-loving Hermione trope: she frequently joins him privately, because the stress after first year and such (her crappy social situation in Gryffindor) caused her to crack. And Stoned-Hermione does just as odd shit.

''Hermione, are you making joints out of Hogwarts: a History pages?''

''It's /magical/, Sally.'' Hermione giggled, and Sally groaned.

''That was bad, even for you.''

There's a bromance between himself and Fleur.

People think they're dating when they're just chilling and getting high -- she attempts to help him with his love-life. Katie Bell has a thing for him, but he doesn't notice her; Fleur tries to help, but since people think they're 'involved'... yeah, shenanigans and misunderstandings. And weed. Lots and lots of weed.

#4:

A RomCom where the older members of the Quidditch Team try to set up a crushing Katie and an oblivious Harry during Harry's third year. Sirius, in the background and despite being thought of as a traitor, also tries to subtly help out his godson.

Ironically, it's his actions that tip off Dumbledore and Lupin that the situation isn't as it appears to be..

#5:

Daphne Greengrass is terrifying.

She's a goddamn psychopath that unnerves her Housemates by being a more vicious version of Wednesday Addams, and is seemingly unafraid of everything.

So, they're shocked and baffled when she freely admits to being beyond terrified of Harry.

Naturally, the other Slytherins try to investigate and understand why, and Harry's confused why everyone in Slytherin is so cautious around him now.

(Amusingly, she's afraid not because he's a magical badass or something contrived, but because she has an unusual phobia of something completely generic that Harry has).

#6:

Thinking back on a prior plot-bunny, and reading an overall rundown of Cursed Child (dear god, what a pile of shit) with Ron and Padma's pseudo-canon kid...

Like in that Star-Trek episode where an explosion in the future echoed through to the past ("Anti-time"), /something/ Harry does in the future fractures the timeline/multiverse, with the "Prime" reality as its setting and him as its focus.

Soon, you have arrivals from possible futures arrive: children he, Ron, and Hermione have or will possibly have... er, or will have... you get the drift.

First come the canon kids... then the "bleed" slowly grows, with Ron and Padma's little asshole (he really /was/ a little ass, according to CC) being thrown in first as a portent. And it grows from there.

The rule of thumb is, basically, the more unusual/esoteric the pairing is in rating (such as Harry and Fleur's kids over Harry and Hermione's), the more divergent the world they came from became from the canon one, set at a microsecond before the canon kids arrived, until you have truly odd shit like Harry and /Rosmerta's/ kids appearing at the end of it.

And none of the various kids come at the "same time": some are old, being adults or grandparents reminiscing on "Grandpa Harry and Grandma Katheryn" ("Heh." He smiled sadly. "Nan insisted people use her full name after marrying Granddad Harry -- said 'Katie' sounded unrefined."); some young being kids or teenagers, etcetera.

While the overarching plot would be to fix whatever calamity caused this, trying to predict/fix what's going to happen (which, incidentally, may cause the very thing they're trying to prevent!), you have the interactions between the various kids and their parents... and not all of them are angels.

Jealousy, feuds (which may apply in one reality but not in another), awkwardness (half-siblings abound); beliefs (some may even be blood-purists, if Harry wasn't around to raise them with the mother, or if the mother left with them, etcetera, and may hate their possible half-siblings if the mother was a muggle, etcetera). Chaos, basically.

Then there's the dynamics between the possible parents themselves: while it may cause the canon parents to sort some issues out (like Hermione and Ron, Harry and Ginny), it could also cause/influence the other potential mothers and fathers (like Cho, Katie Bell, etcetera), depending on how the characters would react naturally.

#7:

Crack.

Harry Potter/RWBY:

Again, people write Harry as joining Beacon, etcetera, etcetera.

Harry, on entering Remnant, considers his situation: no-one knows him. No-one expects shit of him. He owes nothing to no-one. He could have a nice, quiet life here.

Well, on a personal level, anyway -- rampaging Grimm, and all that.

So, he gets a job as a waiter or bar-tender or something as equally mundane, and just minds his own business.

Unfortunately, he later learns the hard way that the cafe (as an example) he works in? It's frequently visited by various huntsmen and criminals. Who bring their own brands of shit with them.

So, while dodging clumsy flirtation attempts from various elements (you know, like how people flirt with that cute waiter/waitress when ordering drinks, etcetera) and keeping his head down from the shit going on around him, Harry tries to enjoy life while keeping out of trouble.

First job? Junior's Bar, as a bar-tender. Yang comes in and wrecks the place, and he has to dodge a flirtatious Malachite twin and an irritated Malachite Twin. And Yang.

Another job? Tucksons. Harry goes on break: Tuckson is murdered by Emerald and Mercury; the former notices him as they leave, heading back. In an earlier shift or so, he might encounter Blake.

Another? The Old Man's shop: it gets broken into by Roman and his hired goons.

As vague introductions by these misfortunes continue, Harry gets slowly sucked in as misconceptions about his presence arise.

Poor Harry.

"--never seen her before in my life!"

Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, as "Sweetheart" tightened her grip on his boss' meat and two veg.

"Eighteen and I'm already way too old for this shit," he said, as he began to pull the cap off two bottles.

Yang chanced a glance at the bartender, an eyebrow arched.

He merely put down a Strawberry Sunrise on the bar. Sans ice. With a little umbrella peaking over the rim. He began to wipe a glass, looking completely unconcerned about the unfolding situation and paying no heed to his boss' squeals of pain.

A stampede of footsteps from behind told her company was coming -- no doubt Junior's goons.

"Thanks cutey," she said, winking at him. "But I'll have to take a rain-check on that drink."

"If it isn't the Twins, it's someone else. What is with me and attracting crazy in this town?" 'Cutey' muttered, and she couldn't help but grin.

She liked his spunk.

--

"I swear, if he expects me to fix his teeth after this, I'm going to Banish that missile-launcher right up his--!"

--

He sighed again as 'Beautiful' jumped from the window his boss just sailed through, head-first.

Movement out of the corner of his eye caused him to turn, frowning, and he found the Twins --their faces bruised, lips bloodied-- limping up to the bar, their unsteady footsteps crunching glass and debris.

One of them --Melon, he thought her name was-- smiled at him in the same flirtatious way she and her sister had been all evening, though the missing front tooth killed her attempt faster than a Dementor's presence did on a Veela's sex-drive.

"...Fuck it, that waiter job down near Beacon is still open."

#8:

Harry doesn't get Hedwig: he gets Rouge the Bat, instead.

Reluctantly, she agrees to be his pet ("Partner!" she insists vehemently), since she realizes that Hogwarts (and Harry) is the best avenue to find a way home.

However, the kicker? Only he can perceive and converse with her as she is: to everyone else on Earth, she's just a slightly larger than average white bat. Like there's a perception filter on her.

So, you've got an eleven year old Harry, from a shitty home, having Rouge the thief as his new moral compass/mentor.

...It's gonna work out as well as you expect.

#9:

Harry goes missing, whether by Voldemort shenanigans, his future self causing it to complete a loop, or just by vanishing by methods unknown.

The cliche bit is that, after panicking, Dumbledore and co manage to magically drag him back from wherever he went.

It works, and they're relieved beyond measure. The reunion is a happy one, though Harry greets them as though he hadn't seen them for decades.

However...\\
--\\
He falls flat on his face on taking a step, on arrival. "Bloody hell! Going to have to get used to walking upright again."\\
--\\
Harry stroked his wand with his finger, smiling as a long-forgotten warmth spread throughout him. "Hello there, old friend." He sighed. "Going to take a while to get used to a wand again."\\
--\\
He glanced into a mirror. "Huh," he mumbled to himself. "Time-span differential, reversion, or just because my lifespan is now so long?"

Hermione looked at him, blinking owlishly.\\
--\\
Snape being Snape, but Harry just sighs.

"You know, before I might have risen to the bait, but life has taught me to be patient with foals and fools."\\
--\\
"Oh hell, my wife is going to throw a conniption!"

"Wife?" Mrs Weasley suddenly looked as though she were near-choking on one of Dumbledore's muggle confectioneries. "You're fifteen! You're too young to even /think/ of marriage!"

Harry, however, just laughed lightly. "Mrs Weasley... Molly... how old do you think I am?"\\
--\\
Three ways this could go:\\
--\\
"I'm twenty-five, Molly. And up-and-vanishing is going to drive my Cadey spare." He looked up at the ceiling, sighing. "Maybe some wizarding chocolates will placate her. Sleeping on the couch isn't my idea of a good night's rest, you know."\\
--\\
Butterflies, yo.\\
--\\
He smiled at her, but it was strange for her to see: if anything, it reminded her of the smiles Albus carried than the boyish grin she fondly remembered. "Molly, I'm six-hundred and fifteen years old. I've been married for five-hundred and ninety-three of those years." He chuckled, and she suddenly found herself feeling a little cold and dizzy. "I guess that means I'm the elder in the building, young lady.

"Oh, and if the temperature begins to dramatically rise, let me do the talking: Celly can, ah, overreact when it comes to her loved ones being threatened."\\
--\\
He smiled at her, but it was strange for her to see: if anything, it reminded her of the smiles Albus carried than the boyish grin she remembered. "Molly, I'm a hundred and seventeen years old. I've been married for about ninety-seven of those years." He chuckled. "I guess that means I'm the elder in the building, young lady.

"Oh, and if things suddenly get chilly, let me do the talking: my Luna is, ah, passionate." /Undeniably nuts/. His cheeks began to grow a rosy red. "Having Sirius' home obliterated by a moon-o'-doom would /probably/ put a crimp on things."\\
--\\
"So," Sirius said calmly. /Too/ calmly, though the nearly-empty bottle of Ogden's finest half-hidden by his feet was most likely responsible for that. "Married?"

"Yup," Harry said simply, smiling.

"Who wears the pants in the relationship?"

He snorted. "Definitely my wife."

Sirius smiled, his eyes distant. "Just like your parents."\\
--

So, yeah: Harry lived out his life in Equestria, got married and all, and then returned pretty much for a visit. A core component of it would be his friends and family reconciling what they knew of him and who he is now -- especially the adults.

Depending on whom his wife is, he's either older than Albus, older than everyone else but closer to Albus in age (they share commiserations over mistakes made during their lifetimes), or pretty much a married adult, and his friends and the adults, like Sirius and Molly, have trouble dealing with it.

-

I'll post the rest in comments due to length.


** #10:

You know, I'd like to see a crackish fic where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville decide to brew their own booze using wizarding plants -- gillyweed wine, etcetera -- in secret. Said booze also has magical effects.

Hermione is purely in it for the research, you know -- not that she may have developed a secret drinking problem to deal with the grey hairs her best friends have given her. No-sir-e.

Lavender glanced over their little still once. "You need more sugar."

Hermione was the first to find her voice. "What?"

Lavender shrugged. "Uncle's an alcoholic. You need more sugar."

#11:

I'd like to see a Greengrass subversion. There are so few of them.

Greengrass tries to blackmail Harry by meeting him in an abandoned classroom. It goes as a reader would expect -- Greengrass waiting for him, being smug and intelligent as per the trope, etcetera.

...And then she falls off the desk she was sitting on, bruising her butt.

It quickly becomes clear to Harry that Greengrass is a complete, stereotypical blonde airhead, despite the image she tries to project.

Harry is torn between feeling sorry for her, despite her actions, feeling indignant that she tried to blackmail him... and going along with her "blackmail" because she's hot.

Meanwhile, the Slytherins are utterly baffled at how Airhead Greengrass managed to snag Potter as a boyfriend, how she did it, and work themselves up into an over-analytical frenzy.

The more Harry gets to know her through her "blackmail", however, they find they actually have a lot in common, and things slowly become genuine between them.

...Which frenzies up people even more.

#12:

WoW's recent lore (okay, pretty much from War 3 onwards) has been... well, shit. However, Titan World Souls did intrigue me a bit.

So, what if Earth actually had a Titan World Soul... but it was one of, if not /the/ weakest out there, contrary to Azeroth's (which was the strongest), hence explaining why magic wouldn't be so prolific compared to Azeroth's.

That thing under Azkaban? The /only/ Old God to impact this world, but so weak it's only at a tiny fraction of what it should have been (only having Dementors, really, and dark beings that should have been under its control are free-willed or even peaceful). It takes decades for it to gain enough influence to affect the mortal world through agents, like Voldemort, Gellert, etcetera, but mortal intervention always kept its pawns in check/defeated them without knowing they were pawns.

The only advantage Earth Magic would have over its Azerothian counterparts is how unusual and concentrated it is.

Fiendfyre? Fire Elementals, controlled like Water Elementals on Azeroth. Other Elementals are just too lazy or weak to really impact the world outside being summoned/forced to.

Dumbledore, one of the few to realise that something more is going on behind the scenes, so to speak, early on, is astounded when he discovers that he's not the only one the World Soul has been communicating with -- young Harry has been since childhood, too.

Perhaps his stories of an imaginary "Big Sister" or mother-figure weren't stories after all...

#13:

"Congratulations, G'kar: you are now a religious icon."

Yeah, just watched /that/ moment in Babylon 5.

A *cracky* thought came to mind: Harry's incomplete ramblings/daily diary about his life and Hogwarts years gets found and published... and are a massive hit.

Spurred on by a recovering Lockheart and Skeeter (who bury their grievances with him and his friends since this makes them as rich as fuck/positive press by association -- small potatoes in comparison, but still massive), Harry's Sixth year becomes a whole lot interesting.

What they didn't expect was for the book to go /international,/ with revisions making the book more and more poetic. Apparently, people saw hope and advice in his ramblings for their own problems. Grudges are solved, peace agreements are brokered, and common-ground shared. Subgroups/other cultures out there even mix him into their own mythologies.

Suddenly, Harry's the center of a rapidly-growing cult... as are his friends -- including people in his outer circle of friends, like the Quidditch Girls, Lavender, Seamus, etcetera.

He and Dumbledore try to calm things down, but they are seen as trying to be humble... which just fans the flames. Especially when the fanatics begin to crop up, surprising the Death Eaters and Voldemort.

Everything Harry does is seen as 'great and revolutionary' by the masses now, much to his annoyance/exasperation. Thoughts and ideas from him that would be dismissed from anyone else are looked on as the greatest things since sliced bread.

"You know," Harry said, humming a little in thought, "they can make milk chocolate frogs... why not white chocolate ones? Or white chocolate owls?" He shot a fond look at Hedwig, who was... taking a crap.

Lovely.

"Genius!"

--

"What's this, Potter?"

"Erm." Harry looked up, confused. "Oh, I just removed a Biro's ink-tube and filled it with ink from the quill pot. Makes it a lot easier to write, and it's less messy -- see?"

"Genius!"

--

"...Chocolate Wizard's Chess, where the loser has his pieces eaten?"

Bewildered stares from the assembled group.

"Genius!" Someone in the back shouted out. "We'll make thousands of galleons!"

...Wizards really were idiots.

#14:

I don't think I've ever seen a fic where such reluctance was on /both/ sides: we know James was nuts on Lily, so (by stretching disbelief a bit) a fic where Lily has even a small interest in James but miscommunication/mixed signals on /both/ sides cause hijinks.

For example, canonically she was put off by his immaturity until he stopped being, well, a dick.

Here, her actions/misunderstandings could weird James out at inopportune times, which baffles Lily in turn at why he looks at her oddly compared to being his usual obsessiveness over her.

On the sidelines, their outer-circle of friends see what's going on and face-palm or laugh -- friends close to them, however, like Marlene and Sirius (respectively) are just as baffled as they are, and try to figure things out with them (and coming to the wrong conclusions, naturally).

Years later, people old enough to remember these hijinks see a similar situation of cascading screw-ups between Harry and X, and either take bets/wagers or brace themselves for an /interesting/ few years...

Point of views would be half-present, half-past as people recognize similar situations between the generations e.g. first chapter half with the Lily/James version, second half with Harry/X.

*** #15:

So, odd and somewhat *nonsensical* thought while reading that Emperor in Worm crossover...

Harry somehow, /accidentally/, heals the Emperor on the Throne. All of the Custodes and attendants gawk as the Emperor's flesh renews around his bones, and he gasps for air with his real lungs.

The real trouble comes after it, per the fallout: some regard him as a heretic, but most of the Imperial population on hearing the news? Harry's a saint. Harry's the Emperor's "hidden son". Harry's a separate aspect of the Emperor, come alive. Harry's the Machine God incarnate, using technology so advanced it appears as magic. Etcetera. Etcetera.

...Harry's also trying to run the fuck away from the galaxy of crazy nutjobs, using his limited magic know-how to disguise himself, and thanking whatever non-real Gods in this reality he can't be psychically sensed.

Death's Cloak really is a blessing!

#16:

Lily's sacrifice yeets Harry into another setting. On landing, he's contaminated/changed by an element native to that universe.

Shandris Feathermoon blinked and squinted: up in the night sky, one star in particular was unusually bright tonight, standing tall amongst its brethren even whilst it was bathed in the shining light of Elune's lunar radiance.

She continued to stare as the star's luminosity steadily increased. Huh, it /almost/ looked as if it were--

Something beaned her on the head; the mossy ground slammed into her back, and the last thing she heard before blacking out were the wails of an infant and the splashes of moonwell water.

#17:

Lavender decides to be "bad" to snag Harry, in a wanting antagonist (in the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainessesWantHeroes][Villainesses Want Heroes]] vein) way, after coming to the belief that he'd only notice her because of how his yearly adventures have impacted his perceptions in life.

"You know, I'm actually quite flattered," Harry said, still rubbing his wrists where the sub-grade bonds had simply, er, fallen apart.

Lavender looked up at him with red-rimmed eyes, sniffling. "You are?"

"Well, yeah: you went to all this trouble that took some serious planning, somehow got a pit full of rabid kneezles --do you know a Mrs. Figg, by any chance?-- and clearly put a lot of thought into this." He cupped her chin and looked directly into her eyes, Lavender freezing in shock. "So, there's a Hogsmeade trip on Saturday--"

She blinked, breaking herself out of her stupor. "You mean all I had to do was /just/ ask you out!"

"To be honest," Harry said with a sheepish smile as he stepped back a little, "before all this, I probably would have let you down gently. But, you kinda proved yourself to not be..." He hesitated, and his hand dropped from her face.

Lavender nodded and sighed in understanding, despite the slight disappointment of the loss of his physical contact. "A 'blonde airhead'?"

He nodded, a little timidly she idly noted. "Of course, all you probably had to do was grab me by the tie, snog me before I could blink, shove your chest in my face, and then state we're going to Hogsmeade." At her look of utter disbelief, he rubbed the back of his neck. "I'm a /bloke/, Lavender, not a celibate monk. And-" his voice dipped to a mumble "-I really like girls who take charge."

Meanwhile, in the shadows of the girls' stairwell, Katie Bell was listening with rapt attention.

/'Take charge', eh? Maybe I could arrange something at Quidditch practice tomorrow.../

**** #18:

Harry runs his own mini-casino in the depths of Hogwarts, in an abandoned classroom. It's not well-known, in a "you must know about it to know about it" kinda deal -- you know, like Fight Club's structure.

He also dabbles in things such as information, smuggling (mostly harmless stuff), potions and such. Dumbledore knows about it, but they have an arrangement: any vital intel he comes across from his 'sources' gets forwarded to him, and Harry gets near-enough free reign. The lesser evil, and all that.

Punters and staff include Katie Bell, who has a gambling problem and works off her debt by being a hostess (while also sliding in the role of being Harry's confidant and eventual girlfriend);

Crabbe and Goyle, who work as bouncers and 'security' and are paid quite a pretty galleon;

Fred and George, who run the Blackjack and Poker tables (aiming to save enough from their wages for the joke shop);

Malfoy, always thinking the next wager will be the "big payday" and who always loses -- to pay off portions of his debts, he relays information to Harry about Voldemort and from inside Slytherin.

Cormac, who always brags about being wealthy and puts down huge wagers, only to covertly beg and borrow from his friends to cover his debts;

Luna, who runs a tarot-card game, with her fantastic animals on the deck; she does it because of the comradeship she feels from the other staff, and Harry kinda unofficially adopts her as his little sister.

Just unusual stuff, you know? I've always liked to focus on lesser-used characters, outside of the few critical ones.

I did write a snip for this, but it was pointed out that it was an OC with Harry's face, and on hindsight, I agree. Still, I like the concept, not my execution, so I'll put it up anyway.

--

"Draco, Draco, Draco," Harry said, shaking his head, and he ran a finger gently down the shaft of the blond's stolen wand. "Payment's due. /Today/." Harry glanced at Katie, who looked a little pale in the face. She did look /great/ in the cocktail dress she picked out for herself, though. "How much was it again, Kitty Cat?"

She blinked, his query snapping her out of whatever daze she'd been in. "Ah, sixteen galleons," she replied quietly. Harry frowned, wondering why his girlfriend was suddenly being so withdrawn since they... /well/.

Malfoy was shivering like a leaf, and he kept shooting looks of betrayal at the two thugs holding him.

Crabbe and Goyle wouldn't meet his eyes.

"Start with his pinkies, then move up," Harry said, turning and waving a hand in dismissal. "You should be grateful, Malfoy, that I'm not doing something /worse/."

Crabbe nodded and, still not looking his friend in the eyes, gripped Draco's left pinkie finger. He began to pull and twist it to the side, and Goyle's wand tip, hot and glowing, began to inch towards his flesh...

The ponce let out a little squeal. "W-wait!"

Harry, who had began to rub soothing circles in the small of Katie's back, raised a fist above his collar; Crabbe's grip slackened, and Goyle''s wand paused barely a hair's breadth shy.

"I... I don't have the galleons today. But, but I know something!"

Harry remained silent; Katie's eyes flicked between the two. After a few tense moments, he caressed the side of her face, which she leaned into, and then sighed.

"This better be worthwhile."

Malfoy licked his dry lips. "I, uh, heard that Greengrass was planning on trying to brew Polyjuice in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom."

Biting back a laugh, he nonetheless remained silent, if to make Malfoy sweat a little more. Having Greengrass under his thumb as a brewer would be quite useful.

Katie apparently thought the same thing, as she gave him a barely-noticeable nod of the head.

"Very well," Harry finally said. "Drop him."

Malfoy fell to the ground like a sack of stones, and Harry casually tossed his wand at his feet.

"You have a forty-eight hour reprieve, Draco. /Get me my galleons/."

--

Yeah. Not Harry.

#19:

Harry is accidentally awakened by an overly-curious Ezra from stasis in a bunch of old ruins. He's confused and very pissed off. Acting on instinct, he apparates around, trying to keep as much distance between him and the Crew as possible.

Oh, and he does things which are thought to be impossible to the locals, such as basic magic.

They believe they awoke either an ancient Jedi or Sith from hibernation, or something.

In the meantime, Harry has an unfortunate encounter with the local Imperials. Unfortunate for them, that is: turns out a Blasting Curse to the chest can easily pulp the fleshy bits of a Stormtrooper. Hey, they shot their fancy ray guns first!

The Crew catch up to him after watching him essentially butcher a squad of Stormtroopers with relative ease: a tense situation ensues when he takes Hera hostage, his wand at her throat, demanding answers in English... which they don't understand.

Surprisingly, it's Sabine who "talks" him down by approaching open-handed, speaking gently in Mandalorian. Reluctantly, he's about to release Hera when more Stormtroopers catch up to the two.

Acknowledging that the Stormtroopers are the "lesser of two evils", he pushes her away and moves off to "neutralize" the party-crashers.

In the end, he hitches a ride with them as they try to work out the language barrier and his story. Meanwhile, Harry is alone, confused, and utterly terrified.

#20:

Goblins are addicted to the muggle arcade machines of the 80's, such as Pac Man, Space Invaders, and home consoles like the Master System and NES, etcetera. The most prestigious have access to the Genesis model II and the SNES.

Skills and recorded scores in these games are sacrosanct to the Goblins. Harry unintentionally impresses, astounds, and makes them fearful after he wanders off during his first visit and achieves the high-score.

Later on, despite being impossible in real-life due to the timeline, Harry takes Dudley's busted Playstation, has it repaired, and then uses it as a bargaining chip with some very interested goblins...

"I'll throw in a copy of Alien: Trilogy if you kick Lucius and Draco Malfoy in the balls, next time they walk in."

Griphook hesitated for a brief moment, but his greed quickly won out over the fear of any repercussions. "Done."

Wands have shipgirl-like avatars: every wand has a personality, a manifestation, that appears as a small, pixie-like avatar. However, they're a lot like Halo AIs in the respect that they can choose their own appearance that reflects their personality and nature.

Harry having a snarky, sarcastic and cynical though golden-hearted girl wand-manifestation would be hilarious.

For a random example, Lavender's Wand could be male, have a thin Russian accent and be a complete geek, while choosing to look like a cowboy; Pele, named after the Hawaiian goddess, could look like her... but have a tomboy attitude and a Bronx accent; Voldemort's Wand could be a cheerfully sociopath girl that likes to flirt with Harry (owner of her 'sister wand') whilst trying to kill him, much to Holly's chagrin; Bellatrx's wand? A disappointing nun-like figure that likes to prattle on in German, etcetera. An Asian-like figure that dresses like a Teutonic Knight, is spacey, and has the mannerisms of a British Squaddie.

Basically, throw anything into a blender, and unless there's a required core storyline theme mixed in by narrative fiat, go batshit with the combinations.\\
~\\
"You know," Holly said, arcing an eyebrow, "you should just snog her or hit her over the head: maybe that'd shock her into normalcy."

"Oh God," Harry mumbled, burying his face into his hands, his cheeks flaming red.

"Peh," Laurel said, though she was grinning. "I think our owners would be cute together, don't'chya think?"

Daphne's face flushed red, though whether it was from anger or embarrassment was a matter up for debate.

Pele looked up from Padma's textbook; her owner was determined not to get involved, keeping her eyes firmly on the pages. "You know, Paddy here heard an interesting rumour last night!" She leaned forwards, smiling eagerly, while Padma winced. "Turns out Luna Lovegood --blonde, Ravenclaw, a year below you lot-- has a thing for Mr Boy-Who-Lived here."

/Somebody, anybody, Stun me now!/

He felt a burst of amusement from his Wand.

/Traitor./

-

Holly, Harry's Wand, looks suspiciously like but not the same as Lily... more like if Harry had a twin, really. First time she and Snape meet, the Lily lookalike calls him a dick.

"Wow," she said flatly. "This guy must have a stirring rod shoved up his asshole."

#22:

You know that Darth Jar Jar theory? (In reality, I'm thinking he was originally meant to be a secret, ancient Jedi or something, or an unaligned, ancient Jedi - but that's neither here nor there).

Romsmerta is actually the 'Big Bad': either she regularly switches identities every century or so to maintain her cover, or she's an ancient witch that regularly possesses the bodies of younger hosts (muggle, witch, or creature such as veela) as a survival mechanism - either full possession aka Essence Transfer, where the host is completely overwritten; personality death and replacement (meaning essentially Daphne, as an example) would become her; Goa'uld-like parasitism (where the host is aware but suppressed) or Tok'ra-like symbiosis (where the host is 'seduced to the Dark Side, so to speak), or where her essence merges into the host, creating (as another example) 'Lavender Plus' (memories, skills, desires, some personality changes, but still Lavender at the core).

I know a few stories have toyed with the concept with Ginny and the Diary horcrux, but on lesser-characters?

It'd put a cruel twist on things if an 'Indi-Harry's' confidant, such as Daphne (commonly-used), was actually not her, but Daphne-possessed or heavily-influenced/twisted.

Another horror bit? Lily was a previous incarnation of this Dark Lady -- either she was 'partnered' with her, forcibly-possessed her (explaining her change in Sixth/Seventh), decided to 'kill' her Lily persona and change her form for a younger identity, or Lily Plus'ed her: she has a vested interest in Harry not only because he's a valuable tool, but also because he's also her son as a 'third parent' type of deal.

Who doesn't love body-horror?

#23:

A crackier version of the above Rouge plot, but this could be merged into it, too.

Instead of Hedwig, Harry gets Rouge the Bat as his postal owl/pet -- specifically, her sassy Sonic X incarnation. And, to her humiliation, not only is she trapped in a frightening world where even teen wizards casually make reality their bitch, she's forced to do the owl job of delivering his mail, too.

Of course she strong-arms her 'owner' into paying her galleons and other trinkets, though.

You can imagine the shenanigans they'd get into with the Goblins, the Philosopher's Stone, etcetera.

There could be some strange magic at play too, allowing only Harry to see, talk, and interact with Rouge as a regular character: everyone else just sees an owl or bat being an owl or bat.

On the plus side, Rouge giving Malfoy a black-eye? What's he gonna say: "Harry Potter's owl beat me up?"

As a sub-plot, we see the owl that would have been bought by Harry; would have been called Hedwig, casually fly around Mobius as... an ordinary-looking yet cunning owl, casually and innocuously foiling Eggman and other villains by doing the right things at the wrong time.

Much to Sonic and co's confusion.

Robotic death machine? Owl passes overhead and poops in an exhaust port. Boom.

Eggman coming to hate an owl more than Sonic would be hilarious.

During the Third Task, Harry answers the Sphinx's question... and then pauses, having a moment of insight.

He asks her a riddle in return, with the stake being that she accompany him if she can't answer it and remain where she was if she could. Overconfident, she says she'll even 'increase his chances' by having a time-limit of a mere thirty seconds.

Harry uses a muggle-originated riddle... and wins. The Sphinx has no clue, much to her complete disbelief.

Thus, when portkeyed, Wormtail suddenly finds himself facing a royally brassed-off sphinx.

#25:

By freak coincidence in the Chamber involving a virgin's presence (not sacrifice!), a bit of soul sacrificed, basilisk blood and venom and phoenix tears, the moon being at the right phase at the right time, and a constipated owl flying over Hogwarts, Harry ascends to lichdom.

As in, Warcraft-style/DnD-style Lichdom.

With Ginny's help, he must keep his new nature secret from everyone in a series of comical misadventures.

--

"Harry," Ginny said, looking him over with disappointment clear on her face, "you haven't been drinking your milk, have you? You need to keep your bones gleaming and strong!"

"But it tastes so horrible!" he protested.

Ginny arched an eyebrow. "You don't like the taste of milk?"\\
--

Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione glanced at one another in confusion; the former wondering when his little sister had become so chummy with Harry, and the latter being utterly baffled why Ginny was suddenly concerned over Harry's calcium intake.

I can just imagine the Graveyard Scene:

---

"No, no, no! /Stay down!/"

Another twitch from the 'twig'; another mound of dirt under a tombstone shifting.

"Damnit!" Harry's skin began to pale at an unnatural rate, the flesh in his cheeks sinking to his bones as he tried to stamp down on the nearest shifting dirt. "Remain - at - your - eternal - rest!"

"Uh, Master?" Wormtail said, taking a step backwards. A hand, bleached white yet covered in worms, erupted from the ground, ensnaring Peter's ankle in a vice-like grip.

He shrieked like a little girl.

"By Vernon's underpants, don't you dare rise out of that gr--" /Creak!/ "Oh, for fucks sake!"

"Hey, Harry?"

"Not now, Cedric--" He blinked. "Oh, for--!"

"I'm... dead, aren't I?"

"...Gin's going to kill me."

#26:

On Harry Potter/Warcraft:

Harry somehow finds himself in Azeroth, and after stumbling around like a fool, encounters various dragons: even when disguised as humanoids, /something/ reacts with his magic and he can't help but hiss at them in legible parseltongue... which, coincidentally, sounds a little off from draconic.

Combined with his highly-magical aura, every dragon that encounters him believe him to be a whelp of their Flight just being rebellious and exploring the world on his own, disguised: they humour him and such, while trying to teach him life-lessons related to their Flight's particular philosophy.

Naturally, he's confused and horrified by their 'orange and blue' lessons.

--

A displaced Harry wanders Kalimdore; older races (such as the various Elves) that encounter him think he's a deity or a demi-god from one of their deities; these misunderstandings lead to hijinks.

--

At the Battle of Mount Hiyal, when the Alliance is desperately trying to hold the line and recruiting the natives from their settlements and merc' camps, Harry and the Shadow Trolls, a subspecies that lives in harmony with the Night Elves, join up.

Harry's use of fiendfyre helps hold the line, even if it does give his allies the chills about how evil it feels.

​

Uh, I think that's long enough for now. I've more scattered around, and if there's any more interest I'll hunt them down and post them up.

Apologies if this all looks spammy. :X

Stay safe from the Virus, guys/girls.

***** Re: your #18. I don't remember if he runs a casino or not, but linkffn(Wizard Kingpin by Odin999) has Vernon run afoul of a bookie who turns out to be a muggleborn wizard, and who takes over a lot of Harry's upbringing.

#+begin_quote
  "We have in our laps a young boy needing guidance, a boy who can influence the entire magical community of Britain." Sarah started to say. "He is the heir of an Ancient and Noble house, one of the oldest in fact. If we play this correctly we have a chance to change the world. If he learns how he could earn favors from all sides of the Wizengamot and change laws to include muggle-borns if he wanted."

  "How exactly can you do this?" Charles asked, though it didn't really involve him he was intrigued by their talk.

  "We teach him everything we know from running numbers to blackmail; the Wizarding World doesn't have anything like bookies, whore house and the like." Sarah said evenly. "You can find a couple of whores if you try but nothing like here."
