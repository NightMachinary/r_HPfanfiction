** I would recommend frombluetored: [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/frombluetored/pseuds/frombluetored/works?fandom_id=136512]]. Hinny Banter is A+ in the first two stories in the Teatime Series. The third story focuses more on the kids (who are now adults).

Glisseo is writing a series where Harry is taking up the Hogwarts DADA post and Ginny just gave birth to Albus: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15813657/chapters/36810339#workskin]]
