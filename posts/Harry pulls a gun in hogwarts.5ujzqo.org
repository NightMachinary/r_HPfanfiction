******* Doesn't want to attract attention, so he acts normal as he had family members die by becoming agents. It all makes sense!

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** It's more about the aftermath of something similar happening in Hogwarts, but it fits the theme of pulling a gun in the Great Hall.

  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

** I don't have a link but there is a story where Harry goes school shooter in Snapes room and everyone is bound to secrecy. The fact that it gets covered up always freaks me out.
