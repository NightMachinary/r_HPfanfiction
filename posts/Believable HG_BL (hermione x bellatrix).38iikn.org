Any tropes welcome - powerful hermione, girl who lived, time travel... must be written well, with either good character dynamics or plot heavy events. Nothing too smutty, I'm really looking for something like delende este in terms of balance between plot and sex. Cheers!


** I can see myself giving out some reddit gold for a good recommendation on this.

I make that bet because I don't think theres anything good out there with this pairing.

** So, it's been a while since I read it, but I vaguely recall enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]]. I don't remember whether it's well written or believable, just general outline of the story.

There's no kidnapping or torture per se, but Bella is quite violent towards Hermione and they are forced to stay together.

Little warning: it hasn't been updated since 2012 and sits at ~290k words. You might want to give it a try, there's so little Bella/Hermione fics you are bound to read it someday anyway.

Edit: My bad about state of updates, must have confused it with another fic.

*** A realistic story of how a xenophobic mass murderer manages to woo a stick-up-her-ass bookworm who is of the group that said murderer murders, and not only that but is about twenty to thirty years younger than her. Oh, and they're both heterosexual to begin with.

Also, there needs to be torture and kidnapping elements to it.

If you can manage to write this story, and have it be believable, and well written, I will believe in god and reincarnation , because there is no way that anyone short of Shakespeare could possibly work this into some sort of working plot.

** I'll bite - I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]] was solid. Well-written and relatively believable, in context (assuming you are willing to accept the very AU premise). It's been a while since I read it, but I remember enjoying it well enough. It doesn't have evil!Bellatrix, but there's a solid plot and lots happening.

** Time Heals All Wounds is a great fic. It has a total of one sex scene in around 50 chapters; it's LONG, so be prepared. The premise is essentially Bellatrix sends Hermione back in time to Bellatrix's own sixth year, before she had really gotten /eevul/.

** There's this awesome fic called ''Impossible'' by PerfectPride in FF.Net and it has: torture, violence and a valid reason to bring these two women together (ancient magic and whatnot) - plus, it's well written.\\
I agree that ''Time Heals All Wounds'' by brightsilverkitty is good as well, but... it takes a different approach. It's kind of sweet, cute, sad and amazing and made me cry - it was a fantastic read.

** So you want a "believable" version of something ridiculously outrageous??

What would that even look like?? I can see at least three problems with this:

- They're both heterosexual
- There is an enormous age difference
- There is the whole muggleborn vs death eater thing.

Any one of these would be a hard sell by itself and would already qualify as unbelievable, to do all three at the same time would just be impossible whilst still giving a fuck about their characters.

  I'm really looking for something like delende este
#+end_quote

"Delenda est" (not "delende este") is not something I would qualify as believable but rather as outrageously AU.
