It seems like in almost every fanfic I read that actively talks about muggles the author either portrays muggles as so much more advanced and that Wizarding Britain is super backwards (‘Did you know they've been to the moon?!') Or they talk about how muggles are uncouth, less intelligent, and completely hostile towards all wizards and witches- a lesser species, really.

Why do so many fanfiction authors go to those two polar opposites instead of a more accurate portrayal of muggles? With that in mind, are there any fics that really go deep into the differences between muggles and wizards, and how their interactions are different in different places, different time periods, and with different people?

Edit: Wait I wrote this at 4 am after finishing a particularly bad fanfic why is this actually getting attention smart people are commenting on my post help

#+end_quote

That's how most wizards in canon see mugles, tbh. Even Mr. Weasley, a muggle enthusiast, talks about them in a "That monkey has done an interesting trick. Fascinating." way instead of a genuine "They're smart and resourceful despite their lack of magic" way.

*Edit*: Even Hermione eventually comes to see them as lesser. She modified the memory of her parents to protect them, but people don't realize how horrific what she did is.

She made them forget their names, their daughter, give up the country where they were born and had lived all their lives, give up their friends and families (Did they have brothers/Sisters/Counsins/Grandparents who wondered what happened what happened when they just disappeared?)... She essentially killed them and replaced them with people that were technically her parents.

And she didn't even talk to them about it, to try to find other options. She just went and uprooted their life, because she's a witch and of course she would know better than the muggles. She violated them.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]] is actually a good interpretation of how they would feel about it.

*** I think the interpretation that she did not give them agency because she is a witch and they muggles is wrong or at least woulf not be my first choice.

It could more easily be read as Hermione not trusting her parents because she did not trust them as people, not as muggles. She thought that their safety (and hers/the wizarding worlds by virtue of her connection to harry) was more important than their agency because she did not trust them to make the right desicion. Not because they were /muggles/ though - because she couldn't trust /anyone/ to make the right choice.

**** I actually think that the film did a good job of showing that Hermione knew how awful that was (I disremember the relevant scene in the book) by muting the colours and showing her disappearing from all their photos, while she stood behind them grim-faced.

It's /normal/ for teenagers to think that they know better than their parents, and not trust them to make the right decisions. And teenagers lack the self-control and ability to compromise (both with themselves and others) that prevents adults who have the power to impose their will on others from doing so and are not as good as adults at coming up with multiple ways of achieving a goal.

********** In my experience with disaster relief*, unfortunately we're pretty fucking hardwired to make any excuse or lie to tell ourselves it's fine to stay home (not like in the corona sense, unfortunately, but in the I won't flee the house/country/get the fuck out of a war zone/disaster zone because this is just a false alarm/media ploy/propaganda and I've worked so hard to establish myself here/the kids like their school and have friends/this is ancestral land and we've held out for so long and made so much of it, it's home...)

So we say ‘It will be ok. It will be fine' and believe we are going to be the exception who get out of it relatively unscathed, and everyone will be ok.

and the Grangers live pretty snugly and comfortably and have clients/patients to see, and muggle London was seeing some effects of the war it was pre-9/11 and so they wouldn't really have had the true danger of extremists in their own backyard to relate it to their own reality.

while I do like the fics where they actually light a fire under themselves and get out, I can see them not doing that too. And as I said, while I am so proud of the teenagers I've seen grow up, it's a fact that they're beautiful little idiots a lot of the time. They get a bit dramatic, and often centre themselves; because they're doing that thing where they're growing into an independent adult. However they aren't there yet, and yet they're ‘so mature now' and they tend to think they know best/that everyone is looking at them/expecting them to excel and get things perfect/that they're the protagonist of the narrative and need to be the hero/etc etc, and so I don't think it's unrealistic that Hermione ‘if you betray the DA you /will/ be permanently maimed' Granger going nuclear and erasing herself from her parent's lives, shipping them to Australia lmao.

Muggles are weaker than wizards. That doesn't mean she considered them unintelligent (at least compared to wizards) or lesser than wizards. What she did was wrong on a moral level, but it isn't that simple. On a purely practical level, she was right. Her parents were at risk. Combine that with Hermione's personality, such as her confidence in her own intellectual superiority, and her actions seem relatively reasonable.

"“Listen,” said Harry. He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. “I know you said after Dumbledore's funeral that you wanted to come with me,” Harry began. “Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. “As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You know, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we're not going back there, I don't think I'd feel right if I didn't have it with ---” “Listen!” said Harry again. “No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We're coming with you. That was decided months ago --- years, really.” “But ---” “Shut up,” Ron advised him. “--- are you sure you've thought this through?” Harry persisted. “Let's see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I've been packing for days, so we're ready to leave at a moment's notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye's whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron's mum's nose. “I've also modified my parents' memories so that they're convinced they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me --- or you, because unfortunately, I've told them quite a bit about you. “Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don't --- well, I think I've cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don't know that they've got a daughter, you see.” Hermione's eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact." -the entire conversation about the subject from Deathly Hallows.

For all we know, they agreed to it, even if I find that unlikely, but it's not like we're given a whole lot of information on Hermione's parents.

Remove the wand and unless the wizard is proficient with wandless spells, which we know to be very difficult, then they're just a normal person. Their only other advantage then would be being able to apparate however most dark wizards or attacks could easily counter that with an ant-disaporation jinx.

It's easier to always have a wand with you than a gun. Even a pistol can't be taken everywhere. There are lots of times and places where a gun simply won't be accessible. If we are being technical, pistols were also banned in England in 1997 so it may have been even more difficult assuming that this also occurred in the HP world.

As well, I'd argue that wands are far more powerful than a wand. It's far more versatile than a gun. There are also a plethora of non-combative things that it can be used for that might be able to protect them, but even in direct combat, it's more versatile than a gun.

*** I don't think that's true at all. Mr. Weasley is just a weeaboo for Muggle stuff. He loves learning more about them, but he doesn't have context for anything he learns, so he gets incomplete pictures.

Hot take: Him not understanding Muggle stuff doesn't make him worse at his job. His job is to track cursed objects and fix them before they get out of hand or hurt Muggles. He is exceptionally knowledgeable in this sphere. His curiosity of how things work isn't necessary at all for his job. He's just interested in a culture that he's not a part of, and is actively trying to learn more about it. The things he's asking about are silly, but he doesn't know that.

Wizards don't treat them like animals - they treat them like foreigners. Some are ignorant and stupid about it, but guess what? We have Brexit and Trump's wall IRL.

Mr. Weasley is too enthusiastic to be completely respectable, but that interest is leagues better than the standoffish indifference of 'ethical pureblood supremacist' fics or the 'all wizards are ignorant savages' of Mugglewanks.

And Hermione Obliviated her parents not because she sees them as lesser, but because she knows they'd be targets if they stayed, and they'd never leave their daughter or allow her to go off to wage war on a genocidal lich. That's good parenting. The problem is that Hermione can't have good parents at the moment.

You're acting like it was her first resort. She probably had it out with them, and only Obliviated them when they refused to allow their daughter to go to war or accept that Harry and Ron needed her.

Uh, what? It absolutely makes him terrible at his job. From canon, he doesn't even know what electricity is. How is he supposed to know how to prevent cursed objects from harming muggles when he doesn't even know what the objects do?

Imagine if a wizard cursed a gun to randomly aim and fire a bullet at bystanders when the trigger is pulled. If Mr. Weasley's response to that hypothetical scenario is "What's a gun? What's a bullet?", then he is 100% incapable.

Just because he is marginally less incompetent than his peers doesn't make him competent. The Head of the "Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Dpt." not knowing the normal use of those 'artifacts' reads like the punchline of a bad joke.

It might not have been so much that they were Muggles as that they were obstacles to what Hermione thought had to be done---and she would have done the same to wizards and witches.

--------------

*Hermione:* ... and that's why you need to go somewhere far away from here --- ideally Australia. I've Charmed these forged papers to appear authentic to any Muggle that examines them.

*Parents:* Thank you so much. But, there are only two sets of documents here.

*Hermione:* Mum, dad, I have to stay. Ha- I can't tell you the details, but it's our only chance to stop Voldemort.

*Parents:* If you're staying, we're staying.

*Hermione:* But you can't! They'll go after you to get to me. I can't protect you!

*Parents:* Yes, and you might hate us for it, but if taking ourselves hostage is the only way to make you leave with us to safety, then we will do it.

*Hermione:* Mum, Dad, I'm sorry...

*Parents:* We are sorry too, but...

*Hermione:* No, not about that. /STUPEFY!/ /STUPEFY!/ So sorry... /CONFABULUS!/ /CONFABULUS!/

** honestly, I think Rowling set us up for this kind of polarity. People who write fan fic do it for a lot of reasons but one of them is reactionary hole-filling, and so when faced with world building that is so eccentric and illogical, it's easy to be like ‘let's bomb the fuckers'

I do enjoy trying to balance it out a little more, but it's really hard building a non-ridiculous take on this one, because Rowling's tone of writing is really quite hyperbolic and gimmicky

I mean when the supposed muggle-loving side is actually not very muggle at all in that they make zero effort to integrate even though they're supposedly hiding in plain sight all over the UK and the world, and we don't see enough of muggles in the canon at all...like why did Ron and Harry never visit the Grangers hi? Ron would LOVE video games and so many things about the muggle world, but he's never exposed to it. instead he's reading comics about the ‘mad muggle'. So you have the not-at-all-normal Dursleys and the boring Dentist Grangers...it's really easy to see how this polarity in tone is formed.

(I will say I've never seen the term ‘muggle wank' but it really is apt for those fics)

as for fics, I find Tea With Mrs Granger by Guardian_Kysra to be really good on this front.

** I think the line is to distinguish between material capabilities vs. other things of worth.

Wizards are /materially/ superior to Muggles. Which is to say, magic can do more than technology can in almost every area, and technology cannot really overcome or circumvent magic. As a result wizards are in general in a materially superior position to their Muggle counterparts.

And that material superiority is key, I think. It's the whole premise of the Potterverse which attracts readers to the world in the first place. The idea of being able to clean your house with a couple of waves of a wand, of being able to travel places in the blink of an eye, of being able to heal broken bones in an instant, etc. All these aspects of material superiority are what give Harry Potter that "I wish I was a wizard" feeling that is the core part of the experience, and which so much of the fantasy genre lacks.

However, material capabilities are not the last word in a comparison of cultures. There are two other aspects which are worthy of discussion: the artistic and the moral.

Artistically (within which I include entertainment) I think it's without a doubt that the Muggle world has the upper hand. The sheer size of the Muggle world, relative to the wizarding world, all but guarantees it. Sure, wizards have some great ideas which are unknown to Muggles (e.g. Quidditch, Fred & George's Daydream Charms which are basically VR in the 90s, which you can really see taking off and becoming huge), but when it comes to literature, music, etc. Muggles have a far greater quantity to choose from. And quantity is its own quality: if, say, 1% of all works produced are great, then Muggles are also going to have far more great works than wizards.

I think Muggle artistic superiority is likely the main avenue by which Muggle ideas end up infiltrating wizarding society - wizards just can't help but consume certain Muggle ideas simply because the wizarding offering is often so much worse.

Morally, things are far more grey, depending on what kind of story you want to write. It's entirely possible to write a wizarding world where their society's injustices are, on proper examination, entirely justified. For example, if wizarding prisoners were so difficult to contain that the choice was between Dementor-run Azkaban or completely uncontainable murderers and rapists, then that would seem to justify Azkaban - or certainly make it a difficult debate.

Similarly, most of the apparent injustices of the wizarding world can be justified with suitable worldbuilding, if that's what you want to do. It doesn't even really require you to go AU, you just have to fill in the many gaps left by canon with appropriate stuff. But equally you can depict the wizarding world as politically and socially unjust and in need of reform.

Personally I think that there's a happy medium on the moral front. To make the wizarding world completely unjust/dystopian is to miss the point that wizarding problems are supposed to be analogous to Muggle ones. But equally, explaining away every apparent injustice in the wizarding world can feel like you're destroying interesting conflict and contrast. So I like to have a wizarding world that is not so much better or worse, morally, than the Muggle world, but simply /different/ - stronger in some areas, weaker in others, and all of it approached with the sensibility of moderation and constructive respect for the source material - building upon canon, not tearing it down.

We have (imperfect as it may) democracies because the leader's power depends on troops loyalty, who eventually still need to rely on the people. Wizards meanwhile have Imperio and Confundus, force amplifier that becomes even worse when their equivalent of high-school drop out can sell mass-produced shielded items because most of the population are hopelessly inept. Thus, gifted & dedicated wizards can force their will even if the system is outwardly democratic. Our judicial system will be a mess if the population is so small that everyone is related with everyone, the accused can claim being imperiused, and even eyewitnesses can be countered with Polyjuice claim.

And that's still talking about the mostly-human population. Giants, veelas, goblins and house elves demonstrate abilities that easily broke our preconceptions about a society composed of a single sapient species with mostly uniform power.

*** Excellent response. Posts complaining about mugglewank sometimes make me uncomfortable with just how much some people are attached to the idea that wizards are /superior/ to muggles. Not even seeing the problems with that. Especially given the social issues with slavery etc that are shown in Canon.

Ignoring social issues though, just from a capability standpoint I don't see why people can't accept that wizards and muggles are just better at different things. Their innovation drives are completely separate. Wizards might develop new spells and potions but when they needed a new way to get students to school, they stole a muggle train, since they didn't have anything like that.

I honestly feel like wizard wank is due to a lack of Sokka's and Suki's in HP. We don't see a normal person kicking as and taking names alongside a powered individual, so some people go full magical superiority, (how many discussions have their been about how a normal person could never take a wizard in a fight, or how a shield charm could completely withstand all muggle weaponry short of nuke?)

Muggle wank is Legend of Korra. Fanfiction writers are normal people. The escapism of fantasy is a great thing, but so is writing what you know and about your own perspective. They don't want a world where people like them are physically, socially, and politically, powerless in the face of people who have power by an accident of birth.

** The biggest thing muggles have is sheer population size.

That effectively means that when it comes to intellectual property, muggle society can produce wayyy more than wizard society. More novels, more music, more research on a huge variety of topics, more engineering and problemsolving, etc.

Wizards have the advantage that magic makes things way easier. They don't need as much engineering talent because enchanting a car to fly is way easier than designing a plane. Wizards also have the ability to research things that muggles can't, like souls.

In most areas wizards are way ahead because magic makes it super easy. But there's a few things that magic doesn't really help much with, and there muggles are ahead. Mathematics, art, philosophy, political science, information science, everything data related. Those things usually involve lots of creative thinking which muggle society has far more capacity for simply because of the much larger population.

** I mean, that is how Rowling wrote the original books. Every non muggleborn or halfblood was completely ignorant of the muggle world. They either looked down on the muggle world (even subconsciously), ignored it or looked at it in childish wonder.

Add to this that nearly every adult in the series was absent at important moments, and/or cartoonishly buffoonish/incompetent when the plot demanded it and it means said characters are practically begging to be ridiculed.

It is also easy to go the other direction and see muggles as lesser. They play virtually no role in the overall plot and we are isolated from muggle society almost completely. They are treated as the other in a ton of fanfics. "Oh those silly muggles are looking into X missing kid? Guess we have to send out Y to go erase their memories again".

So its not surprising that fanfic writers tend to either lean into the purebloods are misunderstood/ right/ muggleborns are ignoring our culture thing. Or they laugh at wizardkind for not knowing that the moon landing happened.

Edit: I think it is also important to realize that a lot of the characters in the story do not act like fully realized rational humans do. They are characters for a children's book series. And that a lot of fanfiction authors are not professional writers. I am not sure why you would expect the average fanfic to make the characters more human and rational than the canon ones are.

In cannon, the head of their misuse of muggle artifacts office was a grossly underqualified pureblood who didn't know what a rubber duck was. Patronizing infatuation with muggle culture is still rooted in a position of pureblood supremacy. If Mr. Weasley peppered the parents of one of his son's school friends with questions about, say, being black, we'd all rightly cringe out of our pants. It's played for laughs because wizards don't exist in real life, but the behavior is frankly still pretty awful, and that's from a "good" wizard.

What we see of Hogwarts pedagogy is atrocious. Britain's wizarding population is minuscule, insular, largely either bigoted or ignorant of muggles, and unapologetically uses slave labor. It's really not a stretch to frame wizarding Britain as backwards and stagnant, but it offers eaqual opportunity to present other wizarding countries in different lights.

I think it becomes mugglewank when wizards are completely incapable of defending against things like guns and bombs, and enchantments shouldn't be easy to mesh with muggle electronics. If our protagonist can take over the magical world with magi-tech and muggle science, then muggleborns would have taken it over ages ago. JK's worldbuilding leaves a lot of holes, but it's up to the fan fic author to fill in the blanks without getting carried away piling up new muggle-derived super powers on their main character.

** I have always liked the idea that there is more to magic than what was shown in the books, both in terms of just Wizarding Europe not interacting much with foreign countries, and there simply being much more to magic than is noted, with Voldemort comparably being a small fry on the international scene, rather than the most powerful Wizard ever as Rowling espouses.

For example, Oriental countries have very distinct folklore and mythology from European countries, so things like magic being practiced in a distinct way there and having distinct magical creatures would make sense, and with Hogwarts declaring itself the best magical school in the world when there is a curse on the defense position and most adults in the country can't even cast a shielding charm... simple ignorance and xenophobia, just look at how students turned on Harry when his parseltongue was revealed, and imagine how it may be prized in places like India. Also, look at how Wizarding Britain only reads the Daily Prophet (there are definitely other magical newspapers in the world than the Daily Prophet and Quibbler), how Luna Lovegood's magical creatures are dismissed, and how World History doesn't seem to be a topic that is remembered, if it is taught at all, given how the teacher focuses on Goblin rebellions.

With this interpretation, you can even do things like fit distinct magic systems such as Magecraft from the Nasuverse in, mixing those in with foreign schools, show the reactions both settings would have to each other when they would normally turn their nose up to each other, and the like. Even without this though, other countries could be more competent than Magical Britain at hiding magic, being more familiar with space agencies like NASA and more intertwined with the muggle world, giving Magical Britain yet another reason to turn their noses up towards those odd cultures.

**** I think its used just because of how amazing it is, and how much it could potentially benefit wizards if they would accept it. Especially since it's fairly Canon supported that wizards both haven't been to the moon, and wouldn't believe that muggles have either.

If Lunar cycles have an effect on spell casting and potion work, how beneficial might having a moon rock to experiment with be? Could fragments of the moon be used to cure Lycanthropy? Who knows?

** Both societies have their advances, its just that the muggles advances are ones of collectivism being driven by resource scarcity, Wizards haven't done half as much in terms of advancing or cool stuff because they Live substantially longer and are from a post scarcity society which removes a lot of incentives to get out of the dark ages. The muggles have a lot of really cool tech but none of it works near magic, or at least needs to be configured to work near magic which no one has put time into doing. In all honesty any time I see muggle wank I always think to myself, hey its the people who complain about how people in star wars don't use slug throwers more. Given that Wizards are basically Jedi/Sith if you squint really hard I'm not surprised that authors have trouble with it. I mean objectively they are better then their muggle counterparts since they have magic, muggles have their charm but they are by definition less. Death eater apologists sometimes are not actual apologists but instead trying to get their point across that the magical beings are simply more, and they don't want to make OCs so you have redeeming or white washing statements from evil characters when in cannon most people didn't seem to think that the death eaters were wrong, just that they went too far. The government was an old boys club of magical elitists who got dethroned and near genocided by a fanatical wing of their own party. I haven't read anything past the original books but thats my thoughts on the matter JK can ret-con things later but if she has I don't know about it.

** The trouble is that the original seven novels did a terrible job of describing the power of magic. We're constantly told how difficult magic is: not only do kids have to be shown wand movements and taught incantations in excruciating detail, but adult witches and wizards tell us how they find certain spells or types of spell difficult.

And all for what? Some of the potions could be useful, but just about everything else is useless or an excuse for laziness.

It's not until the Fantastic Beasts films where we see truly awesome, city-scale magical effects, and the vast majority of fanfic was written before those came out. It's only natural for people before those films to decide that the latest Muggle technology is enough to blow magic out of the water.

If magic had been portrayed that way from the start I suspect the resultant stories would have been very different.

** Far and few fics in between they talk about muggles being incomplete, left bereft of magic far more worse and profound than squibs, like they are inherently missing something. That that complete disconnect with magic is why most wizards don't bother with them, rather than bleating on about superiority. When they are well done, I like them best.

*** I thought that this was the best interpretation of pure blood superiority I've read. Although, in the only fic I saw it in it was proved wrong. It is the pureblood's unwillingness to interact with muggles that enforces this type of thinking. I like to think of it like most biases. It has no real logical reason. They grew up being taught to think a certain way and it promotes an agenda.

**** I wasn't talking about those death eater apologist or even pure blood superiority fics, but the fics that succeed in writing magic as something so completely Other, so awe inspiring, that magic folk quite simply does not know what to do with people that lack it.

In these kind of fics magic folk often remark that they sense something missing or emptiness in high Muggle density areas. Not to be found disgusting but rather disquieting or sad.

These don't necessarily need to be Muggle bashing fics.

I really am bummed out my own cheat sheet on all the HP fics with link disappeared when my computer crashed, because without it I haven't got a snowballs chance in hell of finding these fics.

Once you get past the first 10? Chapters it turns into a really excellent series about wizards realising just how dangerous and scary muggles can be and that they need to do something - in this case it's terraforming a planet and leaving Earth to the muggles.

It's a five part series that's complete

*** As others have mentioned, wizards look at muggles as curiosities, or like how we look at more intelligent monkeys, so maybe something like that, with different spectrums of that behavior across different wizarding families. Muggle families interacting with the Wizarding World with awe, shock, maybe a little fear, but also with curiosity and happiness. I'd like to see more people dive into wizard-muggle relationships, I guess.

**** This does seem like a more reasonable interpretation than what is often show, but I can't say I fully agree.

For example, the pro-muggle concept does make some sense. We can handwave away many of the issues in the magical community because it's a book, but for them, it's all real. Take house-elf treatment. As SPEW gets explored, we see that most elves want to work. They love it. But this doesn't excuse some of the more gratuitous things that occur. Nobody does anything about these incidents even when they see them happen. On a moral level, at least from a muggles perspective (and therefore the writers), the wizarding world is archaic.

This also applies to technology. Wizarding technology isn't nearly as advanced on a technological level. The reason for this is evident and understandable, but it doesn't make it less accurate.

Stuff like this is all around the wizarding world, and so I can see why many muggles may react negatively.

I'm sure people can come up with reasonable justifications for a more anti-muggle stance as well.

With all this said, I do agree on a general level with your thread. I do think many fictions fail to balance both worlds, but I believe there is also a broad range of reasonable takes. For me, it all depends on the world of the fic. The writer's stance needs to consistent with their story, so as long as the history, cultures, and powers justify it, I think it's okay for it to lean in either direction.

**** I don't want to assume that you are advocating for wizards treating muggles like "particularly intelligent monkeys" just that its a Canon accurate way of describing the relationship, which it totally is. Thats how Hagrid, McGonagall, Mr, Weasley, and even Dumbledore think about them when we get their perspectives.

That being said. Fuck That.

If a fic wants to portray wizard/muggle relations like that while actually showing muggles in a larger capacity, then I expect to see the muggles prove to the wizards that they aren't just little Curious Georges with their quaint technology and rubber ducks.
