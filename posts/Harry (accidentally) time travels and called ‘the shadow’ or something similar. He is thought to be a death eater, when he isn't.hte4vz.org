#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

***** Oh sorry, I was just confused, because both those titles had similar amount of words, but the "Harry is missing" is actually the first chapter of the story. I was not familiar with the site. Hahaha
