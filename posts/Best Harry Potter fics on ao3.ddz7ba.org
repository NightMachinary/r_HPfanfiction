I first got interestes in fanfiction on fanfiction.net. For a while I didn't really look for other sites, but (to spare you needless details) then I found ao3. So, I'm looking for your favorite, or perhaps just stories you believe to be exceptional, list of stories on ao3. These are the rules, mostly just because of my mood for fics at the moment. 1. No slash. I'm not homophobic, but I'm not gay myself so I can't bring myself to enjoy slash. Sorry. I guess. 2. No harem. 3. No fem!Harry.

** 4. I don't mind Harry/OC, in fact I enjoy it, but what I don't enjoy is, - Oh, there's this new character. She's way more powerful than anyone else. She saves the day. - you now what I mean?

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.
