So, since leprechauns are a real creature in HP universe why haven't I seen any mention of the mythical pot of gold at the other end of a rainbow. I know that leprechaun gold coins disappear after a little while. But like what happens when you get to the end of a rainbow in the wizarding world? Is there a pot of gold? Do you have to fight a leprechaun to keep the gold? Would you actually get to keep the gold if you fought them and won? So many questions and like no answers.


** A lovely prompt you have here.
