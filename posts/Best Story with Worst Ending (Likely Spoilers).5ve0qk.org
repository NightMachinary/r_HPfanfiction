I just finished a fic that was 99% great. It was engaging, dealt with issues only hinted at in canon in a realistic and thought-provoking way, was multi-layered, and just a real page turner. Adn then in the last paragraph of the entire story, the author decided that aside from Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, everyone else died in the battle of Hogwarts.

It was such an awful ending as to ruin the entire reading experience.

So with that in mind, what fics have you read that were amazing until the author decided to just botch the landing?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]], linkffn(11446957): Grrrr....

But promising fics that have been abandoned are worse.

To be fair, the author said from the very beginning that the story would be filled with overused tropes and clich√©s, and they did good by that promise.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** The Second Wizarding War took a darker turn, and Harry is captured and tortured. An interaction with Bellatrix sends him back in time. Many people like this because it handles the initial aspects of time travel. Bellatrix and Harry are interesting characters to read about. Harry is competent and the plot, up to a certain point is really really good. He teams up with Bellatrix and others to bring down the Dark Lord. Basically the premise is efar would happen if Bellatrix followed Harry instead of Voldemort.

******** Which is a shame because that forward in time could have been the biggest boon for the story. Right when things were starting to go a little too well for Harry, he gets flung forward and now Voldemort has years without Harry's intervention to enact his plans. But that is ok, because Harry has safe houses set up, emergency lockboxes filled with spare wands and neat portkeys, and the gold from two powerful estates.

Part 2 of that story should have been Harry and Bellatrix reviving the Order of the Phoenix and fighting a guerrilla warfare style rebellion against a Voldemort who has won, because there was no boy who lived to disembody him. Instead we get a Harry whose family is fully intact, larger than ever, and the day gets saved without breaking a sweat.

I didn't like it at all that Voldemort was unable to gain any significant power after getting rid of three most powerful figures in Wizarding Politics off the bat. I mean, Old Man Malfoy was pretty damn awesome. If he could be subject to a full-blown attack, I fail to see how a lack of funding could have prevented such an attack on other high-ranking politicians who would oppose Old Voldy.

** linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) is generally beautifully done, but the ending is a bit meh. It's not awful awful, but leaves the reader unsatisfied.

In linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah) the author basically gave up on the story and was kind enough to post an epilogue which is basically an extended synopsis of how it was originally planned to develop the story. I guess we should be thankful for that instead of just plain abandonment, but darn it, I want to read a full story based on that synopsis!

It was, however, quite fresh. For all that you hear about muggles vs wizards, few authors attempt to write such a conflict. I enjoyed reading about it, even though the muggle/wizard war was presented as a bit less important than the Harry/Ginny banging XD. And the last chapter was really contrived.

But, yeah, most of that stuff (one dimensional ultimate evil villains, massive amounts of H/G sex) comes with every story by Brennus. The trick is not to take it too seriously and just enjoy the trainwreck-like ride.

Also, if you haven't done so already, I recommend checking out linkffn(Magical Relations by evansentranced) by the same author. In particular, the first few chapters and parts of fifth year feel very Rowling-esque.

It had so much potential, the worldbuilding was amazing and i was really into the oppressive matriarchal society setup but i just couldn't stand the way the story dealt with prophecy, seers and fate. It felt like everything was already set up and nothing the characters did actually mattered because it was fated to be that way.

I'm not inherently against fate and prophecy; it can work if it's done well, i loved Wheel of Time for example which is pretty much the ultimate 'fuck you' to the idea of free will but it still worked; in Firebird it just never felt right to me, i'm not sure how to explain it better than that.

** Not precisely what you're asking for, but one of the stories that I enjoyed most of, then it fell short of my hopes:

linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) is one that did it for me. While the story isn't perfect, by any means, I really liked the concept and it filled one of the genre's that I enjoy (rebuilding society with members of canon). Unfortunately the stories (because this is really 3-4 short stories tied together by a loose narrative) each hit their stride of world building and then the author appears to have no idea what to do going forward so has that society collapse/get destroyed/etc. and a new one starts.
