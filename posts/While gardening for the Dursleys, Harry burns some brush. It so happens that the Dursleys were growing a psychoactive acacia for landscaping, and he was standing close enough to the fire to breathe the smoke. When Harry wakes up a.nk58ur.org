#+TITLE: While gardening for the Dursleys, Harry burns some brush. It so happens that the Dursleys were growing a psychoactive acacia for landscaping, and he was standing close enough to the fire to breathe the smoke. When Harry wakes up after tripping balls, something is different about his magic.

1. DMT trips, like you can get off psychoactive acacias, are similar enough to near-death experiences that some people think NDEs are caused by endogenous DMT release. Maybe the scarcrux thinks Harry has died and decides to move on to the next great adventure.
2. People often report meeting other thinking entities ("DMT aliens") when on high-dose psychedelic trips. Maybe one of the entities teaches Harry some cool magic that still works when he returns to the real world.
3. People sometimes report lasting sensory differences or changes in baseline mental state after a psychedelic has worked its way out of their system. Maybe Harry develops the ability to see magic that's normally invisible, or a talent for a mental field of magic like occlumency or the visualization part of transfiguration.
4. People who've used psychedelics often seem a bit weird to those who haven't. When Luna Lovegood seems a bit weird, everyone thinks she's seeing the future. Maybe Harry becomes a seer as a result of his experience.


** They say people who use DMT have stories like feeling like they lived in a forest of elves for 20 years when in reality it's been like 10 minutes...imagine Harry learning and mastering a whole new esoteric branch of magic from 5minutes spent passed out by the burning bush

What if Harry's magic gives life to his hallucinations, giving him something like a pseudo-obscurus, a separate symbiotic entity that lives off his magic and that Harry's belief reinforces the existence of, but which isn't driven by self-loathing like a true obscurus/obscurial pair? He winds up with a not-so-imaginary friend that he only vaguely controls, which also has magical powers of its own.

Also, potential Jojo crossover as a way to naturally get a Stand.

*** "Potter, what is that /thing/?!" Snape sneered incredulously.

"Mister Snuffleupagus. He doesn't like being slagged off, either."

"Take your filthy brown mop outside!"

"Well, I tried to warn you."

Snape's eyes went wide as Mister Suffleupagus's mouth opened wider and wider and second Snuffleupagus head emerged, this one with rows upon rows of razor-sharp shark teeth.
