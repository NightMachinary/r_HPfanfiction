So I have been low-key looking for this fic for years and don't have high hopes. It was the first fanfic I ever read. It was originally posted to quizilla probably around 2004-2006ish?Iirc there was some kind of potion accident that linked Hermione Granger's mind to Snape's, so they couldn't help but hear each others thoughts. It seemed to get pretty dark and I think was a fairly long fic. It may have been called something like Twisted Minds. I have no idea if it was ever posted elsewhere.
