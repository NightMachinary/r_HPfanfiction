I just recently realized that there was a pack of werwolf descendants in the forbidden forest and thought it very interesting. I suspect Rowling only thought of them afterwards or had originally discarded the idea. They are said to be beautiful (whatever that means for wolves) and to have near human intelligence. They could be such an interesting plot device/work as characters in a story! But I don't have much hope of them ever having been mentioned?


** There was one fanfic where Bellatrix was a wolf animagus and ran from the law. She went to Hogwarts to steal a wand and restore Voldemort but failed amd went to live with the wolves while slowly losing her human nature. Sirius finds her completely feral and realises that she might be useful after Voldemort's return.

I don't remember the name, only that I dropped it because it completely ignored the Malfoys' faults.

**** It was odd. On one hand it was a believable setup for a Bellamione romance (according to the tags that's where it is heading), and it would have been plausible for Bellatrix to renounce Voldemort after being rescued by Sirius. It had some sweet bonding moments between wolf Bellatrix and Andromeda and Nymphadora. But the entire Malfoy arc felt weird, out of place. I mean, there's a limit to the suspension of disbelief, and redeeming Bellatrix stretches things already. But then making Lucius Malfoy a caring father and Narcissa into a bitch we are still supposed to root for...

That's not canon. In canon we only see her body.

Hell, I find Bellatrix a lot more redeemable than either Malfoy or Snape because she actually faced justice for her crimes while the others lived a life of luxury. And even as a supporter of punitive justice rather than corrective, a decade in Azkaban as it was in canon should be enough for pretty much anyone short of Voldemort, Umbridge and Fudge.

******* It's what Rowling said though, and personally I consider her to be canon... Dolohov killed Remus and Bella killed Tonks.

The problem with her is that she did not exactly go to prison because she repented and confessed, but rather without her cousin's abilities as an animagus she managed to survive on get maniacal loyalty to Voldemort alone. Heck she went to prison because even after he'd disappeared she couldn't accept it and tortured two ppl until the turned insane trying to find out information about how she could get Voldemort back. I'm sorry but I've never seen any redeeming qualities in her, she was just crazy. At least the Malfoys knew to keep their heads down and Snape suffered and died for the right cause (for the wrong reasons but still). Bella and Sirius are really alike, must be the genes. I bet she'd be a dog too if she was an animagus.

******** You misunderstood my point. In canon, neither are redeemable. Malfoys violations of Article 23 of the Hague convention, subsections a, b and f (especially F) would have been his death warrant, even at the hands of the Allies. Coercion and being 16 are not valid defences for attempted murder, treason and terrorism. And Bellatrix crimes are undisputed.

But if you were to write a story where they are to be redeemed, Bellatrix is the far better candidate because she was severely punished for her crimes while the Malfoys, and Snape to a lesser extent) lived a life of luxury. And a believable redemption would require non-canon-compliant changes to their characters either way. Bellatrix, being almost broken by 13 years in Azkaban, would be more believable to have a change of heart. And she atoned with her time served, while the Malfoys drank champagne and ate caviar (so to speak).

That depends on the jurisdiction - however, it's likely that any jurisdiction would have had a harsh sentence for him.

But if we look at post-WW2 Germany we can see that the sentence might have been much lower than you expect. To cherry-pick one person: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Broad][Perry Broad]] was a guard as Ausschwitz, and was found guilty for "Gemeinschaftliche Beihilfe zum gemeinschaftlichen Mord (in 22 FÃ¤llen an mindestens 2.000 Menschen)" (assistance to joint murder (in 22 cases and at least 2,000 humans).

He got four years in a harsher-than-usual prison.

A few of the guards got not much more than a slap on the wrist. For example [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakiv_Palij][Jakiv Palij]] didn't get any punishment, as far as I can tell.

These were not even singular cases, a lot of the Nazis got off relatively easy. And while I don't think it's likely, I can't say that I consider it entirely impossible that the Malfoys got off largely scot-free.

Now, this doesn't have to do much with redeem-ability, but I wanted to bring it up, since you brought up the crimes.

********** On the other hand, you have every German spy and infiltrator who was caught, interrogated, tried and shot within a week. Like I said, violations of 23f (failure to distinct yourself as combatant/using improper uniforms) were really just resolved one way by the Allies, and the Soviets and the Axis didn't even bother with a trial if they captured infiltrators.

*********** I don't disagree, all I'm saying is that there's not "no way" that the Malfoys could have gotten away relatively unpunished.

"Rich Nazi-Supporter profits of Hitler's reign and gets largely away" was sadly not as uncommon as you'd want it, and even people involved directly in the holocaust got away easy-ish.

Again, I'm not saying that the Malfoys get away, and/or that they should not be punished, or are redeemed. I was simply trying to point out that just because of warcrimes, people can still get away and live a life in normal society. I wasn't making any case that they ought to be viewed as redeemed or redeemable - but rather that some monsters, sadly, were in fact viewed as redeemed, despite their crimes and little punishment.

So I'm not really disagreeing with you, I'm just saying that sadly in reality, there would be a chance for some semi-"redemption".

*********** Sorry about that then, I cannot find what I've read and am not sure anymore now that it was all Rowling, because it was a text. It basically said what you quoted, that Snape was not just good or evil, that he made great sacrifices for the greater good, but also that his one true goal was to avenge Lily and honor her memory but did not really care for the lives of the others involved. It might have been a reader's interpretation I guess.
