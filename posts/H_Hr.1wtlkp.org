In light of the recent announcement, what are your favorite Harry / Heromione stories?


** One of my all time favourites is Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic. The development of the characters and their relations with each other is on another level that is rarely seen these days.

** Full Stories:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/The-Time-Meddlers][The Time Meddlers]]: After things have gone terribly in the war, Harry and Hermione decide to travel back in time to stop the war from happening. Things go well at first, until...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5820125/1/Harry-Potter-McGonagall][Harry Potter McGonagall]]: Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6305490/1/Not-So-Muggleborn][Not So Muggleborn]]: What would happen if our favourite bookworm were sorted into the Pureblood-dominated House of Snakes? Here's one possibility... Decidedly AU. Complete. (This one is fun, as are a few of the author's other stories. Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882425/1/More-Than-Familiar][More Than Familiar]] especially, even though it looks like it'll never be finished.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]]: Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. (Author's not joking, he /really/ lets Ron have it in this story. That being said, it was absolutely hilarious, and well worth the read.)

One_Shots:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4151734/1/A-Harmonian-Way-of-Life][A Harmonian Way of Life]]: Tilting the Potterverse onto the path it should have taken post-OotP. Some minor Ron!Bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4973167/1/The-Curse-That-Killed-Thousands][The Curse that Killed Thousands]]: What would have happened if Sirius's appearance in the hospital wing was not received as relatively calmly as in canon? Unashamedly Harry/Hermione H/Hr , but in a family friendly way; Bashing of Dumbledore & cohorts included.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4780695/1/A-Collection-of-Harmonious-OneShots][A Collection of Harmonious One-Shots]]: Some are better than others. Contains various bashing, language, etc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8725665/1/You-Can-Have-Both][You Can Have Both]]: Ron sends Hermione owlpost. Harry sees it, and he and Ron have words. Mentioned Romione, but ends fluffy Harmony. Ron-Bashing, you have been warned. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8828969/1/Wherever-You-Go-There-ll-Be-Love][Wherever You Go, There'll Be Love]]: It starts as a joke: "We should take a vacation, go somewhere sunny when this is over," mostly whispered inside dirty tents and from behind thin blankets. Post-DH.

Authors Worth Mentioning:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][chem prof]] has several stories that are well-written and worth reading, including rewrites of GoF and OotP plus a couple of post-DH stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2758513/Romantic-Silence][Romantic Silence]] writes both multi-chapters and one-shots, and not all of them have happy endings, so be warned. Still, very solid writing, and almost all of them H/Hr.

Honorable mentions go out to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer][broomstick flyer]] whose writing is not the best, but their stories are still fairly entertaining, and almost entirely H/Hr. They're not the best writers, but their creativity is often top notch, so give them a chance if you feel so inclined.

**** Not really, though like Kwan Li's other notable H/Hr story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] (which is complete), it's told in the format of two books stuck together. The first book is done but the second is WIP and rather slowly updating.

You could read up to the end of the first and then wait for the second to be completed if you don't like reading a WIP.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]]

#+begin_quote
  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

Unfortunately it's unfinished and the author hasn't updated in 7 months.

**** Exactly how I feel. I took a break from fanfiction for about 5 years (starting in 2008), and came back a couple months ago hoping to find all the old fics I'd been reading finished.

Nope. Nope. Nope. I've got a gigantic list of bookmarks of unfinished fics, some of them far better than the original novels. Makes me sad man.

**** I've honestly only liked 2 soul bond fics, the rest were all pretty horrible. The first one is obviously Error Of Soul, and the second was Sovran's "Meaning Of One" series.

I've also read /Bonds Of Blood/ and /Harry Potter & Fate's Debt/, but disliked both of them. They felt rushed, and Bonds jumped the shark about halfway through.

The thing is, the soul bond fics I do like, I /really like/. Meaning Of One is probably my favorite romance series out there, despite being unfinished. Do you know any other good ones?

******* You're right in that they are somewhat similar. A Serpent's Sacrifice to me was more complete feeling and epic, but both are great stories. Especially notable is how the Harry/Hermione romance in both is slow-burning and realistic.
