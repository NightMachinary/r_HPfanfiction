Basically the title; Anyone know of stories where the entire population of wizards (or just Harry / MC) abandons the muggles for some separate location, ie. another planet, dimension, plane of existence, Atlantis, some other island, Antarctica.

Preferably no slash, but I don't mind too much.

I also think cell once did a couple short bits on a harry in the 31st century dc, where wizardkind have run out of magic because magic is a resource spread amongst all wizards, and after you hit a certain population density, magic weakens significantly.

*** Just FYI, this post is getting downvoted because FLoM is really, really controversial on this sub. For anyone that doesn't know, the fic started out really really great, but then a few chapters from the end the author lost his mind and turned it into a thinly veiled mechanism to express his own (extremely, extremely racist and sexist) political views. Also, the author is known to be actively hostile to any and all criticism---even the mildest and/or most constructive---and included a truly massive amount of explicit smut in the fic, which a lot of people here don't like to read.

Personally I upvoted this post, because I think you can read the fic in spite of those unfortunate rants in the later chapters and the ANs, but a lot of people here disagree. It's such a shame too, it'd probably be one of my favorite fics if not for the bigotry.

Well, on a serious note, I'll have to actually read the story and see what I think. I'll try to avoid the flaming wars, if possible; as a man who read a comedy novel about the return of Hitler in 21st century Germany ("Look Who's Back" - highly recommended if you want a funny and bold read) and laughed every other page, I think it'll be difficult for me to be personally offended.

******* I think the difference between this work and a comedy novel is that the comedy novel, at least I assume, is poking FUN at Hitler. He's the butt of the joke. I'm a huge Mel Brooks fan personally, and the majority of his work is founded on that exact premise. The movie /Blazing Saddles/ has incredible amounts of racism in it, but the point of the movie is that racists are backwards illogical cretins, not that they're secretly right.

The thing about FLoM that makes the last few chapters really uncomfortable to read is that Harry ISN'T the butt of the joke. He's the one that's always right, and the most logical and sane person in the mind of the author. So when Harry says Muslims are “subhuman knuckle-draggers” (actual quote), or that women are genetically suited to being emotion-driven housewives, and shouldn't rise above their station, it reads as deeply unsettling, rather than funny.

(Especially if they hate religion) The rants late in the fic come about because they (readers) are surprised that racist!Harry that is mentally unbalanced without a moral compas, that progressivly gets worse during the fic "suddenly" become racist enough to trigger people, and the author is extremely baffled that people are suddenly hating on racist! Harry, when he has clearly been racist during the entire fic.

Personally i dont see the issue, even in his prevous naruto fics the MC is hating on all religions. In Flom the religion hating aspect gets worse as the MC slides further and further away from his humanity. Its a clear part of the MC psyche, and well developed, but because he targets Muslims in particular, the author is suddenly a raging racist..

Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
