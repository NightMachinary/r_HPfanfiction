So I have been reading dimension travel and parallel universe fics. While a lot of them have been good and very well written with unique plots. None of them have been perfect. The only way I could possibly find a fic that was perfect is if I wrote it myself. I wouldn't consider myself a very talented writer. In fact I would go as far as to say I'm a bad writer, but hopefully that will improve as I continue updating this. The first chapter is very short and generic but I'm hoping to create something unique. Please give me feedback and be as harsh as possible. Feel free to follow and or favourite if you enjoy it or would like to see whats coming. Thanks. linkffn(12531289)


** A few quick thoughts, 600 words isn't really enough for a chapter. Sure this is a quick intro but there isn't enough. I think the normal length of chapters on popular fics are around 5000 words.

You've set up an AU, one that seems similar to linkffn(9704180) with regards to a violent and war torn past before a world swap. Have you heard of the idea of show don't tell? You've told us Harry is a magical monster and everyone else is dead, we didn't find out, we didn't invest anything emotionally, you just stated it. It feels like you've aimed for an air of mystery but missed the mark and hit confusion. You've dropped references to events but you haven't made me care, especially when I know he's leaving. He seems to be headed to another AU judging by your summary. That will be a huge turn off to a lot of people. It can be done but with every divergence from canon you move further from what people can easily engage with. To read an AU a reader has to engage and commit themselves to learning the differences and thinking about the implications. Having two different AUs means they have a lot to learn and remember. You're going to have to write a very compelling story to get people to invest their time in learning your worlds.

Your summary is weak. There are plenty of threads here about summaries and I'm going to be a terrible person and not tell you how to fix it.

If you enjoy writing keep it up. My biggest advice is when you re-read/check your work ask why a lot. Don't include things that don't need to be there. Does Harry need a sleeping bag charmed to be warm if he has a sleeping bag and a wand, or a trunk big enough he could sleep in or even the skill to transfigure a bed. In a world of magic there are very few limits. How long would it take for him to transfigure a real bed, especially if he's now a master of magic? Do you need to tell us everyone died or will we work it out, will we find out through his actions and experiences? On the other hand you're missing a bunch of detail, where the bloody hell is he, what is it like and how does he feel about it? There's mystery and then there is vagueness and I think finding the balance is an area you've yet to get down perfectly.

Good luck, have fun and I hope that in some way this was helpful.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  After a wounded Harry goes to sleep, he wakes up somewhere else. Where he isn't The Boy Who Lived. Generic at first but hoping to diverge into something unique.

** I read your first chapter and it is mainly filler, and while that may have been your intent, it's not a good start from my perspective. You give background information that could be unfolded within the story itself. You could have left an air of mystery in terms of what happened to Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, keeping the reader guessing, yet you go off and spoil it under 614 words.

Also, I have an issue with what you wrote here on Reddit. You say that you've read a lot of "dimension travel and parallel universe fics" though none of them have been perfect. You apparently are going to rectify this when you say "the only way you could possibly find a fic that was perfect is if you wrote it yourself". However, you then claim that you aren't a talented writer and you keep going by calling yourself a bad one with the hopes to improve. How on earth are you going to pen the "perfect fic" when you make those types of assertions? That doesn't make any sense.

On to your first chapter:

Your setting is off; you take too much time "telling" the reader mindless backstory and in doing that, you give little description of where Harry actually is. I had a hard time imagining the context of the whole thing.

Also, just within your first paragraph, you have an odd sentence structure going on. (e.g. "Once Dumbledore had died, and the Order began dying off. He had no one to rely on.")

Continuing on, does a "bone-breaking curse" even exist per canon?

You're using an old trope with the "expanding trunk," something that isn't very popular with many users on here, just with the fact that it's overused, not part of canon, and is cliche.

Why would Harry have charmed a sleeping to keep warm if it's been inside his trunk? Surely that alone would be enough for it to have been kept warm even without a charm. And if not, Harry placing a charm on the sleeping bag once it had been extracted would have been enough to keep warm.

What does it mean when "they were jumped a flock of death eaters"?

You state "Voldy" in one sentence and the next, you call him "Voldemort."

You then dive into magical cores, which is another over-reliant trope that isn't popular on these boards.

And what does "wizard-king in England" even mean? There's no explanation of that at all...it's just thrown in one of your paragraphs and left alone afterwards.

Finally, you say "genocided"; "genocided" isn't a word.

If I'd take a guess, I'd say you're a first-time writer, which is okay but you can't make claims of drafting the perfect story when this is your first one, unless you're some sort of prodigy. Your first chapter is riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes, while you give the reader way too much information initially, extinguishing any air of mystery you could have created otherwise.

Your first chapter is the "hook"; it should draw the reader in with an original plot and inviting characters. Yours, however, is a summary with little to no setting, along with zero dialogue and most importantly, no hook. There's nothing within your words that attracts my attention.

I don't mean this to be harsh, because I think writing is an important tool, creating a basis of knowledge paired with creativity, and it's exciting to find compelling writers every time I open Reddit or FanFiction. But you need to plan out your story, perhaps get a Beta, and revitalize your first chapter than what you currently have down.

Good luck.

*** Thanks for the feedback. When I meant perfect I meant it would do exactly what I want to happen, not necessarily well written. I'll try my best to fix the first chapter.

** I would change the summary to be slightly more informative, slash/not slash? His family is alive there or not? Is it time travel as well? Write dimensional travel to the description so if people search for it they can come across your fic. Add main characters or pairings to the description.

I don't have much to say for now, other than I don't think it's necessary to show too much of Harry's original timeline, like some one else suggested, maybe you could edit prologue to add some flashbacks. Harry that is a war veteran is a trope so readers can fill in information themselves.

Please, don't use Voldy as nickname for Voldemort, or any other like Moldyshorts or whatever, this is a bad indication for fanfiction. If you want your villain to be scary, give him some respect. The same goes for Dumbledore , no Dumbles or old goat or senile old fool, even if you want to go for manipulative Dumbledore.

Good luck:)
