I've seen fics with manipulative Dumbledores bested by a changed will or a "finite" by Hermione or a well-timed breaking of memory charms. I've seen dark Harry where he comes to school as Darkname Ravenshadow Evildude Riddle and Dumbledore shrugs, or he takes over as king of Slytherin and Dumbledore worries but does nothing to curb his obvious evil.

Are there any fics where Harry has to work harder than "dispel the trackers and head to Gringotts with equally manipulated romantic interest in tow" to escape Dumbledore's manipulations or has to do more than go, "lol, the Malfoys love me and daddy Voldemort made me Lord Slytherin so you can't do anything, so suck it old coot," to neuter Dumbledore's attempts at stopping his evilness? Thank you!


** Now that you mention it, I really want to read fics like this as well. Quite a while ago, I read a (then unfinished, at least) fic where Evil Dumbledore, together with his bestest friend Evil Snape, spent at least a dozen chapters being killed continuously by Harry and friends (who also got super fairy powers along the way). They didn't figure out who was killing them by the time I lost interest and dropped the fic, but the reason they kept being killed so often was because they had Horcruxes. I remember Dumbledore being rather competent in this fic, such as having multiple (even one completely autonomous) ways of resurrection, bound by Unbreakable Oaths to force people to revive him. The setting was more in the light of Riddle rising up as a new Dark Lord (described as a 'Dark Slytherin') and wanting to depose Dumbledore (a 'Dark Ravenclaw') as Britains #1 Dark Lord, but got offed by Harry. Harry and crew are basically complete unknowns in the great game between Riddle and Dumbles, but both are cottoning on rather quick. If anyone knows the name of this fic, please link it as I want to see if it's finished yet.

** An overly manipulative Dumbledore who was also noticeably competent would presumably be very difficult to beat on anything.

*** Which is totally the point. Harry is rarely given any real challenges and the authors are forced to make Dumbledore suddenly act stupid to provide conflict even if he's this master genius manipulator.

**** The problem though, as I've said elsewhere, is that a sufficiently competent Evil Dumbledore is entirely unbeatable by Harry. To have the story work, either the Evil Dumbledore has to make some obvious mistake, or Harry has to be absurdly overpowered.

***** I don't think that's necessarily true. Can Dumbledore be beaten? Yes. Can it be done without major sacrifice, enormous risk and long term plans? No. Can it be done on a whim one summer? Absolutely not. It's basically luck and unpredictability and a lot more luck that would get Harry the win, and even then it could very well be a pyrrhic victory.

****** Well, this /is/ fiction we're talking about. Solutions, even somewhat implausible ones that the author manages to convince you of through skillful writing, are always possible. The point is that it is a harder thing to do and keep the reader from finding the plot implausible. However, a sufficiently good writer can probably pull almost anything off.

******* This is true. I also realized I was thinking of Dumbledore in general. Thinking now, I must change my answer. Alone, Harry could never even start stopping evil/manipulative Dumbledore, I think. And no Sirius's letter to be sent after his death would work either. At the least I think Voldemort or someone of equal power/maneuverability would be the only kind of person to be able to "free" Harry. Keeping him free though is a whole different matter. I don't think Harry could "hide under his nose" once he's free. It would have to turn to straight up Harry/Allies vs Dumbledore guerrilla campaign.

******** Ah, now here you have an interesting notion. A plot in which Harry is cunning but weak and gets Voldemort and Evil!Dumbledore to destroy or at least radically weaken each other might work. The problem would be getting Harry into a position where he would even realize Dumbledore was manipulating him, which would likely need to be either some sort of accident or the result of Dumbledore making a mistake. A rational Evil!Dumbledore might still be too cunning to let anything slip. Perhaps Dumbledore (and Voldemort for that matter) aren't entirely sane --- after all, people who aren't entirely sane make mistakes, and one good reason for being dangerously evil is being somewhat off your rocker. Indeed, perhaps there might be a common cause to all of this.

(/Eureka!/)

And given all of that, I think I've worked through a set of major changes to a plot I've had percolating for years now in my "someday" bucket that I could never get to work before. Perhaps now it really will appear someday.

********* Gratz! I'm writing a fic similar, where Harry pits a not evil Dumbledore and a reasonably sane Voldemort against each other by playing both sides. Of course he's playing his own side too, since he wants to eradicate the parasites that prey on the weak and the weak that don't dare raise a hand against their oppressors (completely ignoring any hypocrisy in the process, mind you).

** I started a highly competent and evil Dumbledore fic once. I may yet finish it, but the key problem was this: in the face of a really competent and evil opponent who has strong access to you and everyone around you, and exists in a world with things like memory alteration and compulsion magic, it's really hard figure out a plot that ends with the teenager with no experience surviving, let alone winning.. I couldn't get over that hurdle to a satisfying ending. I may yet figure out a mechanism to make it work that doesn't involve an inexplicably powered up teenager, but it isn't easy.

*** I'm writing one not with Evil!Dumbledore but dark(ish)!Harry, and he makes a lot of sacrifices. I'm also trying to figure out why Dumbledore doesn't believe the prophecy, knows Harry is a horcrux and doesn't just kill him and say there were no survivors. Because if he does believe in the prophecy, my writing partner and I decides Harry wouldn't be able to sneeze without Dumbledore knowing why.

*** I've got a method for you: Dumbledore recognises that Harry's kinda evil, and takes him on as an evil apprentice. Eventually, as you'd expect, Harry betrays him - except Dumbledore has a failsafe, because he's not incompetent - and then Harry flees as a somewhat trained, but cut off from most of his resources, wannabe evil opponent.

It sounds pretty cliche, because it is, but it avoids the issue of 'I somehow took two years to catch up to an ancient and terrible sorcerer' by making said ancient and terrible sorcerer Harry's mentor.

** I don't know about Dark!Harry, but if you want a truly competent, manipulative, evil Dumbledore, I could recommend the Lightning Speaker series by AntaresTheEighthPleiade.

To reiterate; the Dumbledore in this fic series isn't some disposable hurdle on the way to Harry's twue destiny, he's the main villain of the fic, with ancient prophecies about him and everything.

  Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.
