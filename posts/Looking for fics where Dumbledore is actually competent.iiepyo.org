Like the title said I'm looking for fics were Dumbledore is smart. And please no bashing.


** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/][Aspects]] is a Harry Potter, Worm, Twig, and Pact crossover featuring the protagonists of all four end up in year one of Hogwarts in an alternate universe. Doesn't really require knowledge of any of the crossovers, but it helps.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] and its sequels have Dumbledore taking an active role in the various wizarding wars. This is a crossover with Dresden Files, and Harry is quite OOC, due to growing up with a fallen angel in his head.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane)]] Dumbledore teaches Harry. Harry makes mistakes. 4th year fic. I haven't finished it yet, but it's been pretty good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order][Dear Order]] is a crack fic, but Dumbledore is awesome in it

linkffn(10541297) Harry is Death of the Apocalypse. He needs to find the other riders, and while doing so messes up a lot of things. Dumbledore ends up cleaning up his messes with some awesome fights. Warning: fic is dead.

#+begin_quote
  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book Two finished.
