Not necessarily a fic about a specific Black member like Sirius or Narcissa, but one where the Black family in general is a main character. Maybe the Blacks raise Harry or Sirius becomes Lord Black and he and the family shake up the Wizengamot. Fics where Dorea Black and Charlus Potter are Harry's grandparents and he learns about his history like in linkffn(12155794) are welcome too.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

I'm currently working on a fic that follows Andromeda, Narcissa and Bellatrix from when Andromeda is born right to just past the battle of hogwarts. It's not finished yet but it's already 44,000 words haha
