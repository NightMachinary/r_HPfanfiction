So, what's a fanfic that took a character that you disliked, and tweaked them just enough so that you liked or even loved the new version?

One that springs to mind is Lockhart. Sarah1281 somehow takes the character, and doesn't really change anything about him, but somehow makes him more like-able than most readers find in canon. The only thing that really changes is Harry's view of him. The fanfics in question are /Oh God Not Again/, which is a parody time travel fic, and /When in Doubt, Obliviate/, which has Lockhart abduct Harry before the Dursleys can take him in, and raises him.


** It wasn't one fanfic, and it wasn't a fan fiction per se, at least in written form. But it happened for me gradually with Ron Weasley, coming to a head with the Very Potter musicals.

Let me start my saying I didn't always hate Ron. In the first three books, I was fine with him. He was never my favorite, but he was fine. It was Goblet of Fire were my opinion on Ron started to sour. Just from canon, I thought Harry was a little too quick to forgive Ron after their fight. I realized that Ron's insecurities and jealously were clouding his judgement, but he also knew Harry, and the fact that he was so quick to brush Harry's protests about the danger aside aways bothered me. This moment wasn't the base breaking moment for me, though. That didn't come until Deathly Hallows. But because of DH, when I started reading HP fanfic, I preferred fics that had some Ron bashing in them initially. There were some fics where I could appreciate Ron in a better light, but it wasn't until the Very Potter musicals that my opinion on him changed for the better.

Granted, they are more on the crack-side of things, and it exaggerates a lot of the characters' traits. That said, I think their portrayal of Ron is one of the less extreme changes from canon. I was aware of Ron's canon flaws, to a point where I was hyper-focused on them when reading about him. The musicals reminded me of Ron's strengths as well, though. Seeing how others interpreted him outside of a debate, where I tend to gravitate toward the side I agree with, as well as being able to see him in a more balanced portrayal, with strengths and weaknesses showcased, was crucial to allowing me to see him in a fairer light. He was highly insecure, argumentative, and insensitive, but he was also brave, funny, and fiercely loyal - all of which are canon traits for him as well. Seeing how close Harry and Ron were in the musicals finally made it click how the two were able to stay so close in canon, because I was seeing his characterization through others in a way that pushed my own biases to the side. And it made me realize that part of why I disliked how deeply insecure Ron was was because I had disliked how deeply insecure I was when I was younger, too. Actually, a lot of what I didn't like about Ron stemmed in part from things that happened in my own life, and where that's how Remus became my favorite character, it turned Ron into one of least favorites, if not my least favorite altogether for a time.

While other fan works have also helped me, I've noticed that a good number of fics that I've read where Ron is depicted positively tend to drop some of Ron's worse canon moments (like the fight in GoF, which seems to be pivotal for many when it comes to how they view Ron) altogether. In fact, a lot of those fics also tended to downplay the deep-rooted insecurity he suffers from throughout the entire series, especially after the first couple of years. And I can see how it's so tempting to change Ron's character to be more palatable. But I now think these changes are for the worse, because he loses the depth in his character, something that makes him feel all too real at times. It actually started bothering me when Ron's insecurity was watered down, because that was such an important part of his character and a crucial part of his growth. It's uncomfortable to go to those fights he has with Harry, but that's what makes him coming back so much better.

So, I'm a Ron fan now. And I don't think I would be if it weren't for fan fiction.

*** I completely agree with what you just wrote; it was beautifully put. I had started fanfiction reading RobSt or Dramione fics, and that led to a souring of my viewpoint towards Ron as they only ever focused on the things he did that was wrong and played up many instances that weren't. Then I watched a Very Potter Musical, as well as several discussions about the character, and realized that a lot of it stems from his background and that the camaraderie between Harry and Ron is hard to understand as an outsider. He's full of flaws, but also so much redemption, and it's much harder to write that than to just bash him for the sake of Harmony.

*** I think a lot of people forget that he was /14/ in GoF and even in Deathly Hallows it's a bunch of 17 year-olds putting their lives on the line and also leaving behind everything they knew to do it. I'm not sure what they're expecting out of Ron but he's a kid. You can bet your ass that I wouldn't have left my home, family, comfort, and relative safety to go on a quest against a genocidal maniac when I was 17 because I was a kid. Maturity is a gradual process, and that gradual development tells of Ron being, in my opinion, one of the better characters in canon (see: Mary Sue Hermione).

*** Dumbledore is the character I have the biggest problem with, though all the same I don't hate him.

I can enjoy a bit of bashing towards any of the characters, but there are a lot of fics that took the bashing so far out of the way of the plot that i had to wonder why they were straying so far just for that extra kick at an already dead horse.

I saw one fic that gave Ron the Death Eater a proper, dramatic turn, and it was believably in character, even! (due to something he got punished for early on, he ended up missing out on key information and even missed a few of the canon "we're still friends!" scenes, until he went into a downward spiral, his jealousy becoming uglier due to misinterpreting Harry and Hermione's status as adoptive siblings as Harry stealing his girl, and he and Harry dueled it out, with Ron screaming Crucio... but nothing happens, because despite bearing the Dark Mark, despite seething with jealousy and a sense of impotency, he still loves Hermione, and he still loves Harry.)

Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

** Snape

It didn't happen over one fic, though the main turning point was a single fic, it happened over atleast 20 fics.

I previously disliked Snape acting like Harry was his father and being willfully blind to the truth, it was rather childish in my opinion

The main turning point was actually linkffn(severus snape and the art of war) helped by a few Slytherin!Harry stories where Snape was supportive and not an idiot

Currently I like a good Snily story or if Snape plays a part and is well written then I'm rather likely to read it :)

** I agree that I don't believe a fic can greatly change my opinion of a character in canon of their canon actions. A well written fic may be able to come up with some alternate/additional rationales for why the canon character acted the way they did but I doubt that would change my underlying opinion of that character.

For instance I think canon Snape by his own actions was a petty, evil, bullying man who could not get over his school rival "getting the girl". And with that pettiness he tormented/tortured the son of his rival (who of course was also the son of the woman Snape supposedly loved. So much for that "love" in torturing her child). IMO Snape's actions by the end of the stories did little to redeem him.

But there have been a couple of stories that got me to like their portrayal of an OOC Snape. (Both are Reptilia28 time travel fics). One story had the Dark Mark being an evil overlay that forces you to take/act on your more negative emotions. This story had the one of the characters find a way to remove Snape's Dark mark and then have him change his attitude. (Changes his appearance, gets a second job doing what he loves (eg developing and brewing potions), and even finds a woman for him).

The fic is The Eighth Time is the Charm by madie080802

linkffn(13012483)

The other story completely changes Snape's entire interactions with the other Marauders including allowing Snape to change part of his own family background (in particular not losing his mother due to an abusive husband, and not joining the death eaters).

Reboot by Kallanit

linkffn(9552519)

So bottom line while fics can get me to like a canon character who is OOC, I do not believe they get me to change my opinion of a canon character and his canon actions.

** Fanfiction has definitely given me opinions about minor characters when before I'm sure I never had an opinion about them. It made me think and care about characters like Oliver Wood, Percy Weasley, and Lavender Brown when before I really wouldn't have paid attention to them. I'm sure fanfiction colors characters differently based on the writer's intent, but I've always been good at separating canon from not (example: I love fanfiction Snape, but canon Snape is awful).

**** Coming from a Dumbledore supporter I've always seen him as a distant grandfatherly influence doing what he believed best for the wizarding world.

Don't get me wrong, he did some messed up things. Worst of all, excusing obvious child abuse.

In canon alone, I liked him well enough. But every now and then I'll find a fic where Dumbles shows remorse for his actions. And my heart grows a little fonder each time.

But to each their own. I totally understand why others would see him in less than a spectacular light.

** Honestly, it was Snape. Ever since I first read the books I had conflicted feelings about Snape. At age 12 I thought since Harry named his son Albus Severus that Snape was cool. Then, I thought it was a horrible decision and I hated Snape. Then, I started to not like Dumbledore. Now, I read a lot of fanfics and I love reading Snape as a snarky, asshole, good guy. I know he's deeply flawed in canon, but some portrayls of him are just amazing in fanfic (and in canon).

I've learned that I would most likely hate Snape if he was my professor - unless I was on his good side, but as a gryffindor that's doubtful - and I would probably want to throat punch him. But, if I was an adult in canon and roughly his age I would probably really like Snape and just get frustrated at his hatefulness. Snape as a character is just so amazing because he is morally gray. I don't want villains that are supermcevilasshole or heroes that are powerful-sacrificial-bad-decision-makers, I want to argue with people about a character's motives!

** The Sinister Man's /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) ) on Umbridge.

While I had disdained bashing before coming across PoS, I obliviously disregarded fanon portrayal of hate sinks---I implicitly didn't consider them worthy of notice or depth. Why bother to put in the effort on them when the author themself didn't? But, as is his modus operandi, The Sinister Man went above and beyond, constructing an intrepid, underdog Dolores that readers find themselves (or at least I find myself) compelled to root for while still being cognizant that her character's trajectory could very well lead to playing a nearly-identical role to her canon counterpart.

Though even back then I believed that fanfiction can add value to a work and its fandom, I'd always though of that as an external, additive thing: a fanfic writer bringing in external ideas, concepts, techniques, &c to replace, modify, clarify, &c parts of the fabric of canon in order to create something of their own. And while there's nothing intrinsically wrong with all those, I didn't see how a fanfic writer could /reconstruct/ elements of canon (or fanon) from the ground up as a creative and storytelling tool. TSM's doing so with Umbridge showed me how that could be done even in the oddest or seemingly trivial of places and the worth of doing so.

tl;dr, even characters the original author bashes themselves (and other aspects of the story they may well have not cared about) are worth examining and utilizing.

** Fanfic changed my opinion of Harry. It made me see cannon hp as a Normal Child TM that just wants to chill somewhere and not be bugged. I never really appreciated that facet of Harry's character until I read through the extremes of fanfiction.

In the beginning, I read a lot of OP / smarter / darker Harry fics. Harry was never my favorite character. He was just the protagonist. I didn't really HAVE a favorite character. The fics made me crave a more powerful version of him in cannon. But as I kept reading, powerful!Harry became exhausted and then I ran into the other extreme of the fandom with “beam of light”/“angelic”/Harry that could solve all the wizarding worlds' problems with his sheer force of will and bright disposition. Both AUs and interpretations have fantastic fics and writers.

In the end, that broad survey of fanfiction and exploration of Harry P's alternative characteristics made me more fond of cannon Harry. I never LOVED his character but I appreciate the nuances and willingness to make Harry normal a hell of a lot more now.

*** Perhaps if we were able to make judgments on a purely objective level, I would definitely agree, but that isn't the case. Personal biases impact how we perceive things and how we feel about others on some level, even if we try to counteract them or rationalize them. This is certainly true for character interpretations, as many of the major characters in the series have a wide range of depictions within the fandom. Even when using canon as the main bases for interpretation and dropping popular fandom exaggerations, figures like Dumbledore, Snape, and Ron are still so polarizing because of different perceptions based off of canon. Some will always argue that Dumbledore is nothing but a manipulative chess-master using the people around him as human pawns without regard for their feelings, or that Ron is an awful friend who wasn't there when it mattered.

Since a fic by someone else would remove a reader's own biases on how they are written, it's actually possible that something could change someone's opinion on a character without the character exhibiting extremely OOC behavior, as you claim. I'm not trying to claim that fics aren't guilty of widely OOC portrayals, because they often are, but just stating that this isn't always the case, because it isn't.

You make a very valid point. Personal bias exists, and it is almost impossible to get rid of it. However, one's opinion changing because of a fanfiction is a clear indication of either OOC behaviour (as I originally stated) or replacement of our own bias with the author's bias.

After all, authors themselves are human, and are not capable of viewing events in a purely objective manner.

I simply feel that while it is wise to take others opinions in view, your own beliefs are based upon what you have experienced.

A purely objective fic which displays a character's canon compliant thoughts sounds like a wonderful chance to have a fresh perspective of what we already know, but it is also not really possible. In some ways, even J.K.R. is incapable of being completely unbiased.

As far as just taking others' opinions in view, I'll agree there. I'm actually quite weary of those too easily swayed by the beliefs of others. But knowing how I used to be an extreme opposite for a while, I've since learned that there are times when others can help me see when my own flaws and biases are clouding my perception of things. That's more of a general point than with fan fiction, though it has happened a few times where it's happened in fanfic for me.

It definitely isn't, but it does sound nice. Though I would say that's putting it nicely about J.K., even recent Twitter comments aside.

What's weird is that you seem to disagree with it aswell, even if it is indirectly stated: In your comment below you say "My own opinion has changed */slightly/* for some characters, but it has shifted to a more neutral view. "

A fic doesn't have to completely replace your previous bias with the author's. It can also show you a new side of a character, something that will allow you to form a slightly more objective view, present you with an interpretation of canon you hadn't thought of before.

*** Nope. I disagree. If you see *good* perspective changes, it can change your view.

Remember the trio's plan to:\\
1. Explode a potion and burn people to cause a panic so they can steal ingredients

1. Kidnap 3 people from Slytherin, throw them into a dark closet*, and impersonate them

2. Invade the Slytherin's privacy and gain the ability to go into their common room whenever (even if you won't use it for bad)

It seemed perfectly alright to the trio, didn't it?

Now imagine it from Blaise Zabini's point of view. Yes, he's a bigot, but he's human and although you still may dislike Blaise for being a bigot, you'll suddenly see that the trio were being huge self righteous asses.

I've changed and added a few details, but only because Blaise is mostly OC, we can only speculate what actually happened, and Blaise may not have actually find out who did it. But this could actually be cannon, or quite close to cannon.

Imagine you're Blaise.

One day, in potions class, suddenly, a loud bang happens and you and your friends are covered in hot burning potion. You shield your friend Pansy from most of it by instinct, and your skin burns with excruciating pain. Your ears are ringing and you scream.

From the pain, you don't notice the trio stealing ingredients. You go to the hospital wing, dazed by the accident.

A few weeks later, Crabbe and Goyle suddenly begin acting strangely. After that, you find them on the floor with their robes taken. They tell their story. They give vague descriptions of their attackers, but too vague to find them out.

You are furious. Your friends have been targetted by someone unknown - but who?

You manage to figure out that the prior potions accident must have occured to steal ingredients, for the polyjuice potion. Lucky that you sneakily read that dark tome from your mom's library.

From the clues, and asking around, you find the identity's of the attacker. You are absolutely shaking with anger! THEY'LL PAY. THE SCARHEAD, MUDBLOOD, AND BLOOD TRAITOR WILL PAY!

Your freind, Theodore, manages to hold you back from attacking the trio in a fit of rage. Theo knows that the trio is able to get away with anything for having harry potter on their side, and being Gyrfindors. Theo knows that attacking them will only lead to Blaise being expelled, and he doesn't want that for his friend.

You know that too, but in that moment you didn't, couldn't care!

From then on, you see what your mother meant. Potter really was the wrong kind of person, he truly didn't deserve any respect. From that day on you truly hated him.

** Never really hated any characters (besides Umbridge, but that's a given), but reading stories that bashed Dumbledore or the Weasleys ironically only made me appreciate them more.

The first time I read a story that had Dumbledore bashing I was so confused by the inexplicable “revelation” that he was the bad guy that I went back to canon to try and understand where the writer might be coming from and whether I'd completely missed something in the books. I had not, and over time I began seeing the pattern in the kinds of fics that bashed characters that were undoubtedly good in canon. They all relied on the presence of elements that didn't exist in the books to justify the characters being suddenly evil, such as another powerful figure who could oppose Voldemort and protect Harry, or a different love interest besides Ginny.

I suppose the original fics that started the trend were novel for the surprise twists, if nothing else, but even the better written versions which twisted canon imperfections out of proportion rather than relying on new additions seemed laughably ridiculous to me in how far they had to reach to make the good guys look bad. More often than not, there was no attempt at nuance, all of the good traits that might make the bashed characters redeemable in any way were just tossed out the window and Dumbledore and the Weasleys were made into wholesale villains. It all just seemed like bad writing with no thought behind it other than perhaps a desire to project the author's negative experiences with real life people onto characters that filled a similar role in Harry's story regardless of whether there was any resemblance or not.

I've always preferred fanfics that hew more closely to canon, but I do enjoy AUs that have well-nuanced characters. Seeing the myriad stories that reduce Dumbledore or the Weasleys to caricatures on the level of the Dursleys only made me appreciate the amount of detail and care that went into fleshing them out in canon.

Made me enjoy a decent post-war portrayal of Draco and Dramione.

Then I binged lots of other stories in this genre and it brought me all 360 degrees back to hating him and his portrayal in Draco sympathetic fanfic.

So in conclusion, my opinion got flipped and then re-flipped after a few months. Though I couldn't name a single particular fic for the second flip, just a general sense of revulsion and 'ugh'.

** Probably Tom Riddle/Voldemort, haha. I mean, it's been a while since I've read canon, so maybe my opinion would just be changed right back again, but the fics that sort of really highlight that he was abandoned at an orphanage, he wasn't enough for his mother to stick around for (she was heartbroken about being left by the person she'd statutorily raped), he grew up during WWII and the blitz, grew up lacking in probably basic necessities so of course he'd turn to thievery, any accidental magic would probably have marked him as needing an exorcism back in those days, haha, but most importantly he grew up never knowing any form of LOVE. Which is psychologically what triggers sociopathy/psychopathy anyway (you can have the genetic disposition for it, but have it NOT be triggered). So yeah, just gave me a lot of empathy and a desire for him to be saved or shown something other than Dumbledore setting his only possessions on fire.

For those of you who've seen Cursed Child, the playbook you can buy on the night actually has a good part on comparing Tom Riddle to Harry Potter and how J. K. Rowling says the difference between the two orphans is that Harry knew true love for fifteen months of his life. So I think Rowling probably shares some of the empathy it took fanfiction for me to cultivate lol. It's probably why she started the charity 'Lumos' to get kids out of orphanages.

... That's a ridiculous statement. He wouldn't even /remember/ those fifteen months. So much for the idea that it's our choices that show who we truly are, if environmental factors in the first year are the real difference between heroes and omnicidal maniacs.

** I learned to dislike Ginny over the span of multiple fanfic. I didn't feel one way or another about her during the books, she was Harry's love interest but I wasn't in the books for the love so I didn't care. She wasn't in the forefront enough for me to have any big opinions.

When I started reading fanfiction I gravitated to what I knew from canon. So I read Harry/Ginny fics. The problem? The Hermione vs. Ginny thing was big, so a lot of fic I read went out of there way to insist that Ginny was this amazing person that was meant for Harry and only she could understand him. And it annoyed the me enough that I actively began to dislike her.

I feel the same about Severitus fics. I like reading a Snape gets to appreciate Harry for who he is fic without the Snape wank or adoption. But I already saw Snape as a dick that was on the good side going into fanfiction and that hasn't changed.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
