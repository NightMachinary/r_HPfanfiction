I'm looking for fics that make you say, "Damn, that was cool." Maybe the culmination of a long anticipated battle or a truly impressive work of magic? Or even just a really well written scene.

Any suggestions appreciated.


** The insanity that is all of the battles in linkffn(Return of the Marauders)

The "Battle" of Kashyyyk in linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) Harry single-handedly /annihilates/ an invasion force with a single spell.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
