I read this story a few years ago on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I think it's been taken down. I was planning on searching for it on [[https://fictionhunt.com][fictionhunt.com]].

The story takes place after the Final Battle. Dumbledore and Snape are both still alive. Remus was never with Tonks and goes back to Hogwarts to teach. The school has been opened to students from all over the world and Remus forms a friendship with an American female student named Whiskey. It starts off as just platonic but as the story goes on it becomes more flirtatious (I remember she was about 19 years old). She finds out he's a werewolf and they encounter a lethifold in the shrieking shack. The finally kiss in the last chapter.

I remember a lot about the story (if I am remembering correctly) and I really loved it. If anybody can tell me the name of it I would be very appreciative.

Thank you.
