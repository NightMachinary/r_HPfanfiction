On [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] there's post about Neville someone mentioned that Snape is so harsh on Neville as Neville represented what could have been, if Voldemort's choice had been Neville Lily would have stayed alive.

With this in mind and the fact that Neville's greatest fear as shown in PoA was Snape. I think there is an excellent dialogue that could be had here.

Snape should be his usual, clinical and venomous self but I would imagine no matter how thick skinned you are finding out a child fears you more than say death should be a pretty ego damaging moment.

Can be pre or post epilogue.

Neville's strength/resilience should be acknowledged.

Bonus points if it's as a result of Snape hearing about Lupin's bogart class.
