No slash, romance, angst, hurt/comfort or twilight shit for that matter. Vampires and demons should be brutal, evil, blood/soul sucking monsters.

But not turning it into a complete godlike or powerfull Harry fic, where he defeats everybody with ease when he is only 12 years old and gets mad at Dumbledore cause he manipulated him and stuff, and gets all dem ladies, and of course without the bashing.

Also, I'd be interested in a story or two where Harry has to serve the Fae from the Dresden universe, or some other entity.

  Abandonned by his guardians, Harry Potter vanished from existence. Years later, a young man graduates from one of the most elitist and secrete Magical schools and makes his way through Magical societies. Fate or Fatality? Ancient Greeks called it Anarkia.

** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and the rest of the Denarian Trilogy are the closest I can think of, if you haven't read it. Harry is a Denarian from Dresden Files, though it doesn't really cross very much with the rest of Dresden Files, other than the Fae being in it.
