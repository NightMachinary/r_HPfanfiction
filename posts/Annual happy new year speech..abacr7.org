As some of you may remember, I do this post every single year, I like to wish you all the best of the best in your endeavors next year, whatever they may be. This community is great, normally I do not have anyone to speak about fanfics with IRL, which is incredibly frustrating when you take into account how much of a time-consuming hobby this can be.

The fact that this community exists and that is so active is really great, I´ve enjoyed your recommendations, your own fics and your enthusiasm for the hp universe. I would also like to say thanks to [[/u/the-phony-pony][u/the-phony-pony]] for the incredible job he/she (?) has done so far with the wiki and the book club.

I hope you enjoy this night, be it with friends, family or even alone. You all are the blood of a great community and It's an honor to be part of it with you all.

​

Wishing you the best always,

Zantroy <3

** How many subreddits have you been banned from and how many alternative accounts do you have? I ask this because ur account is 4 yr old and I have managed to get myself banned from 2 subs in less than a year already.

**** I've gotten banned from [[/r/relationships]] three years ago because I disagreed with the mainstream advice of "cut that person out of your life", which seems to be the only advice you get there.

Bans can be very arbitrary, not that it is usually a great loss.
