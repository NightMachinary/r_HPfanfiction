:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi there! This is my first time doing this, so I apologize if I'm somehow doing it wrong, hehe.

I read a fic a while back that had Harry as a child find a house (I think in Privet Drive?) that seemed to be magical. I believe it occasionally had books and things for learning about magic appear in it, the most memorable one being a toy cauldron that had plush toy versions of ingredients, so that Harry could put in different combinations of the toy ingredients and learn what potion they made. I also believe the fic had Severitus in it?

I know there's not a lot to go on, but if anybody can find/remember this fic, I'd be so grateful!


** I don't know what that fanfic is, but I just have to say, that toy cauldron sounds like a brilliant magical educational toy.
