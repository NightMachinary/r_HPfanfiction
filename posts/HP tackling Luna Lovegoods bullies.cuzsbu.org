  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

Harry discovers that quite a few of the Ravenclaws pick on Luna, including the entirety of the Quidditch Team and the next match he's playing just happens to be Gryffindor/Ravenclaw...

One round of /faking-the-Bludgers-and-daredevil-flying/ later, the game has gone down in history as The Match Of The Raining Ravenclaws...
