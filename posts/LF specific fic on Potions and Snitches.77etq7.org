Read this story quite a few years ago but it wasn't finished at the time and I lost it before they could finish.

Harry runs away from the Dursleys with a broken arm and is found by someone and taken to a care home/orphanage where he is adopted by a very nice lady he take to calling mom (i believe he does anyways).

Harry is a metamophagus and when he goes off on his own to play he takes on an appearance that could very well be his new mums biological son. Meets Severus under this guise to I guess sees Harry performing accidental magic and mentors him (could be he doesnt know that Harry has magic and is just being a nice person? ). Until Harry shows him his Hogwarts letter and Snape realises who hes been spending so much time with and is FURIOUS.

Scenes I remember is new Mum has a boyfriend who doesnt treat Harry well because jealousy and when new Mum finds out dumps him.

Harry and new Grandpa are at a toy store and run into the Dursleys and Harry panics and changes to his alternate appearance before the Dursleys can see him but new Granpa sees him and they talk about just WHAT Harry can do.

Harry goes by different name when in his alternate appearance (I believe Evan but could be wrong)

Can anyone help me find this fic? I've been searching for ages and I know I read it on Potions and Snitches and would very much like to see what happens after Harry goes to Hogwarts.
