** My only gripe is that from the titles it seems episodic, I can't speak for everyone but I prefer and overarching plot rather than many small ones, chapters could bleed over to each other. All of seems to happening a bit to fast while filler is discouraged, you could use these chapters to develop your characters, put an interesting spin on them. Your stories probably great and i would read it. Just one final note make yours different, I'm sick of all the tropes and similarities which may as well be copy paste.

*** That is fine criticism. I do not intend to be very fast. Chapters will be long enough and smoothly develop into the next chapters. I have based it on the fact that when times are indeed good, time kind of moves fast as Harry notices this in the books.
