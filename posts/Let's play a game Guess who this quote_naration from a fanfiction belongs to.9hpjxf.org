**** Is that the person, or the name of a fic? Because I got this game wrong apparently - like most people here - but someone guessed the fic. Dunno if you are talking about Harry, though.

***** Person, or persons...it's a little unclear as to which....from the Seventh Horcrux. Tbh, Harry Evans-Verres-Potter is fairly similar to Horcrux Harry in a lot of ways!

***** Oh wow wouldn't have guessed HPMOR, haha

I really like Seventh Horcrux :)

It's basically crack, so don't go with the expectation of taking it seriously or it might ruin the experience. But yeah, I recommend it! It's high quality trash humor, from what I remember. I loved it.

****** YESH, I LOVE CRACKY FICS. I have been searching everywhere for them. I love a good laugh. Beside I don't take anything seriously, even if I didn't like it, I will just read the next one, you know.

OH come on. This is like my favourite part in that chapter. I laughed so hard. There was also the part where Harry was getting his robes. Lol, not spoiling, in case someone reads this. But i laughed so hard that I actually cried.

Not much of a hint - I will only give three hints though! This is the first one. The second will be the sentence after.
