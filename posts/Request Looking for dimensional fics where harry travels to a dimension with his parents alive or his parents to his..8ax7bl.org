** Shaydrall's The Merging has this at one point in his story, but it's not the main component of the Fic and eventually Harry goes back to his normal dimension. Regardless it's an amazing story and one I recommend.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.

** Strange Reflections, linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin), is about an alternate Potter family being transported to a near-canon Harry's universe. They're kinda dicks, though, with alt-Harry and alt-James being complete dicks, alt-Lily not being given anywhere near enough time to be given a personality, and the sister ends up ditching them to stay with Harry.

The Merging, linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall), has a brief section (2-3 chapters, I believe) where Harry is sent to an alternate universe where Neville is the BWL and is introduced to his alternate family by crucio-ing a Death Eater who was crucio-ing alt-Lily. Unfortunately, though understandably, he rather quickly goes back to his universe.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
