Looking fore some fics where Harry is blind from childhood or becomes blind throughout the story.

I just had a thought how would a story look like if the scar due to the killing curse was not on his forehead, but over his eyes, which made him blind from 1,5 yo, and it wouldn't be fixible. How would Harry navigate his life at the Dursleys and eventually in Hogwarts. Thinking of writing that, so I'd like to see if it already exists and how did other authors approach this topic.


** Blindness by AngelaStarCat sounds like the kind of thing you're looking for ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]])

From memory, he still 'sees' magic as colours, but it's been a good while since I read it!

*** Thank you! I'm sure I'll love it, the start is just fabulous. Petunia raising Harry like her own son for him not being perfect to fit in the Wizarding world, that's the vibe I'm here for! ♡

Look up Basilisk Eyes. It goes in-depth and is awesome.

There aren't many, not really, Basilisk Eyes (already recommended) portrays the disability well. But it's so slow and focused on the various disabilities of the characters, that it's a slog to go through.

This one Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor linkffn(6554218) is way more concise and written with true understanding of what blindness would entail. It's not great, it aged a bit and it lacks knowledge of canon, but as far as a blind character portrayal, I think it's best.

  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.

*** And from the very first paragraph of that story - "Thanks to the other authors who have written blind!harry fanfics, especially Katling with Harry Potter and the Guild of the Night, xyvortex/Taylor1991 with Blind Faith and pottermalfoy24 with As a Bat."

Haven't checked if any of those are still around.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  If blindness wasn't enough for Ariadne Granger to deal with upon attending Hogwarts, being the transgender Girl Who Lived didn't help matters.Blind trans girl Harry Potter fic to spite JK Rowling's TERF ass. Starts before Ariadne has even figured out she's a girl and before she is rescued from the Dursleys.Since this fic is gonna be quite long, I'm adding a key here. Note, some things might lack context if you skip.Chapters 1-6: Pre-Philosopher's Stone.Chapters 7-33: Philosopher's Stone. Minimal plot divergence.Chapters 34-75: Chamber of Secrets. Moderate plot divergence.Chapters 76-109: Prisoner of Azkaban. Major plot divergence.Chapters 110-148: Goblet of Fire. Major plot divergence.Chapters 149-Current: Order of the Phoenix.
