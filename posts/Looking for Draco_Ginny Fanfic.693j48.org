Hi, I remember reading a Draco/Ginny fanfic years ago, where the characters are all older. I think Draco ended up being on the 'good' side and so was friends with Ron/Harry etc. Him and Ginny had a bit of a past during the war and in current times she was dating Colin C, even though her and Draco clearly had chemistry. There was also a sub-plot with Ron being away but him and Hermione getting back together and Harry helping Pansy P and getting in to a relationship. I have a horrible feeling it was on Portkey.org and therefore may be lost forever, but would be great if anyone knows if its stored elsewhere or could share a copy!


** I don't know about that fic, but if it was on portkey here is an unofficial archive [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/]]

*** Thank you so much - I remembered today it was either portkey or checkmated. Do you know if there's an archive for the checkmated site?

** Wasn't there a Ginny/Draco fic where she ends up sorted into Slytherin and becomes a rival of Harry in Quidditch? I only remember it because there was fan art associated with it of a NSFW nature where Draco was with Ginny in the Quidditch locker room after a match and there had been a long thread on Reddit discussing the art since it got deleted off the FF host site.
