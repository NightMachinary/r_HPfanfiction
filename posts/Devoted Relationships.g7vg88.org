To clarify, I'm looking for fics that feature extreme level of devotion between members of the main cast. Not necessarily romantic either.

I would not consider the golden Trios relationship sufficient, i'm looking for Bella/Volde type of relation atleast

Soulbonding forcing it is fine as a plot device

Protagonist being tortured and broken and later saved, leading to either type of devotion is fine as well (although I don't care to read the actual torture)

Nonreciproated is also fine. Just no angst. I want utter certainty, unshakeable trust from the devoted side.

Lastly, the longer, the better, appropriately well written, etc. etc.

But no oneshots.

Previous request threads are fine too, reddit search is eh.

Thanks everyone.


** Chapter 25 of The Mind Arts has this. Really weird stuff.

*** This looks great although your "really weird stuff" and the mindrape warning of the fic itself worries me a bit.

Does this fic feature explicit rape scenes ? I don't mind mindstuff, but I cannot read physical rape. Often that isnt mentioned as a warning and I really can't physical rape.

Thanks for the rec

**** No physical rape, and the mind stuff is generally alluded to, not explicitly stated. It's actually a pretty good fic, but this chapter (25) got freaky with the 'master' stuff and the author abandoned it after chapter 26. It's a good read.
