That line at Madam Malkins where he tells Harry he'd just leave if he was sorted into Hufflepuff made me wonder if anyone has written a fic where that actually happened to him. Could be serious or cracky, I'd love to check any out if they exist.


** There was a fic in which the Weasley Twins either Confounded or potioned the Sorting Hat so that it sorted everyone in Harry's year pretty much at random. It was hilarious, and I think it was posted on LiveJournal by someone whose nick was something including "Corvidae". I can't remember the title either.

Harry and Draco were in Hufflepuff, Hermione and Neville in Slytherin, Pansy and Ron in Ravenclaw, and I forgot who went to Gryffindor.

Does anyone remember?

*** Yes - in the (sadly unfinished) sequels “Laocoon's Children”. If I remember rightly Harry thinks Draco is “a bit wet” when he first meets him!

  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.
