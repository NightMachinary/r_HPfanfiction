What is the most interesting take on the whole hallows/becoming the master of death/being the master of death that you have read? Or just your own head canon about it My favourite is from linkffn(death is lighter than a feather) where the mod is a world traveller and the hallows all have some level of sentience and personalities


** Headcanon? It means nothing. It just means that Harry accepted that death was there, and you can't outrun it - and symbolically that's what the tale was about.

I'm not a fan of the title giving anything in terms of special powers or abilities. It's just... I don't know, it doesn't fit the setting well IMO, and the Hallows just seem like powerful enchanted objects to me - not literal artifacts of death. I don't mind making the Hallows more special, but in the end I like them being just artifacts made by humans.

The exception I have is when having 'Master of Death' is just used as an establishment point for the fic - eg, meeting death and bargaining the Hallows/status away to explain Harry getting a time travel attempt, and there mostly because it's cliche/funny.

I've yet to find a fic that was enhanced by the Master of Death aspect being used as more than just a starting plot device.

*** I dunno. Grindlewald and Dumbledore both - two in a long line of people - believed there was something extra special about the artifacts and what combining them might mean. It might be "the real magic is in the journey" and even if the artifacts were just crafted by mankind or another magical species that the only way to Master death is to accept it.

But what if that's not all there is to it? It's another blank slate of potential magic, and that's what people like about it. For me, my favorite MoD fic is linkffn(Hallows and Pathos). I'd say give it a shot. It's got a much more sinister undertone to it than the majority of other MoD fics, and it's doesn't fall prey to the op!harry trope either.

**** Dumbledore doesn't really say there's anything special about them, other than their power and the myth. The indication from the text is more that it's made by talented brothers - or, perhaps, just in a family. The legend that springs up around it is just a legend.

I'll give the fic you recommend a try - but I don't know. I think powerful enchanted artifacts made by humans that have nothing to do with death is a lot more interesting than the normal super-power-up for Harry that the 'Master of Death' typically entails, particularly since it has nothing really to do with him personally.

(There's also the element of british centric aspect if they /are/ actually given by death - apparently, they popped up in Britain only and stayed there, as though Death thought that it would be the only place of import. If the Hallows were more spread out throughout the world/magical civilizations, maybe I'd be more inclined to find them more powerful/interesting)

***** There's no reason that they couldn't have spread out. Or that there couldn't be more of them. Harry is a very focused narrator and he never did any real investigation of them and all we really learn about them is what Harry learns about them. I don't know of one offhand, but there could easily be various versions of or additional Hallows that have sprung up through history.

Also, I just read through H&P again and I guess it does kind of have an OP!Harry bit in there that I had forgotten about. So, sorry for slightly misleading you in my previous post.

** I headcanon being Master of Death as becoming the Master of one's death i.e. it is up to the master of death to decide when he or she dies. The cloak would allow one to hide so that death can't approach when one is old; the wand would make one nigh invincible in combat so that one cannot be killed and the stone would allow the master to still contact one's loved ones so that the death of a loved one doesn't push the master into committing suicide to reunite with them. All three together give one the ultimate power to decide when to die.

This correlates with my headcanon reasons about why Ignotus gave up the cloak and decided to die. He longed to be with his dead loved ones. The stone would have helped ease the pain a bit. Antioch died because he was vulnerable while asleep. The cloak would have dealt with that vulnerability. Admittedly the Stone is still a weak point as it could make the Master decide to die to reunite with loved ones.

But then again Death is inevitable and even the Master of Death must meet it.

** It is my headcanon that by accepting death and sacrificing himself, Harry proved himself worthy of the Hallows, and by overcoming death, he became their true master. He did not become Master of Death because he united the Hallows, he was able to unite them, because he became the Master of Death. And they are his for the rest of his life.

This is especially true for the Elder Wand. The Wand has a history of changing owners, it is known to be very fickle. With Harry being an Auror, one would expect that the Wand will quickly change ownership again, since even being disarmed has been shown to be enough for the Elder Wand before. However, I don't think this would happen, not for Harry. The Elder Wand seeks one thing in its owner: power. It is no coincidence that the two people who have held it the longest are two of the most powerful wizards of their age: Dumbledore and Grindelwald. In fact, we know that Grindelwald even managed to keep the Wand's allegiance during his temporary defeat and imprisonment in 1927 (Fantastic Beast movies). This means the Wand isn't quite as fickle as appears at first glance. The wand chooses the wizard, and in this case it obviously chose Grindelwald over Newt, perhaps sensing that Grindelwald wasn't truly defeated and would make a comeback. It only left Grindelwald when he was defeated by a more powerful wizard, and it stayed with Dumbledore even longer, only leaving him when he was about to die. Though why would it stay with Harry when Harry clearly isn't at the same level as Dumbledore and Grindelwald magically? Because Harry has defeated the ultimate enemy: death. In doing so, he has proven himself more powerful than anyone else, and since it is unlikely that anyone can repeat this feat, the Wand will never find anyone better. Therfore I think Harry is right, and the Wand's power will be broken once he dies.

Another headcanon of mine is that the Master of Death (Harry) cannot die unless he chooses to do so. If he is killed by whatever means, he ends up in limbo again (King's Cross). However, there is nothing really in canon that supports this headcanon. I just like the thought that Master of Death is more than just an empty title. Dumbledore and Grindelwald both used to be obsessed with finding the Hallows, and once upon a time they clearly thought there was something to it, older Dumbledore's words about the Peverells just being skilled wizards nonwithstanding. Who is to say how magic works? Maybe people believing in the power of the Deathly Hallows is all that it takes.

** My take is that Master of Death is an in universe myth.

Assuming the brothers actually met Death, and didn't just craft the items themselves, the hallows were never a set. I'm unsure if the three brothers actual met Death as the Elder Wand seems to be a proper wand with a core and not just an enchanted stick.

- At the first brothers request Death created a wand more powerful than any other and probably cursed so the user dies in conflict.

- The second wished to commune with the dead so Death enchanted a stone to call the spirits of the dead. It also seems to be cursed so that all who use it are cursed to take their own lives. The spirits called may also be compelled to aid the curse.

- The cloak is special, it is Death's own possession and was not cursed. In addition to being an invisibility cloak of superior quality the owner cannot die. Also ownership might only be transferable through gifting.

Harry might be considered Master of Death as he was able to escape curses of the wand and stone by killing himself via Voldemort when the cloak lets him escape death.

*** It's not that the Cloak renders the owner unable to die. The myth went that Death simply could not see those who hid under it.

The real power of Death's Cloak that made it stand out (much like how the Elder Wand was a superior wand and the Resurrection Stone conjured shades of the dead) was the fact that it was /insanely durable./ Throughout the books, we're told that cloaks of invisibility are available to those with the resources and connections needed to acquire them. However, most cloaks aren't as durable nor as lasting as Death's Cloak was; eventually, the magic in the cloak would weaken and fade over the years and the cloak would lose its power. But Death's Cloak retained its power over the course of centuries, far longer than any other cloak its age ought to have, and it still works just as well as if it were a new cloak.

I agree, though. The "Master of Death" thing is likely just a myth, but possession of the Hallows still means you're in possession of three very potent magical items: the Elder Wand is a superlative focus for working magic (especially martial magic), the Resurrection Stone lets you speak to dead shades (and possibly learn their secrets and knowledge), and the Cloak of Invisibility is a powerful invisibility cloak that will retain its power for several lifetimes.

When combined, they give you Power, Knowledge, and Secrecy; three qualities that can make an intelligent and skilled wizard or witch very might indeed. But they most likely don't give any further powers beyond being the sum of their parts --- the "Master of Death" is just a fairy tale, after all.

**** You are correct that the cloak is incredibly durable and that it is very impressive, but it is still underwhelming in comparison to the other hallows.

There is also the issue that cloaks protection is seemingly weak (or at least less that advertised) with both Dumbledore and Moody being able to see through it. What good is an invisibility cloak meant to hide from Death if mere mortals can see through it.

I'd argue that the difference between Death being unable to see under it and being functionally immortal is a matter of phrasing. The third brother didn't suffer a heart attack the second they took off the cloak, instead they lived to old age until after they passed on the cloak. In fact none of the know owners have died before they were able to pass on the cloak. Finally we know that fate can be altered luck potions and prophecy, I see no reason why the cloak might not be responsible for Harry's plot armour throughout the series.

***** Well, /Moody/ could see through the cloak's invisibility, but his magic eye is hax anyways. It can see through solid objects, and the cloak is technically a solid object.

Dumbledore, on the other hand, apparently cheats by using the Homenum Revelio spell to detect human-presences around him, allowing him to locate people who are invisible. The charm apparently works like magical radar or echolocation by sending out an undetectable pulse of magic which returns the locations of all human-presences in the area. It's weird that Dumbledore apparently knows /when/ to cast his non-verbal-and-wandless human-presence-revealing charm in order to detect invisible people... but part of me wonders if Dumbledore is just /that paranoid/ for whatever reason that he's made a habit of using it all the time.

But explaining the Cloak as a form of plot-armor is actually not a half-bad explanation for it's "special-ness". So long as you're the true owner of the Cloak and haven't passed it down yet, you get lucky enough to cheat death by running and hiding, sheltered under the plot-armor ownership of the Hallow grants.

Though... that still has a flaw: Fleamont Potter canonically died of Dragon Pox, and his son, James Potter, only inherited the cloak /after/ Fleamont had died. It was bequeathed to James in Fleamont's will, and only became James' after Fleamont had first passed away of illness. Before that, James hadn't actually had the Death's Cloak - it'd been his dad's and a family heirloom he wasn't in possession/ownership of. And dying of Dragon Pox doesn't quite strike me as a death fit for someone still protected by "plot armor"

It's actually a pretty big thing to note for fanfics that try to stick close to the HP setting: James never had the Cloak at Hogwarts. He only got it after his parents died of illness not long after his own marriage.

You die, you move on to the "next great adventure" automagically. Death should mainly be about finding people who cheat death and maybe those who perpetuate large massacres and/or genocides AKA those who prevent people from having a natural death. Maybe guard the veil(s) of death?

** I'd like to read a fic where the only power that the Master of Death has is changing the death that someone would have otherwise had.

So for instance, if a wizard is meant to die from being struck in the head by an object that someone is summoning using /'accio'/...Harry could take away that death. But he couldn't pick what their new death is, so it might be better or worse than before he interfered. I think it would have some of the same drawbacks as divination, regarding interfering with the future and all.

He would certainly be tempted to use it while he's working as an Auror. But what if saving someone's life in the course of his Auror career condemns them to an even /worse/ death? Should he interfere again?

Or...what if Hermione was meant to die from cancer before the birth of her first child and he takes away that death, but now has to live with the knowledge that she's going to be murdered in a home invasion in 10 years? How can he spend time with his best friends and their children now that he knows their family is going to be destroyed one day? What if he takes away /that/ death and instead she's killed in a motor vehicle accident on her way home?

So, he's just Harry. Not any better or more powerful or more qualified to handle this responsibility. But given it anyway and struggling to cope. I'd like to read a fic like that.

I guess my take on 'Master of Death' is /literally/ taking away death, but then facing the consequences of doing so.

** I'm all for special MoD powers! I love them. I like when his powers are original and interesting. For example, when he can sense when someone's about to die ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18339977/chapters/43418063][The Call of Death]]), or accidentally reanimating dead things ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2528972/chapters/5621090][Hell To Raise]]) (though it's not MoD but has the same vibes?..). Also, I love when there's Death (as a character) in fics and Harry chats with them like a friend quite often ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18824134/chapters/44668678][Lily's Garden]] in some parts, the beginning of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up)]] ), especially if Death is from Discworld (Lily's Garden).

My favourite take on it is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]] (not really MoD but has the same vibes too...) where after his death he sometimes isn't reflected in the mirror, sometimes is very cold, sometimes people hear not his voice but a dead person's and sometimes it's like his home is haunted. Wish there were more like it. It's a brilliant idea.

I always imagine him becoming Death in my own plots though. He can't die, his body is restored after taking lethal damage, he has to meet souls in Limbo and send them to their train, do some mystical paperwork related to it (maybe accounting all temporal immortals and the limits of their immortality? Like all the vampires not capable of dying of old age, all those fools with Horcruxes, Flamels...), being able to speak to every living being and summon souls if they haven't yet moved to their afterlife/reincarnation. I always picture him staying at Hogwarts and teaching History, telling students much more than their textbooks (having a tea with a hundreds years old vampire and chatting with souls/ghosts helps with getting information).

Sometimes I'm influenced by other fandoms and picture him being [[https://hades.gamepedia.com/Thanatos][Thanatos from Hades]] (or just mythology) or [[https://hades.gamepedia.com/Hades][Hades]] himself. After playing Arcana ([[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nixhydragames.thearcana][Android]]/[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-arcana-a-mystic-romance/id1165696961][Apple]]), I imagine him as a Major Arcana, [[https://thearcanagame.fandom.com/wiki/Death][Death]], though I still haven't figured out what that would entail. He would have his Realm in [[https://thearcanagame.fandom.com/wiki/The_Arcana_Realm][Arcana Realms]] and show the Realms to the other characters, maybe make some deals with them to make them and himself stronger. In this plot, he would oppose another Major Arcana, [[https://thearcanagame.fandom.com/wiki/The_Devil][the Devil]]. I imagine that the Devil would make a deal with Lily and James separately on 31 October 1981 to "not let Harry be killed that night in exchange for staying in his Realm" (Lily and James realize that they both took the deal only after seeing each other in the Devil's Realm) and a deal with Voldemort on 2 May 1998 "to let him go safely" after being hit with his own Avada (the Devil just didn't mention that he would be able to walk in his Realm and not in the mortal world), maybe with Dumbledore too. And when Harry tries to think of someone foolish enough to deal with the Devil (deals make Major Arcana more powerful and able to enter the mortal world), he will instantly think of Voldemort and then will have to gather other characters and venture to free Voldemort and possible others (Devil couldn't become so powerful with just one deal after all) in order to weaken the Devil. I just imagine Voldemort, Lily and James walking through the Realm, arguing, bickering and threatening each other, and Harry just leading them and thinking "this is my life now". It would include bonding with other characters and investigating the Realms (I imagine Harry taking McGonagall, Flitwick and Snape on his quest), finding his powers, meeting other Major Arcanas and fighting cool battles, of course.

If only I could write it, heh. I apologize for just spilling it all out here but I just wanted to share it with someone and I have no one for it...

** I always thought the best take was that it meant that you were the master of death magic. Meaning like death curses, necromancy and spiritual combat and resurrecting people were things your innate magic became able to do by instinct. I also felt that to actually control that supernatural affinity so your magic didn't do it by instinct to everyone around you required years of training at minimum, otherwise any time anyone tried to challenge you at any of those your magic would channel your power through the appropriate hollow and go ridiculously overboard. For example anytime you faced a necromancer your magic would,fire off a killing curse that honed in on the necromancer and the stone would seize control of all their undead (possibly with an invisible killing curse while also making all the undead more powerful intelligent and invisible.)or literally making your soul invisible for spiritual combat so no one can target you with death curses or even find your soul to mess with.

** My headcanon is that as Master of Death, you would be able to be immortal, have some sort of necromancy, resurrect yourself and/or be reincarnated should you choose. Possibly astral project.

** Headcanon? Harry after he dies becomes Death, the only true way to master death is to become death. He can visit and take comfort in his family but he Becomes the personification of death

** My head canon powers.

1. True invisibility. Nothing can see/feel through the cloak. Including no footprints in the sand and even water goes through it like cloak wasn't there.

2. Every spell was over powered. We know Elder wand was powerful, we seen it in the movies where Voldemort destroyed entire Hogwarts protections with single handedly even he was not true master of the wand. Now think what it can do in the hands of it's true master.

3. Ring can control undead things like inferi, zombies and ghosts.

** A head canon/how I would use it in a story:

The Peverell brothers created them to be able to master death - to be able to bring someone back to life, possibly the youngest brother. To do so would require the usage of all of the hallows.

The stone to bring the spirit back to the land of the living. But would be stuck essentially as a ghost/shade.

The wand to bring the spirit to life and have a body. But they aren't meant to be alive so they would be haunted by death, quickly dying from anything between heart attack to seemingly random coincidences.

The cloak then, to keep the resurrected alive, to stave off the consequences of having bought someone back to life. but they must keep it on all the time. (For a story I'd probably make it so when on someone resurrected it doesn't make them invisible just hide from death)

In a story I'd have it as either, the cloak gains the specific properties of being able to hide from death when put on someone resurrected or any invisibility cloak would work but they quickly fade because the person was dead and so the hallow invisibility cloak is unique in that it doesn't fade and lasts forever - more in keeping with canon.

This works I think because the ability to bring one person back to life is something people would possibly kill over and seek relentlessly, i.e Dumbledore with his sister. Wouldn't break the story and isn't too over powered as it's restricted to only 1 person. This would also introduce conflict for Harry if it came out, as he would have too choose who, if anyone, to resurrect and there would be a lot of pressure from a lot of people who would try and get him to choose their loved one.
