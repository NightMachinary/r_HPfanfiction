Hey! Just gonna shamelessly say I'm on a huge hurt/comfort kick right now (something about the state of the world) and I'm looking for fics where Harry's scar visions or flashes are noticed and not hidden from Ron and Hermione. I hate in canon how often he suffers alone and I wish Hermione was a little less judgey and a bit more caring?\\
I really like The Seventh Horcrux by Melindaleo, which does some of what I'm looking for I think.

Any recommendations, even if they're not exactly what my request is, are super super appreciated. I like trio friendship and am open to any pairings. Just good writing above all else.

Thanks so much!
