I'm looking for a whole bunch of different types of fics. If you don't have any recs which fit into any of these categories, then just let me know your favourite fic!

I prefer long, plot-centric, completed stories. I don't care about ships -- I'd rather that the plot was the main focus of the story, but I won't turn away from a story just because it has a certain ship either. Hit me with your best recs. :)

If you do happen to know any awesome fics which fit into the categories below, I'd be really grateful. Again: long, plot-centric, and completed stories are ideal!

1: Time travel. Either Harry getting thrown back to the Marauders Era (bonus points if he's resorted into Slytherin) / Harry's memories returning to his younger self (fix-it type fics, but preferably without too much canon rehashing) / anything with Snape getting thrown back in time.

2: Alternate sorting fics. Preferably Harry, Snape, Ginny, Hermione, or Draco.

3: Any grey / dark / independent Harry stories.

4: Any stories where Harry grows up with / is mentored by not-Dursleys (bonus points for Snape).

5: Anything about Tom Riddle's diary. I've never seen any fics where the diary and the person it's writing to (Ginny, Hermione, Harry, or otherwise) end up working together? I'd love to read something with the diary as a form of mentor / teacher / co-conspirator for world domination.

Thank you! :)


** 1. There's lots of alternative sortings here:

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.

*** Thank you! I remember looking through a ton of the painless-j lists a couple of years ago, but I'd forgotten about them until now. I'll be sure to take a look through :) I haven't heard of Lithium, but it looks really promising!

** A lot of these topics have come up a lot on the subreddit. I recommend doing a search.

It is on the right on top of the sidebar. Make sure to hit "limit my search to [[/r/HPfanfiction]]".

Have fun on reddit! Be sure to check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index][the wiki]] for suggestions as well.

*** Thank you! I've had a quick search, but most of the topics I found were quite old (8+ months or so), so I was hoping to get some fresh recs! I'll definitely have a more thorough search though, and will poke through the wiki too! :)

** 4) *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146): Harry ran away and was adopted by the Grangers; both good and bad guys are made smarter and stronger in this fic; most likely Harry/Luna pairing.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

#+begin_quote
  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
