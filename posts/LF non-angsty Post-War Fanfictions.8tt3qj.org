Yo.

I have been trying to read a few fanfictions that went ahead and pictured a super angsty, cheesy, emo Potter.\\
Sure. That could have been one outcome. But I dont wanna read about Harry whining about how unfair life is and then getting his butcheeks slobbered by Draco Malfoy. Thankyourverymuch.

Are there any post-war fanfictions (including crossovers) that feature a non-angsty, pro-active Harry? Badassery is a plus.

Please DO NOT link the top Review-Fics. They have been read too many times already.


** Do you want stories about adventures that Harry has after Hogwarts (like Sum of their Parts) or do you want more dealing with family type?

*** I think either is fine. As long as its not a Harry-Ginny-ship that is traveling the family-sea.

** Well, I wrote an one-shot that commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts in the form of an interview with Harry: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628). I laid down some of my assumptions and expectations for the postwar development, while trying to keep as canon compliant as possible.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), only has 749 reviews on FFN, but is a top recommended fic on this sub. If you haven't read it, it's definitely worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), shows a manipulative!Harry in his full glory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is IMO the best canon compliant postwar fic.
