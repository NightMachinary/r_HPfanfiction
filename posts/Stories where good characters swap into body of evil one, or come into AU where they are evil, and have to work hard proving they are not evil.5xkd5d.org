I remember fanfic where Harry got into AU where he was Voldemort's right hand man, and another where Hermione swapped minds with Bella. It was really interesting to read, and if you know more stories with that premise, I'd like to read them too


** Unsure if this is the fic you were referencing in your request, but if not then this fits your request pretty much perfectly. One of my favorites to boot as well.
