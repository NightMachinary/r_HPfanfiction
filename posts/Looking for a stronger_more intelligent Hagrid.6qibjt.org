In fan-fiction, Hagrid is often portrayed as stupid, magically inept, uncultured, and overall, a rather laughable character more suited for comic relief or derision. While I'm not always the biggest fan of some aspects of canon, I really liked canon Hagrid, who could perform non-verbal magic with a snapped wand. Furthermore, he was quite deft at social networking and interacting with magical creatures. That's not somebody who is stupid.

Looking for stories where Hagrid isn't a laughable character.


** Of course Hagrid is smart, he even mastered Occlumency

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** Recently came upon this fic which really breathes life into a number of characters as well as the background of the wizarding world. Hagrid in this story is a master at animal empathy, which makes him a valuable tutor for Harry who has similar gifts.\\

** Mm, I asked for this around 7 months back, not counting the 'major character Hagrid/werewolf' thing just a day or so ago. I got a bit of thinking about how powerful and significant Hagrid is and how important he could potentially be, what it'd be like if he raised Harry instead of the Dursleys, etc.

Have an upvote so that more people see this request and hopefully link even moar good fics.

  Many people believed it was Dumbledore who was quietly directing the war from behind he scenes, those same people would tell you Hagrid was barely capable of understanding the consequences for his actions. What if Hagrid was cursed with the ability to see the future far better than Trelawney ever could and he used that knowledge in his own unique way? No slash, just friendship

** He is a side character in my Story "Patron", but in that AU, he is one of the most renowed experts for Magical Creatures and has been a teacher at Hogwarts for decades. He gets called in to investigate sabotage at the TWT, and later breeds animals for use in the war. And of course fights in the war as well.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** In A Distant Storm, Hagrid got a new wand, was reinstated as a wizard, got his Mastery in Care of Magical Creatures, and was made a Lord on the Wizengamot as reparation for being framed by Riddle. (He got the House Gaunt seat, renamed the House of Hagrid) He did all this in the span of a single summer. linkffn(12564837)
