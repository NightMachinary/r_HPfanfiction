I was hoping that we could update and revise the list LordTalon made on HP Fanfiction. We could order them by status as well as story type.


** Can you link the list? I have no idea what is discussed here.

** I think that it may be better to add good stories to tvtropes lists - [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter]]

** Why that list? Does it only show the best of the best? Who decides what's good and what isn´t? What we need is a thread and a good way to commend good stories and organise them by pairing, length etc.

*** Well that's why I'm asking for a revised list.

It is certainly the biggest list of FF I've come across and is helpfully sorted into Completed, In Progress, or Abandoned but it hasn't been updated in a while and I believe that it can be further sorted to help those find stories they would be interested in.

**** I found this one a while back. I can't remember where I found it, but I had it on my computer so I will upload for you: [[https://mega.co.nz/#!phEXwTSb!GiepTFAhj5ciF_pf3MTtownOJC42RQxmPojW1MUQ_Yo][top 100 completed favs]]

Some of them are good, but I have read very few of them.

I know it is not as large as the other, but it does have 100 others, and you just wanted a lot.

***** I have this list too and even though it's very handy, organized and easy to use I'm not to crazy about it. It shows the 'best' stories by number of faves but I've found that usually the story with the most faves are the ones I love the least since they tend to be generic, overly-romanticized or a downright cliché.

*** I agree that the list needs more organization. Complete is all well and good, but I don't want to get five chapters in and discover its slash
