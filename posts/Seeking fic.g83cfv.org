Anyone got any really good luna/harry or daphne/harry fics that really focus on story and development and are really well written? Preferably lengthy ones but I'll accept any... And any luna crack fics too


** Well you could try The Grass is Always Greener by kb0. As it's name suggests it's a Harry/Daphne fic and is a little over 100K words long.

And you could try The Curious Case of Luna Lovegood by Marvolo666. Its a little over 276K words.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.
