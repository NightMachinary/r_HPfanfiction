As the title says, does anyone have any fic recommendations where the protagonist is not one of the cannonically good guys?

For example Voldemort/Tom Riddle, Belatrix, even one of the Malfoys being the fics protagonists. If they are actually the good or bad guys in the story doesn't really matter.

I read a few of them already, mainly with Voldemort as the protagonist and I'm hooked.

*** Of the three suggestions I have only read your one shots so far and they are all amazing and make me want to read more on them even though they're one-shots. You have a way with words that immensely brightened up my day.

**** Wow thank you! I really appreciate that!! I'm glad you liked them :) I'm hoping to write a longer fic in the same vein... just have to find the time.
