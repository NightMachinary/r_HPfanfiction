I've read a lot of H/L already - most (if not all) of the recommendations given in the first 5 pages if I search for Luna in [[/r/HPfanfiction]] by relevance over all time. By all means bring out your obscure, crossover, or smut stories. I'll read them all. Complete stories are most preferred (and being beta'd helps; it takes a horribly written story for me to quit reading, but it has happened before) but really all I ask for is a focus on the fluff and the fun.

** I recommend "Unspeakable Beauty" on ffnet. It's set after the war, has a lovely romance (and some lemons) between Harry and Luna, with an interesting plot mixed in. It's incomplete though, but please read it anyway. The last update I read was that the author was sick, I hope she's alright.

*** I hadn't read Here Forever which is odd because I thought I had read all of Silently Watches' HP stuff, so thanks for that!
