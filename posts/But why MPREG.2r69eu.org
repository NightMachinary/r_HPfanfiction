MPREG seems to be a big part in homosexual pairings and I don't understand why. Even though there's magic, that doesn't mean anything is possible. Do they lack an understanding of human anatomy? Are they simply young? Optimistic?

If anyone can shed some light on this, that'd be great! Or explain how they can read a story with it.


** One thing I have realized is that MPREG, as a plot device, allows you to pull the 'surprise baby' trope on the slash couple in question - i.e. very easily add drama to the romance.

You can't have a 'surprise baby' if you're adopting or having a surrogate - at least I don't think you can. And depicting the drama of surrogacy or adoption is way harder to do, I think.

However, a lot of ff writers want to just steamroll their way to desired outcome 'x,' in this case gay dudes having kids.

Option A: Bringing in new characters, developing them (maintaining good relations during the surrogacy period/who gets to be the initial baby daddy/acclimating adopted kids to a new household/what if there is friction there) and a bunch of other shit.

or

Option B: Dude gets pregnant. Hurrah.

While I would prefer reading more about the first one as it is grounded more in reality, as much as anything FF related ever is, the second one is much much faster to write about and therefore easier. All you need to do is ignore basic anatomy and incredibly high likelihood of anal fissures.

These are magical beings who can apparently train the ability to turn into animals at will and despite things like laws of conservation, can transfigure humans into whatever they'd like at will, can apparently be born with the ability to just shapeshift however, etc. I don't see how there's such a big jump from 'Tonks can literally change to look like whatever she wants with no noted canon restrictions' and 'people can just change their heads into shark heads because they needed to breathe underwater' to 'I am a man who wants to have children, there's probably a potion, spell, or transfiguration in existence that will allow me to do so.' I've read a lot of mpreg, if the rest of the plot sounds alright, and I don't see what's wrong with it. If it's not something you like, don't read it. It's like just about every other theme: some are really good, some are trash. I remember reading a creature fic where Harry was a veela or something, and the author had them breed in the bird sense. It was fascinating. I've also read various mpregs with shapeshifting, c-sections, internal vaginas, that alpha/omega stuff, etc etc etc. It's not really any worse than some of the other stuff in the fandoms.

Fiction generally (especially today's fiction) allows many not-so-far-off loophoops. If you have sparkly vampires, transforming monsters, and fucking schools for witchcraft and wizardy, two male characters in love wanting to have biological children doesn't seem so crazy.

** I always thought the concept of mpreg was ridiculous (although I read some anyway), but then I stumbled across one random fic that completely changed my mind with one point: human transfiguration. Canon characters in HP can go from human body to animal body. Therefore I'll buy that the HP world has a transfiguration process that can give a male human working female parts. I expect it would likely be an expensive, finicky, and rare procedure, and it would be a lot easier/more sensible to just transfigure the man into a woman, but okay, I'll buy it as possible.

Of course, I've never actually seen a mpreg story that uses that logic, mostly it's just "there's a potion"/"oh you didn't know wizards can get pregnant?"

But if you mix logic with working magic then some ridiculous things do start sounding possible...

Authors write the stories they envision. If they want a story about how a male/male couple builds a family, especially in a fandom with magic, why not Mpreg? I keep being surprised by the criticism "why would anyone write that?" Or the "that author may be young/confused/etc."

The why is "because they wanted to write about that." And people read them because they like them. I can take them or leave them. I'm more concerned that the story is written in standard grammar and has an interested plot.

** In real life, some men can get pregnant. If you want an explanation that doesn't involve creating a uterus with magic, then make one of the participants trans, with magic to give them an appearance appropriate to their actual gender rather than the gender assigned them at birth.

I wouldn't mind mpreg more than fpreg if there were an explanation for the mechanism. If it's The ♥ Power ♥ of ♥ Love!!! then I'm not at all keen on it. But the biggest problem with it is that it's pregnancy, and you know it's going to be the best experience of their lives.

Seriously, you have a parasite in you that grows to be several percentage points of your bodily mass, rearranging your internal organs. In the meantime, you're horribly unbalanced, leading to spinal problems and heavily reducing mobility. It makes you frequently nauseous. It can lead to osteoporosis. Removing the fetus is one of the most painful experiences that people commonly go through. In my first aid training, someone was pretending to have a broken wrist and I asked how much it hurt, compared to the worst she'd ever experienced. She gave it a three out of ten -- ten out of ten, she said, was when she gave birth.

And people romanticize this! I don't understand it. I strongly doubt any of them have given birth.

Harry still wears glasses and has a scarcrux, Mr. Weasley is balding, Slughorn is fat, Moody has a fake eye and leg, Eloise Midgen has spots, and so on.

Magic in HP can do a huge variety of specific things. It isn't necessary to have magic for losing fat or clearing up acne or restoring hair to have magic for creating a uterus in a man. Granted, creating bodily organs is rather more complicated than magical liposuction.

I've seen people using capitalism to explain the existence of various body modification and self-improvement potions without their widespread use. I have some problems with that, primarily with the magical community being very small and the resulting constraints on supply/demand curves. Especially with ephemeral supplies -- you've got to move that inventory or lose it.

I've also seen people using one-off magical artifacts designed and constructed by ancient geniuses. That's a well-attested thing in canon, what with the Deathly Hollows and the Mirror of Erised and the Philosopher's Stone and Ravenclaw's Diadem and the Sword of Gryffindor.

******** It's almost as if I don't have an issue with AU or even mpreg, but rather the statement that "men can get pregnant", as if it wasn't posted to intentionally create an argument.

********* Except that you have no evidence it WAS created to start an argument besides 'oh, I don't like this, so it must just be mentioned out of spite instead of offering a potential alternative to typical mpreg'. You know, since the opening post was about making characters trans to make mpreg more tolerable.

I know this might be a huge fucking surprise to you, but sometimes people are actually inclusive of the trans community and that shouldn't be treated as a novelty or an intention to create an argument. :/

Read OP's comments, it's evidence enough.

Calm yourself. The only issue people took was with the statement "men can get pregnant". Even Transmen who have fully transitioned haven't. OP was looking for a reason to start something about it for some reason, this isn't about being inclusive.

******* In the context of the HP world, none of the characters are from the Americas. So the Alexandra Quick series is intentional idiocy too, right?

******** AQ is in the context of a complete AU world, which is stated very clearly by the author multiple times. Throwing out the statement "some men can get pregnant" with no other context other than a HPFF forum is completely different.

Even equating the two is laughable. Starting to wonder if this is Tumblr.

So you would have been happy to see trans people in the Alexandra Quick series? And you're against non-canon-compliant fics that are too close to canon in general?

********** I don't care if you write Harry as a half giant with a flower for genitals. As long as you explain it in context. My entire problem was your statement of "men can get pregnant", when you're obviously /only/ doing so to provoke an argument. Everyone understands that transmen can get pregnant, because they were born with a uterus, whether they wanted it or not. Your statement seems as if men born /without/ one can have children, when that's obviously patently false.

Jesus, I let myself get baited so easily. I knew you were only posting to be contrary, and I fell for it anyway. I'm done, enjoy your evening.

When in the original post I went on to talk about transgender men *in the very next sentence*. Yeah, pull the other one.
