I would love to read even a oneshot about McGonagall and Snape bonding over their hate for Umbridge or so.


** While it is not the focus of the fic, it is a big part of it. I really enjoyed the development of their friendship. The story is a marriage law AU, wherein Hermione says 'hell no' and flees with Harry and her family to the US. I also really enjoyed the development of her parents as people and their relationship with Hermione and magic in general. They are badasses. Linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities).

**** I disliked the complete lack of buildup for the Harmony ship in that fic -- it felt completely sudden and unnatural to me (I mean, the countless SSHG marriage law fics that this fic is mocking is even worse in that regard, but still). Besides this, I found the fic very good.

***** Well, the story started when they relationship already existed, so that wouldn't be that bad. Unfortunately, H/Hr relationship seemed like the weakest part of otherwise really nice story, and yes, I really liked McGonagall/Snape relationship there (although, I missed some kind of Snape conversion story, but that's another point). And yes, the best part was the Percy/Audrey story (there is no way how can I be persuaded that Audrey was not a Muggle; looking at you otherwise rather nice linkffn(12181042)!), and apparently I was not alone, so there is linkffn(12373273).

**** I wish /Escape/ had better punctuation. It seems like the kind of fic I could like, but I get too annoyed by the missing comas and poor style of the first chapter (it's not that bad at all, I'm just picky) . Does it get better as it goes on?

***** I can honestly say I've never paid attention to punctuation. (Unless it's something obvious like a question ending in a full stop or triple exclamation) I'm shit with commas both in my native language and English. I'm okay at spelling, but commas are beyond me. I just pepper them randomly and hope some are in the right positions.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** I'm sure I read a fanfiction where there's a series of meetings between Snape and McGonagall over the period of first and second years and they commiserate on how awful their students are and how bad Quirrel and Lockhart are as teachers. I just can't find it right now.
