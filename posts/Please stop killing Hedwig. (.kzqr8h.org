It breaks my heart every time I read a story where somebody (usually Vernon) casually kills Hedwig as a cheap plot device to show how depraved they are. I've just read three stories back-to-back where it happens. This last one she is put, still in her cage, into two layered garbage bags and literally thrown into the bin, thus being injured and asphyxiated.


** I totally agree. It's virtually the only plot device I actively dislike. Everything else is just a sort of wearied irritation at this point.

*** I understand that sometimes it's a plot device you need for a specific story element, but in most cases it's a simple matter of extreme cruelty just to show how awful Vernon (or, rarely, Dudley) is.

**** Indeed. Even so, it's a depth I'd rather stories not sink to. Kill everything else by all means, but killing Hedwig is just wrong. :)

***** One story I remember had Hedwig killed OFFSCREEN, and it was reported to Harry in a jarringly offhand manner (shot with an arrow by a centaur, if I remember correctly). Having done that, there was no real effect on Harry, so it was rather poor writing.

Then again, there's one of those "wrongfully put in Azkaban and later released" stories where Harry only once wonders who took custody of Hedwig, before he just gets another owl.

I sometimes wonder if these people have never owned a pet.

****** To be fair, canon Harry doesn't spare much thought for Hedwig. Granted he was involved in a live or die chase at the time but even after he is more shocked by Moody's death (a person he didn't really interact with much). I know that Moody was a human but Hedwig was his only link to the magical world all those summers when he was trapped at Privet Drive.

In his defense, Harry had witnessed so much death by the time he is seventeen that he is probably desensitized by it. He doesn't really seem too moved about all the death that occurs during the Battle of Hogwarts even if among the victims there were people he cared about (granted he was walking to his own death at the time).

** There are /so/ many ways to show how evil a character is. Killing off Hedwig is crossing a line you never really need to. I can power through it and keep reading, but it's perilously close to immediately making me apathetic towards the story.

It hurts me all the more when Harry's just kinda blasé about it. If that happens, I'm just /immediately/ out.

**** Make Hedwig a phoenix under an illusion charm, and Harry somehow breaks said charm (immense magical power requirement optional, but this is a wish-fulfillment trope so it probably exists anyway). Done.

(note: I don't know of a fic that actually does this. If it exists, let me know because it actually sounds like a halfway decent compromise between "Hedwig gets to live for a change" and "Harry gets a totally awesome Hedwig-replacement pet")

**** Have Harry get the pet... and also keep Hedwig. I have a dog and a cat, I didn't need to sacrifice my dog to the gods before I was allowed to have my cat. You can have multiple at the same time there's zero need to kill Hedwig.
