** You might want to look for transfiguration fics like linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) that have a heavy conjuration bias as it equates to the same thing.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
