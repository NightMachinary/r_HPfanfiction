#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

*** Oh I don't know. I haven't read one in a couple of years. I was just thinking about it and wondering if there were any really innovative ones.

** Never saw any that were good, and there used to be thousands of them before they got purged from FFN. TBH, not sure how anyone could make it through them, since it was almost always just full of characters reacting with the author's metaknowledge. Always seemed cringey to me.

I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they all got shifted to some other archive site, though I don't know what site that would be. Probably ao3.

** I remember reading Discovering the Legend series but it's not on FFN now. It's probably on fictionhunt.
