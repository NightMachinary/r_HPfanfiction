Ok, the title of this post is kind of redundant in a way, because we are all looking for "good" Fanfic, and our idea of "good" is different from everybody's that offers their idea, than others, lol.

What I am actually looking for though is quit simple in my opinion lol. Its stories that involve Royalty. Now it can be were Harry is related to said Royalty, or he is friends of this Royalty, gets adopted by, rescued from the Dursleys by them, or is even this Royalty himself.

​

Now the reason I am asking for help in finding some of these stories is because I recently read a few stories, one example:

*A Royal at Hogwarts*

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1537694/JayColin][JayColin]]

​

Story can be found on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and it was really good. there are few more that are along the same venue that are also really good, in fact "*The Journey Begins*" is actually my favorite and I am hoping the author writes some more on it.

​

In the mean time, I am looking for some ideas, story wise, to read that are similar in the HP world that are really good, quality to the ones that JayColin wrote. They don't have to be complete, necessarily, but updated periodically would be nice. Completed ones are also quite lovely ;)


** I haven't come across too many royalty stories unless you're talking about stuff like linkffn(Avalon in Arms by potterlad81).

There is linkffn(Harry Potter and The Iron Lady by mugglesftw) that I enjoyed.

  Harry finally takes up the roll he was born to fill, and Albus Dumbledore isn't happy at all. A new power rises to defeat Voldemort and reshape Magical Britain. This is for those who like magic mixed with muggle technology and a good war story.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

*** Still my preferred muggles-save-the-wizarding-world story. Except I didn't like slight Weasley bashing, which was in this case absolutely unnecessary.
