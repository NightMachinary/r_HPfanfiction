From being playful one minute to leaving a classmate scarred and attempting to have a teacher killed.

Yeah otters might be cute in real life, but they're super hardcore.


** I'm confused, isn't that her personality in the books? She's sweet and kind and all of sudden there are birds attacking your face.

I'm pretty sure that article misses something...remind me, what was the nastiest curse Hermione ever used in the books?

**** Interesting question!

If by nastiest curse, you mean the one that was intended to do the most damage, then the curse that affected Marietta comes to mind. If you mean the one that had the most devastating consequences, she obliviated her parents. She also trapped Rita Skeeter in a jar, which sounds like torture to me.

There's also that whole "Umbridge got raped by centaurs" fandom interpretation, and if you believe that, definitely the worst thing she did.

***** She also confunded Mclaggen, who was riding a broom a hundred or so feet in the air.

For someone who has seen her friend hold on for dear life as someone jinxed his broom, saw that same friend almost die from actually falling off a broom, and got that same friend's new broom confiscated to check for jinxes so that he wouldn't fall again, Hermione didn't really seem all that concerned about McLaggen being confused and disoriented dozens or even hundreds of feet up in the air.

****** Clearly that's because McLaggen wasn't Hermione's friend. (I'm being sarcastic here, but I feel like you could actually use that as an explanation for Hermione's seemingly hypocritical attitude to people being cursed/jinxed while riding a broom).

** She's kind of like this in linkffn(An Old And New World)

The author, Lens of Sanity, writes a very interesting Hermione. He describes her in another fic as “She's not evil. She just has a little trouble telling the difference between turning someone's hair green as a joke, and killing their dog. It is because of this little problem that she always follows the rules strictly, so as never to be caught out.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...
