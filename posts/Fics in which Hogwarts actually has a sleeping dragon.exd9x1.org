(and perhaps someone 'tickles' it)?

I don't care about time periods, main characters, pairings/het/slash or whatnot. All I ask is that it's fairly well written.

Thanks in advance.


** Considering the weird architecture, Hogwarts could actually BE a sleeping dragon. The rooms move about when it wriggles in its sleep, the towers are its limbs and joints, etc.

Final battle occurs when it just unfolds and they all fight across brickwork scales and masonry claws.

** Did no one tell you about Ignatius the sleeping dragon? Helga Hufflepuff Dosed him With a powerful sleeping draft while the castle was constructed. He sleeps under the Hufflepuff common room, His fire breath Is the source of Hogwarts' ever burning kitchen fires. When students go To tickle the pear On the painting of the bowl of fruit at the entrance to the kitchen, The pear is actually Ignatius' tickle spot Directly under the skills behind his left ear. Every time a student tickles the pear they are giving Ignatius ear scratch, making the dragon laugh And sneeze fire To keep the kitchen fires is burning.

On an added note: Helga Hufflepuff Ever the advocate for courtesy and kindness no matter the species, Design a comfortable chamber for the dragon to sleep, Ignatius comes and goes as he wishes, Returning to the chamber to sleep. He is perpetually being fed treats by the house elves As his presence keeps the fires burning. Dobby And Ignatius We are known as Wonderful friends During Dobby's time at Hogwarts, He was known to take extra care when preparing Ignatius' meals , Both Dobby and Ignatius We're quite fond of the hats Hermione Granger Sowed During her years at Hogwarts. Ignatius Found her hat particularly useful for cleaning behind his ears( with Dobby's help of course)

  Alternate Universe. It's September 1991, Hogwarts has recently come under new management, and the headmaster intends to carry out the sorting of the new first years in person. One-shot. Non-canon magical being. Minor tidying of some sentences, March 2013.

** This isn't quite what you asked for, but in linkffn(13230340), Harry is a dragon---and that's okay. He sleeps while attending Hogwarts, so it fulfills the /letter/ of your request, if not the /spirit/.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=2902][Red Is The Heart by St Margarets]] has actual dragons guarding The Hogwarts, and Harry and Ginny actually need in one moment to wake up a sleeping dragon, and of course they contemplate this school motto at that moment.
