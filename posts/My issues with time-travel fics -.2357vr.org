So I like a good time-travel fic as much as the next guy, but after just finishing a couple, I can't help but be a little frustrated with the currently available selection.

The biggest thing that gets me is when time-travelers go back in time and go through Hogwarts/school in general all over again, and the author fails to make note of how /mind-numbingly boring/ it would be to re-do /middle school/! That's what first years of Hogwarts are - /middle school/ and even if you don't remember everything that was taught to you in middle school, the teaching methods in general are still catered to eleven-thirteen year-olds. Middle school subjects are not taught the same as high-school / college subjects because children learn differently at different ages. Sitting through those classes at an older age waiting for all of the other students to pick up the material /should be/ a drag and at the very least commented on by the time-traveler via whatever narrative device the author is using.

And that's another thing - trust me, if someone shows up to middle school and starts acting / /learning/ like an adult - that's going to get noticed by (competent) teachers pretty quickly. And all thoughts on the competency of the Hogwarts teaching staff aside, someone is going to notice that something's odd.

Now I'm not saying that a good time-travel fic can't be written with the traveler going back to school, but what I /am/ saying is that the author had better make note of the fact that the person is going back through the basics all over again. For an adult who's been using magic for years or even decades, learning to change a matchstick into a needle would be a lot like a university graduate relearning basic addition & subtraction. This is definitely something that can't just be glossed over.

The second major thing that gets be is when 35-70 year-old adults travel back in time and start acting like children. I just got done with a fic where Harry goes back in time after fathering three children yadda-yadda, only to not do anything about Ginny having the diary during second year because he can't decide what to do about it and is unable to come up with a solution that doesn't arouse suspicion. I mean /come on/! Harry was a freakin' auror for years in this story, and he can't come up with the idea of a note or something to the teaching staff? It's things like this that really get me - it's like this version of Harry grew up, had a family, carved out a great career, /and didn't learn a single damn thing the entire time/.

What my complaints really boil down to is that if you're going to write a time-travel fic, you can't got through the same old song and dance. People react to situations differently and situations play-out differently based on the experiences of those involved. Time travel fics can't use the same old sources of conflict and expect to read smoothly.

And I've suddenly just lost all steam for this post. I'd be pleased to read some of your thoughts/feedback/own gripe about time-travel fics. Or if you have any suggested fics that aren't as bad as some of the ones I've read.

Thanks.


** Here's what I don't like about bad time travel fics. The good ones often don't do most of these.

*A) The character refuses to make changes (at least not at first).*

I mean, what's the point of timetravel if you're not going to do anything with it? If certain things "have to happen" then why did you bother travelling to the past in the first place? I'm not saying "blow your cover and start messing shit up", but at least do something substantially different this time around.

This mistake is often combined with mistake B.

*B) Going back way too early.*

Harry goes back to first year? Why? As far as I can tell things went pretty well in first year and second year. Harry got in Gryffindor, became the youngest seeker in a century, nobody died, the philosopher's stone is safe and you killed a basilisk with a sword. How can you possibly top that?

I can understand why you don't want to jinx this by "not changing anything", but then why did you travel this far back in the first place. Just drop in around the time Pettigrew escaped and clear Sirius' name (and tell Lupin to take his Wolfsbane already, while you're at it). That's when things started going wrong for the first time. Going back earlier is meaningless.

*C) The author doesn't understand how cause and effect or randomness work*

Just because things happened a certain way in the original timeline doesn't mean they will be identical this time around. Especially once you actively start acting differently.

Random events are still random.

For example: Quirrel might decide not to unleash a troll on Halloween or the troll might stay in the dungeons and all Harry accomplishes when storming in the bathroom is looking like a fool. Interesting twist if this causes Hermione to not care about Harry and she doesn't become his friend like the first time around.

Nearly Headless Nick decides to go down another corridor the night the basilisk was released and Justin actually drops down dead instead of just being petrified.

Especially the basilisk one is really frustrating!! It was a miracle that no one died the first time around. You cannot guarantee that the same thing will happen again this time. Unleashing that monster again is a crime and you are just as responsible for anyone it kills as Malfoy/Voldemort are.

Aside from randomness, If you start mucking things up as early as book 1, including having Peter Pettigrew arrested and freeing Sirius (legally) as well as destroying Horcuxes this early then people will notice and plans will change.

So say you do the responsible thing and destroy the diary as soon as Ginny gets home from Diagon ally that day. Good, but this has two consequences:

1) The basilisk is still alive. Voldemort might still call upon it later as an ace in the hole. But fine, that's an obvious one. Just say that you somehow trick Dumbledore into killing it by "accidentally" stumbling upon the Chamber of Secrets. But what many don't seem to realize is

2) Malfoy isn't going to sit there and do nothing else all year. Lucius planted that diary with clear expectations of rocking the boat at Hogwarts so he could get Dumbledore fired. If the news-articles about petrified students and messages in blood don't start appearing he will surely try another scheme. One the time traveler has no idea about.

the changes in the timeline (both random and caused by earlier changes) are endless yet so few fics barely touch upon that...

It makes sense to to make unnecessary large changes, but just reliving your first year exactly would be insane.

Well, it gives more time to prepare, deal with horcruxes and such. If you have both A and B.. yeah, that doesn't make sense.

Virtually nothing is truly random. Things are going to generally fall out the same way unless you make changes that affect them.

The basilisk is actually way easier to deal with if you deal with the diary ahead of time, all you need is a rooster.

Also, if I recall correctly, Lucius had no idea what the diary would actually do. He just knew it was a dark object given to him for safekeeping by Voldemort, and assumed that whatever it did to Ginny, it would be unpleasant. As obsessed as Voldemort was with immortality, he would never have given Lucius instructions to put one of his horcruxes at risk like that.

Yes and no. Certain big events might start the same (if left alone) but I don't believe they will play out exactly the same. Some things, like the random path a troll happens to take when wandering around, is so unpredictable that you can't guarantee he will end up in Hermione's bathroom all over again.

*** Well, C depends on how time travel works in that universe - whether it's really going to throw everything into chaos when a butterfly flaps its wings (which would probably be realistic) or whether everything is on rails and deviations from that makes things try to get back on track or causes everything to completely derail.

There is one fic in particular that I read recently where it took the 'on rails' interpretation to an extreme, any serious deviation led to a premature death that Harry simply could not escape, and it really emphasized how terrible and mind-numbing it would be to get caught in such a loop, without any way to escape it. And then when he finally got things /right/... canon path, pops out the kids on schedule, dies in his nineties or something... he still wakes up in that shack on the lake.

It started out as hilarious and it got dark and depressing the further it went. It was an /awesome/ one and I wish I could remember the name of it.

** Have you read my Bonds of Time Series? They're pretty popular, and reason for that is I add new storylines to it. It has a Soul-Bond, plus each year, aside from the first is different than in the books. The fourth year which I am starting now is going to go through the same tournament storyline, but it will have twists to make it different.

It is all about how you make it different this time around. A lot of people seem to like to stick to the same storyline, which is why it would seem boring for the characters. Mine is unpredictable.

Everything that has changed in my story has consequences later on in the story.

** Another fic without the whole school redo thing is Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord. I think it really does give us a mature Harry but he's also not de-aged.

Yeah I can agree with you on that front. It makes no sense to redo school, and I hate rewrites of the series. Pretty much the whole fic of epic length is all classes and no plot. Its so mind numbingly boring. The set up is good and then - school! urgh

** Not all time travel is equal and I'd argue that the best authors of fanfiction time travel are adult authors, ones who would have trouble actually putting themselves into that position.

A few worth note:

jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] directly addresses most all of these points. Harry, as an adult James, can't connect with his peers because the gulf between maturity levels is just too high. One of the major conflicts of the story is Harry's acting as an adult among children or those who see him as a child.

Swimdraconian's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] has Harry basically try and fail at the whole back to school thing. The differences are so vast as to be unfordable.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1446455/Perspicacity][Perspicacity]] has like four or five time-travel fanfiction stories, all of which handle the matter smartly, not settling for default NOFP-esque "repeat canon but in fix-fic fashion."

*** /The Lie I've Lived/ was one of the first fics I read, and I have to say it still is one of my favorites. I've never really thought about it in relation to time-travel fics, but you're certainly correct in saying that they author does a great job with the "adult in a kid's body" conundrum.

I'm not sure if I've read the others, but I'll certainly give them a perusal.

** Are there any good fics where someone goes back in time and completely fucks things up so they're worse than before? Like, Harry makes a mistake in first year and causes Quirrel to get the Stone before Harry can reach him, that kind of fuck-up.

** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]]? It actually addresses the boredom aspect in a pretty funny way. I've read a couple others where Harry and Hermione go back in time and almost immediately blow Hogwarts off completely and leave. It wasn't until it was brought up in those stories that I even considered how mind-numbingly boring it would be to redo all that though.

*** I read a few chapters of /Faery Heroes/ and decided to wait until the author got closer to finishing it. I really enjoy the story, but the updates are so spread-out that I find I have to re-read most of it every time a new chapter gets posted in order to familiar myself with the story again.

I'll admit that I, too didn't give the "re-schooling" much thought until I read "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5627314/1/In-this-World-and-the-Next][In This World and the Next]]" by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]]. Harry and Hermione both acknowledge pretty early in that story that they have little-to-no need to attend Hogwarts a second time, nor do they have the desire.

** This is going to get a bit lengthy, I'm afraid. Also, sorry for english mistakes, not my 1st language. My favorite kind of time-travel fic is the 'next gen goes back and meet their parents' kind. Yes, yes, there's a lot of those out there and they're very repetitive. See, I'm very picky with fanfics, but when I'm really hooked on a certain trope, I usually ignore bad grammar and bad writing in general if it means I can read another of those fics. The thing that bothers me about these fics is the AU next gen, the super powerful next gen and the dislikable, annoying next gen. Let's go in parts.

AU next gen - Harry married Pansy and had 7 children, Hermione married Draco and had 11 children, next gen hates all Weasleys and Granpa Lucius is a teddybear. First of all, STOP WITH ALL THE KIDS! Women are not baby-popping machines, ffs. Second, their names. "Ebony Willow Malfoy" "Severus Sirius Colin James Albus How-many-more-dead-peoples-names-can-I-fit-here Potter", seriously people, it's like My Immortal all over again. Third, I'm not a Malfoy/Death Eater/Dark Side apologist. I recognize people change and grow up but to me some characters cannot be redeemed (Lucius), and I hate this little habit the fandom has of loving all dark side characters and making them out to be some misunderstood heroes while bashing the Weasleys. I love the Weasleys, and you can hate them all you want, you may point out theirs flaws and I might even agree with some of them but making the Weasleys to be evil, manipulative, uncaring, bloodsucking fame-whores just to justify your main pairing is ridiculous. I won't get into ship matters, you can ship whatever you want, just please make it reasonable and belivable(?).

Super powerful next gen - ok, ok, I know they're the Golden Trio & Friends' children, but that doesn't mean Lily Potter is a metamorphagus(?), Fred II can do wandless magic in his sleep and Hugo Weasley is some kind of genius who became an animagus at 11 years old while his big sister is part Veela. Seriously?

Dislikable, annoying next gen - everyone cries all the time, there are at least four different rivalries among the group and they do stupid things all the time, not to mention the whole "we can't tell you this and that and also the one thing you really want to know but I can tell you all about my owl, my Firebolt 9000000, my Hogwarts house and how awesome I am at quidditch"

Also hate how Ron gets no love in those fics. It's "Uncle Harry this" and "Aunt Mione that" and "yeah Uncle Ron kinda exists, idk tho"

'Back to Hogwarts' time travel isn't really my thing, neither is 'next gen goes to Hogwats with their parents', but I read a few and what most annoys me is stuff like 'lets change our names but have the same surname even though we're ridiculously different', 'let's excel at everything cause that's not suspicious at all' and 'future mrs. longbottom looks hot, let's bang' I think I've ranted enough for now.

** The problem of peggy sue fics, is the idea is so overdone by this point. The first few pioneering fic are great, after that its just the same stuff repeated by another author all over again in their own words.

Plus, if you're reading from Fanfiction.Net, remember one thing: The authors there are usually of teen/tween age with heavy influence from the western anime fandom. Just those two elements heavily defined how most fics will be written, which is horribly repetitive and cliched.

Combining those two, you have to realize the whole point of a Peggy Sue fic is to fix a certain plot point that the author find disagreeable, or to change the plot altogether to how they'd like it to be. So after the nail is changed, the (subpar) author would proceed to ignore the time travel altogether, because the purpose of time travelling for the author is completed in the first place

With that being said, fics like Sisyphus (by esama) and Oh God Not Again (by Sarah1281) end up standing out. I'd suggest giving them a quick read if you haven't encountered them. They both deconstruct the genre, but from different viewpoint

** Fanwanking is usually needed for most stories dealing with such fictional concepts.

Most time travel fics that redo Hogwarts are "old soul to young body" type - in those cases I am able to give a pass on such problems because I treat it as young body + less/differently developed physical brain + different hormones would probably mess quite a bit with the cognitive processes and behavior habits of "old brain" and who is to say how well the back-in-time copying was done.

It's a fiction process so no one actually knows what exactly you would need to transplant from one person to another to get the entire "person".

Our brains are apparently constantly changing to break and form concept associations which partially form both our memory and our reaction to everything around us. So with anything short of physical brain transplant (which is not what's described in most such stories) it shouldn't be possible to ever transfer a full copy of the older "version". For me it is actually easier to believe that I am reading about adventures of partial copies.

Even with very good copies, number and strength of associations matter in brains. For example, if you could somehow upload an adult's vocabulary to a teenager's brain - the knowledge of word definitions might be there, even memories of using the words, but the teen's speech unlikely to change until the new associations are strengthened enough for brain to start activating that knowledge during casual conversation.

On top of likely imperfect copy - it is pretty well established that our brains operate as a chem shop reacting both to external stimuli and many internal signals coming from our body. People start behaving very differently based on different drugs pumped into them and our brain + body is constantly using drugs to manage themselves. I don't just mean direct stuff like more extreme reaction to opposite sex - different hormonal levels will create a multitude of subtle differences that can overall change both how "old-brain" will behave and react.

Combine the two + add the fact that to a mid-30s adult school years are a barely remembered era faint enough in memory that very few moments would actually feel like a "repeat".

Given all of the above, I don't think repeat of school would be quite as boring, or that the adult-in-kid's-body would actually be capable of behaving like an adult - so my suspension of disbelief isn't broken on those details.

Particularly since I know what every kid and teenager usually feel like they are acting/behaving in a sensible and adult manner despite usually appearing less than mature to others - so when I read about time-travel OC being cool and collected I keep in mind that their internal impression might be just as mistaken as every other teen's.
