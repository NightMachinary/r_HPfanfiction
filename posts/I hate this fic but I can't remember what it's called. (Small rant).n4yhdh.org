:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a Harry/Fleur pairing fic a while ago but I can't remember what it's called, or what the plot was. All i remember was that I liked the fic somewhat, it had a whole romance plot for Harry and Fluer but right at the very last chapter it takes place years after they get together then tells you that they broke up and Harry is proposing to Daphne Greengrass. Now I like the Daphne pairing aswell but it had no lead up or anything, the only thing that hinted at it was Daphne flirted a bit with Harry and told Fluer that if they broke up she would jump in to replace her.


** It's linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7) and that Harry/Daphne ending was just a single "what if" chapter near the end. It's still technically Harry/Fluer

*** To clarify, there are a couple of epilogue chapters, one of which depicts Harry with Daphne after he and Fleur went there separate ways after years of separation due to school, and another, alternate epilogue that keeps Harry and Fleur together.
