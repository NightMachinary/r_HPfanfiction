Like, he survived every single assassination attempt. So, what if him surviving the killing curse gave him a sort of â€˜resistance to death'?

Because no one apart from him has ever survived it, how are we supposed to know if there are any after effects other than death?

Or maybe he's just resistant to the killing curse, which is more likely...


** I'm pretty sure that if he were hit with the killing curse now then he'd die. The only reason he survived the one in the forest was because of the horcrux.

*** But how do you know? No one's ever survived the killing curse, let alone two times, no matter what the reason was

**** The story straight up says that Harry survived because the killing curse killed the horcrux instead of him. I can't /prove/ that Harry isn't immortal because it's an unfalsifiable proposal. But that's at least what the story was attempting to imply, which in a fictional universe is functionally fact.

I'm fine with fics bending or breaking that conception as much as they want, obviously.

*** But by then he'd already collected them. Being the master of death is, for a lack of a better word, life changing. I don't think it's something so easily renounced

** There was a fanfic that played with the idea that because Major Spoiler: (MAJOR ONE)

Harry chose to come back he was not permitted to move on. There's only one train per person and he missed his.

Be warned this one's dark.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
