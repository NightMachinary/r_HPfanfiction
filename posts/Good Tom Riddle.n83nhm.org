Preferably with a personality as close to canon as possible, dark magic, snappy, manipulative, but somehow still good preferably. Thanks everyone! (All fics that fit this welcome unless there's a harem somewhere.)


** Have you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]? It's...crackier than what you want, but he's smart and he likes dark magic and he's manipulative. (But he's also sort of high. And happy.) You can give it a go, though :)

** There's an anthology of stories called "There's nothing to fear" that has a Voldemort who is still, well, Voldemort but his goals are more noble. He is a former Gryffindor and he fights for the rights of Muggleborns, Squibs, Hags, Goblins and the outcasts of the magical world instead of Pureblood supremacy.

  Being reincarnated as Harry Potter's fraternal twin sister really puts a new meaning behind "death is but the next great adventure." Grey!OC. Updates every week.

** When I saw the title I did wonder about a story with Harry as the chosen one suddenly being given a long list of Wizard and real problems to solve. Humans are destroying the planet what is the plan sort of thing. When Harry looks at them they all go well Voldermort had a plan, we might not have agreed with it however it would have worked.

I wonder if you could write a Wicked for Tom?
