:END:
The story is funny. It's a Sherlock Holmes xHarry Potter crossover. It kind of hard to describe, Harry's Aunt ends up marrying Sherlock's brother Mycroft. I think there were gnomes or Hobbits or something that were at war. Harry is a little kid in it. I remember it was on AO3 , I have been looking for it for the last few days I know the author update pretty frequently but haven't been able to find it.on google or AO3.


** I just so happen to be about to start reading that

It's Defendat Erit Scientia

**** Yeah, I'm not far into it but it's pretty good. But the random capitalization is really pissing me off. Every other sentence has a word that's just randomly capitalized. It's getting in my nerves.
