I apologize for the language. Google translate from Russian. Advise the Fanfics about the Dursleys who accepted Harry well. It is desirable AU Dursley: They are not afraid of magic, but they are not magicians. It would be cool if Vernon was a military man, with the corresponding consequences for Harry's growing up.


** A Better Man is the first one that came to mind for me. It's a personal favourite.

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

** You're my Density by robst is like that, I think. Last time I remember reading it at least. It's Harry/Hermiony and I don't believe it starts with good Dursleys but I'm pretty sure that changes. Pretty sure the Dursley's have a good presence in it though.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.
