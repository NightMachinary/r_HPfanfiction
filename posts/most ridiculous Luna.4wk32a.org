So first. A caveat. I do love Luna. She is adorable and sad.

Now. I've read a moderate amount of fanfiction I'd say. And it seems luna is often used ad the authors chance to either wedge in foreshadowing like a brick through a car window or just their chance to I clue some "kooky humour" by the loosest possible definition of kooky and humour. I've also read some truly touching examples of the character.

My topic. Is what is the absolute over the top ridiculous and or excessively or unnecessarily crazy Luna you've ever read.


** I'm not fond of seer!Luna. Or seems so obvious it's not even funny.

Truth is, Luna's not easy to write. In canon you don't see much of her. When she got an important role it is rare that she's well done, I reckon.

Now to answer the question, I think the most over the top Luna should be found somewhere in Rorschach's blot stories.

This one by Nonjon is pretty crazy too but perhaps not as over the top.

A really strange read though.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.

***** True. I apologize for my outburst. But whenever somebody links either Make a Wish or Larceny an uncontrolled rage takes over, because Luna ruined both ot them(more Larceny). Rorsch has a habbit of taking a good idea taking it in the right direction then turning around and fucking himself in the posterior with bullshit.

No need for that. One of my eyes starts twitching whenever I read a robst-style Hermione, so I can empathise.

** In general, it takes some talent to "write a good Luna". I have also read quite a number of fanfictions and Luna is often portrayed as a super seer, god blessed child or just crazy. She really is neither of them, granted she is not normal, she actually makes sense, but kinda speaks in her own language. Yes, she has a weird hobby searching for creatures (inherited from her father), but I'd say, she is a deceptive friendly and loyal person. I would gladly have her as a friend.

** There's a "Harry tells Britain to F off" story where all his friends and Lupin turn against him after the DoM incident.

At the end in the "where are they now" portion of the story, we learn that Luna was mauled to death by a lioness after she ventured too close to her cubs seeking her hallucinated snorkack.

I guess this counts as excessively crazy seeing that the narrator tells us she's actually schizophrenic.
