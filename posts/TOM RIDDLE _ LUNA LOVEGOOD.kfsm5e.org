So ... I rarely post here, but I really wanted to indicate very good fanfics about Tom Riddle / Luna Lovegood, a ship, unfortunately, rare. When I first read about Tom / Luna, I thought I wouldn't like it very much, but, heavens, today I'm totally in love with this couple. Unfortunately, there aren't many stories about them out there, so if you know of any, I would appreciate it if you shared it here.

Without further ado, let's get to the stories:

#+begin_quote
  When Luna makes a terrible mistake and ends up in a time she never imagined she'd been in, what will happen before she gets back? And what will she do when she realizes that Tom Riddle is in her year? Rated M for language, violence, sexual content. *This story is in the process of an edit for more canon compliance & (hopefully) better writing. 12/32 chapters edited.* Sequel now up.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Into Your Gravity. Luna must now learn to live a new life full of loss. But she also has a dangerous secret. When her future is thrown into question, perhaps the only place to look is the past. Rated M for language, violence, and sexuality.

#+begin_quote
  As a captive of Lord Voldemort, Luna Lovegood never thought she would live beyond the first 24 hours. Saved at first by her quick wit, Luna learns the depth of human evil...and becomes the Dark Lord's greatest weakness. Eventually LVLL.

#+begin_quote
  Et si la r√©alit√© de Tom Jedusor et de Luna Lovegood se t√©l√©scopaient par moment ? Ils ont tous les deux 16 bien que des ann√©es les s√©parent, c'est une rencontre improbable qui laissera des traces sur celui qui deviendra l'un des plus dangereux sorciers du monde.

** "Twelve Dark Moons" was one of the first fanfics I read, and is the only one of those first few that I remember anything about, especially positive. Second that recommendation (though I'll have to re-read to see if that holds up), and /definitely/ second the strong content warning. I'm curious to see the rest of the list in that sense, because unless one or both is heavily OOC, I don't know if there's a way to do this pairing without heavy/triggering content. You know what with Luna being one of the most likeable and kind characters who has already experienced her share of trauma, and LV being a literal Hitler analogue.

EDIT: people, please don't downvote this thread just because you don't like the pairing. We don't have enough good recommendation posts in the sea of jokey "prompts". Fanfic is niche. If you don't like the niche, move on.

*** Thank you for your comment !!

"Twelve Dark Moons" is really heavy, "Aux portes de Luna" has some parts, but not so much. "Into Your Gravity" and "Dark Matter" are light, but I don't think the characters are very OC, since Tom is in the "beginning", before becoming Voldemort, having to keep up appearances at Hogwarts.

And yes, Luna is so kind, totally different from Riddle

** I'm reading into your gravity now and I just finished chapter 19 with the necklace and now I'm afraid to continue because I'm afraid it's gonna be sad.

I love it. And I love reading from the perspective of a girl that isn't Hermione but I'm scaredddd.

*** I am very happy that you are reading my recommendation! From the chapter you're in now, everything will be more exciting (ok, a little sad to a certain extent, but ... without spoilers, you'll soon find out), reaching a crucial point for the sequel, "Dark Matter", which is even better than "Into Your Gravity" in my opinion

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
