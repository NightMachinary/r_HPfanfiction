I started reading ff in college so I'll also ask who reads HPFF while in class or at work? I very rarely will sometimes read for half an hour on lunch break....but would probably read more ff if I had a chance to at work. :)


** I do when I actually get to take a lunch, or if I have to go to the bathroom

**** She's the main character from the Netflix show the chilling adventures of Sabrina and unfortunately there are very very few crossover stories with Harry Potter. Very very few crossovers of any sort to be honest because the show just came out like 6 months ago, but I still hold out hope someone will write a good one.

** Part of my job involves very boring data entry so I use voiceover on my phone to listen to fanfic while I do it. It's actually increased my productivity lol.

** NSFW isn't jsut a work or school thing. I've got a very avid little reader in the house with me, who knows I like reading Harry Potter stories -- she's very fond of peeping at my screen and asking what the story is about.

So, I like to be aware of what could be on my screen when sh'es around :)

**** She is pretty adorable! She had a lot of trouble with reading until it "clicked" for her one day. she went from stuttering reading outloud at a snails pace to devouring whole books swiftly in the space of 2 or 3 months. it was fantastic. <3

** I used to work for a major company with 1000ish people working in "the factory" and 500ish people working in "the office." One of my main tasks was going over all the suppliers' compliancy documents and asking them for updates if the documents were outdated. Given the size of the company, this was boring and repetitive. I can't help it if one of the three open PDF files on my screens is a downloaded fanfic , can I?
