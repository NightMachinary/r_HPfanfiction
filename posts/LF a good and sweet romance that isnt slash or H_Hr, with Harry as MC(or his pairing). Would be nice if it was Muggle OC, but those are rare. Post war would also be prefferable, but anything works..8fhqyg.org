#+TITLE: LF a good and sweet romance that isnt slash or H/Hr, with Harry as MC(or his pairing). Would be nice if it was Muggle OC, but those are rare. Post war would also be prefferable, but anything works.

Bout the Muggle OC, I've read both Behind Blue Eyes and Grow Young with Me, so those are out. Loved both of them. Another sweet one was Maddley in Love, also everything from Dorothea GreenGrass is out too. And Shyguy too. I'm a sucker for romance, now that I think about it.


** Another muggle one is linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss by Ecmm)

Or another muggle one, linkffn(Second Wind by savinggrace711). Though I have to admit that the first few chapters of this one were rather bad, but the author seemed to realize that and the story improved after that.

Not muggle, but it's fluffy, sweet without giving (too much) diabete, is Hope by Jeconais. It's Harry/Gabrielle and it's not on FFN.

Or if you just want some fluff to pass time, any of James Spookie's older stories before "What we're fighting for" will do, though those tend to get rather repetitive if you read several in a row.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

  Post DH. After 9 years of wizard aristocratic life, Harry finally finds something that gives him the purpose he was searching for. And he finds it in a quirky American muggle girl. Rated T for language and suggestive themes. Second Wind 2.0 - Updated October 2016.

*** I think I've read most, if not all of James's work, including those old ones where he just now re-posted in ffnet. Hope is my favourite Harry/Gabby fic, too bad is incomplete.

I've seen Hocus Pocus being suggested sometimes in other threads, but the size is really a turnoff, its so so short. But I'll read it, its not like it would take me long anyways.

This Second Wind is new to me and it seems interesting.

Thanks a lot.

**** If it's anything, I'm also a fan of longer work. But Hocus Pocus is one of the only two short works that I enjoy. The other one being "Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much". I say give it a try.

** linkffn(10728064)

Post war H/Daphne with great characterization. It's a very slow buildup, but the relationship just feels extremely real.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
