  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** I think this is what your looking for. linkffn(9586702) I never finished it myself but it does have s dueling tournament eventually and I'm pretty sure Flamel is involved.

I want to write a crossover with Fate/Stay Night myself one day. Love the series but don't have time to work on it right now.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
