Never seen a post like this, so hope it's okay.

I desperately need someone to talk with about my fic, or even just the characters in the style I like to write. I feel like I'm going crazy running things over and over in my head. The only person I know IRL who does fanfic doesn't really like my style of fic, and vice versa. So it's just me, thinkin about it, on my own, for weeks.

If you've read my fic, it'd probably help, but it might spoil it a bit for you if you like it.

It's a Harry/Fleur where I try to have the characters be a little more realistic in their interactions. That's probably the fic in it's most basic form. I've made numerous other changes, but that's the key. People acting like people, even though they're magical people.

Shoot me a pm if you'd like to nerd out over the pairing and writing style.

*** I have. Im active in the discord, and the IRC is kinda dead. I havent found anyone there that shares my interest, so I figured I'd ask.

Thanks for the suggestions though!
