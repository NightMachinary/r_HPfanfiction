I remember something about him becoming The Headmaster, and then gets summoned to another world or goes back in time or something similar. Anyone have any idea about which one it is?

Edit: I do believe that it was a MasterofDeath!Harry fic, now that I think about I, and we've determined in the comments that this sub uses LF- looking for, rather than ISO- in search of


** It could be linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon)?

It's all in Harry's backstory, not the actual fic, but Harry does get married, become the headmaster, and get old, before being summoned hundreds of years into the future into a Firefly crossover.

**** I think the convention here is to use LF, standing for 'Looking For' and then a description.
