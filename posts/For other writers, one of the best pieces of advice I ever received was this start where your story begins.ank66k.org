So many fics I've read start at year one, at the very beginning when they really don't need to. All that ends up happening is canon rehashing and boringness a lot of people don't want to read. Don't get me wrong, there's been good fics starting at year one, but they have a driving force right from the beginning that so many fics lack.

Think about where the essentials of your story begins and start there, not necessarily the obvious starting point. In my fic, things had been AU since CoS but I start at HBP because that's where the story really amps up. I could have written it from CoS, but that would have been four years of extraneous information that I would have found boring to write that you didn't really need to know/ that could be explained through flashbacks more effectively.

Essentially, don't beat around the bush. Think about where you should start--it isn't always the most obvious place.


** To add to this, when setting the stage make it obvious that something has changed. If you are writing an HBP story and it has an AU background, make that clear early on. Don't go through five chapters of Snape's book and teenage drama only to reveal that Grindelwald is MoM in the sixth.

Every time I open a story that has an interesting premise and Harry is on the train or a day away from opening his letter or /whatever/, I have to restrain myself from closing the tab. I know I have to give it a chance, but I usually end up skimming the first few chapters or /years/ trying to do so.

** Totally agree, it's 100% boring to read from year 1 when the real plot starts at year 4.

On the subject of flashbacks, it annoys me to get a screen-size separator with "FLASHBACK" written in the middle. Shouldn't the author be able to make the reader understand it's a flashback without that indicator?

*** People on FFN don't know how to use the line breaks to separate scenes or delineate PoV switches.

--------------

One of the hallmarks of oldschool HP fanfics is the weird combinations of oOoOoOOOo or X-X-X-X instead of line breaks. I remember that it was fashionable at one time to use an acronym of the story's name like, =-=-H-P-a-t-P-S-=-= if the fic's name was "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".

** The opposite of the canon rehash is starting /after/ the story begins, and splicing in random flashback scenes to fill in the gaps of "How We Got Here". Eg, Harry facing the dragon challenge from the Triwizard Tournament as the first chapter of book one. I understand that non-linear narrative is a stylistic choice, but when it's written off-the-cuff and chapter-by-chapter as most fanfics are, none of it comes off as cohesive. Just random scenes that don't provide any sort of continuous flow to a story.

...Or maybe I'm too stupid and plebeian to "get" artistic/stylistic writing.

*** No, I think you're right the flashbacks should generally be avoided.

If there's truly essential "how did we get here" material, or stuff that's different than Canon, then a good writer should be able to include it in dialog, descriptions, and context clues, rather than resorting to a flashback full of clunky exposition.

**** I've been reading a non-linear fic and it's driving me bonkers.

It does the exact opposite of the typical Year One canon rehash which is thousands of words of pointless exposition of things we already know (and some additional rehashed fanon, like the Gringotts inheritance tests.) Instead, it starts right in the thick of the story, with Snape and Lupin being respectful colleagues, and flashes back to "Several years earlier". What's making me so angry is that each present-time chapter sets up mysteries, and each flashback scene carefully avoids answering the questions that the reader wants to know.

To me, it seems like a contrived method of perpetuating mystery and tension, by depriving the reader of information that is known by the characters in-story... instead of creating genuine conflicts.

This is exactly how I view flashbacks, most of the time. They can be done well, but so often even published authors with professional editors behind them can't pull it off. It's a big ask for fanfiction authors.

****** One way to keep flashbacks in check is to only use them as part of the action. Pensieves, Dementors, people getting knocked out, etc can be a good way to say: "Hang on a second, there's some background information you need." They feel more natural than just dropping into a 10,000 word explanation of why certain things are the way they are.

One thing JKR is really good at, in my opinion, is structure. For all the idiot-ball carrying characters and minor plot issues, she does structure /really/ well, revealing information at key points to nudge the audience along without spelling anything out until the big reveal.

Structurally, flashbacks should rarely be the "big reveal" section of the story or scene, until it is at the climax of said story or scene. Flashbacks to add mystery are all over the place in canon, while giving necessary context to current-time characters, but they should reveal /something/. Playing with /where/ the flashback takes place in the story or scene can completely alter it from being tiresome and boring, to a gripping revelation.

But yeah, hard to pull off.

***** I think flashes of certain pivotal or important moments from the past can be done well, especially interspersed within a scene in the present, but when it's a full-on hard cut to a flashback, and it's a brand new scene that you know is going to go on for a while, I tend to zone out.

***** As a storytelling tool, objectively I know that flashbacks as a narrative device can be used in an effective way to forward the plot without spending time rehashing things we already know.

But when I'm starting new fics that use flashbacks, I must be picking the wrong ones or something, because reading fanfic flashback sequences, they're neither used to show /or/ tell relevant information, but rather used to bait and switch.

** I don't really agree with this. I tend to prefer full seven-year stories, even if the divergence only gets clearer later on. It feels more complete. But of course, that doesn't mean canon rehash doesn't get old very quickly; so my solution is to make First and Second Year arbitrarily short, with lots of skipping and ellipsis, only showing us what's changed and leaving the rest to your memory. So for example, if we're imagining an Animagus Harry for whom the real difference starts in Second Year plot-wise, you'd still have First-Year to show all his introductions to the various characters, but the extent of the Broomstick Scene or the Troll Scene would be that we'd get to see the conversation in the aftermath of those scenes (which unlike the scenes themselves /would/ change as a result of what's changed with Harry).

** Completely agree. Way too often, I find myself reading a fic that starts out interesting, then dully meanders along for ages before /finally/ getting back to the point. If the author just skipped all that useless fluff, summarizing the important points and maybe stopping to flesh out a couple of the more pivotal ones, I might not skip ahead so much. (Because I do that. More than I should, probably, but I have little tolerance for slice-of-life stuff after encountering so much of the boring kind.)

So, if there's something vitally important that happens before the meat of the story begins, use timeskips. Use flashbacks sparingly. Long or frequent flashbacks are annoying (imo) for the same reason I hate prequels; I already know the state of things in the present, so reading about the past holds no mystery or tension.

If you really want to start in media res and then go back to explain how they got there, do so at a point /not far from the beginning./ If you start at the end of fourth year and then go all the way back to first year, yeah, I'm going to either lose interest or skip ahead. Instead, I'd recommend--in most cases--going back no more than a couple of weeks. Gives you a hook, but keeps you from losing the fish.

^{Upon re-reading it, I don't know how that metaphor's supposed to work. I just had plot hooks in mind and it somehow turned into a line that doesn't make logical sense. Sorry. XD}

** This is something I agonised over with Victoria Potter, where I considered starting the series at the beginning of fourth year. Ultimately I decided against it.

An important element of the story is witnessing Victoria's progression from magical novice to powerful witch; had the story started at fourth year, without having witnessed a major part of that progression, the reader would be presented with someone who comes off as a Mary Sue. On top of that, the way she progresses in magic is supposed to tell the reader important things about how magic works and therefore guides the reader in their understanding of magic for the rest of the series.

The other major barrier to starting in 4th year would be the supporting cast. By 4th year, they will all have significant amounts of history with each other. Indeed, one of the major themes of 4th year is dealing with the fallout of an event at the end of 3rd year which shifts the dynamic of some of the relationships. While this definitely can be dealt with in a "in medias res" way, with the reader being drip-fed information about what had occurred in 3rd year and why, the reader would essentially have entered into a conversation mid-way through, surrounded by strangers who have all these unknown backstories.

So I decided to start at first year and take the "snowball effect" route to building everything up. I continue to feel that it was the correct decision, but I do sympathise with the criticism that chapters 1-6 are all laying the groundwork for the later story rather than telling an interesting story in themselves (though of course, if someone were reading VP without ever having read the HP series, then chapters 1-6 would be an integral part of the story - another reason why I like to have them). Even though they cover much the same ground as canon, there are too many things in those chapters that I feel the story needs - for example, Victoria's pre-Hogwarts ability with magic, which is the first and most fundamental indicator of true talent; or her different relationship with the Dursleys than canon Harry, where she is treated better in material terms but still starved of affection and praise, which forms the basis of one of her character traits (vanity).

** I agree with this, you can have your story be as AU as possible, but just show stuff happening through a different way; whenever it's important to do so. Otherwise, yeah; just start as close as you possibly can to where your story actually starts.

So many stories start at year one, and they're nothing but rehashing, except for a few minor changes here and there, but even that gets boring/annoying after a while. So if your story really starts in I don't know, year 5 where the story picks up for you, start there.

That's really great advice.
