Ron comes from Devon and the idea of him having a West Country (correct me if I'm wrong but I believe Devon is West Country accent?) both strangely appealing to me and wrong. I think realistically he didn't have enough muggle interaction for this to be the case and definitely speaks with the same accents as his parents but it's a funny thought.

Do you think that wizards might have their own accent? Considering their relative isolation I would imagine it's plausible. I see the wizarding elite as (ironically) talking with an upper class British muggle accent or very close to.

I definitely tend to visualise the characters as having the accents they do in the movies, but I can't help but wonder what they should technically sound like-I suppose if it's not mentioned in the books it's likely not a noticeably unusual accent.


** I would expect the Weasleys would have twinges of a West country accent but not as strong as Hagrids for example.

Harry would have a fairly plummey home counties accent as would Hermione, but she would be a bit more well spoken.

Dean would have a modern East London accent (i.e, not cockney). Lavender is a bit Essex-y in my head, the Patils slightly northern/Midlands.

For some reason Stephen Fry gave Tonks a brummie accent which makes no sense as she says wotcher - that's a classic "norf london" accent - think Idris Elba in Luther. Lupin has a slight Welsh lilt every now and then because of his mother.

I've always imagined Pansy as a Scouser but nothing in the text supports this, it's just random.

***** The Beatles with their northern accents were kind of a big deal when they became popular all over the UK. I always think of that part in A Hard Day's Night when Ringo is wandering around and gets yelled at by the cop on the bicycle. He turns around and yells, "Southerner!" and with his accent, it comes out "soorthenuh!"

Also, the Monkees have a song on Headquarters called Randy Scouse Git, which in the US we're like "Who's Randy Scouse and why are they telling him to get out of here?" That ... is not what it means at all.

I adore regional accents and word usage here in the US. There's always the great soda vs pop debate. My very good friend grew up in Minneapolis and while he doesn't have much of an accent himself, his mom sure does and it's adorable. Also, they don't play Duck, Duck, Goose there. They play Duck, Duck, Gray Duck which is something that is VERY regional.

Local news anchors cultivate a very generic American accent because they move around to so many different markets. It's endlessly fascinating.

****** I find accents so interesting, along with regional variations.

In Australia, according to Wikipedia we have three accents, but I have only really heard the one in real life and the second only on TV occasionally (broad Australian accent-what the world imagines we sound like I think). The third I have no idea. But we do have some regional variations in words, New South Wales for example says 'bubbler' for what I would call a drinking tap or fountain.

I watch Doctor Who and I love trying to guess where the actors might be from. My favourite accent is Yorkshire.

I have what I think is a funny Australian story. A few years ago we were on an Alaskan cruise and me and my dad shared a table at lunch with a couple from Perth. The day before, we'd been in Juneau and while at the visitor's center at the Mendenhall Glacier, we saw a bear, so we were chatting about that. She was a known bear and the rangers were doing a good job of keeping her away from people, so it was all right. The wife of the couple says that she was afraid to come to Alaska because she /might/ see a bear.

I just kind of blinked at her for a few moments and then said, "Wait, you live in Australia where even the insects are actively trying to kill you and you are afraid of /possibly/ seeing a bear in Alaska?" And then we had a whole conversation about sharks and how they glue GPS antennas to them so the alarms will be set off on shore. But, /maybe/ seeing a bear is scary.

Poisonous snakes and spiders you don't really see, they are as scared of us as we are of them and 90% of people live very urban. I fancy my odds against a spider more than I ever would a bear, I always say that most of the world is much more dangerous than Australia because they have big land predators.

Sharks are rare, but sometimes there's sightings and they definitely do worry me. But I am told that most sharks aren't interested in us anyway.

I'm several days late on this, but fuck it, I do what I want. Mostly the use of bubbler is an east coast of Wisconsin (source: this here [[https://i.redditmedia.com/jeRTefp7oreOrfy1jLsdgoLUXadfOVw8PKwTq2fVWBM.jpg?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=305705a086882d8c006d5bbf4b78b729][map]]), since the original brand of drinking fountain was, if I recall correctly, Bubbler.

******* Well, posting this from Lancashire, having been born and brought up here, and assuming you don't want to get into the really fine local variations, the obvious one is a few extra contractions, mostly of 'to the,' 'of the' and 'with the'.

For some reason I've never been able to fathom, those are written differently than they're pronounced, so where I'd /say/ "I'm going to't pub wi't dog for a pint o't new beer they're serving", for some reason it gets written "I'm going to t'pub wi' t'dog for a pint of t'new beer they're serving." Never figured out why that was, but that's been the convention as long as I can remember.

There's a few irregular past tenses: treated becomes 'tret', frightened becomes 'frit', beaten becomes 'bet'.

Although, and this can't be emphasised enough: in this day and age, most of the old dialect is used sarcastically or for comic emphasis. And we tend to tone the accent down for non-speakers. A /lot/. Except when unleashing a torrent of Authentic Northern Gibberish would be funny.

If you want to actually hear a fairly broad range of Lancashaire accents, though, there's plenty of Coronation Street clips and episodes on Youtube. In particular, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlieHy6SjM]] features Roy Barraclough, who's from Preston, pretty much dead centre of Lancashire and kind of an average of all the Lancashire accents that aren't Liverpool (where they speak Scouse, practically a different language) or Manchester (where they use most of the same dialect but have an easily-mocked accent, they sound like aliens from one of those other planets that have a north). Most of the rest of the characters you hear (apart from the token posh bird) have various shades of Lancashire accent, with only a couple who're authentically Manchester.

(If you want what Augusta Longbottom /almost certainly/ sounds like, look up Roy Barrclough's skits with Les Dawson, the two of them in drag as Cissie and Ada. Augusta grew up Ada, but nowadays she cracks on she's been Cissie all along...)

Cricket as a working-class sport /was/ a thing, but only in some of the First-Class counties - Lancashire and Yorkshire being the two most notable ones. Derbyshire, to the best of my recollection, wasn't among them, and even if it was, it would've been in the mining parts, not the cotton-spinning parts.

There was an old belief - how based in fact I couldn't say, the real cricket buff in my family was my grandmother, and she's some years past me being able to pick her brains on the matter - that there was something about working in a coal mine that turned out horrifying pace bowlers.

Kid's got a ratty old Wisden in his room though. He doesn't actually play, mind you, but he follows the results when he can and likes playing with the numbers in his head. Making the statistics make sense pleases him.

** Honestly, I read in an American accent (California American, specifically) because I'm American. The thought of trying to read with any other English accent seems really daunting to me.

I don't think wizards would have their own accent, I'm not sure they're isolated enough. Again, I'm just thinking of the U.S. here because that's what I know best, but I imagine that a wizard living in Alabama would have a deep southern accent, whereas one that lives in California would have the west coast accent.

I do, however, think they could be oblivious to the muggle lingo of their region. For instance, New Yorkers saying its "brick" outside and meaning cold, or people in Northern California saying they're "finna" (gonna) do something.

Wizards do seem to have limited interaction with muggles sometimes, on the other hand that don't seem to speak all that differently so they probably don't have quite the right isolation to have a completely different accent. Wizards have a lot more freedom of movement then muggles, able to essentially apparate all over the UK whenever they feel like, so that might have influenced them into having a more generic accent potentially.

** I have the Weasleys with West Country accents, but not extreme. In one story, Ginny jokes about how her brothers sound like a bunch of pirates when they all get together. I imagine Percy would work the hardest to adopt a posher southern accent. Harry probably has a bit of a posh accent as well due to growing up with the Dursleys who do seem to put on airs.

** I grew up in Yorkshire before moving to Cornwall and later Devon (south Devon though to be specific) and the idea of Ron being a janner really appeals to me.

I live in Scotland now though and the nomadic life has fucked my accent (Scots mostly think I sound posh English but I don't hear it myself as no posh english gals uses the word nowt or drops quite as many letters as I tend to do)

If he's a Devonshire boy I'd love to change my headcanon but it'll be a stretch because the south west largely has accents I associate with farmer types and I feel like he and his family wouldn't have been hanging out with them, primary school has a hell of an impact on a kids accent and like... Other than muggleborns did any of them go to school with other kids?

I honestly don't know what the canon is for that but I always assumed they must have been homeschooled because that would be tough for sleepovers otherwise.

And it depends where you are with the "wee" I think - I'm on Shetland and I reckon they'd think you foreign if you said something small was "wee" rather than 'little' (or 'peerie' if you're a local, don't try it if you're just visiting though everyone -including us interlopers- will find it ridiculous without an Isles accent to back it up)

A personal favourite Scottishism is the "ach" of frustration, which when fueled with some real vitriol it's a thing of beauty. I do sometimes catch myself using some Devon grammar and miss the SW though.

The other thing I thought that was really interesting was how much ice cream there was around the area. We were there in October and it was not warm, but there was an ice cream truck parked right there at the castle. We did a bus tour of the lowlands and the driver was super happy we could get ice cream at a little shop in Anstruther.

**** Well, janner mostly. I lived in Plymouth for alf a decade and folk down there don't sound particularly like the stereotypical "Devonian" folks you hear on TV or radio or whatevertf

There's a hell of a breadth of difference between someone from Exeter and someone from Plym or from out in the country, and having spent my time in cities while living down that way the "stereotypical" Devonshire accent you hear sounds like the country boys far more than any of the janners I lived wi.

And growing up in the west country is obviously going to influence an accent, but growing up anywhere would surely be negated by not actually socialising with the locals, which I feel the Wizards would have been limited with considering primary would have been tough - I can't imagine Fred and George going to yer local Nursery long enough to pick up an accent without getting kicked out due to their chaos 😂

Tonks is definitely from the East End of London.

Finding a natural accent for the Weasleys is hard. Maybe West Country? Though I can't hear them saying things like 'Where he to?' or 'gurt' lol. Definitely not Cornish though. Maybe Herefordshire?

** I'm American, so I'm not that knowledgeable about the distinctions of British accents. I can identify some London accents, Scottish accents and maybe a few others, but when, for example you say "West Country," I got no idea what that means exactly.

I find, however, that I am very susceptible to phonetic spelling of dialogue- like Hagrid's accent I had little trouble imagining, even before the movies came out. Again, I'm not knowledgeable enough about the way British accents sound to write that way - so I don't- but it plays heavily into my Headcannon. I think that there's this stereotypical British accent that my brain defaults to if I don't have the phonetic spellings.

On a related issue, I somewhat recently (a few years ago now) picked up what I think must be a first (American) printing of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- it uses a lot of Americanisms that I find completely immersion breaking- the Weasleys saying "Mom" to Mrs. Weasley was the thing that really broke my immersion, but also "trash can" instead of "dustbin," "sweater" instead of "jumper," things like that. In later printings (definitely of the later books) I'm pretty certain that they switched to American spellings of things "Defense Against the Dark Arts" as opposed to "Defence Against the Dark Arts" for example, but kept British names for things.

*** Haha, I am Australian myself. I watch a lot of Doctor Who and my mother's British so I do have some awareness of different accents in the UK but just barely-I can maybe recognise a couple. West Country is stereotyped as the farmer accent (also pirates), Hagrid speaks with a West Country accent, as does Mr Dawson (Christopher Rylance) in Dunkirk I believe.

I think any book labelled Sorceror's Stone has the Americanisms-but every book afterwards goes back to Britishisms, which must be jarring for the reader. There's a [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2001/08/25/differences-between-british-and-us-versions-of-ps/][list]] on the lexicon that has all the changes.

It's funny, in Australia we mostly use Britishisms so none of them confused me in Harry Potter. What confused me, and wouldn't confuse the majority of the world, is that Harry was going to school in September rather than February.

**** I don't ever remember being confused by Britishisms at all, and I was around 8 or 9 when I started really reading HP. Probably the most confusing thing would have been words like "jumper" that don't seem to be simple synonyms. For example, "dustbin" and and "trashcan" are literally different words that mean the same thing- clearly synonyms. Interestingly, the one thing that confused me until embarrassingly recently was whenever Dumbledore does a toast- he usually says "raise your glasses." I thought that it was some quirky wizard custom for people to raise their EYEglasses when giving a toast.

Also of note for the publishing history of the first book, I had, for the longest time, a softcover copy of the first two books- from what I understand, JKR vetoed the Americanisms AFTER the Sorcerer's Stone had been published for subsequent books, and this veto also fell into place for subsequent printings of the Sorcerer's Stone- I assume that having a softcover copy meant it was a later printing. Part of the reason I now have an earlier printing is because shortly after they announced the cover change for American copies of the book I went looking for hardcover copies of them with the original Mary Grandpre cover art because I was afraid that they would fade away and I'd never complete my hardcover collection.

**** I've concluded that there's a "pureblood accent" which is partly propagated by Hogwarts, much like RP in Muggle England.

JKR is pretty scarce on how purebloods get their schooling pre-Hogwarts (I don't think the Weasleys are the most representive sample). Some combination of small-group dayschooling and homeschooling by parents or tutors.

It's plausible that some (magical-raised) halfbloods were Muggle-schooled; they would pick up the local accent almost as much as muggle-raised would.

But purebloods don't interact with Muggles enough, and Statute considerations would mean most halfblood children wouldn't either. So they'd talk a lot like their parents do (and their friends their age; I assume there are some).

IIRC, there is evidence for sociolects (Mundungus Fletcher).
