linkffn(Not Dumbledore by kathryn518)

EDIT: For those who don't know, they are the author for "I'm still here" and "I still haven't found what I'm looking for" which are 2 fics that get recommended a lot here.


** Brilliant!

This was a wonderful one-shot, thank you for sharing.

*** Chilord had a website at [[https://www.chilord.com][chilord.com]] which mentions the FanFiction Federation as where he keeps his in progress works. There's a link there that requires a (free) login, which is where the posts are. Bear in mind that these are not and will unfortunately never be complete.

** Pretty nice. This fic succeeds in showing that Ron can be smarter than he lets on, and that even after the society was supposed to attain a perfect peace, there will be an underlying "dark hero" force to maintain that peace and the gullible public's happiness.

** I definitely thought this was going to be based on that old ‘Dumbledore is Ron from the future' theory that was kicking around before the last book care out haha. I might've been mistaken, but that was a Good read!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
