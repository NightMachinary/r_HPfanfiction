Hello everyone, Im working on creating [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Salem_InstituteRP/][The Salem Institute]], a magical school in the USA, like Hogwarts - just American.

Right now, we are really interested in finding players who can be super active, as teachers, as well as lots of students.

We have created a large amount of lore, and background information on the Wizarding USA, and the magical population. So if you are interested, or you know someone who might be interested.

Please check us out!
