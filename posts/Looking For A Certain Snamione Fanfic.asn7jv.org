There was a story I read a few years ago where a I think a potions accident happens and Severus and Harry switch bodies.

What I remember from the story

- Harry in Snape's body is unconscious and in the infirmary
- Hermione falls in love with Severus in Harry's Body
- She masturbates to the "new and improved" Harry
- Severus was working on a potions problem and Hermione finishes it for him
- Ron eventually finds out about the switch
- Severus can "tap" into Harry's memories

Please if anybody knows it please tell me. Thank you very much.
