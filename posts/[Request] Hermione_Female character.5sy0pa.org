Just as the title says, I'm looking for Hermione/girl. Any girl, I'm not terribly picky, just not with Ron, or Harry, or Draco. Kinda hard to search for since I think this isn't terribly popular.


** Hermione/Luna: linkffn(crazy little things by dreiser) Hermione and Luna work together in magical university and fall for each other.

Hermione/Cho: linkao3(your story's all wrong by attila) Cho is a healer. Hermione's her new patient.

Hermione/Pansy: linkao3(set your hope on fire by theviolonist) pansy and Hermione run into each other at a gay bar.

Hermione/Ginny: linkao3(the letter by burning_arrow) Harry comes off a bit bad but no bashing.

  "So you're a dyke now," Pansy said after they'd settled at a table far from the pounding noise, sipping on a mai tai.Hermione winced. "Don't use that word.""It seems you're never quite done policing what I can and can't say," Pansy said.

  "Well," Cho says, "my first name's Ermintrude, so." "Right," Hermione says again. "Well, that explains that, then."
