:END:
So in this one, Harry accidentally gets transported to another world where he's a Death Eater and Voldemort's right hand. He stays in that world for a while and eventually gets sent back to his own world. When he arrives back, he's in front of Voldemort about to get the Dark Mark. He plays along and kills Voldemort, but then finds himself on trial in front of the Wizengamot and Fudge for being a Death Eater, which he manages to get out of.
