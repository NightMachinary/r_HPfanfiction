Natural 20 has this subplot in second year where a muggle police department finds out about magic due to a botched obliviation job, and they send messages to themselves and leave audio tape records to remind themselves whenever they get obliviated again while they investigate as much as they can about the true reasons behind the many murders in the early 80s. I'm looking for any stories with similar plots, where muggles figure things out and they're somewhat clever about it.


** It's maybe tangentially related, but there's also: */Escalation/*, by Bobmin356. A humorous one-shot about the trouble with Obliviations in the world of modern electronics.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** I've asked this before and haven't found anything quite like it, the subplot was the best thing about Nat20.

The Iron Lady fic was ok, but that has muggles as ahead in organization/Intel instead of the underdogs (and for some reason had the absolutely stupid "conscript Harry and co to be child solders, look they have a military rank' thing. Ugh)

Watching this. If you find a story about the muggle world catching on but struggling to do so from a position if weakness (instead of the more common 'magic gets blown open to the world and can't be contained' or 'superior muggle organization figures out about magic and manages the issue' plots), I wanna see it
