:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What's that one fic where Harry spies on luna using the marauders map because he can't physically be near her or see her and Luna can tell that Harry is spying on her and does this little twirl whenever he uses the map to check on her to say hi and they eventually mutually masturbate that way and I think there's this thing about witches bonding to men to drain them of their magic or something and Harry can hear and see magic cores while luna can only see and that's special somehow

Ummm.... Yeah... I might be confused about the second part but the thing I'm looking for is the one with the map thing thaaaaankksss

** Nope you're correct about the second part. I was thinking of this fix yesterday but couldn't remember the name.

** You're thinking of The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs. Unfortunately, I don't think we're allowed to directly link it, but it is still up in FFN.

*** That's the one. Why wouldn't you be allowed to directly link it?

**** Because it has explicit content involving minors. Directly linking that stuff goes against both Reddit's policy and this sub's policy, which is why the ffnbot's post was removed on the other commenter's request for it. I'm pretty sure they have a list of fics you can't directly link somewhere on this sub, but I'm on mobile and haven't figured out how to find it
