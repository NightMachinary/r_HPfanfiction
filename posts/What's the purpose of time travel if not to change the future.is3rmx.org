I've seen quite a lot of fics where Harry decides to be as 'mediocre as possible' in order to not change the timeline... which is stupid as his presence already has changed the timeline. My question is... Does it bother you to see rehashed the canon?


** I feel like anyone who goes back in time, unless they hid away from all people everywhere, would change the timeline. The question is how much. I don't mind if canon is changed, but it's awfully difficult to do well. Stories that go back to the marauders era are common, but then Harry seems to end up just being chucked into school as some previously home-schooled student under a false name, given a half a minute warning from Dumbledore not to, you know, mess around with time too much, and then left to his own devices. I feel like I'm still looking for the perfect time travel story, although some I've read have been good.

** A lot of the the the logic is that Harry (Or whoever is travelling back in time) can only predict things and hopefully change the big, really bad stuff, if he let's the Stations of Canon happen as much as he can allow hinself ethically. (And, sadly, that often means they think "is it ok I let Ginny get possesed?" but not" What about stopping Bertha Jorkins from running into two bad situations and then dying because of it? What about not letting Frank Bryce run into Voldemort in Riddle manor and dying?" - Basically, only the big main characters feature in their minds, too...).

I am ok with a story starting out that way. It makes sense somebody would be cautious. But I figure nobody is good enough recreating the past that things will stay exactly the same and that small changes will start to snowball with time. If a a stiry does not start to diverge from canon after some time I am usually not that happy. -That said, there are exceptions. Maybe the protagonist TRYS to change things and timee seems to effectively fight back trying to realign itself to canon continuity, for exasmpld. That 's cool with me. Trying tyo see a Protahonist fight against time and fate can be interesting even if outwardly little changes in the time line. Trying to see a protagonist realise they can only change that much and use what little they can change to the best of their abilities is interesting, too.

I think I'd also be fine with a protagonist who ends in the past by mistake. Maybe they have a good life, a family, a future. And they realise: Changing ssnything can destroy that. So, they either don't or are reluctasnt about it, at least. - In that case I'd read the story for the internal drama.

** My favorite time travel stories are generally involving adult Harry (and/or others) physically time traveling - none of this 50 year old in a 10 year old's body - where he/they are going to absolutely change the course of the original timeline. Finding and destroying the diary before it gets its hooks in Ginny, destroying all the Horcruxes as soon as possible, etc.

** Generally the logic is that any change, even a seemingly good one, can have drastic repercussions and often entirely unpredictable ones. The time traveler can only know for certain that voldemort gets defeated in the timeline where everything happens in canon. Any change risks giving up everything.

It's not about just changing the timeline /at all/, it's about trying to minimize the damage and make sure it's as close to the original timeline as possible.

It makes a boring as hell story though

** I like how it's handled in Crossing Lines by plutoplex. The travelers' attempts to fix canon cause canon's tragedies to happen. It's really fun to see them praising Peter for his loyalty and heroism, which earned him a posthumous Order of Merlin, and he's like, Posthumous?! Damn, I'd better do things differently.

** It doesn't really bother me, but it doesn't really interest me either and I don't tend to read those kinds of fics for very long.

A time-travel fic that doesn't change canon? One I'd like to see (and am working on plotting out atm) is a kind of 'Groundhog Day/It's a Wonderful Life' thing, but for the secondary characters that Ignorant Oblivious Harry knows bugger all about. He won't be able to change events he knew would happen before he travelled, because everything he does when he travels back already happened and thus he can't contradict/change his own memory like that, but he can find out that Remus and Tonks had a fight before the battle and died angry with each other and then fix that, so they die a little more resolved. He can find out that Lavender's younger brother falls from a tree a little before the battle and dies before medical attention can arrive, then save him. He can find out all these little things he never paid attention enough to know about, then fix them for the better.

** Time travel in HP universe doesn't automatically change the future unless the time traveler is not careful enough or purposefully messes with the timeline. As we see in PoA the time travel doesn't create an alternative timeline, rather the events of the original timeline already include the time traveler. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3zTfXvYZ9s][this]] video explains it very well).

I will say right away that I don't read time travel fics about going back to Harry&Co's first year or their childhood and prefer time travel back to Marauder or Riddle's era, so there's no canon rehash either way. For me the appeal in trying not to change the timeline is the angst that comes with knowing future events and having to let them happen. Though I also like it when characters do try but since they were always present in the past nothing would work. Seeing as in lot of the fics time travel is accidental and happens post Battle of Hogwarts, I find it highly understandable that the characters would try not to change anything. First, they hope to find a way to get back to the future and who would want to return to the world they don't recognize. Secondly, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. There's no guarantee that you wouldn't make things worse, no sense in risking it when the victory is already assured. I actually like fics wheere time traveler(s) try to change things only to end up worse off (I once read a fic where Arthur had died before Ron and Ginny were born).

** To steal everything not nailed down.

Or to meet your heroes, have a history essay due next week but know nothing of the person you are doing it about? Well, the only solution is obviously to go back in time and interview the guy.
