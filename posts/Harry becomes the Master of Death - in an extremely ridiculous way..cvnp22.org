Got any fics where Harry becomes the MoD in a really funny way?

He could accidentally disarm Dumbledore who threw that ring at him or something.

I need something funny.


** IIRC, insane!Dumbledore literally throws Harry the Elder Wand and then hides the stone in a transfigured orange, of all things, and gives it to Harry in linkffn(Core Threads).
