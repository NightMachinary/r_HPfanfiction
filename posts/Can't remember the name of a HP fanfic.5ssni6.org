I remember reading this hermione time travel fanfic and she was enrolled into the school as a Beauxbatons transfer student. I believe that in the story she changed her name, her hair colour to blonde and constantly wore Beauxbatons uniform, due to Dumbledore insisting that she isolate herself so that in the future, she won't stand out. She was I think sorted into Hufflepuff and it was a Hermione x Remus fic.....Also during the story, there was this part where Snape intentionally messed up Hermione's watch so that she would stay locked in the library with Remus during the full moon because he wanted her to know that Remus was a werewolf. She also researched ways to go back to her own time and wrote her notes in french. I really want to read this story again... so if you could find it please let me know!!
