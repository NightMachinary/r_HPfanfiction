  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** These are both slash fics, eventually ending up Tom Riddle/Harry/Snape, so YMMV.

  Voldemort is finally dead, or so the wizarding world believes. Unfortunately, Harry knows better. Non-compliant with DH (written and first published in 2006)

  Summary: Voldemort is finally dead, or so the wizarding world believes. Unfortunately, Harry knows better. A/N: Written for the HP Reversathon, for Ziasudra, who asked for Harry/Voldemort and Harry/Tom, a post-war dystopia, featuring OutForOwnGood!Voldemort and TryingToSaveWorld!Harry, coexistence becoming a battle of wills, complicated manipulation, psychological tension, fights for dominance, unwillingness to compromise, dark humor, and dubious consent. Possibly a mention of the giant squid. *g* Thanks to my beta readers, Regan V, Ella Bane, Snapetoy, and GMTH. And thanks to the lovely Llama for being so patient with me.
