:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm sorry lads but I need this super quick. The premise is that lily is sad and James sends her an anonymous letter to make her happy. Any takers?

Edit : She has become sad with the pressure of everything really. It's at Hogwarts. I seem to have lost the fic. It would be really helpful to me as a friend is going through something similar and I need ideas for the annonymous messages


** Is this a fic you can't find or a writing prompt? If it's a lost fic, more details would help! At Hogwarts, during the war, AU? Why she was sad?
