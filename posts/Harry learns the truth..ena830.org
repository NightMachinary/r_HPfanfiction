''Harry learns that Snape was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy.''

I'm looking a fanfiction that goes along these lines, it can be the main plot of or it can just apart of it but I want to see how different people envision harry reacting to this news.

*** So... a lot is wrong here and not actually canon.

1. The attack against the Potters was in october 31st 1981

2. The books make it clear that there were two "candidates" for the prophecy right away, Neville and Harry, even though they weren't born yet, because the prophecy announces the birth of said person.

3. The alleged recruitment is not canon, is something JK Rowling misremembered, as Hagrid said Voldy never tried to recruit them. And even if you can argue that Hagrid is an incredibly unreliable source given that he doesn't know much, I think JK established that the fans cannot begin to take her additions to the story seriously with all the tweaks and trying to change canon shit. It is not written anywhere in the book, so it is not canon, and the only actual canon reference that we have about it denies it. It is, at most, a headcanon.

4. Prophecies in HP do actually get fulfilled, at least the ones regarding our main characters. Excluding of course the shit Trelawny spews every other lesson, because they are not actual prophecies and her Inner eye is more than slightly fucked up. Dumbles was only trying to impart on Harry that prophecies do not take free will and the importance of a self fulfilled prophecy. It is true that not all will come true, but given that Dumby is more than a little manipulative towards HP, I have a hard time believing everything he says, but that is up to each one of us to believe it or not ;)

*** I had always hard time to believe that Snape was torn for twenty years by his revealing of the prophecy. Yes, it was very unfortunate, and yes it could possibly lead to death of a woman he was interested in (I have hard time to say that she had loved her, because [[https://youtu.be/t4mqHdd5gzo?t=92][Shrek is right]], if he loves her, he has to let her go). But it *was* a mistake, he really did not meant to hurt her.

**** I think he prob had a lot of trauma and shit and all the thing every Snape fan says and we are tired of hearing(I'm one of them, and my otp has to be SS/HG /Just because they are the best written fanfics I've ever seen/ and not at all compatible with canon) HOWEVER, saying that he was too young at the age of 20 when HP had to deal with a lot of the same shit childhood wise is doing a disservice to both of their characters. I know HP had support and bla bla, but Snape was no child and he recognized his mistake afterwards. (I don't know if I got my point across, but I'm a little busy rn)
