I've read so many fics, and in the fics that have the character go through a self-improvement/'training' phase, there is often a physical exercise component. For example, I'm reading the beginning of linkffn(The Serpentine Subterfuge), where the main character starts working on her physical strength through exercise.

This fucking triggers me. (Especially because the main character is a skilled potioneer that could easily make a potion to increase her physical ability.) Not /once/ have I seen any fic where the character improves their physical body through some form of magic - whether it be a ritual or spell. It's always something stupid, like lifting weights, or running - it's always something /muggle/. Does the concept of magic just flee these authors' mind when it comes to this segment of a fic, or is there some other reason for this?

Because I /really/ don't care for reading about the protagonists' daily exercise regimen when you could have magic take care of it and move to a more substantial plot point.

** You haven't read any stories where Harry grows a foot taller and acquires an Adonis-like body over the summer through a regimen potions that "undo" the malnutrition the Dursleys supposedly subjected him to? I think that's a pretty popular trope. My main problem with it is that Harry doesn't have to work for it.

*** Not really, but that doesn't sound well balanced either.

Regardless, in stories like The Slytherin Subterfuge, where the character should be beyond capable of helping their physical selves magically, it's frustrating to see the author resort to exercise.

I, personally, would like to see something more along the lines of a character discovering or implementing a magical method to improve themselves physically.

** First, for example linkffn(11574569) (one example) has body improvement through rituals, if you get over the mild case of pedophilia in the fic. [1] In general, Gray!Harry or Dark!Harry fics tend to give magic more power, especially in terms of self-improvement. Light!Harry fics tend to give muggles more power.

Second, there are some reasons for this:

- People often get drilled how important sports are. They do sports themselves, and they invest quite a lot of time in them (or have people they like that do). When you invest something into something, your first instinct is always to defend it. You bought an iPhone? Apple is superior. You have a PC, and no console? [[/r/pcmasterrace]]. You play tennis? Football is for wankers. It's basically [[http://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sports.png][this]] effect.

- "The Wizarding world is bad, we need to fix all aspects of it" - a very common sentiment in FF. Muggleborns need to get more training for the wizarding world, students don't exercise enough, they disregard all the superior muggle stuff and are incredibly backwards (See: "How can you not have cellphones? Best invention evaaar" - Someone to Harry, when he has a video-mirror in 1994), ... - so we completely need to fix the system. Start with sport.

- Self-Improvement must come at a cost (at least the author thinks so), so letting your character run for a bit is easy, and something the author as well as the reader can easily relate to. You can only train Harry so much with spells.

- You want to give Harry an advantage over trained magic-users, and any ritual he does they'd done as well if it was easy. So you need to either give Harry an aptitude for these things (like for flying) /or/ give him access to a resource no one else has (Horcrux in head, black library)

[1] (I say mild case, since Harry had been in prison without any human contact since he was twelve, so I'd think he never grew up emotionally from that. Also, his body is also young, and hormones exist.) Anyways, the relevant stuff is in chapter 14:

That the house hadn't affected that ritual was a minor miracle.

People do tend to use nutrition potions to heal but rarely more than that. I figure they should at least take some effort to brew/ learn the specific spell for spells that strengthen a person. I'm pretty sure Hermione briefly points out a few to Harry in GoF, before the dragon but they're advanced newt spells so they don't try them; I'd have to check though.

** If there was a portion for it, or a magical way to "enhance" your features, wouldn't every adult in Harry Potter magically look like a model or an athlete?

I feel the fact that a major number of adult individuals (in all ranges of magical ability) we are introduced to are very average is telling that such a potion or magical means isn't possible. I feel like certain things, such as make-up, nail colour, hair styling etc. can be performed via spell or potion or whatnot, but if someone wants to physically improve their fitness, the muggle way is the only way?

It's never really bothered me before, and I feel like if I read a piece where a potion fixed it all, I'd find it odd unless it was properly explained. (I could see a daily potion or "beauty elixar" or whatnot for vitamins/minerals or to help with skin/hair/teeth health.)

#+end_quote

Is that actually so? I can't think of any potions or spells which are a combination of easy, safe, cheap, permanent, and positive. You can create temporary increases in ability, but they're usually unsafe or indirect (engorgement charm can make you explode, for instance), prohibitively difficult or expensive to create (Felix Felicis), or harmful (any poison ever). You can /fix/ physical issues permanently, but I can't think of anything like a healing spell which /improves/ physical ability, rather than restoring it.

In fact, magic is often roundabout in how it accomplishes its goals. Yes, sometimes you can simply levitate an object with a spell. Sometimes though, you make something follow you by giving it feet. A spell to increase your strength might very well give you an extra set of arms and legs rather than increasing your raw strength.

Look at it another way. You could, potentially, use a charm or potion which may be difficult and dangerous in order to improve your cardiovascular health. Or, you could have a running regimen. It's not difficult to run regularly, especially not in a place like Hogwarts with how large and open the castle grounds are. It's basically permanent, at least as long as you do it to some regularity. It also doesn't rely on anything but your body. No potions, no spells, no magic of any sort. As long as you have your body, you have the results of your exercise. It's simple, reliable, and effective.

Besides that, it's good for you, and potentially improves your magical ability. If it's just mental, it helps. I don't know why, but physical exercise does make you just a little bit sharper. If it's physical, obviously I don't have to go into that. Hell, even if it's spiritual, many spiritual beliefs tie the body to the soul and believe a strong body helps in whatever purpose their beliefs hold. Monks don't just exercise because they've got nothing better to do (though I suspect it's a contributing factor).

Of course, there are interesting things you could do with it. You could ritualize your exercise regimen to tack on some kind of magical effect, even if it's not related, for instance. You could use potions to make exercise less difficult. That's a separate issue though. That's about what does and does not have any magical influence, or how often magic needs to be brought up.

So, the question is then /why/ is this character doing it? Well, if they're required to fight or compete in some way, it helps, for obvious reasons. They could be the sort of person who just can't sit still and needs to burn off that energy somehow. It could be a body-image issue. They could be health-conscientious. They could be the kind that need more structure in their life and will go out of the way to create it if none exists. They could very well just be driven to self-improvement.

Then, why is it actually written down rather than given a passing mention? Obviously it establishes or reinforces some character traits above. Or, perhaps, it runs counter to them and the character's struggle with it is the point. It establishes the character's routine so we know what they're doing and when. It gives that character an excuse for being physically capable at a time when it's more relevant (for instance, if the character can outrun an auror).

I haven't read the fic so I can't say for sure what's going on, but I suspect that if there is a problem, it's not necessarily the exercise. There's lots of potential reasons for it to exist. I'm not gonna read the entire fic to find out what they are, but they could very well be there and you just missed it. Or you've read so many fics that the trope has just gotten old for you. Either way, it's not the exercise.

** Eh, my head cannon is that there are physical enhancement rituals but they're extremely difficult to do because of the ingredients required in the ritual e.g.

- Fur of a transformed werewolf on a full moon.
- Blood of a vampire willingly given.
- Muscle/bone of a goblin that's seen a 100 battles.
- Heart of a centaur eaten when Mars is bright etc etc.

Otherwise you would have every character and his owl doing these kinds of physical enhancement rituals. The characters would then go from being wizards to being super heroes.

** I always assumed that it was similar to the whole "mind and body" school of thought. For example, warrior monks have to take care of both honing the body and focusing the mind.

And, though it's not as sophisticated as how adult wizards sometimes cast magic, the vast majority of magic in HP has specific physical movements and such involved.

I think a lot of this is tied to the fact that many of the characters are either muggleborn or grew up in muggle society.

Also, most potions (other than the ones that kill you) aren't permanent. Just like how you can't create something out of nothing, you can't use magic to permanently change anything. Even transfiguration has its limits and that is the most physical class of magic, requiring very precise wand movements to cast the spell.

I think that many people also write exercise who have never actually had to do a long exercise program. They just do an inspirational montage of before and after.

So yeah. It's pretty silly, but it does make some sense. Magic may not inherently be tied to your body strength but it may depend on how you use magic in the first place.

If achieving fitness /isn't/ the point of the story, then instant-fitness-in-a-bottle could work well.

I think the OP's point is that there are a bunch of stories in which many paragraphs are spent on exercise routines when it's not important to the story. Harry starts exercising in the Room of Requirement on time dilation, gets out at the end of term, his fitness routine is documented throughout summer, Ginny notices appreciatively, and that's the end of it. But Ginny already had the hots for him, and the story could have skipped summer at the Dursleys if it weren't for the exercise routine.
