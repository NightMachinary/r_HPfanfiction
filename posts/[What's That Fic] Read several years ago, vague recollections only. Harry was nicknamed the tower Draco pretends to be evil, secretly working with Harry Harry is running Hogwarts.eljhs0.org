** I think you read one of the sequels for HPMOR (Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality) called Significant Digits. Harry's 19 and lives in the Tower of Doubt, Hermione is immortal/invincible (the Superman of the team), Ron is never mentioned, and The tower acts as a emergency center slash hospital for wizards and witches using the power of the Philosopher's stone. Let me know if that's what it was.
