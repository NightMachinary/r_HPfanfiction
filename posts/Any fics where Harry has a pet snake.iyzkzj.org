Bonus points if it

1) Eats Scabbers

2) Gives useful information about the Wizarding world

3) Was found by Harry pre hogwarts

Thanks!


** I've literally just been re-reading linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them), so fortunate timing. It's a great fic.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Rising From The Shadows]] (the second book of the Harry of El series), Harry gets a large pet snake called SssSthss. Two books later, Hagrid borrows her for some of his lessons, much to the terror of the visiting Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959/chapters/56911591][That Universe Over There]], Harry gets transported diagonally back in time and encounters his young alternate, Ivy, whom he promptly assumes guardianship of. Ivy gets a pet snake which she takes to Hogwarts with her which proves useful in dealing with the Troll, amongst other things.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Hated You From Hello

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18501823/chapters/43844539]]

This is the best fanfiction that I have /ever/ read and coming from someone who practicaly lives of fanfiction, that is quite impressive. It is a crossover between FFXV and Harry Potter but no prior knowlage for Final Fantacy needed. It sounds bad but /please/, give it a read.

Also Harry has snake called Clementine who just realy makes the whole thing.
