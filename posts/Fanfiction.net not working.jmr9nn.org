All of my update emails send me to a page that tells me to check if the link is expired or wait 15 minutes for the story to post, but for some, it's been days.

Anyone else?

Edit: the mobile app which I just found out about it is working fine. I'm really enjoying the fact that there's an app instead of using the mobile site

***** Already read it. I guess I got to it before the bug started. I had an interesting idea if you can throw it in somewhere. Maybe during the Quidditch offseason Harry is able to teach the other cannons the Patronus charm and when they're announced at the beginning of each game, their animals lead them out onto the field when they do their opening lap.

It would be a neat way to rile up the fans before each game additionally each player would get their own Patronus merchandise

#+begin_quote
  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic.

** From what I have seen these are the following issues.

1. New stories when clicked give the following error (Story Not FoundStory is unavailable for reading. (A)). *Desktop*
2. Updated stories give the following (Chapter not found). *Desktop*
3. The app I use runs into issues downloading new chapters. *App name fanfiction reader*.
4. One newly updated chapter I was able to access showed incorrect update date but the email had been sent within 30 minutes of clicking the link. Said chapter cannot be accessed anymore by the same email link. *Desktop*
5. Not all users will have these issues. I have seen reviews for chapters I could not access.

Don't know if they are working on it, the sites twitter account shows no activity since third of October.

** FFN has had caching issues starting near the end of July. For a long time, certain pages would sometimes show a version of the page as if it was near the end of July. This issue went away only last month-ish.

If you have an account, try logging out, or vice versa. This sometimes seemed to help (but I don't really know why).

The last few days, I've seen very weird behaviour of pages in general not loading at all, showing outdated versions, etc. Probably connected to the earlier issue.
