linkffn(6764665) This is a really good story and its driving me nuts that the author abandoned it. Also FYI if you go to the authors page she says its not quite abandoned but if anyone wants to take the story and run with it they are more than welcome.


** You can!

*** You are right I could. However I like the story too much to butcher the ending. I read fan fiction. I can not write it.
