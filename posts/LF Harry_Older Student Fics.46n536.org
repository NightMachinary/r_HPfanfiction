I know Harry had his group of "fan girls" at Hogwarts but I was always surprised we never saw any older girls go for Harry (I dont count Cho - she was only a year ahead) unless he was just completely clueless to people who were interested in him which is completely possible. Anyway, he is a celebrity, I just feel like this would happen more. I read a dimension travel fic a while ago where Harry had a crush on a OC Ravenclaw head girl when he was in his like 2nd or 3rd year. Anyway, it wasn't a huge part of the plot but the OC's friends were joking around about how even though he is young she could mold him into the perfect future husband and snatch up the Boy-Who-Lived while he is still young or something like that. So I'm looking for a fic where a girl who a couple years older than Harry decides to go after him while he is still young/innocent & impressionable. Can be someone like Penelope Clearwater or Tonks or an OC from any house.

*** Fucking christ that's terrible. I thought maybe the smut would be better. I should have known. This totally makes the list of 'that which has been seen cannot be unseen'.

To anyone debating reading this. Run. Run screaming.

**** It is a truly awful story and I haven't made it through very far myself. I did feel bad about recommending something from my "Don't read" folder but it fit all the criteria. I'll put up some kind of a warning next time.

**** I tried reading it but didn't make it that far. In my request I was thinking more along the lines of the oneshot with Tonks in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/86/Odd-Ideas][here]] (its the second story in that chapter so you have to scroll down a bit) It's also sort of humorous so not to be taken seriously. Another example I found is the abandonned story Linkffn(8304489)

  What if Harry met the Tonks instead of the Weasleys in Diagon Alley. What if he was also a metamorphmagus? Harry becomes a Puff and has to resist Dumbledore's machinations and learn what it means to be a member of the Hufflepuff house. Idea for this story comes from AJ3kyll and his story Dark Badger... go read it.
