**** I wasn't offended by it. I found it pretty funny, actually. It does seem like a joke. I think they just understood my kind of sense of humor from my writing.

And a nice gay way? Not sure what ya mean.

** I'll go with a positive example:

I write a story where Harry and Tonks stumble in a clusterfuck of European politics and conspiracies (and also stumble in a relationship with each other). The description clearly states that. I completely ditched the canon plot past the first chapter. Yet, 90% of the reviews predict that it is centred around Hogwarts or think that Voldemort is the only "bad" side. I also had a couple of rather annoying reviews telling me that an illegal arrest is, in fact, illegal and the Hit Wizards shouldn't be naughty. I even mentioned Sirius' case three or four times in that chapter. So I was pleasantly surprised when I got a review which seemed to "get" the story and what my overall goal was.

#+begin_quote
  I love it. The best stories are the ones that use the existing world as an outline and you, the author, fill it with your own details. i hope you have Harry and Tonks travel all over the world and Europe, because that would be orginal and very cool. Great story and i can't wait for more!
#+end_quote

Not the best praise I ever got, or the longest, but it was one of the few where I got the feeling that the reviewer truly appreciates my work and that I am willing to break with expectations and tropes.

** I'll go with everyone's /favorites/:

- "I liked this story but then you made it [pairing]." (Harry had a conversation with a girl and the reader assumed that was the pairing. Needless to say, it wasn't.)

- "Piece of **** writer I'm stealing this story and making it right." (I almost felt honored.)

- "This would be so much better if you didn't bash __." (In this case, it was Harry... Not sure how I managed it but okay.)

I know I'm missing some but really they're all ridiculous.

** I think I got a marriage proposal once. At first I was kinda lit... then I remembered how online dating usually ends for me and laughed until I had to smoke a bowl to stem the tears.

Kidding.

Other than that? Probably the time that some dude drew up bookies' odds for the Big Bad's reveal.

** There was a review of one of ny abuse fics where there is sexual abuse between a father and his son. I didnt detail the scene, just trailled off after leaving some hints.

One reviewer asked if it was sexual abuse liek they couldnt believe it was a thing! Talk about emotional impact!

I got a hate message about how I was evil and bad for supporting child abuse. I mainly write child abuse theme but always from the pov of the impact of it on the child.\\
I was pretty happy to have a hater. If someone hates you, your doing something right (unless your a bad guy who is doing actual abuse, homophobic etc)!

Oh and the most touching ones : a fic with anxiety attacks, a person said thats how they felt when they had anxiety attacks too. I was happy they found something to relate too.

On a fic about abuse and the after effects on an adult: one person recognised thier friend was like that characters behaviour too. Education is a great thing!

That being said, my favorite review was from a Guest acc who said, "It could be better."

** Just after releasing my first ever work, being a bit nervous because, you know, its my first and also a very unusual crossover, I got this review:

#+begin_quote
  "Okay I was not expecting this to be that good but I'm pleasently surprised . Keep up the good work"
#+end_quote

Made me very happy that people apparently appreciate it, and that I could make a largely untried combination work. :)

Then, I was also quite proud of these. We're all suckers for high praise after all ;)

#+begin_quote
  "A very interesting start. I especially like the way you naturally transitioned her into the new environment. Crossovers like these are often jarring, yet you made it seem reasonable. So 50 points for that. Waiting for more."

  "You mixed two of my favorites fandoms and made it something especial, thank you. I haven't checked this type of crossover before and am hopeful with the type of work you've let us glimpse, loved how natural your made the mixing of both world ;3"
