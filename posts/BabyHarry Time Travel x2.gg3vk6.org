:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I remember reading this one fic awhile back, and I haven't been able to find it again. From what I can remember an older Harry Potter goes back in time, and ends up in the body of his baby self. He then somehow ends up in the marauders time.

One point that really stood out to me was when Harry is trying to act like an actual baby and goes over to the Slytherins table. He ends up pulling on Lucius' hair. After that, he ends up staying with the Slytherins and Gryffindors. I think Lucius and Lilly end up as friends.
