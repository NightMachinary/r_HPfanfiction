** A story where a Manipulative Dumbledore trusts only ONE person with the contents of his plans for the people and the future...

Britain's Darling Boy, Harry Potter. Junior Auror and regular voice over the Wizarding Wireless. A boy with an easy smile, that dazzled all and a charisma that even Tom Riddle would have been envious of. A heartthrob, a national hero, an icon, an idol and a nationally accepted example for youth all over.

But when the camera's were away, when the mics turned off and the public blinked just long enough for him to slip back out of view and into the shadows... he was a fiend with a wand. A manipulator, a scoundrel, a being reminiscent of the Muggles Bogeyman or the Grim Reaper. Ruthless, inescapable, merciless.

None would suspect him, none would even think to ask, what would he have to gain from poisoning Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy? He had protected the family from the fiend Greyback! Macnair died in a vicious incident with a Hippogriff, why would you think otherwise? It was a freak accident yes, not out of the question considering the dangers of his work. And honestly, Hermione, how else would he have ended up in such a terrible state, no human can do something like that.

A world where Harry Potter smiles for the camera, signs whatever the latest starstruck fan pushedbhis way and killed/dealt with anyone Dumbledore saw as standing in the way of a peaceful and perfect society for all wizards and witches. The dichotomy of his existence was nothing he should be ashamed of, he was doing this world and its people a great service... It's all for the Greater Good, after all.

** No talk shows, since wizards don't really have that, but linkffn(6635363) has Harry raised by Lockhart to be a celebrity and use his fame.
