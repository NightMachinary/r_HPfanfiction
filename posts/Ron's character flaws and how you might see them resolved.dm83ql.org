I am finally working on planning a fic where Ron spends the summer after 1st year in Eygpt with Bill. Consequently, cannon events would change, but first, Ron needs to change. I'm not as concerned about events ( I feel like I have a good adventure plot due to my experience with tabletop RPG), but I want to make sure Ron gets a decent character arc. I love Ron (so please don't hate on him in this thread) and would love to discuss what his arc could have been. I know one of my flaws as a writer is making characters too perfect. There have been great threads doing this with Hermione recently, but I don't remember one with Ron.

Personally, I think his big flaw is his insecurity. This leads to his jealousy and his issues with his Horcrux. His family's poverty plays into this, but I also think he has a distinct lack of purpose, which he struggles to resolve. This is the main component of adolescent identity development, according to Eric Erikson, one of the significant theorists of identity formation. His brothers have done everything before him in the early books, so he doesn't have a sense of place before he gets involved in Harry's Yearly Shenanigans and when he does, his identity within the trio is not as concrete as Harry (the savior) or Hermione (the knowledge base). We know, of course, that he was /supposed/ to be the wizarding world info base, but that rings hollow as too close to what Hermione was.

Someone mentioned in a recent thread that Ron should have been the people person. I find that an interesting idea, but not being a people person myself am not sure what that would look like.

TL;DR: I'd like to get a discussion going about Ron, his flaws, and a good character arc for him. I may use the info to help me plan a fic. I'll give credit, of course.


** I don't actually hate Ron like a lot of people seem to, and have seen several interpretations of him in fanfic that I actually adored. Ron has a lot of potential as a character that I think Rowling never used fully, and I've always found that to be a shame. Unlike what some people think, Ron actually isn't stupid by any means. You cannot be stupid and play chess as well as he does. I'd honestly say Ron has the potential to be quite the analytical mind and perhaps even detail oriented in his own way. I think you're right in that Ron could be a people person. He's got a good sense of humor, is laid back, easy going, and with enough confidence and learning tact I think he could develop into the type of person people find easy to talk to, like to be around, and tend to open up pretty fast to.

It strikes me that you have the perfect opportunity to start building Ron and have him live up to his potential. Spending a summer in Egypt with Bill could do wonders for his confidence, and if you play it right could set him up to develop further. Maybe he takes an interest in curse breaking, ancient languages, and runes after Bill shows him what it is they can do in the real world? I don't see him becoming a genius like Hermione, but maybe in a few specific areas he finds he loves and decides to study and excel at? He's shown he can quite passionate about things. Qudditch and chess come to mind. He strikes me as the sort of person who's 'all in' or all out.

If he's into something, then he's obessesive and learns everything about it and sticks with it, or if not he doesn't care at all. I think his problem in school was that everything he took seemed so boring and he had no real emotional investment. He isn't Hermione who works hard at everything and considers good grades to be a reward in their own right. We know he has ambition (First year. Mirrior of Erised), but Rowling never followed up on him finding his own path out of the shadow of his siblings.

Something else that I think Ron could excel at is being the glue and the heart that bind the group together. If you make him the people person, you could easily have his sense of humor, charm, and ability to get people to open up allow him to serve as a confidant to his friends. I think he's got the background and personality to be the type to value family strongly and his friends equally so.

*** Thanks for this great reply. You hit on some of the potential I see in Ron. You make good points about how people skills could help the trio. Maybe he realizes how horrible he was to Hermione before the troll incident. The comment about him being all in or out for school is also useful. I'm a teacher, and I've definitely seen it. I know he is good at chess, but I want to go deeper than simply having him as the strategist, though I think it shows his potential to be observant.

**** I think you're right about it showing him having the potential to be observant. He'd have to be able to think multiple moves ahead and be able to read people's moves. Both of which feed into the people skill theory. Maybe chess honed his ability to read people and sparked his interest in them?

A thought is that maybe someone called him out his treatment of Hermione and he took it to heart? Maybe someone asking how would he like it if someone treated Ginny that way?

Ron being all in or all out strikes me as a reasonable interpetation. He isn't stupid, he can care about and excel at things, but he alway seemed so bored in class.

As I said, Ron's got a lot of potential that Rowling never built on, and I always found his character arc lacking and unsatisfying.

** I see Ron's intelligence commented on alot and I just have to point out that he does well enough in school to be named a Prefect, gets the same grades as Harry, and is actually shown doing a fairly decent job of it. Otherwise, knowing McGongall, she'd have vetoed him being a prefect outright if he had been such a terrible student in the first place. Not to mention his first year he was also dealing with the Neville problem of working with a hand me down wand that made everything more difficult than it needed to be.

In fact, the only person smarter than them in theory and wandwork in Griffindor was Hermione herself. Did it help that Hermione helped then study? Of course. But it was still up to them to retain that information, take the test themselves, AND do the actual wandwork.

Neville wasn't leadership material at that point, so all he had to do was beat two others.

**** Oh, no doubt. I was just illustrating that Ron was by no means dumb or an idiot. Just a typical teenager (who did have a habit of putting his foot in his mouth, but what guy hasn't at that age?).

Which leads me to consider, what grades did the girls in Hermione's year get and how did they stack up to Ron and Harry?

** Ron is the spare and he knows it, he has accepted it but wishes he wasn't. Bill was head boy, Charlie was quidditch captain winning the cup, Percy was head boy and the twins are clearly brilliant in their own way. Ginny is the first girl so maybe she gets a pass but what is left to achieve that one of brothers hasn't done before? He knows it's almost impossible to surpass them so he barely even tries. He knows what makes him special is Harry and he probably resents that, he likes Harry but is defined by him, at times it's like his brothers, he will always be the lesser in other people's eyes. Ron has few hopes and dreams because he doesn't know what is left for him. Without a goal or a dream Ron just goes through the motions and lives day by day not caring for the future because he has nothing to reach for.

Ron needs a dream, something to drive him. Harry wanted to be an Auror, Hermione wants to change the world, Ron just wants to be happy and that is far to vague too have a path to.

*** I absolutely agree with you. That is what I meant by him needing a purpose. I read another story that was time travel, and Ron decided to learn to cook so he could take care of his friends better on the Horcrux hunt. I really think this is the way I want to go, not just Ron, who cares for his friends as comic relief, but Ron, who cares about people because that is who he is. Just have to get him from point a to point b.

**** If he's going with Bill you can have him see things there that shake him. Perhaps one of the other curse-breakers makes a mistake and the injuries inspire Ron to become a healer. Perhaps Ron spends some time amongst the muggles and realises its not like his Martin Miggs the Mad Muggle comics so goes towards muggle-studies and work with the ICW to preserve the statue of secrecy.

Healers in the magical world must be quite good at defence against the dark arts so far as knowing counter curses etc so its not like he couldn't still help Harry at things.

** Working on the ideas that he was supposed to be the go to guy for Wizarding world knowledge and turning him into the people person of the trio, I'd like to see the development of a Ron who understands the nuances of the Ministry of Magic, making him into a competent politician in the future. How do I explain it... Hermione can research all the books but she tends to overwhelm people with the knowledge. It's potentially Ron who can take that knowledge further by presenting it in a more palatable way because of the other trivia he unconsciously absorbed through the years (mom's economics to keep the house running, dad's comments about the ministry, Bill dealing with goblins, Aunt Muriel's whatever, Fred and George's humor, etc.) So in some way this is Ron getting over his desire from first year Mirror of Erised to stand over his brothers and to some extent the rest of his large family. He becomes thankful that his large family allowed him to gain what at first seems like trivia to something really useful for him.

** I'd say that Ron's important contribution is to keep Harry's life from getting too dark and serious. Ron is the one Harry has fun with. He needs Hermione's company, but what he really enjoys is Ron's company.

Ron isn't the protagonist, but keeping the saviour reasonably balanced and healthy and sane is a pretty important job.

** I said this in another comment, but I feel like Ron was really underdeveloped, character-wise. For example, Neville went from a shy kid who was horrible at everything except Herbology, to a leader who stood up to multiple death eaters and killed Nagini. Ron... never really changed. He was originally made to provide information on the wizarding world, which is why he had so much random knowledge. He is definitely not stupid, just kind of lazy. He also doesn't have many good traits besides being comedic relief. Being good at chess doesn't make you good at strategy(I know this very well). It feels like JKR had a good idea of what Ron was going to do in the first few books, but didn't keep maturing his character. A way to make him have a change would be to let him get over his self-esteem issues after the second task or as a result of Harry becoming Triwizard champion.

** Heres an idea to get Ron away from his insecurities and jealousy. Have Ron be invited by Charlie to see some dragons over the summer for one reason or another by himself and without the rest of the Weasley's. A poor way to get Ron over his jealousy would be ti give him everything he ever wanted. Perhaps Ron goes to visit Charlie who is talented in Transfiguration and Ron has fallen very far behind at school because he is lazy. A minor argument between his parents and an accident while he is away that gets the Weasley's severely injured ( House collapses or something.) The idea is that he sees what he has and that he took it for granted and the pain he feels when he loses it. Some life advice from Charlie about working hard to get where you want to be instead of looking at those who have it with jealousy. A dramatic event to chamge his outlook on life and give him that little bit of drive to 1) Impress his parents who were disappointed in him for falling behind and 2) Overcome his jealousy by understanding what he has and that with hardwork he can have everything he ever wanted like his elder brothers have. Harry often says that fame isn't that great and that he would give it all for a family like Rons but Ron doesn't quite understand that, by almost losing his family he can start to see that better.

** I am not particularly fond of Ron because I find him the most unrelatable out of the trio and his main theme of being in his brothers' shadow is boring IMO. That being said, I am not fond of making him "worse than Hitler", a traitor, a wife beater or similar crap.

With that out of the way, I'd argue that a second year divergence would not do him much good. His worst scenes are in books 4,6 and 7 (especially the epilogue). So I'm not sure how much a preemptive pep talk at age 12 could change there because at that age, he hasn't manifested that jealously yet. I'd argue that moving your timeline to after the fourth year would work a lot better because then Ron could base those conversations on actual experiences and not vague concepts. Otherwise, it'd be Bill giving advise on the nuances in Caesar's writings before Ron has even learned a single word in Latin.

*** I get what you are saying. I also understand why people don't like Ron, and I think he deserves better, so I want to try and give him that with this fic. I'm going to try and nip some of the insecurity in the bud by allowing him to have his own adventure. You're right to say that we don't see a lot of the jealousy etc. until later, but I believe the jealousy is a symptom of deeper flaws rather than the cause, and that is what I am trying to get at. What I'm trying to say is that I want the fic to be more than a pep talk. Instead, as a brother, 11 years older, Bill is trying to bond with the brother he doesn't see much and mentor him. I have a similar age gap with my siblings, and it is not easy. But because he has a mentor investing in him, instead of just sailing through things can change.

**** Yes, but Ron is unlikely to learn BEFORE he makes mistakes (you don't learn that fire is hot without touching it once or twice). Bill is much likelier to have an impact on Ron after he fucked up something. Obviously, you can lay the groundwork beforehand, but unless Ron has experiences he can connect the advice with. Say Ron comes home after GoF and uses that time alone to reflect on the past year. That should put him in a much more receptive state than without an event where he can look back on and say "that wasn't my brightest moment".
