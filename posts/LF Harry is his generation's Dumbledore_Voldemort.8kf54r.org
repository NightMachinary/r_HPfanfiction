WITHOUT being a wish fulfillment lets put Harry with Hermione who is a gorgeous walking calculator dictionary that can recite any book from memory (Trash fics - Hermione is meh in terms of looks in the books, not Emma Watson, and the films take away from Ron to give to her) are there any fics where Harry is his generation's Voldemort/Dumbledore in terms of talent.

Voldemort who could make Horcruxes at 16. I want a Harry that is that good for a legitimate reason without silly powerups or training pre hogwarts, but not evil. That way him beating Voldemort (however it happens) seems like less PIS and more plausible. Voldemort will still obviously be stronger and smarter, but that way the gap doesn't have to be made up for by ridiculous CIS moments. Basically want Harry to be equal to in School Voldemort.


** linkffn(12740667) The Mind Arts by Wu Gang fits your request quite nicely.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

No offense to you specifically, but it's not very helpful, and there is basically zero chance that you're going to edit this comment or anyone will come back when (more likely if) the story ever gets posted to look for it. So how does it help the OP?

**** Good point. I was sort of thinking I'd come back and send a PM since this is just one step removed from the premise of the story I'm writing.

But whether that intention is borne out it's probably more of a stimulus response thing. I have this particular thing on my mind because I'm spending time on it, someone mentions that thing. What a coincidence, blah blah blah.

The internet is a place where imperfect humans with varying degrees of self-absorption talk about the stuff they care about. Not a robotic utilitarian vending machine where you put in a dollar and get exactly what you want. Unfortunately sometimes you get what you want and also some irrelevant bullshit because people like me type without thinking.
