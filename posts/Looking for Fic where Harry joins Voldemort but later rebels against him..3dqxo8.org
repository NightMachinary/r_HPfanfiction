I read it a while back. I think Harry joins Voldemort, becomes a trusted general and Voldemort names him in an important position after they win the war. But then Harry rebels and I think it ends with Harry being decapitated.

Thanks.


** I can't help with that specific fic, but [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2c66tq/how_to_find_a_fanfiction_if_you_dont_remember_the/][this]] is a good guide to finding a fic if you haven't tried it yet. It's in the sidebar here as well. Good luck.
