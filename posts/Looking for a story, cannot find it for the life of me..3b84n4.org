Hi All

Im looking for a fanfic i read a short while ago that i stupidly forgot to bookmark. The general gist is that Harry ends up in Slytherin, and ends up warding the Slytherin 1st year dorms due to the older years breaking in. He is very competent, i just cant remember if it was time travel or older Harry!

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
