Dumbledore isn't the grand puppet master behind the evil plots of Molly Weasley and the love potion happy children. He doesn't knowingly turn a blind eye to Snape's vile use of potions on unsuspecting students. He's not happily allowing the pure bloods to stomp on the filthy mudbloods polluting his castle. And when he finds out what they've done, he is not happy.

Slash, dark!characters and crossovers are fine. Please no mpreg, genderbending, harems, pottercest or romance/smut-centric plots. Thank you


** Hmm, well, I don't know any long stories with what you're looking for, but here, this one-shot should tide you over for a little while:

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), perhaps? Jim, the WBWL and James and to lesser extent, Lily, Ron and most Gryffindor students except Hermione and the Twins are mildly bashed. Dumbledore, however, is merely shown as a good person who has made mistakes.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) One of the best story ever. Dumbledore is bashed but he still is a good guy. He only made bad decisions at the bad time.

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry
