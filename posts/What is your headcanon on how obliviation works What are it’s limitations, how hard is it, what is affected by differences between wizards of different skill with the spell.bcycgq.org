For me I feel like it works best for things that have happened recently otherwise it can cause mind damage because after enough time is passed, other memories would be connected to the obliviated one. I feel like it's easy to cast but easy to mess up/make mistakes/cause brain damage. As you get better with it and other kind related spells, it's effects can be harder to get rid of. I feel like someone skilled with legilimamcy would have an easier time creating false memories and an occlumens would be more able to resist/fool an obliviator.


** Humans are amazingly adept at self-deception. Also, every time we remember something, the memory is rewritten. It's not like a computer with files you can delete. When you access it, it gets reflavored and overlaid with fresh interpretations and biases which merge with the old. It's incredibly subjective. I think that's kind of the difference between a confundus charm and an obliviation charm: confunding someone just nudges their mind to self-adjust in a direction you prefer, and obliviation acts more like Alzheimers.

*** My idea is that less skilled obliviators flat out remove memories. Like someone saw a person disappear. They no longer realize someone was there at all. That works in some cases but what about I'd say they were checking that person out at a store and they disappeared from the line. More skilled make them decide they did see them walk out of sight or whatever for instance. Mind damage occurs when a) lots of obliviatons or b) shoddy ones don't completely remove path ways to that memory or bits and pieces are still there I suppose. Less skilled ones would leave a feeling like a person swears something happened but can't figure it out and more skilled people would be able to keep someone from feeling it at all.

**** That example sounds more like memory modification, which is yet another type of charm. Much more skill required indeed, but better all around.

** - Blocks access to memories but does not completely remove them.

- The blocked memories continue to be known to the person's subconscious but are not accessible by their conscious mind.

- Repeated or large scale obliviation causes temporary disorientation but does not cause any damage to the mind (beyond the loss of the memory itself).

- As a Charm, it is capable of being blocked/shielded etc. like any other Charm.

- Cannot be used successfully against an Occlumens.

** As far as I am aware Obliviate only erases memories. Changing or adding memories is a different spell, the false memory spell.

As for the mechanism, what is a memory? Stored senses encoded into groups of neurons. Obliviate just undoes that process.

You don't get over being Obliviated. Recovering someones memories is a process of accurately recreating the stuff that was removed. The means this is done by? Who knows. Whatever method they currently have is not 100% reliable or Gilderoy Lockhart would have been fixed up.

*** Dumbledore used legilimency to recover(or at least see) the erased/altered memory's of Voldemort's uncle and Smith's house elf.

*** Voldemort recovered Bertha Jorkin's memory of Barty Jr so I don't think the memories are removed more likely just blockd off.

** The more power you use, the more you can erase.

A weak obliviator might be able to erase your last 5 minutes. A strong one can erase your entire life.

A legillimens + obliviator combo can erase specific memories from inside your mind.

This spell to me is definitely considered Dark arts, even though magical britain doesn't have strict laws against it.

Erasing someone's memories is morally evil, even if done for a good reason like lessening a traumatic experience. It's like casting crucio to restart a heart.

Obliviation doesn't lock memories that can be regained later, it obliterates them. Neural patters in your brain are shredded, gone forever.

*** i think that probably magical britain has strict laws against obliviating another wizard. but it's still taught and used to keep muggles from violating the statute of secrecy.

** So the obliviate charm is for getting rid of memories. (I think it just suppresses/blocks them since Voldemort was able to break the charm on Jorkins.) There is an entirety different spell to modify memories(shak uses it in dumbledore's office). Legilimency can be used to create false visions (snape tells harry voldemort does this to his victims). Since Occlumency can fight legilimency it is most likely able to fight other mind altering spells, but skill level will determine success.

** I came across a fic a while back where Obliviation pushed memories from the mind into the Aether, and a sufficiently skilled wizard could potentially pull them back, although the person who has been Obliviated, without a connection to the Aether, has little to no chance of reclaiming the memory on their own.

Seers, with their connection to the Aether (which has no specified, linear time and therefore allows them to view the future/present/past to some degree) cannot be permanently obliviated; any memory of theirs pushed into the Aether will find its way back to them eventually.

I always quite liked that interpretation, as it is original and still lines up pretty well with what we know from canon.
