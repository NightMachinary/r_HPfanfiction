Not tomarry, only harrymort


** mmm... there's linkffn(Again and Again) but other than that I can't really enjoy any of it.

I will say that I got excited at first because I thought you were talking about where the Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up, like in "Hit the Ground Running", which I love, but the slash normally goes a place I don't want to go. I've tried to read a fair few, too, but usually either the writing or the story logic is bad enough that I nope out of it fairly quickly.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** I've never read that (Hit the ground running) before, will give it a try. The only horcrux wake up fic I've read as one that eventually turned into HP/LV/SS. It was interesting... But it wasn't on the big sites like Ao3 or ffn so I can't even remember the name anymore nor find it.

Again and again is great. Is it finished?

** I'm a bit surprised that linkffn(A Snake Named Voldemort) hasn't come up yet. It's the first Harrymort fic I ever read and the fic that turned me into this pairing in the first place. I've never seen another like it, where Harry isn't inexplicably totally dark, there's no light bashing or dark apologist weeaboo crap, doesn't pretend political airs, where Voldemort is actually redeemed by love and yet still visibly himself.

It's also well written and quite amusing. The author is talented enough to have also written the only mpreg fic (not the one above, but also Harrymort) I've ever liked.

*** I've tried a snake named voldemort so many times but couldn't get into it a few chapters in. Maybe it gets better later because many people seem to like it.

I also tend to like fics where Harry stays good and Voldemort still can't love. One of my faves is In Somnos Veritas.

**** I consider that fic well written from beginning to end, so maybe the author's style just isn't for you. It's been a while since I read it though, so it could be that the beginning is rougher than I remember. It was still readable by my standards, which is pretty high since my tolerance for ick fic is basically zero nowadays.

I'm pretty sure I've read In Somnos Veritas. That's the one where they show up in each other's dreams, right? And Voldemort gives Harry a gift that follows him into reality? And is incomplete?

**** For explicit slash: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685657/1/Hauntingly][Hauntingly]] linkffn(11685657) are new favs, even if the explicit slash bits are few and far between. Voldemort is still evil and still sort of insane, and Harry does not have a good time. By the same author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11972693/1/No-Glory][No Glory]] linkffn(11972693) has only three chapters but looks like it might be what you are looking for too. I haven't read any other works by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6778783/ObsidianPen][ObsidianPen]] but having read your other comments here and those three works, it might be worth you having a look through them.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/658024][Consort]] linkao3(658024) is short but I think has a great evil Voldemort. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385][47 Days to Change]] linkao3(1485385) is a time travel where Harry tries to raise Tom right and fails spectacularly, resulting in a just as evil Voldemort in the present (future?), but isn't complete, and the slash so far has only shown up in the oneshot extra [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1850743][47 Days to Change- One-shot]] linkao3(1850743). I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8741238/1/The-Courtesan][The Courtesan]] linkffn(8741238) quite a while ago. From memory it had a reasonably evil Voldemort, but Harry was a bit useless and the writing is OK, but not great. If you can stand over powered Harry, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] linkao3(2378855) is worth a look too.

For fics which are not quite what you asked for but worth a look: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] linkffn(10182397) might be something like what you want. It doesn't really have a romantic relationship between Harry and Voldemort, and Harry is a very different character then in the books, and rather over the top, which can be a bit silly at times. Epic Solemnity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] linkffn(5402147) has a human looking sane Voldemort, so that may not be quite right either, but I tend to like Epic Solemnity's writing, and it is complete, which is always a plus. In the same vein, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the waters and the wild]] linkffn(7985679) is an excellent fic, even if it isn't quite what you are after I think.

MPREG warning: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good Harry/Voldemort(normal body restored about half way) but is sadly a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too, even if its isn't exactly deep and has a somewhat silly preg story line.

The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) does excellent characterization of Voldemort (and Tom too) but doesn't have explicit slash if that is what you were after. I couldn't finish [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/934466][Solace in Shadows]] linkao3(934466), but I have heard excellent things about how dark Tom is, without being an over the top dramatic prat. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2842724][Monster in the mirror]] linkao3(2842724) and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/966896][Love's Loathing]] linkao3(966896) feature Voldemort rather then Tom.

  Alive. Hidden. Concealed in the metaphorical closet, and the ominous, creaking footsteps outside belong to a monster... He's sniffing the air in anticipation. He's craving more than the scent. Intoxicated by his own bloodlust, and a single, fleeting moment of weakness is all he needs. "...I will have you..." Eventual HP/LV/TR. Sequel to 'Mine'.

For me, the most important part is Voldemort won't become a "good" people easily. He's a villain, and he won't change into a tender, caring, moral people in a second. He is also unlikely to fall in love very quick and recognize that immediately. The author gets those right.

*** Don't yuck my yum

Seriously though I don't really romanticize this pairing. The dynamic can be really fascinating though and it takes a certain kind of writer to do it well. I'm into gory morbid stuff. Works for me.

Also, Voldemort is written as being really good with magic but it's seldom demonstrated in other fics. Harrymort fics tend to go into really fantastic magical theory and stuff.
