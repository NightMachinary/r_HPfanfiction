** I have never been more annoyed by a <3 sign than the one in that post.

I think that summarises by feelings about this well. The fact that JK has called the preview fan reactions wonderful may be the most infuriating fucking thing in the world.

Also, I feel like we all owe an apology to Robst.

*** Not on her part, but a lot of people thought Voldemort didn't have any interest in sex or love, and that maybe after all the dark magic experiments and soul-splitting and his resurrection he wasn't even human enough to get it on anymore.

*** Well...yes actually. At least for those who have let Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal take over, where Bellatrix seems more in love with the opportunities for carnage he offered her.

** If Scorpius/Rose is canon, then please enjoy this story I wrote about them because it very well could be canon now. Lol.
