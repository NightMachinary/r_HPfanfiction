I was just wondering what the best way to find copies of fics that have been taken down off of fanfiction.net is? I have seen people talking about having copies of stories before and have no idea where they get them from. There have been several times lately where I have followed old recommendations from this site where the story has been taken down and there was even this one story I read last year and went to reread it the other day and it was taken down. Is there some some website out there where people have archived these stories? Let me know if anyone can help me out. Thanks.


** Other than [[/u/bkromhout]]'s suggestion, the only way I know is to google and ask around. When people say that have a deleted fic, it means they saved it before it was deleted (a good habit to get into, IMO) or received it from someone who did.

** crawling through live journal communities are a good bet. i've also just gotta stress downloading stories you really like because damn.

i just spent two hours looking for the complete works of maya. its kind of depressing going through these half dead archives and abandoned blogs and horrible shitty formatted media fires. like damn. this subreddit has been really helpful too.
