It's common Fanon to say that Harry had some kind of mail block on him to stop him from receiving fan mail mostly because he was celebrated enough that it makes absolutely no sense that he didn't. However, in book 5, he did receive a bunch of mail due to the interview he gave. How do we reconcile that?

Did the Wizarding world just not send him mail when he was young? Did they give up before he was 11 which is when the mail block was removed? Was the 'mail block' centred on No. 4? (In which case why didn't he get owls when he left privet drive?) Or did the Goblet of Fire break the mail block somehow?

** Honestly, it makes a good deal of sense that fan mail is somehow held in trust for Harry - I'm not sure what the protections would be exactly, but there must be some kind of re-routing service for fan mail within the wizarding world, or your average celebrity like Gilderoy Lockhart or Myron Wagtail probably wouldn't be able to move what for the torrent of owls and other mail birds surrounding them. Moreover, Harry was a literal baby, and I imagine there's probably some sort of code for how young a child can be before they're legally allowed to receive post from an owl, this likely to prevent against kids getting hold of their parents' owl order catalogues.

As a young child, I expect that Dumbledore saying, "hey, no one should send this child fanmail because like, he's a child," probably would have been respected by a good deal of people, even if not like, every single person.

From what we see, a lot of the people who do send him post know him well enough to know his address or which dormitory he'd be in Hogwarts, and maybe that's part of the thing behind being able to send your post through, if it's a vague intent thing - if you already know that about him, it's possible the filter would let you through based on that. I'm not sure how postal magic works exactly, but I imagine there is /some/ sort of protection on the letters that Harry can receive, where he'd only get the stuff from people on an "approved" list of writers, probably based on family, and the Hogwarts student and staff list. While Harry isn't aware of this re-routing service, I would understand why it wouldn't come up in the plot - Dumbledore wouldn't want to mention it and would likely be in charge of managing it as Harry's magical guardian, and by the time he died, stakes were a lot higher, and Harry wasn't yet of age in order to take command of his own trust.

When it comes to the Prophet article, it's perfectly possible that in agreeing to do the interview, he opted in for some temporary waiver of that re-routing service, meaning that people would be able to respond directly to him - I wouldn't be surprised if Skeeter had that kind of thing locked down, just to add to the incendiary nature of the article. It's also possible that because he opted into a binding magical contract with the Goblet of Fire, which saw him as an adult, that the protections for a minor were temporarily lifted, because the magic was a little bamboozled by the contradiction, and then Dumbledore put it right again once the tournament was over.

I don't really know that it's necessarily like, an evil Dumbledore thing in this case - I think a lot of his decisions were pretty questionable, but as a child, it'd probably be horrible to receive a lot of fanmail, especially once Harry was like, fourteen and over, from which he'd probably get gross offers from various witches and wizards offering to bang him once he was legal - or before, because it's not being a sexual predator if they're a celebrity, I guess - on top of random death threats for no reason.

Even the genuinely positive fanmail would probably be a lot for him to take.

This is one where we kind of fill in the gaps, to be honest - I don't imagine JKR would have said much about it even if she had thought of it, just because it's not relevant to the plot.

**** Hedwig is pointed as an unusually smart owl, but your point still stands regarding Sirius. However, the sexual offer thing is a legitimate concern as it is something a responsible adult would be concerned. Moreover, Harry may be happy with sexual offers from people he finds attractive, but not from random men and women obviously not all there in the head.

** All things considered there's no definitive answer. We know that he was able to receive his Hogwarts letter at 10, then after that he was able to receive mail from his friends. I'm sure Dumbledore could and would stop fan mail from going to the Dursleys (either to keep them compliant so they would be more willing to house Harry, or for his own nefarious reasons if you're into that). But that doesn't explain why he never got them later, or after he started going to Hogwarts.

** I've always rationalised it that the vast majority of the wizarding world simply didn't know where he was to send him anything.

There are three people active in the wizarding world who *definitely* know that Harry Potter went to Privet Drive before his eleventh birthday. Dumbledore is one, but he's not telling anyone if he can help it. Hagrid delivered baby Harry to the doorstep, but if Dumbledore says he can't talk about that then loyalty will mean that he never does. McGonagall watched the Dursleys before Harry got there, but again...even if she personally has her doubts that this is good for him, she'll trust Dumbledore's judgement.

****** They knew he was still alive after Voldemort.

My point is that it may not be common knowledge what exactly happened *after that*. I'd bet cash money that when Harry was a little boy there were at least a dozen really bonkers and contradictory rumours about where he was and what he was doing.

He'd died when he was three because Death Eaters had poisoned him. He was with Muggles, but they'd drowned him on a holiday to Blackpool. Dumbledore had stashed him away in Australia or something. He was being raised by the centaurs, or the goblins, or by something else not human.

The wizarding world seems quite susceptible to insane conspiracy theories.

A few people (like Daedalus Diggle) might find him...but you'll note that the few wizards he runs into before he turns eleven are all proved later on to be members of the Order or otherwise Dumbledore's mates, who Dumbledore could then ask not to blab about it.

******* I agree that there were probably a lot of silly rumours and funny stories. I don't get why that should stop every single person from sending him fan mail. A letter could reach Harry in each of the situations you described where he isn't dead. (And lots of people write fan mail to celebrities never knowing if it will ever reach them or if they'll actually read it...) To me, it seems more likely that there is some anti-fan-owl charm or something similar, than nobody ever even trying to send a letter to Harry Potter because they didn't know for sure where he lived - especially in a world where it is normal to be able to send letters to people without knowing where they are.

******** If you could just send a letter to anyone and have it always get there, the Aurors would catch Death Eaters or Sirius within about three days. They'd have been able to send a letter to the terrifying escaped convict Sirius Black, or to Bellatrix the Death Eater, and then just follow the owl. The Death Eaters watching the Weasley family should have been able to follow any mail they sent and kill all their friends.

Since that didn't happen...I'd figure that *normally* an address matters. Harry's Hogwarts letter was certainly addressed exceptionally carefully.

Maybe Hedwig was just a super bloody smart owl?

They do seem to have a mind of their own - maybe they just wouldn't deliver the letter as long as they were followed. But it's all guesswork of course. Just seems to me to fit better within canon than Hedwig (and the other owls we see doing similar stuff) being an exception. There are muggle-repellent charms and notice-me-not spells and stuff. Could be that people could cast anti-Auror-mail spells and anti-fan-mail spells and anti-tracked-owl spells or something ;)

** My headcanon is that owl mail tends to work best with people you've personally met, and thus most people wouldn't be able to send Harry letters. This doesn't really hold up to canon - it would mean Lockhart's fans would need another method of contacting him (though, then again, having hundreds of owls visit each day would be a problem by itself, so maybe that would be necessary anyway).

I rationalize it by saying that sufficiently advanced wizards can put up some sort of magical beacon that allows owls to find them. This explains why every good and evil person seeking someone didn't just send them a letter and follow the owl, as well.

The events towards the end of Book 1 and 2 and his involvement in them would probably also make the news. I doubt Dumbledore would be able to completely suppress the knowledge of that getting out after giving Harry and his friends 150 house points in front of the entire school.

** While this is not the perfect reason but it could be justified by Harry's popularity levels maybe. When Harry survived Voldemort's curse, he was just a baby. I doubt people would send mail to a one/two year old (sorry I forget the exact age Harry was). Even if they did, I do like the idea of Dumbledore blocking all mail to him until he was a certain age.

After a while, even though the wizarding world was aware of Harry's existence, it is possible that in the attempt to move on from the war and its memories, it got pushed to the back of their minds. IIRC, Harry made an appearance in Daily Prophet in his fourth year when Rita Skeeter interviewed him, which suddenly created a new wave of interest in him, hence the fanmail.
