  Harry Potter never did have the best luck with holidays. How do you even begin to fight a creature the size of a large building? Harry Potter vs Trespasser.

** linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) This is best next-gen series on ffn and the best thing about it is that the plot was written out before hand, so the plot doesn't go into random places.

Edit: Oh nvm this isnt exactly what youre looking for srry.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
