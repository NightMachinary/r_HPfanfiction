  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.

** There's Black Coat which has something of the kind.... Harry and Tom are not in love but they end up as frienemies with Tom caring for Harry as a friend. Harry does not really turn Tom good but Tom is disgusted of what he becomes in the future (still the timeline is unaffected). I thought it was a really cool and well-written friendship story with some really awesome original ideas, especially that the author at the time was fourteen, yet still mature enough to stay away from romance if they had no real life experience with it back then.

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?
