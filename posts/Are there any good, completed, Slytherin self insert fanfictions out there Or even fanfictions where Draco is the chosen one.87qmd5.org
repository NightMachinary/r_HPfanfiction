More info: As for the type of story, I don't mind a few grammar errors, as long as it's not flooded with them. As for ratings I don't care, but would rather not have any weird, extreme romance situations involved either. It has to still be updating or completed, as I don't see the point in torturing with myself with reading a good series that was dropped. It may be good, but if it cuts off, I won't be happy.

*** I read the tags (it has way too many btw) and summary, but I'm not convinced by the main character. Can you explain what you liked about this story ? Like, what makes it stand out ?

**** Okay I wasn't initially sold by the summary, but I gave it a try and the story won me over. It's a little difficult to justify why you like a story, but I'm trying to without giving too much info.

To begin with, I quite like how the story expands the HP world, but still fits into canon well. One major issue with SI fics is balancing the protagonist's foreknowledge so they aren't so ridiculously overpowered or out of place. When d done badly that can warp the world/story or be unsatisfying as an author tries to justify holding on to the stations of canon. Guinevere/Lys is rather overpowered- which she acknowledges in the fic- but there are limits and hindrances to her knowledge and ability to act etc. For example, I don't want to spill too much information, especially as the plot point is developing, but the fic takes place in a slightly different version of the hp world. Lys also has physical and other disadvantages to somewhat balance out her magic and knowledge.

Generally though I find the story charming and cheering- despite the darker places it sometimes goes. I'm not always the biggest fan of the Weasley family, but I quite like how they are written here. It's rather heartwarming. I also appreciate Lys as a main character, because while she may be manipulative or cynical, she is still a good, caring person and rather cheerful. I've gotten a bit tired of overly cynical and edgy SIs so she is refreshing.

***** Thank you for the detailed explanation ! You make the story way more appealing than the original summary. I might give it a try :)

**** I've got nothing better to do so I'm giving it a shot. So far, 1Â½ way of ch 2, it's sorta Mystery SI Reincarnation fic with OP main character. I'm hoping the mystery parts will carry it. I'll write again when I know more.

Edit: It somewhat reminds me of linkffn(Barefoot) and linkffn(Blindness)

** linkffn(Draco Malfoy and the Philosophers Stone by HiBob) is a series with Draco as the chosen one (and some other AU points). It's not the best writing, but it's pretty entertaining from what I remember, and the entire series is completed to a pretty satisfying ending.
