Preferably magical, like a Phoenix.


** There's the fic "To Shape and Change"\\
Where harry has a Coral Snake that is very important during the plot, is not just some "Oh Harry has a familiar" and then forget this for the rest of the fic, here Coral is'nt just an aniomal, she's Harry's best friend and her magic is also very important to the history.

*** The name should be ”to snape and change” it would be the best pun ever

Sadly that 'forgetting your pet for like ever' thing is very common, would love to see fics similar to ”to snape and change” in that aspect

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
