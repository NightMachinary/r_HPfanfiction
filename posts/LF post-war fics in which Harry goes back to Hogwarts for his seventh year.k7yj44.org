** Do you mean "8th year" fics, where everything happens as in canon, then after the war Harry (and others) go back to Hogwarts for their NEWTs?

Or do you mean true 7th year fics where the Golden Trio never drop out and the Worst Camping Trip doesn't happen?

*** 8th year! I didn't know that's what people called it. But I've never heard of the second trope before, so I'm open to that as well:)

**** True 7th fics are fairly rare; I think I've only seen two or three, both published before /Deathly Hallows/ was released.

8th year fics are popular, though. The AO3 tag is "Hogwarts Eighth Year" if you wanna search it. My favorite 8th year fics are /Written On The Heart/ linkao3(9065263) and /Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day/ linkao3(359705), both Draco/Harry.

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?

  Even though he's unarmed, injured, lost in the Forbidden Forest, and facing a possible murder charge, Draco Malfoy gets lucky.

  The bloody war has ended at Harry's sixth-year. Though hailed a hero, he's ready for one last year at Hogwarts. One year of a normal life before becoming an Auror. While there, a simple agreement manages to challenge his identity as a hero, while still providing the normalcy he craves. Haphne AU. Post-War 7th year.
