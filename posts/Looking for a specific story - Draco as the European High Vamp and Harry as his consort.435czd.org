Its been years since I last read it but I remember it being very well written with a great plot line. Essentially Draco is the head vamp of Europe with Severus as his second, while leaving one of the clubs he owns he spots Harry in line trying to get in looking strung out. He takes Harry to be his consort over time. Severus pairs with Remus later taking him as his pomme de sang. It was a long multi-chapter fic that was finished before 2010 (so long ago). I don't think its on fanfiction.net or AO3 though but I can't remember which one of the other fiction archives its on. It was mature rated. Been searching for a week with no luck so I figured I'd try here.


** I've no idea how I remembered this as I read it years ago, but I think you're looking for [[https://desolatesmemoirs.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wicked.pdf][this]]. Wicked, by desolate03. Used to be on FFN back in the day. Starts off exactly as you described.

** Is it an Anita Blake crossover? That might help you find it.

*** No, though I've come across one of those that I have saved to my queue to read. This one is pure HP. It was engaging because the Vamp!Draco wasn't overplayed especially when you find out he's not just any vamp the author actually wrote that part in well enough where you don't cringe, Severus as a vamp is just sort of expected. The fact that Severus asked Remus to be his Pomme De Sang in exchange for helping control moony after Dumbledore took him off the wolfsbane was a nice touch I felt as well.
