** Article has the right idea, but places the blame on the wrong woman- JKR confessed that keeping Ron and Hermione together was a matter of the author letting her plan override the inclinations of the characters she had created. It was Emma Watson who suggested that Harry and Hermione would have made a better match, but the camps really should have been divided into Team Ron and Team Not-Ron.

The strongest and most adult outcome for all these heroes would be for their friendship to remain strong, even if they all married someone else. This would apply even to the second-strong team of Ginny, Neville and Luna.

Anyone with a sense of the character of Hermione Granger can easily see that there is only one who could properly accompany her through life's roller-coaster and never fall short of being her perfect companion...

[The proof is left as an exercise to the reader]

*** Herself! Hehe.

"The strongest and most adult outcome for all these heroes would be for their friendship to remain strong"

I like that very much. For me, it would have been better to keep the three of them separate in their private lives so that the bond they shared wouldn't bend to one side or another. Pairing them off with one another tips the scales a bit.

**** Ron stared at Hermione, quite dumbstruck. Harry coughed. Luna looked at the others and then turned to Hermione; "Is it common for muggles to marry animated corpses?"

Hermione blushed but replied archly, "Not common, no. You have to admit though, he's much easier to get along with, now that he doesn't speak. Also, I own his house, all his books and a collection of fifteen wands. My children will be considered half-blood--"

Ron roared, "CHILDREN? How does that happen?"

Hermione's blush deepened. She muttered, "M-magic, of course."

Yeahhh... no.

Oh well. I was just working by the numbers. According to the pure volume of lemon fics, Hermions's ideal companion should be the mpreg spawn of Snape and Draco.

*** I like the idea of Hermione being with Harry. It never felt like her and Ron connected.

Couldn't Neville gotten with Ginny, and Ron gotten with Luna, Padma or Cho?

** I agree with the article, except for this part:

#+begin_quote
  she made the ultimate sacrifice--erasing herself from the memories of her parents to help them avoid the unnecessary suffering that came with knowledge of the wizarding war
#+end_quote

Anyone else think it was a really shitty move?

*** yes - it shows that in reality she is just as prejudiced against "muggles" as most other magicals. Nothing in all HP books freaked me out more than the relative casualness with which one of the central characters effectively murdered and mind raped her parents.

**** I would say it has more to do with her belief that she is always right. It has been turned down a bit by this point, but she will do whatever she thinks is right regardless of what others believe.

Such as the house elves, Sirius's broom, DA, and the interview with the Quibbler. Etc.

**** If anyone ever found them, it wouldn't matter whether or not they /knew/ where they were, they'd be tortured and killed anyway. It would have been just as easy for them to take an extended vacation or skip town under an assumed name.

***** Yes, it would have been just as easy...but let's say you have a young daughter embarking on a dangerous and potentially life-threatening quest. Wouldn't you be upset? MY PARENTS would not have gone quietly. Regardless of their ability, they would have done all that they could to keep tabs on me/try to help me. Hermione probably did that to keep them from placing themselves in unnecessary danger.

There's no way that this decision is justifiable. Full stop.
