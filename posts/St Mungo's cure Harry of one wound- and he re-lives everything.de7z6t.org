I think this is in year five or six. He has to go to St Mungo's for some cure that can never be used once, and it makes him relive all the blood quill stuff, Nagini's bite, and maybe takes the Horcrux out?! But they don't realise how extreme it will be until it's happening... I feel like Snape night have been there. Does this sound familiar?


** 99% certain that's Moment of Impact by Suite Sambo, available on fanfic.net.
