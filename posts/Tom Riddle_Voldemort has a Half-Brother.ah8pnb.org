That idea emerged in my Mind and an Encounter between him and Harry could be interesting, atleast i think that. I was thinking about how to keep it to the Canon, since Tom murdered only his Father and Riddles Parents (his grandparents). Im not sure, if he would looked for a potential Sibling, as i think, he only would extinct the "source" of his existence, so his Father.

But lets assume, that he either didnt know about Half-siblings or he wouldnt care about their existence. Do you know Fics with that? Whether he is magical and visited a different School than Hogwarts or was a Muggle and through coincidences somehow comes in Contact with the Magical World or makes his own conclusions (Tom was a clever Person after all, so his Sibling could be too)? Maybe he even made it to Prime minister and so get involved with the Magical World.....doesnt matter. What i really am interested, is how a encounter with Harry would be. Would it be "casual" because Harry treats him like any other Person and wouldnt be prejudiced or would he be cautious (especially, if that Brother might be a Criminal or even Worse a Magical Criminal). Im open for any ideas.

Im not sure from who's POV a Fic would be, as i said: im very interested in how Harrys Reaction would be about another "Riddle" and Voldemorts Brother of all People. But i think, a Fic from the Brothers View would be good too. A Fic that switches in Views would be good....but since Harrys reactions is what interests me the most i would prefer from his View, i would still accept Riddles View anyway.

Maybe The Brother is Harrys (or maybe Rons or Hermiones) closest and best contact when it comes to interactions with the Muggle world (IF he is a muggle)

Hmm, im also ok, if its not a Brother, but a Sister and Harry "might be" attracted a litte, because she inherited her Fathers good appearance. But i would be mainly looking for a Brother, so if you know both contents, it would be good, if you make a Note.
