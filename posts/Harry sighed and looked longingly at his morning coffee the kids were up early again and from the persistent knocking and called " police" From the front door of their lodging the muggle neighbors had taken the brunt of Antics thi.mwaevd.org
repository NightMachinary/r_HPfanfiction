Harry grabbed his wand and shuffled towards the door as the banging Continued sighing again he pointed his Holly and Phoenix feather wand directly into the people and whispered" obliviate"

The officer stopped banging and looked rather confused for a moment before wandering back to his bicycle and pedaling off towards the station the neighbors mrs o'leary and mrs Donahueboth in their late eighties had substantial gambling debts Owed to his 2 sons and they had a habit of calling the police over whenever the boys came to collect usually in the form of biscuits and the occasion or jelly baby run as ginny refused to keep any such sweets in the house unless it was Christmas.

Harry looked at both his sons to would be angels trying to look as innocent as possible but he could see the horns holding up the halos. They were 3rd generation marauders after all Running a A gambling operation/a card shark event using the pensioners as suppliers for their sweet tooth any time one of them fell into debt.

Harry just looked at his boys and said, " I won't tell your mother of you don't."

Before wandering back to bed whilel his boys nodded vigorously in agreement.


** I usually really don't comment on the language or spelling of a post because I am hardly perfect in english writing either. But this time it is impossible to ignore it. There is a reason why languages have punctuation marks. The reason is so that a text becomes readable. You should really use them.

I tried three times to understand what the heck you mean with your prompt. It was impossible because half of the time it doesn't make any sense with how your sentences are.
