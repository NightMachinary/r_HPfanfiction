Hey all, I'm contemplating mucking about with a fairly standard timetravel story, one of the ones where Harry wakes up in his old body pre-Hogwarts. Admittedly, my story would likely be a little Powerwank-y, but I'd prefer to keep it at least a little grounded. So, considering he'd have all the knowledge of an AU, adult Harry, but none of the actual magic ability, how strong do you think he could be? Like, with some training, what's the magical limit for wee firstie Harry?

Just keen to hear your opinions on the idea, don't mind if you take a more canon approach or whatever!

EDIT: Realised that realistically probably isn't the best qualifier. Basically, at what point would you consider a character to be OP or broken?


** I'm going to answer this question more generally, without reference to the time travel, because I think the time travel aspect makes the question less interesting. In the time travel context, the question is not about what rate wizards normally progress at, but rather concerns the impact on a wizard's magic of changing their physical body.

On that subject, all I will say is that I very much doubt that changing physical bodies would alter your magical ability - see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gaquik/magical_cores_or_the_limits_of_a_wizard/fp1dc84/][this comment thread]] for the full reasons why. So long as you don't adopt the body of a Muggle or a different magical species, that is. Also consider that using polyjuice doesn't seem to alter magical ability.

Moving on to the more general question of magical progression: consider the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort duel at the end of OotP, the highest level exhibition of magic we have witnessed. What, in that duel, is particularly special?

- Dumbledore animates a number of statues. We know that animation is taught at Hogwarts. The act of animation itself is not impressive - it is not rare or secret knowledge. What is impressive is his ability to animate several large objects simultaneously, with a single wave of his wand.

- Dumbledore creates a flaming whip. We know that the creation of fire is taught at Hogwarts. The act of creating fire is not impressive. What is impressive is his fine control over the fire, and his ability to create it quickly.

- We see Voldemort transfigure the flaming whip into a snake. We know that transfiguration of animals is taught at Hogwarts. The act of turning something into an animal is not impressive. What is impressive is the ability to perform a large, perfect, complex transfiguration with a single wave of the wand, and on fire rather than a normal physical substance.

- We see Dumbledore turn the snake to smoke. We haven't seen students transfigure things to smoke, but it seems functionally no different to vanishing, which we know is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive here is not his ability to get rid of the snake, but his ability to get rid of a large vertibrate animal with a single wave of his wand (for reference, Harry takes the length of a whole exam, probably well over an hour, to vanish an iguana in OotP).

- We see Voldemort conjure a silver shield. We know that conjuration is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive is not the fact of conjuration, but his ability with it - we don't often see wizards creating silver.

- We see Dumbledore levitate a globe of water and encase Voldemort within it. Levitation, and the movement of objects more generally, is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive is his fine control in being able to perform this magic on a substance which flows.

- Voldemort casts the Killing Curse a lot. This is something Goyle can do.

- They apparate a lot. This is something many wizards can do.

Of all the spells cast, the only spell which is properly outside the standard education of a wizard is Dumbledore's mysterious powerful spell which Voldemort conjures the silver shield to protect himself from. Everything else is magic which is theoretically within the Hogwarts curriculum. What is special is that their ability with this magic is very high: they can execute these spells flawlessly, effortlessly, in an instant, at scale, with power, and in apply them in ways which are not standard (e.g. levitating water rather than solid objects).

So all the knowledge is within your grasp at Hogwarts. The question is: what level of ability do you achieve with this magic while you are at Hogwarts? On that front, we know that Dumbledore showed his examiners things they had never seen before, and was publishing articles in magical academia, exchanging letters with the greatest magical minds of the day while still a teenager. Similarly Tom Riddle is described as being the most brilliant student Hogwarts had ever seen. Grindelwald is also described as brilliant while he was still at school.

In short: if you're in the top tier of wizard, you flourish early. If you've got to age 18 and you haven't yet shown sign of being a Dumbledore-level talent, you're never going to get there.

What this tells us is that a Dumbledore-level wizard is probably 95% of the way to being the finished product by the time they finish Hogwarts. After Hogwarts, you may pick up useful and powerful spells here or there, and you might gain niche skills not taught at Hogwarts like occlumency, but the foundation of your magical repertoire is already all there. I would imagine a Tom Riddle at 18 would be almost as dangerous as Voldemort at 60.

In terms of how to handle this, my preferred approach is for these wizards to go deep into magic rather than rushing on ahead. The sign of a Dumbledore-level wizard is not casting OWL magic in your first year; it's spending a month delving deep into the levitation charm so that you have truly understood and mastered the magic, being able to cast it with a level of ability that few others can.

*** What impressed me most about the statues is how even just one of them completely rendered Bellatrix helpless and pinned her down, with there being apperantly nothing she could do about it. Voldemort on the othet hand destroyed it with a single spell.

**** I think it's a tricky question. I can see that the aim of the question is something like this: "What if a person had the same traits, but took different decisions?"

However, I think there's a fundamental problem with the question, which is this: if you took different decisions, then you can't have the same traits. Your decisions arise out of your character; to change Dumbledore's decisions is to change his traits. You can't separate out a person's identity from their past.

A Dumbledore who didn't study properly during his Hogwarts years is a different character, and thus the character of his magic would be different. I would suspect that he would never be able to achieve the heights of his canon self - he just doesn't have that deep connection to magic. A true magical prodigy, I think, would find it /impossible/ not to immerse themselves in magic, because they live and breathe it.

I tried to show this in Victoria Potter by having Victoria get bad grades in maths in her Muggle school, because the way she thinks about numbers is an inherently magical one - she can't wrap her mind around the Muggle perspective. Seeing the world through the lens of magical thinking is part of who she is, even before she has a formal magical education.

*** Personally, I think that the end of a duel can be determined by a few factors

1. Willingness to kill (assuming duel to death) The answer is a yes or no, I would wager that Dumbledore could maybe have killed Tom if not for Tom escaping, but the biggest limiting factor was definitely his lack of intent to kill Tom.

2. Creativity, you can see that extremely well in the duel, they're being rather creative in their fighting, Which means the opponent has to be creative in their counter to that, creativity creates opportunities and if you are good enough you can grasp those opportunities and send a powerful attack.

3. Finesse, how many things has the combatant completely mastered and how accurate and succesful their spellcasting is.

4. Endurance, I don't actually know if there is a thing such as "magical exhaustion" but assuming there is then I really doubt a 4th year could do either sides spells in one go without collapsing, then there's physical endurance too, which is quite useful if a spell can be dodged.

5. Speed, how fast can they think up a counter?how fast can they act? how fast can they move out of the way?

6. Knowledge, do you know the counters to your opponents attacks? Do you know rare spells to attack with? Do you know ways around counters?

I have a feeling that I'm still missing something from this list but we'll see

These are in no order of magnitude, importance or effect

** Canon, there is no such thing as magical strength or ability (that's a pureblood delusion), only knowledge and skill (which may include talents of various forms: dextrous fingers, quick-thinking, etc.).

Harry's 11-year-old body won't be as able as his adult body (even with exercise and training) but his skill should still be fairly good. Because of that I wouldn't put him face to face with a senior Death Eater, but someone from the future will likely have tricks that haven't been seen before (and Harry was part owner of WWW!) so there's an opportunity for a creative author.

Don't forget that silent casting is taught in 6th-year NEWT classes, so he should have that down (some fanfics make a big deal about him "inventing" silent casting or using different words which is pointless in canon).

*** There definitely is. 4th years are considered incapable of casting the killing curse because of its power requirements. Those under 17 don't have the magical power to trigger Voldemort's power based trap. 17 is an important magical milestone. That said, it's not the end all. Just because Harry can't manage to cast a shield charm or a killing curse at 11 doesn't mean he's useless. He can find Dumbledore and tell him about the future instead of creepily living with children for 7 years, for example.

**** Age seems relevant to magical ability, but in the magical world, age is not a purely physical property - see how the Weasley twins failed to pass Dumbledore's age line even after they /physically/ aged their bodies.

I think the best summary of canon magical ability is: your ability with magic, including your particular strengths and weaknesses, emerges out of who you are as a person: your character, experiences, knowledge, perspective, willpower, discipline, etc.

With that in mind, I don't think changing your physical body is going to impact your magical ability, so long as the body is that of a wizard.

***** Perhaps, but age still seems a rigid factor. The Weasley twins failed to pass the age line because they weren't truly 17, though they were physically aged. Perhaps age is defined via the mind or the soul. If the latter (and going by the typical route of this type of time travel), then yes, I suspect that Harry would retain his full magical capabilities. If mentally, then I think it would depend on how Harry considers himself (which is likely an adult). I'll admit I was probably wrong with Harry; I failed to consider the time travel aspects fully. And, if magic is separate from the body (not mentioned in canon and thus unlikely), Harry may still have the magic of an 11 year old.

I think that age certainly does matter when it comes to magical power. Voldemort's boat is able to detect magical power and a 16 year old does not register. 14 year olds are unable to muster the power to cast the killing curse but Crabbe is able to cast it at 17. That said, it is entirely possible that Crabbe was more competent than widely considered. He is considered to be top of the class in Dark Arts by Neville.

I have read your document on magic. While you craft a cohesive and convincing argument as to factors which influence magical ability, I don't think the possibility of magical strength can be entirely ruled out.

That said, magical ability is dependent on age and magical strength can't entirely be ruled out, as cheapened as it might be by magical cores and the accompanying riff-raff. Power is frequently used throughout the series as a descriptor and there is a rigid improvement of magical strength at 17. While other factors can explain away magical strength as a factor, it's the more complex explanation, and less likely. When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.

If you have evidence which proves me wrong, feel free to correct me.

Might be worth going, if only to stop certain things from happening there (the whole philosopher's stone plotline, Ginny and the diary, the other horcrux still at the school).

I think a lot of writers like having him go to school for the same reason they write fanfic, it's easier and more fun for them. But there are good canon reasons to go if he's trying to avoid tipping off Tom or getting on the wrong side of the Ministry, like the trace and the fact he's the most recognisable wizard ever, despite no one having ever met him (I still don't quite get that, is a small forehead scar really so obvious?).

Also, if he's trying to recruit people to help out, Hogwarts is a good place to start, though if I'm remembering it correctly, that could be breaking the Geneva conventions.

I'm interested that you say there's no such thing as magical strength or ability. You're probably right that canonically there's no mention of it, but there must be some other requirement than just skill and knowledge, because I feel like otherwise it doesn't make sense that Dumbledore is seen as the only wizard strong enough to defeat Voldemort.

I dunno, personally I tend to subscribe to the idea of magic being like a muscle, needing training to grow stronger and having a limit to what it can do. Otherwise, what's to stop a precocious 11 year old from correctly doing the wand movements and incantations for a spell that's taught in seventh year?

In terms of silent casting, I'd probably agree that he could do it as he understands the "knack" to doing it, considering it doesn't seem to have any other requirements other than figuring out how to do it, and may just be too complex for younger students to learn

** I can't say for the first week of term, but even a knowledgeable and creative (and a bit ruthless) student who just finished his first year at Hogwarts would be a menace in the Muggle world. The Levitation Charm can lift very heavy objects and make them move at great speeds, the Fire-Making Charm can start the biggest and most dangerous forest fire the world has ever seen, Colour-Changing can almost completely change your identity by changing the colour of your hair and skin, the Unlocking Charm can open the top state of the art muggle vault, the Severing Charm can cut through everything that isn't protected against it and can cut dragon-hide if applied correctly, a 'botched' simple boil-curing potion (what Neville did) acts similarly the strongest of Muggle acids and could its effects could be strengthened, they can petrify people, disarm them, make them unable to articulate, grow painful boils on their skin, force them to dance wildly or spontaneously sing and they have a grasp of changing vertebrate and living animals into inanimate objects.

That is but a fraction of what a first-year student can do with magic and that is mostly first-year or, at best, second-year level skills. A post Battle of Hogwarts Harry would know much more than just that and his knowledge would surely translate into his magical expertise. I imagine he could be equal to Hermione at the beginning of the first term if he never had the chance to experience magic with a wand before and it would grow exponentially from there. Harry seems to also be above average when it comes to the practical side of magic and we never see this in the first two years because we simply don't see him cast any spell in the first book and barely any in the second one.

But, we also have to remember that even preschoolers are able to apparate without splinching or other crazy things, so it's really a question of if physical age has any effects on one's magical abilities if one has already a N.E.W.T. level knowledge of magic. In this case, Harry would be just as good as in his original life, minus potentially his muscle memory (I won't pretend to understand the human body this much).

*** Good points! It would definitely be interesting to have Harry basically cheating and getting top marks over Hermione, just due to him already knowing most of it. It's kind of funny that your view seems to be that he would be as good apart from muscle memory, because my thoughts were pretty much the opposite (all of the muscle memory, so good at battle tactics and reacting, but a reduced magical output to what he was used to). Ironically, muscle memory was one of the few things I felt certain he'd still have, because as far as I can remember, "muscle memory" is a misnomer and mainly mental.

I hadn't thought about the accidental magic, which as you mentioned can be pretty powerful stuff. My headcanon around that tends to be that accidental magic is more wild and pure magic, so tends to be stronger but less defined.

** Canonically, we don't /really/ know - obviously, we don't have any examples of someone who went back to their kid body.

We have some examples of people with well developed/controlled accidental magic - Lily and Voldemort, off the top of my head. However, they were still not trained - and obviously grew a lot more proficient with magic after being taught.

Personally, I like the interpretation that magical potential/power does need some time to mature (it explains, for instance, why Hogwarts doesn't start earlier). I also like having magic not just be mental - that is, that the body would also play a role in it (so a time traveler back to a point like that would have to go through and practice some again).

With that in mind, I would recommend putting the pre-Hogwarts limits to roughly equivalent with Riddle/Voldemort's capabilities pre-Hogwarts. Then, in school, I'd be fine with speeding it up - but with magic being more tiring (/not/ something explicitly in the books obviously, to forestall an argument about how canon that'd be) and with him still needing some time to practice. A shorter time travel (eg, from the end of 1st year to the beginning of it, or 4th-1st, etc) doesn't require that, but I think the larger jump means you should put some more limits on it.

It should be challenging still, IMO - and having a super powerful Harry running around in his 1st year body /feels/ like it'd be too much to me. I'd probably get bored/lose interest if we see him, say, overpower Bellatrix from the very start - even if it'd be reasonable under certain interpretations of magic, it would not be interesting to me.

** I don't have any strong opinion on character power levels, but if you're trying to keep them grounded, I have a suggestion: Focus the story on something else. For example, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past has a Harry with a fair bit of future knowledge and a greatly expanded magical core from merging his old and young souls together - but not much of the story is about him using it to roflstomp his foes. Mostly it's about how he reconnects with his friends, tries to support them better and train them to survive the war, and help them to get along better with each other. Boosting Neville's confidence, reassuring Ron of his individual worth, helping Hermione feel less alone in her drive to excel, drawing Luna and Ginny into his circle of friends at the first opportunity.

If you focus on the people, then you don't need to worry so much about Harry being OP; it'll be an engaging read regardless.

** I don't think magic is a substance that grows over time. You either have it or you don't. All that matters is how much you know and how skilled you are in applying your knowledge. Basically if old harry is the greatest wizard ever and knows a ton about magic then baby Harry, with old Harry's knowledge, would also be the greatest wizard ever. What defines a great wizard isn't just how many spells they know but how they use the spells they know.

** 11 year old Harry with 17 yr old canon Harry's /knowledge/ should, at the very least, rival 1st yr McGonagall if not the very best 1st years all-time. So, depending on your AU adult Harry, he should be talented.

*** Is 1st year McGonagall a measure of smarts/skill? I've never heard that one before, it's usually just Hermione.

And yeah, my thought process was that as he has all the knowledge, he'd likely be able to do second, maybe third year-level spells at first year, and the only thing holding him back would be his pure magical ability.

I'm very wary of using the term magical core, but it does simplify things if I use that, and just try and stay away from the "Unusually large core" and "Locks placed on the core by Manipulative!Dumbledore" tropes.

**** JKR added some info about McGonagall in one of her side books. McGonagall's school years mirror Hermione down to the sorting, but, on the strength that she was noticed for transfiguration skill and became an animagus, I have student McGonagall ranked higher than Hermione.

"Pure magical ability" factors very little, though it /does/ exist. If we're crediting knowledge and understanding as the most important factors, your Harry should, with a little practice, be able to do the majority of what the adult Harry could.

** Well, a firstie casting stuff like an Imperius Curse should be impossible, even with time-travel knowledge. I'm a firm believer that every wizard has some level of power - like humans have different levels of physical power & endurance - only that this matters even more when we are talking about magic.\\
You are able to train, exercise, and increase your magical power with knowledge, but eleven is too young for strong spells.\\
It doesn't matter if the mind travels back and is stuck in a young body. Your physique influences your mentality heavily, and you need to adapt first. You also need to regain your 'muscle memory' in regards to magic.\\
My guess is that even if a 40yeas Harry travels back, being an 11years-old again, he will need 1-2 years min. to adjust to the new condition fully.

Well, to sum it up. I think that a time-travel Harry will be able to reach his peak after 1 1/2 years or so with diligent training etc. so he adjusts every aspect to his new condition.

*** That was basically my thoughts, except I'd probably hold back full power a while longer, maybe fourth year he'd be as strong as the average adult wizard and fifth and sixth year he'd be back to his own level, depending on what his level was like before the time travel. I'd definitely veer from canon as to what Harry and the Future were like before he came back, just so he has a genuine reason to come back.

**** Yeah, that's a more realistic approach. We really don't know how magic works, but I am pretty sure that using powerful magic should affect the body in some way. Maybe as if you were trying to lift something very, very heavy. Even if you manage it, you will feel damn exhausted, sweaty, and your back or muscles will hurt a little.\\
Something like that should apply to magic.\\
Using powerful stuff stresses the body, and probably also the mind/spirit. Only an adult may be able to /resist the radiation/ or whatever without damaging the body in some way.
