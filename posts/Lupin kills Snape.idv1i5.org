Searching for fanfiction where Sirius' joke goes too far


** None of the fics I know ever considers that if Snape got killed by Lupin that night, there could be some really dire consequences:

- Lupin would be arrested and kissed by dementors
- Sirius would be arrested and sentenced to Azkaban
- Dumbledore would lose his job as headmaster
- Lily would forever hate James Potter

*** I'll play the devil's advocate: if Snape had been killed, a paranoid Sirius could race Pomfrey down there and pull a Barty Crouch, transfiguring his corpse into something. Morbid thought, but then he wouldn't tell James, nor Remus, nor Peter. Snape's head of house would just assume he'd run off after Sirius sneaks into the common room with his brother's help and takes away a few of his valuables. To outsiders, Severus Snape simply disappeared. Sirius lives with this secret his entire life, and his friends are none the wiser...

Sinister, but plausible.

**** Still, the elephant in the room remains the war against Voldemort. Now without Snape around to ear drop the prophecy, how are things going to turn out?

Sirius gotten Snape killed must have some impacts on his personality though, and how is that going to affect the plot?

***** Voldemort doesn't know about the prophecy, and since it's implied that a prophecy has power if one only believes in it, then things may span out extremely differently.

Sirius getting Snape killed might make him either resentful or even more desensitised because he didn't suffer consequences for his actions. Indeed, his arrogance might accelerate because nobody even suspects what he did.

**** that is a creepy idea...

And I would love to see how it plays out. How paranoid does Sirius get, would he learn occlumency to hide this secret, would he give into this darkness or would he try to become better

***** There's actually a small theory in the fandom that Sirius does know the tiniest bit of occlumency. Something about Snape flicking his eyes to his wand whereas he normally would make eye contact, suggests that maybe Sirius is blocking him from his mind? His survival with the Dementors as well because a simple idea isn't fuel enough. I definitely think he'd be talented enough for it, however. But yes, I definitely think he'd become more cautious.

Where he takes it from there, I don't know. Maybe he develops arrogance because he got away with it, and wants to do it more. Cue an infamous serial killer who surfaces in late 1978. Fun idea, but inconsistent with his character, unless...this serial killer murders exclusively corrupt people. Lucius Malfoy, Rodolphus Lestrange. More adventurous, Barty Crouch Snr. So I think he'd definitely learn occlumency, and maybe even develop some self loathing that makes him turn into vigilante by night, because not even Order business is enough.

Or, since in my original comment Regulus helps him, his brother is the only person who knows, and he swears him to secrecy. The willow incident is before sixth year, so Sirius hasn't run away yet. Maybe, in order to repay Regulus he stays back at Grimmauld Place to protect his little brother, and becomes a Death Eater spy for Dumbledore. Ironically, he takes Snape's place...

****** Or a combination out of some of those. Like he becomes the death eater spy, but a serial killer at the same time and I mean he more than anyone would have the information who to target. So he only passes on the infomation that he didn't use himself.

And he is confincing himself that this killing and everything is his redeemtion and being better than before

******* I mean, he'd have to be pretty depraved and delusional for it to become this way. Maybe he turns that way after he tells Remus and James what actually happened, and the latter takes a stand, which means that Sirius will have to owe up to his mistakes...or Sirius as an assassin.

I really want to read one such story.

******** part of me wants to write that story. Plot bunnies are running wild, but I have like 5 other stories I want to finsh/ write first...

Maybe as a really condensed oneshot... I have this idea in my head how Regulus would help even more with the cover up... like Regulus, who knew Severus a lot better and who has another hidden talent in copying hand writing and sends a letter to Lily to explain. How he was offered a chance to join with the death eaters and he wanted it. He wanted to join so much, to prove himself, to gain power and all he had to do was torture/kill/something along that line a muggleborn and that was a price for greatness he was willing to make. One nameless faceless person to for real power for a real chance that being better, but then they told him that it wasn't any muggleborn, it was her. And he couldn't do it. So he fleed and she shouldn't look for him, because they will watch her and if she finds him, they will too and they both will be dead.

Because that would explain why he disappears without a word and nobody could find him...

**** Well, Remus would be the wiser, returning to his senses with Snape stuck in his teeth. I wonder how he'd take that. Could he still be friends with Sirius? It's pretty amazing he stayed friends after the canon version, so this might not be different. He'd still be like, “Wow, I can't believe anyone's willing to be friends with me. If he wants to use me as a murder weapon, I guess that's fine.”

*** I would say it depends on how things happen...

Did Sirius still tell James and James was just too late? Did James get injured in this attempt? Because then I see a chance of Lily forgiving James who lost his best friend (in Remus and a bit in Sirius) as well...

Did James get away uninjured, but late and decide to start get everything in place to save Remus (and Sirius)? Like getting brooms for them to flee on before people realize what happened? Maybe setting money aside and they then have to live in the muggle world? I mean could you imagine the angst and drama of those two being stuck together after that.

​

But one thing about Sirus... I'm not sure if he did something that could put him in jail. It shouldn't be too hard to claim, that he was just 'warning' another student or discussing a shared theory, about Lupin being a werewolf. Sirus didn't do anything to force Snape down there. Funny enough I would think it is Snape and James who could get in legal trouble about it. They were the once that disturbed and opened the cage of a transformed werewolf. That sounds far more illegal to me than what Sirius did. I would expect that telling about werewolves and how to get to them is actually not forbidden, but normally only those with the means to kill such a werewolf would enter and I don't think it would be forbidden to kill a transformed werewolf. So telling about a werewolf wouldn't be forbidden either. But risking releasing one would be highly illegal. So you either have the means to kill them or you stay the fuck away...

​

Edit: just to be clear I think it was morally very wrong what Sirius did. I just don't think that it was legally as wrong as people pretend it to be. As that it was clear that Sirius would face Askaban for it. Now I agree that legally Remus would be punished for it

  After a prank gone too far, Sirius Black realises that things have to change. He never wanted to follow the path of his parents and the realisation that, in certain ways, he was like them wasn't good. His life from there on took another direction. One person certainly found this new Black heir very interesting.

  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.
