Got interested in the idea with students with differing religions at Hogwarts after reading a fic. Forgot the name but featured a Jewish Ravenclaw I believe.

Wondering if there were any similar fics? Can be important to the plot or not.


** you're definitely thinking of goldstein by laazov, which I agree was super enlightening and informative ( I also learned a hell of a lot about Jews and Jewish culture, etc)

  Harry needs to take control of his life. Some very old magic is at work, and our hero finds hidden strength within himself. Snape becomes a major player. Better summary inside. Multiple pairings.

  I was eleven years old when I first heard about Hogwarts, but my faith told me everything about that school was evil. This is the story of how I reconciled my religion with the truth about what I am.
