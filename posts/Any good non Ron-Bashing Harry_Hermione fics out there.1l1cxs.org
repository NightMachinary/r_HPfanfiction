I'll be honest, I'm a sucker for Harry/Hermione (AKA HHr HP/HG) fics... But I feel like a lot of the popular ones take care of the canon pairings by characterising Ron as pig-headed, lazy, and gluttonous. It gets old after a while. So, has anyone come across a good one where the Golden Trio is intact?


** I'm on my phone right now so I can't link it to you but if you look through my history there's a thread I started a whole back asking for favorite H/Hr fics that got a reasonably large response. As far as fanfic preferences, I'm in the exact same boat you are so any of the fics I posted in that thread should have very little to no Weasley bashing Happy reading!

*** Not sure Vox Corporis qualifies as "non Ron-Bashing". There's the long "you don't deserve her" rant, and the "In case it hasn't already become painfully obvious, I hate Ron. Hate him with the fiery passion of a thousand suns." author's note.

**** I admit it's been some years since I read this, but if there is Ron bashing, I remembered it as having been rather low-key and not the overt character assassination we normally see in bashing fics. If I recall, the author's venting her distaste for Ron plays out as a much-diminished role in things. Dumbledore, I remember, is treated sympathetically.

Thank you for the reminder though. I apologize if anyone was disappointed by the consequences of my faulty memory.

** Harry Potter and the Fifth Element has very good H/Hr. Don't be daunted by its complexity or length, just start reading. It was partially written before HBP

***** I made it to about chapter 75 before just giving up. I love long stories, but when you have a 10,000 word chapter detailing the events of one morning, and realise that despite being 700,000 words in, only a few months have passed, it's a real struggle to keep going.

****** Well you only had like 10 chapters left and were more than 1 million words in. On FF.net the story is only updated to ch. 74 and 1.1 million words, on the other site I thought it was complete at 83 or so.

******* I didn't know that at the time though, this was when it was still being written. I was quite late to the party as well, started it around mid 2010, read as far as it went, stayed around for about a years worth of updates then gave up. I might have another go at some point though, now it's finished.
