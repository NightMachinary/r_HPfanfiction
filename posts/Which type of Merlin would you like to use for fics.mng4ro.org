Type A: Merlin as viewed by most people.

When one thinks of Merlin, they think of an old man who is a mentor type and is a powerful mage who had the unfortunate circumstance of being tricked by his student. This Merlin is viewed as a powerhouse who chooses to be an advisor to the king instead as he trained him and raised him from a young age. As an old man, he has had time to train, hone and discover new magic and is a terrifying opponent to face off against and is a valuable well of knowledge. This is a Merlin who handles things from the back as a true Sorcerer type character. This Merlin is a mentor who eases his students into their studies and teaches them moral lessons. This is an emotional type Merlin who prefers to handle things in the shadows and likes to have others do things for him so that he had time to do more things. He is a Canon!Dumbledore type character, preferring to help his students and is a mystical, strange character who likes to pretend he is kooky to let his enemies' guard down around him. Although this is the more common Merlin Type, he has potential to be used well as a character although he doesn't leave much room for growth as he is normally an old man or someone close to the end of his life.

Type B: A younger Merlin fresh on his journey to become a mage.

This type is a type where it could be used for time travel fics, either he comes to the modern day or a character from HP goes to Arthurian times or for a Medieval AU. In my opinion, it could be bland at the beginning but has potential to grow into whatever character you want. If you want him to grow into a villain to fight, you have the option. If you want him to grow into Type A, then there's your chance. He is an empty slate meant to be molded into whatever the author wants.

Type C: Anime Merlin.

This type of Merlin draws less on his aspect as an old man but dives deep into his roots as a half demon, specifically, half incubus. This means that as a demon, while his evil tendencies are halved as a result of his birth, and because he was blessed with holy water, this means that instead of being evil, he is merely mischievous. As an incubus, a sex demon, he naturally appears as a handsome young man somewhere between his late 20's/early 30's. As a demon, he does not understand emotions well and eats dreams in order to feel human things. He is also good with a sword and staff and prefers to use those in combat. In my opinion, this is a Merlin who is a mischievous mentor type who throws his students into the deep end without warning to test if they are ready and prepares them for tough times ahead. He prefers hands on combat with both his sword and staff instead of being a back line supporter. This is a calculating Merlin who handles problems himself instead of having others do it for him. This is a rarer type of Merlin, being used only in a few fandoms, specifically the Fate fandom where he originates. He has a bit of potential growth where he learns to be more human and mix his demon and human side well, just in time for something.


** So....Gandalf, TV Merlin and Fate Merlin?

** I would want the Merlin from the TV show tbh. He's just a general nice guy who tends to be really powerful and just wants to have fun with Arthur etc. However, you could also go for old grumpy Merlin who tends to take after Gaius. Imagine him talking to Nicholas Flamel like "When I was your age..." as a joke and 'ol Nico just looks like he's on the office. Idk, it depends if u wanna go for a crack fic tho

** I vote for the Merlin from the T.A. Barron book series, cause I just remembered those and think it would be cool.

Most similar to Type B, TV Merlin.

I'm also just realizing that T.A. Barron Merlin is pretty much just TV Merlin mixed with Harry Potter from the Blindness fanfic.
