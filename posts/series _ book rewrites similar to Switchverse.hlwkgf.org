I just finished the Switchverse series, which seems to have been abandoned after book 3 was done?

I really enjoyed students from all houses being involved and the mixed up sorting compared to canon.

In general I am looking for other fanfictions that span over the different years while not dragging on because the author gets too caught up in world building that either gets left behind or is used to justify one plot twist.
