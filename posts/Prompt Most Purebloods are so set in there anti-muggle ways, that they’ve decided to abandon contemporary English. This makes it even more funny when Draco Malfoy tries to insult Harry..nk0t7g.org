-Harry and the other muggleborns are like "...wut?"

-Cue chaos and remedial Latin lessons with the likes of Crabbe and Goyle

-The Ravenclaw muggleborns are freaking out, they never prepared for this!

-Harry decides to say "screw it" and gets a snake instead of learning Latin. Speak to the snake, snake speaks to Harry, Harry has the snake write down what he wants to say.

Harry gets accused of a lot of stuff during the series (mostly black magic and murder) and the first few times he makes it worse because he ranted about pancakes or something to a Senior Council Member in an open forum before having his old mentor step in and translate. Happy to report he does get better at Latin later in the series though.

** If you think about how isolated the Wizarding World is, they should speak their own variant of Early Modern English. Even some Muggleborns incoming that wouldn't change that much. If you isolate two groups for long enough they will develope different languages, that's why German, English, Spanish, Italian etc all have similarities but are very different at the same time. Once upon the group who settled in Europe spoke the same language, then they split up.

** Translating spells. I know there's no precedent for them and evidence in the fourth book suggests otherwise.

But if wizarding people truly had a different language from the muggles, the necessity to not be in the dark when muggles talk will drive the need to invent such a translating spell. And as far as we know translating spells don't seem that lore breaking.

Imo, Fudge would be speaking Bulgarian to please the foreign leader and extend courtesies or perhaps he himself didn't know the translating spells between bulgarian and english. Consider this: if Fudge were truly in need for translation wouldn't he have hired translators? But then again Fudge was extremely frustrated about the communication gap, he could've ordered someone to translate if there was such a spell...

My intuition of course, comes from the "Tom Marvolo Riddle" <--> "I am Lord Voldemort" thing. If we can rearrange letters then that paves /potentially/ the way for translation.
