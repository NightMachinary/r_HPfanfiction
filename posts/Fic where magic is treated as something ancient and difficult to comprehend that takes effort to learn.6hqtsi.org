** [[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

  "I'll give you a hint," he said, when he saw Alex was stuck. "What is so special about moving your wrist that it changes the world? Why is it that the same movement could just as well create the shape of a dog as of a phoenix?"

  That was easy.

  "The movement is a symbol," said Alex, "it represents what's in the mind."

  "Precisely. There is a phenomenon called Internalisation - you'll study it in philosophy in fifth year, I believe. Internalisation is the process by which, as one advances in one's understanding and practice of magic, the physical becomes mental. When I conjured the wood, I made no complex motions with my wand. And yet, those motions were in my mind, buried deeply.
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Canon-ish yet original take on magic. According to author, only on hiatus.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  "Fascinating," he said, straightening up. "And acceptable, for the most part. The target destination in Diagon Alley is a bit ill-defined, and the return destination of the Dursleys is a bit weak, but the portion of the Portkey dealing with adverse momentum and inertial compensation is exemplary."

  "Yeah," said Harry, shrugging. "Ever since I started practicing Arresto Momentum nonverbally, all of the movement-based magic I do seems to be a bit easier."

  "Interesting how that works out, isn't it?" said Dumbledore, his benign expression betraying just a hint of a smile.
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, and you think Helga couldn't hold her own against Godric or Salazar? But in some aspects you are right. Hufflepuff does not at all fit your temperament, although you admire their ideals of loyalty. What you must take from your fellow house is their calm determination. You've asked me how to prepare to fight a dark wizard decades older, and there is a great deal of advice I could give. But right now what you need most is hard, steady work. Can you work, every day, to improve? Can you pursue difficult knowledge, not from love of it, nor for its immediate gains, but as a stepping stone for the future? Can you work and work some more, even when progress appears miniscule or fleeting? In short, Mr. Potter, what makes great wizards is not just ambition, or power, or genius, although all those help. It is their willingness to act rather than to react, and to work rather than play."
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  The end-of-term project at Dursmstrang makes up for a large percentage of each student's final grade and is designed to not only demonstrate the student's understanding of the material taught, but to go beyond what has been explained in the class. While working on his final project in Transfiguration, Mr. Potter managed to find an exception to the age old theory that living and nonliving things are incompatible with each other in switching swells (To see the full discovery analysis, please turn to page 7).
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] - Inspired by the above fic comes this AU in the world where Voldemort won. Unfortunately pretty short and hiatused so far, but I hold hope that Halt will continue it.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh...is it any good." Harry hummed in response. "So how do you perfect it? Your spell, I mean?"

  Harry marked the page he was on, deciding that it was a good time for a break. He set down the book on his study desk, next to an Abraxan stuffed toy that had been with him since he could crawl. "Well, there are a lot of things that affect it. You've got the spell-specific factors, like how the wand motion, the incantation and how well you understand the magic behind it."

  "Makes sense."

  "Then you've got the general factors that affect all spells, not just a specific one," continued Harry. "They split this one between Understanding of Magic-"

  "Wait, hold up." Robert's brows furrowed. "You just said that understanding magic was a spell-specific thing."

  Harry stood up to stretch his cramped muscles. "No, no, the first one is about the understanding the magic behind the spell itself. This is about how well you understand magic in general."
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. On temporary (I hope) hiatus.

Semi-relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  Most of the time, however, Harry had spent reading his new book of forgotten charms masters. Even better than he had originally thought, the book not only made a study of unearthing long lost authors and descriptions of their achievements, it even tried to recreate some of the forgotten research and listed all relevant books that may either help deciphering this old lore, or may have been used by said authors themselves. Harry had excitedly skimmed through Nentray's chapter, and was delighted to find that the author had managed to replicate a very respectable amount of experiments and charms that were believed to be lost. How the author, a certain Professor Mandus, had managed this, when he himself had stated that Nentray's works had disappeared, was beyond Harry.
#+end_quote

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] - Hermione wanted to be a great witch, and there is a house for those who want to be great - Slytherin. There is just one problem, it may be not the nicest house to be in if you're muggleborn. Nice story about Hermione getting more hardcore thanks to fighting Slytherin bullies. Sadly on hiatus.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  "I believe this is primarily a problem of trying to run before you can walk," McGonagall said. "Let's start by performing the same spell using transfiguration basics."

  Hermione stifled a groan. Transfiguration basics were described in the appendix to the transfiguration textbook as a method of simplifying the visualization required to perform a proper transfiguration. She had been excited to learn about them at first, until she discovered how tedious they were.

  Even the simple matchstick to needle transformation, when broken down to the basics, was quite complex-jabs to define the spacial coordinates of the object to be changed, the little waggle that indicated wood, the spiraling motion that signaled a transformation in material, the zigzag that represented metal, followed by the motions that defined the change in shape-instead of a relatively simple wand motion it was twenty seconds of paintstaking work. The payoff was that if you performed the wand motions correctly, the match would transform as long as you kept anything even vaguely needle-like in mind.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Dead.

Relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid continued, "You do get a point for your Class 1 Petrifaction, Mr. Potter, so you end up with five and a half points," Harry smirked triumphantly over Hagrid's shoulder, and Granger just glared. Hagrid chuckled a bit more, and asked curiously, "What spell did you use to induce the Petrifaction, Mr. Potter?"

  "Just an overpowered Petrificus Totalus, sir, I panicked when the Knarl attacked," he responded quickly. He had his ideas as to whether or not it was actually panic, but said nothing.

  Hagrid nodded. "That should do it. The spell was initially made to induce Petrifaction, but was thrown aside when it was realized that the amount of extra energy needed for Petrifaction could be more easily and efficiently used in a naturally more powerful spell, like Petrificus, which is ironically a significantly more difficult spell to perform at a basic level than the 'Totalus'" he said, using air quotes to emphasize the meaning.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.

Given that it seems like we have similar tastes, do you have any other recommendations?
