Arthur is such a huge fan of Muggle related stuff, seems like a shame that JKRowling never got Arthur and Hermione's parents together to talk, I'd think it'd be pretty funny.

It doesn't have to be the main part of the story, it can be a small part, but any of it could be fun.

Seeing Hermione's parents interact with the Weasleys, Harry and any other Witches or Witches could be a cool thing to see as well.
