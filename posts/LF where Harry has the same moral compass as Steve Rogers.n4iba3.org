As the title says, I am looking for Harry has a strong sense of morals and ethics. The "power he knows not" isn't any mystical power, it's just that Harry is a good man. Perhaps he convinces Voldemort to find redemption or they have a similar rivalry as Captain America and Red Skull. P.S. No slash please.

  "I can do this all day," Harry said.

  Lucius rolled his eyes. "We all can. Magical exhaustion isn't canon."

** Maybe have him punch Kingsley Shacklebolt while exclaiming that "a black man wouldnt be in power" and then shouting that Voldemort must have taken over because of it. (Seriously Captain America punched Fury jr using that logic in the comics after he first woke up, only replace Voldemort with Hydra)

*** Sounds like Ultimate Captain America. There's a reason why fans disliked the Ultimate universe, Ultimate Spidey was the only character that wasn't written as a racist or sociopath or asshole just to make them more "relatable" or "modern".

**** Additionally, Ultimate Cap was operating on the assumption that he hadn't slept for 55 years and had been on speaking terms with the highest-ranking African-American officers at the time.

Also, remember when Ultimate Cap was sneered at for being disgusted with the incestuous relationship between Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch?
