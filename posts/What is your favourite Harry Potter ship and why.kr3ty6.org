** Whenever I think about it, my mind goes back to the fifth movie, when Harry and Luna see Thestrals together. I don't even remember if it's from the books or not, but this scene was just so heartwarming. On top of that, Harry finally met someone to whom he could relate, at least a little bit.

**** This is the thing. They are the only ship that I am happy to follow and trust simply because it makes the story so much more dramatic and heartbreaking.

Lupin losing his two best friends after being betrayed by the person he loves in one night. Then living for 12 years all alone with lycanthropy until suddenly your asked to go back to school and the first person you see is your dead best friends child unconscious at your feet. And having to live in the school with all those memories AND your old school nemisis who you once almost murdered by accident. All while your escaped convict ex boyfriend is trying to break in.

Then! Over the course of one very dramatic evening, you discover your old best friend who you mourned for is still alive and was actually a traitor the entire time. So the man you love has been wrongfully imprisoned in a hellscape for 12 years and you did nothing to help.

And THEN!! You turn into a werewolf and almost try to murder the trailer, your boyfriend, your dead best friends son and his three friends and your nemesis which you don't learn about untill after the fact. Then while your getting fired your escapee boyfriend flees again and you are once again left alone and unemployed with your entire reality turned upside down.

Remus Lupin is such a character. Jesus christ. Is that man ok I want to give him a hug....

****** She was just way too perfect in fanfics and in canon she is very annoying. I'd hate her in real life and it kind of put me off her character.

I also started reading Drarry and I like Harry more than Hermione so that happened.

If it wasn't Harry/Draco, it was Ginny/Draco or Draco/Luna. Anyone but Hermione tbh.

Idk Hermione just stopped being my fave. I like her as a side character but not as the main pairing

**** Iirc he only said that in that one scene in DH. And never before or after...so Harmony makes imo more sense then the canon-pairings. The way i. e. Ron and Hermione act with eachother is kinda toxic. Semi-fine for friends and maybe siblings but in a romantic relationship? Yeah no. They would destroy each other one way or another.

********** That has nothing to do with Harmony. Heck even Ginny/Harry makes more sense (imo) and I consider canon-Ginny little more then a bwl-fangirl. In my eyes Ron shares the last place of suitable /romantic/ partners for Hermione with Draco and Pansy (there canon-selfes of course, fanfiction-counterparts are a complete different cup of tea) Don't get me wrong Ron as a character has great potential and how he was portrayed in the books shows that he can be a great friend but those two /happily/ married?

Ron because they clearly love each other a lot and if they added attraction in it would be extremely natural.
