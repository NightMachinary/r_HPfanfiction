#+begin_quote
  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** Old-ish pureblood families (Prewitt and Weasley). 4-5 kids in Hogwarts at one time. Minor department head salary? The Weasley property/ies has to be bigger than what it is shown. Orchards, farms, rental properties, etc. Not enough to have them swimming in money, but more than enough to keep up their current living situation.

I can totally see Molly managing their estate while Arthur is at work. Being a landlady suits her.

They could have been scammed out of their money, or more lucrative properties and businesses. Or they could have burnt down in the Voldemort and Grendelwald wars, leaving land.

I can see the Weasleys making a comeback after they all graduate. Once everyone leaves the house and can take care of theirself, the money being spent on the kids can go back into the businesses or properties, increasing their return.

â€‹

The WWW shop? I don't think the twins could afford that. That placement in Diagon alley? The size of it? A thousand galleons could not get that much. Nor could I see the weasleys getting a loan of that proportion from anyone. I'm guessing it could be an old property the Weasleys or Prewitts owned, and the twins got from their father and busted their asses to fix it up.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
