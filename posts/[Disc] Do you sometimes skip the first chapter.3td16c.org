I've noticed that I cannot stand reading the first chapter of many HP fics where the author is trying to set up the AU (i.e. how Harry turns into smexy batman-jesus-brad pitt in the summer of his sixth year to gather up the 7 magical pixie balls). It seems to be really apparent in stories where the author picks some point x in canon and then goes off on their own tale. On fics where the change is completely before canon, i.e. linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), or something outside of the HP world, the first chapter setup is much easier to get through. What do you think?


** If I find I have to wade through a lot of shit in the first chapter I just quit the story as that's an indicator a lot more shit may be coming.

*** Exactly. There are hundreds of thousands of fanfics out there.

If I skip the first chapter of a bad story, then I'm just going to be cringing /and/ confused for the second chapter.

*** Yeah. If I think there's a chance the writing will improve, then I'll skim a couple chapters ahead to see. I've caught a few decent fics like that. But the first chapter is usually a good indicator.

**** I mean, complete reboots of the storyline (i.e. linkffn(firebird's son) ) have manageable first chapters, and in fact suck me into the story quite easily even though the changes might seem as equally contrived as a generic Voldemort/HP fic.

*** I've made rare exceptions to that rule. One trilogy that I've read, the first part - the writing was terrible. 2nd part not so bad, by the 3rd, the author knew what was up and it was actually enjoyable, although the ending was a bit.. Rushed?

***** Not a Harry Potter one, it's Spirited Away. I should clarify. Its not terrible writing, but I found it a bit clunky to read, and then as she progressed it got much better. Anyway the author is Velf and the first story is Courage of the Spirit. On mobile so having trouble linking it.

****** I feel like the Dresden Files series is this way. I decided to start the series because of a "buy two, get one free" sale the bookstore was having. Later I was so glad it happened this way because I wouldn't have continued past the first book or two if I hadn't already owned the third. Luckily I loved the third and now it's one of my favorite series.

*** That's why I try to give it a shot, but I feel like most stories have arbitrary changes to the character to force their story to work out. That's what really kills the immersion for me: seeing all these characters flipped upside down in the middle of canon as the author takes the wheels onto their own world.

** There are times when I skip way, way more chapters.

Its rarely the first one. I respect that the author wants to set the scene, even if its at first just a slight divergence from the original plot.

But what I definitely skip are "Harry goes shopping", "Harry does workout" or other Grind-LevelUp-Chapters with the protagonist just doing some montage-style makeover. Extra points if he gets tattoos and starts smoking.

** After thinking about it for a bit, here's my conclusion.

Though Rowling didn't make a completely airtight narrative throughout her books, she did describe her characters well enough that on point x on the canon timeline, we, as readers, have a decent idea of how the characters in the story can turn out based on their previous actions and such. However, many slightly AU writers forget this and think that they can arbitrarily change everything past said point x w/o considering what has happened beforehand. I feel like that's why complete reboots/changes to base canon are easier to read since much of the story is showing what sort of wizarding world Harry will discover this time and allows OOC to be slightly more acceptable.

** As a reader? No. As a writer? Yes.

Example: Imagine I start writing a time travel fic. My goal is to focus on the interaction of Harry and other Hogwarts students.

In this scenario I could either write a chapter about how his live is in the future, the resulting twist that sends him back in time, him being confused about the change, him starting to make changes and then finally arriving in Hogwarts.

Or, since none of these things are so unpredictable that a reader wouldn't be able to fill in the gaps, I could simply start with “And here I was, dangling my far too short legs from the chair, waiting to be sorted in to a house for the second time. Time travel sucks, especially in situations where all you do is wait for information that you technically already know.“

Tada, 2-3 introduction chapters compressed into two sentences! If there's something I find worth mentioning I can always push Harry into a similar situation and make him remember things.

As an author 'skipping chapters' is not only allowed, in many cases it's necessary.

But as a reader? No. I'll assume that the author has a reason for his first chapter, that he'll drop hints of what is yet to come. If the first chapter then only is canon rehashing, I'll know the rest will be similar, in which case I don't skip a chapter, but the whole fic.

*** This is a really cool thing to know about writing, thanks. I have never attempted writing fanfiction but I'm thinking about it and you hit the nail on the head on articulating what it is I find really annoying in most fanfics I eject out of - "And Harry felt a tug and went whirling around dimensions for two paragraphs and we spent four more learning the favorite colors and biographies of the bronze Ravenclaw trio".

** I skip the first chapter many times, especially if it's time travel or AU setup. Oftentimes because these kind of fics have a very corny or cheesy lines filling up the first few chapters. like:

"War was won but everyone is dead...blah blah.....Phoneix....blah blah.......second chance."

It feels like an awkward narration that we sometimes see in movies. I just hope that author has a good premise and the quality of fic improves over time. If something in later chapters causes any confusion, I quickly skim over the first chapter.

** Sometimes I will, but it usually just means I'll be dropping the fic in short order.

Sometimes I'll get a few chapters in, realise I'm not enjoying the story at all and skip ahead a few chapters to see if things pick up. This rarely bodes well for the story.
