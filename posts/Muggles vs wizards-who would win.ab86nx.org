With all the powers wizards have and the technologies muggles have,who would win?Wizards could mind control the muggles,that is for sure!But what about defect muggleborns checking up on them?Fiendfyre vs treacherous muggleborns,thermal sensors vs apparating into a place with a disillusionment charm and/or invisibility cloaks,nukes vs millions of muggle lives,the military against Voldemort,Ice Guns/machine guns/close combat vs wands and so much more!Who indeed?

PS:Sorry about it being so messy-I accidentally pressed the back button two times when I was almost done with my way more organized discussion.And before I forget,happy New Year's Eve/New Year!!!!!!


** Muggles dont even stand a chance. Its the same thing you would see in alien invasion movies. The enemy is so advanced that they might as well be gods. I think the big problem in this discussion is when people imagine such a war in conventional terms. In that case yeah, wizardkind doesnt stand a chance, purely due to the superior numbers of Muggles. But in a real war (and in a more meta way, if such a war was to be written realistically, considering the abilities magic gives), wizards could obliterate all muggle nations without even breaking the statue of secrecy. Just from the top of my head, here are some suggestions:

1. Infiltrate the government buildings of nations with nuclear missiles, place an Imperio on whoever can order such strikes, and then enjoy the show. This could be done through apparition, Animagus form, transfigurations, polyjuice, and probably few more I cant think of on the spot. I think it is safe to assume that magical ministries do place wards and guards next to such persons, but nothing is unbreachable. Hell, not even Hogwarts or Gringotts were, I doubt a muggle presidential palace is.

2. Send wizards to assassinate the command structures of muggle armies, at least the most powerful ones. Just apparate in their homes.

3. Use polyjuice for false-flag ops. Terrorist attacks, false military operations, assassinations. Enough to either spark an all out war or social turmoil and violence.

4. Apparate at power plants and take them down. On a similar note, apparate across countries and burn down the agricultural field.

5. Apparate on oil rigs and take them down. Also on a similar note, take down shipments of oil.

6. Biological warfare. Im sure there are plenty of potions or viruses that wizards have/could develop which could balance the numbers, so to speak. Heck, just pour the draught of living death in the water supplies.

These are just the things I can think of on the spot. Grindelwald was right when he asked who the law (statute of secrecy) protects. Its meant to keep muggles safe, not wizardkind. If you look at it realistically, wizards could conquer earth with ease. In fact, I think the more technologically advanced muggles are, the easier it would be for wizards to kill them off, or subdue them.

*** Yup, agreed. I get that a lot of wizards in HP can act stupid, but some people on this sub act as though they'd just sit around, having tea, getting nuked, and that's that. Nvm the fact that muggles likely wouldn't even use nukes, but any weapon muggles have the wizards have.

Honestly you only need one decent wizard to take down an entire muggle government. Pretty sure Dumbledore or Voldemort alone could conquer a world without wizards suuuper easily.

​

Unfortunately no. In any fanfiction all confrontations between wizards and mundane people look unbelievable, because authors either knows nothing about modern weapons and war tactics or are all for something spectacular (even if it's stupid with some analysis).

​

Also usually meet a problem he or she just produces some new magic to resolve it. Just because.

​

Using the same logic, in case of war a powerful wizard would just make a ritual that kill all non-magicals. Just because it's magic and it doesn't follow any laws.

** The thing about the "wizards vs muggles" debate is that most people end up turning the topic into "Death Eaters vs muggles, muggleborns, squibs, and all wizards who support Dumbledore". On a fun note, I'm actually impressed nobody mentioned the infamously non-existent shotgun quote at all +(yet)+. Maybe, just maybe that misconception died in a fire like the even more infamous (yet equally non-existent) quote about Nagini being the snake from the zoo in book 1. +(who am I kidding, people still believe both those stupid misconceptions anyway)+

In an actual war of muggles versus the wizarding world, muggles cannot win against wizards. It is literally impossible. Even if you narrowed down "wizards" to just be "Death Eaters + DH Ministry of Magic", the Dementors cannot be killed and are only affected by the Patronus Charm. Sure, the Dementors are not wizards but they are used as weapons, especially by dark wizards. Muggles cannot use magic, therefore they cannot do anything to the Dementors.

Since I'm talking about wizards vs muggles, the muggles would be defeated since none of the wizards would be helping the muggles in that scenario (if they did, it wouldn't be wizards vs muggles; it would be muggles and good wizards vs the evil wizards).

Even ignoring the Dementors, there is the Imperius Curse which, contrary to popular belief, doesn't actually have an upper limit on the number of people that can placed under the Imperius Curse by the same caster. There's a reason why the Imperius Curse was a legitimate defence aside from the Ministry being semi-incompetent to completely incompetent. IIRC, its implied in canon that those under the Imperius Curse returned to normal after Voldemort died each time, suggesting that the majority of the Imperius Curse usage in the First and Second Wizarding War was done by him personally.

Combining the Memory Charm with the Imperius Curse, and the victim will never remember being under the Imperius Curse since their false memories will have them believe that their Imperius'd state is perfectly normal. The Imperius Curse probably wouldn't even be needed if the Memory Charm is cast well enough.

I'd argue that not only could wizards utterly decimate the muggle world with zero real effort if they actually wanted, but it wouldn't even take that many people. *There are 195 countries in the entire world, but you wouldn't even need to take down that many nations. At the bare minimum, the wizards would only really need to deal with the UK, France, America, and Russia to dispose of the majority of the muggle world's military might.* The only thing that actually stops someone like Voldemort or Grindelwald from single-handedly conquering the muggle world is either the presence of an equally skilled opponent (i.e. Dumbledore), or not having enough of a following to bend the global wizarding community to their will.

*TL;DR: Muggles cannot stand a chance against wizards at all. Dementors, the Imperius Curse, and Memory Charms are just too strong. Conquering the muggle world is far easier for wizards than it sounds since it only requires conquering 4-5 of the most powerful muggle governments with the Imperius Curse and Memory Charms*

** Realistically, a war between the two wouldn't count on numbers or direct combat. Idk if wizards have anything that is as destructive as nukes unless you count Crimes of Grindelwald as canon, but they wouldn't really need to.

It's like the Illuminati bs. If they did exist, they'd have already won. They don't need to destroy us all to do it, only get the leaders to shut up and do nothing. Which is what wizards in canon seem to do lol

It'd be super easy for wizards to end the war. Not by killing all muggles, but by imperiusing the world leaders or simply replacing them. And so long as wizards weren't actively killing muggle citizens, they'd move on with their lives. You know much corruption we see in our world right now? Yet so many people just don't give a fuck if it's not affecting them directly.

Even if wizards went around setting fiendfyre on random neighborhoods, America is like the only place that would really stand a chance (guns) and even then, what good are guns if a wizard just apparates, fucks your shit up, then leaves immediately after?

Only way muggles win is if they kill most wizards, which isn't happening. Or if they just nuke the entire planet, killing themselves, and even that's debatable if it'll kill all wizards.

** No one

Let's say one wizard is equal to a thousand muggles (obviously this is just averaging since both sides have some ridiculous advantages) no matter who wins the majority of both populations will die, I'm talking billions of deaths. Muggles have the advantage in some places (United States, Africa, Middle East, Asia) due to how common guns are, their numbers, or a history of beating superior enemies. But in small, isolated, and dense countries such as Europe and many islands, they have none of those advantages, they can't afford to bomb their own land, firearms are heavily restricted, and they're used to having the advantage.

All the muggles have to do is take the squibs and the muggleborns on their side.

If simple bombs don't work, they can always use nukes. Sure a lot of muggles will die from the atomic bombs, but there are way more muggles than wizards, so there's a better chance that the muggles will survive in the end.

The wizarding society as a whole doesn't treat them horribly. I'd go so far as to say that the majority don't, seeing as, you know, there was a whole magical civil war over the issue.

Secondly, what will they reveal? Diagon Alley and the British Ministry? Bomb them and you're literally bombing your own innocent citizens. Hogwarts? Debatable if it'll even work, and even if it does, congratulations, you've just bombed a school full of children belonging to a society that can take any weapon you use and use it against you via mind control.

#+begin_quote
  If simple bombs don't work, they can always use nukes. Sure a lot of muggles will die from the atomic bombs, but there are way more muggles than wizards, so there's a better chance that the muggles will survive in the end.
#+end_quote

Yeah, precisely. For every wizard you would kill with a nuke, you would likely kill thousands of your own. Tens of thousands, perhaps. It's not as though all wizards live in a single community. Many live amongst muggles, and those who don't can't easily be found, and if they are, who's to say if nukes would even work against magical protections?

Honestly, the whole "We got nukes" argument I see all the time is terrible. We've had nukes for decades and have only used them twice in all of history, and against what we consider our enemies. I've no idea why people think we'd suddenly start dropping them on ourselves. I know you said if the muggles don't hesitate to sacrifice some of their kind, but that's a pointless qualifier. Wizards are capable of mass destruction, too.

Wasn't there kind of a Holocaust of muggleborns and most people working for the ministry....just went along with it?

From what we saw Voldemort had only a few dozens Death Eaters, you cannot start a whole genocide (that wasn't even secret) and take over the government without more widespread support. There were more people who were sympathizers or at least didn't lift a finger to stop what was happening.

Also, I am pretty sure it's canon that squibs are treated terribly since from what I remember even "progressive" wizards , like Hagrid, called Filch a "squib" as an insult.

I understand what you're saying but here we're talking theoretically. In practice, pretty much anything could happen since there are too many variables. The point is that /theoretically/ the muggles can cause way more destruction than the wizards, since I never saw the wizards having anything as powerful as a nuke.

Yeah, because the Ministry was taken over by Death Eaters, Imperiused people (the fact that they had to be Imperiused adds to my point), and the most powerful wizard alive. I think it's pretty fair that some of those opposed to it didn't openly rebel.

That still doesn't point to the society as a whole being that way. Again, there was a civil war about it, a civil war that was eventually won by the good guys.

How would they? If your government decided to start doing the same, and they had the power of mind control as well, what would you even do? If you so much as speak out, you risk the deaths (or worse) of your entire family. I'm sure plenty did try to stop what was happening, but they just failed.

Fiendfyre and whatever Grindelwald used at the end of FB2. We don't see fiendfyre ever used to destroy a city, but I'm not sure why it wouldn't.

Or grab a rock, enlarge it, enchant it to be unbreakable, and use a Banishing Charm above a city.

Or Imperius someone who has access to nukes.

Or just let the muggles use them, given that they'd be destroying themselves much more than wizards if they were to.

Not mentioning that the Cold War gave non-magical governments so much experience in spy games that Magical World will never catch up.

I believe that there's something like MI-13 that tracks and keep records on every wizard or witch. If Magical World causes too much disturbance, specially trained forces will wipe it out in hours.

Not really. A war had happened. That's bound to complicate things. The following years could have seen many more, like baby boomers. Also, the books at one point say there are 200 Slytherins. The real number is likely anywhere from 5-15k.

Because in canon, they do. Or at least, the leaders of muggle governments do. Our governments and ideas of countries and laws are all abstract. The muggle governments don't have any inherent right to control the wizarding world.

From Half-Blood Prince, we see that wizards can pretty much do whatever the hell they want in regards to muggles. The British Ministry of Magic can even arrange for the president of another country to have their mind altered with.

Wizards already have control.

I can easily imagine that there's some status quo agreement between magical and mundane government. No one want to break it because things can become very bad very quickly by both sides. But if one side breaks it, another one will have to react.

***** OP's question, I can only assume, isn't based off of fanfiction. If we're going off fanfiction, then wizards obviously win since there are literally god!Harrys out there. But he's obviously talking about what we know from canon.

And what we know from canon is that wizards already basically do whatever they want with muggle governments, so therefore we already know muggles wouldn't just easily take care of wizards "in hours" or not tolerate them.

There hasn't been a war between muggles and wizards in canon, so we can obviously discuss and debate about that. But there's no point in debating about whether or not muggle governments would tolerate wizards, as we see that they already do.
