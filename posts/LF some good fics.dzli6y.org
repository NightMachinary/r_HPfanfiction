So im looking for some fic reccomendations. Anything you think is A+ fan fiction.

Would prefer: M/M pairings Harry centric No harry/ginny No modern au/coffee shop style fics No PWP

But if something is a+ but doesnt match above stll reccomend it either.

Also really looking for time travel fics :)


** I would say, really the only A+ that I have as a favorite that I can recall, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255432/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-mysterious-potion][Mo]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12754810/1/Monstrous][nstrus]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer. You might have seen it tossed around some, so I'm not to sure if you've seen it or not.

** I quite enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10222526/chapters/22683254][Anachronism]] by Starcrossed. I consider it and a few of her other fics A+, but I'll only link that one for now! (It's a Snarry, not sure if that automatically disqualifies it)

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
