That's it. I'm curious if there's a story where Hermione takes the form of her own cat for some reason.

Someone else does it with their own pet would be great too.


** Not exactly, but she's a cat Animagus in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]] and enjoys fighting other cats, including Crookshanks, in her animagus form. She's also quite arrogant and doesn't like dogs (Sirius).

  Hermione's animagus form takes the shape of an ordinary back-yard cat. She uses her new skill to get free access to the library. But alley cats aren't the only ones sneaking around Hogwarts at night. OotP

** Oh Jesus (Merlin?)... that's sick. Why would anyone want to do it with their pet?
