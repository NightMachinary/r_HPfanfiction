  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Unfortunately it's not finished yet but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7269945/1/A-Reluctant-Hufflepuff][this]] fic is really good. Draco's sorted in Hufflepuff but the rest of the story is canon. It's really quite realistic and Draco's really in-charcter. It's very well written and one of my absolute faves.

** I'm quite honestly /just/ starting to read this, so I cant say for sure, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7733386/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Puppet-of-Time][this]] fic, HP and the puppet of time, draco time travels to the past to his younger body, blah blah blah, to change the future after something went horribly wrong, looks like it's gearing up to be a ravenclaw draco and hufflepuff harry non-slash fic.

I'll keep reading and update this comment I suppose.

Edit: Yep, Draco got sorted into ravenclaw and Harry into Hufflepuff.

Also it seems something changed somehow and Hermione is a secret slythern in Gryfindor.

This fic is proving to be interesting.

** If you can find it, then If You've A Ready Mind by Maya is excellent. Funny, well written and solid characters. Draco is quite OOC, but he usually is if he is a main character, and his OOC-ness is at least consistent and appealing. Harry/Draco. But it was taken down years ago, and pretty much just exists in an unwieldy pdf nowadays. The author isn't a massive fan of distribution of it, so I won't post a link.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
