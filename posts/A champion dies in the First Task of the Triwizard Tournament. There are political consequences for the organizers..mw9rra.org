The Tournament was restarted to promote International magical cooperation and friendship; a tournament which had formerly been cancelled centuries ago due to the /high death toll./

There were supposed to be precautions in place to ensure that "/this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger./"

Then they put in nesting mother dragons in the First Task.

/A champion dies./

What was supposed to bring countries together becomes just another bloodsport.

--------------

I would /prefer/ the champion to not be the illegally entered underage one, but I'll be fine either way. I do want consequences for the organizers though. That would be good.

A champion should die, and in the First Task itself. Not badly injured, not coma, but /death/. And only a champion, not "dragon slaughters half the spectators."

I know that linkffn(No Longer Alone by VonPelt) does this at least in part, but I'd like more.


** I really like this. Especially as, depending on who is the one that dies, there are all kinds of political snafus that will come about. Creature rights, angry Bulgarians, and then Cedric dying earlier would be like gasoline on the fire that was started with the heir of Slytherin stuff. what fun!

*** You say that, but in the final task in canon the two foreign contestants are sabotaged by unforgivable curses, Cedric is killed, the winner is kidnapped and suffering from the cruciatus curse and the only suspect is summarily executed before law enforcement have a chance to interview him. While the information blackout on Harry and his general ignorance of the wider magical world mean that we don't know anything about the immediate aftermath, long term none of this is never mentioned again.

**** It would be interesting if there was a political scuffle between the UK, Bulgaria, and France in the background of a story due to what happened in the maze. Krum tortures Fleur where no one can see them and his defence is that he was controlled by the notoriously hard to prove Imperius. And it's not like the British MoM is going to risk looking like idiots and giving Dumbledore evidence by coming out and saying "yeah it was all organised by a criminal we thought was dead, but don't worry we executed him before he could give any kind of official statement".

As for Barty Jr.; well Fudge wasn't really hiding much. He was quite clear about his thoughts on the matter: that was an escaped convict and he was Kissed. He didn't care about anything else because he didn't want to consider Voldemort coming back. Jr being alive was Sr's fault. Sr was conveniently dead. That wrapped that case up nicely

If you're talking about that time when “Moody” put all those kids under the Imperius as a practical demonstration... from what I understand “Moody” got permission from Dumbledore who probably followed protocol and got the right approvals in order to cover his arse if nothing else

********* True

But then again, this was in the point of view of a teenaged boy. I doubt he'd be privy to the board of governors' thoughts or the parents' thoughts of the things that happened in Hogwarts and Dumbledore's hand in things or the results of Dumbledore's decisions or even events they felt the headmaster was responsible for (even if he truly wasn't)

“Moody's” year as teacher could actually have been a factor in allowing Fudge to take so much control... the board of governors might have been swayed into allowing Umbridge in and getting all that authority because of what happened in fourth year

After all, it certainly couldn't have been the first time the ministry has tried a stunt like this to get control of Hogwarts

*** Harry sank down into the soft, leather armchair. It was clearly charmed for comfort, and just as clearly made for adults much larger than him. ‘Nice,' he mumbled, figuring he should say something.

The man sitting in the chair opposite him nodded. ‘You like it? I had it specially made. Its magic helps my patients to relax.'

Harry shrugged. He'd barely said a word in weeks.

The man leaned forward slightly. ‘Do you know why you're here?'

Harry shrugged again. That had become almost his entire way of communicating.

‘Your reprobate of a godfather is worried about you. He asked me to help.'

Harry felt his lips twitch at the apt description of Sirius.

‘My name is Healer Tonks, but you can call me Ted. We're related by marriage, you know.'

Harry frowned and looked up at him.

Ted smiled gently. ‘My wife is Sirius' cousin. Her Great-aunt Dorea was your Grandmother.'

‘Really?' Harry said.

Ted nodded. ‘I'm muggleborn, of course. So I don't have any attachment to idiotic wizarding traditions.' He smiled again. ‘Like the Tri-Wizard Tournament.'

Harry's breath caught in his throat. ‘I don't want to talk about it,' he ground out.

‘I understand. But it is bothering you.'

Harry felt a spike of anger, but the chair was very comfortable, and it didn't last long. ‘Wouldn't it bother you?'

‘I dare say so. So many deaths of people close to you would bother anyone.'

Harry narrowed his eyes. ‘It's not like I was close to Krum!' he spat.

Ted nodded, his movements slow and even. ‘You weren't friends with him?'

Harry shook his head. ‘I hardly knew him. I don't think I even talked to him. Not really. We each took our dragon figurines out of the bag and the Task started. Krum was third, he left me all alone in the tent, and never came back.'

‘The dragon.'

Harry swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat. ‘Yeah. I didn't see it, but I heard it. And later I heard all about it. Over and over again. For months. He cursed the dragon's eyes, it went mental, and smashed his head in with its tail.'

Ted looked sympathetic. ‘When did you first learn what happened to him?'

Harry shrugged. ‘Dunno. I heard the screams from the tent. Then lots of people were shouting. Then nothing. For hours. No one came in or anything. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't even look out; the tent flap was charmed shut to stop us from looking.'

‘And then you had to face a dragon.'

‘Yeah. At least Mo... at least Cr... at least I got some advice that helped me. It helped that the stands were mostly empty by then.'

‘Did anyone try to talk to you after the Task?'

‘Hermione. Ron.'

Ted raised an eyebrow. ‘Any teachers? Any adults?'

Harry shook his head.

Ted reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose. ‘I see. Were you friends with either of the other Champions?'

Harry shrugged. ‘Not really. I talked to Cedric a couple of times. But Fleur...'

‘Yes?'

With a snort, Harry said, ‘She called me a leetle boy.'

Ted smiled his gentle smile. ‘A tremendous insult to a teenager.'

Harry barked a short, abrupt, bitter laugh. ‘Yeah. I thought she was a stuck-up cow. But... I saw her. In the lake. Her blood just... hovering in the water.'

Ted stayed silent, letting Harry speak without interruption.

‘The Grindylows; they were... eating her. Two were fighting over... over her...' Harry suddenly started gagging.

With an almost imperceptible flick of his wand, Ted conjured a small bucket in front of Harry. The boy grabbed it and retched.

After several noisy, pungent moments, Harry got his stomach under control. ‘Sorry ‘bout that,' he mumbled, wretchedly.

‘You've nothing to be sorry about, Harry.'

Harry nodded, finding himself believing Ted. ‘Thanks.'

Ted vanished the bucket and contents. ‘Any time. As I understand it, you had to fight them off too.'

Harry was silent for a while. ‘First.'

‘Come again?'

‘I fought them off first. With a Revulsion Jinx. It made them mad. Then they left. They went after Fleur.'

‘I see. Harry, what happened, it was not your fault.'

‘Then whose was it?' Harry demanded, raising his voice for the first time in weeks.

Ted leaned forward into the anger and self-loathing. ‘Not everything bad that happens is someone's fault,' he stated flatly. ‘Sometimes, bad things just happen to good people.' ‘I made them mad,' Harry said, his voice breaking.

Ted shook his head. ‘They were already mad, Harry. The Tournament is dangerous for the participants. It was no accident the idiots in charge chose that spot to start. They wanted you to encounter enraged Grindylows.'

Harry frowned. Ted's assessment of the organisers' intellect matched Harry's own, which made him at least consider the claim that the encounter was planned. ‘But her sister blamed me.'

Ted sighed softly. ‘Few people consider eight year olds capable of forming reliable conclusions at the best of times. Especially in emotional times. It's so easy to blame someone for a tragic misfortune.'

‘What about Cedric? That wasn't misfortune. That was my fault.'

‘Why?'

Harry laughed darkly. ‘Because I told him to take the trophy. I didn't deserve it.'

‘So why is what happened your fault?'

‘What? If I hadn't told him to take the trophy, he wouldn't have died!'

‘But you just said you didn't deserve it. So Cedric deserved to take it. Anything that happened was out of your hands.'

Harry looked confused. ‘What? He took the trophy because I told him to! He vanished, and then came back dead!'

‘Yes, but that only matters if you deserved to win. If you had deserved to win, you would have taken the portkey. But you didn't.'

‘But,' Harry said, his voice thick.

Ted slowly eased himself out of his chair and knelt in front of Harry. He placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. ‘It's not your fault.'

Harry shook his head. ‘It is,' he forced out.

‘It's not your fault.'

Harry couldn't say anything.

‘It's not your fault.'

Harry's mouth opened and closed silently.

‘It's not your fault.'

Tears welled in Harry's eyes. ‘Stop it,' he mouthed.

‘It's not your fault.'

Like a dam breaking, a wail burst from Harry's throat. He threw his arms around Ted's neck and cried. For long minutes, he trembled and shook, purging himself of the emotion he'd bottled up for months.

‘They cancelled it for a reason,' Ted whispered.

** They told us everything had been handled; they told us there were precautions.

Our first warning should have been when they demanded nesting mothers. It's well established that no dragon is ever more dangerous than a nesting dragon.

Our second warning should have been when they demanded the Horntail on such short notice.

The contract, the preparations had only been made with three dragons in mind. And we chose the three with care.

Every dragon is dangerous, of course; but the three species chosen were chosen because they are the tamer species. More controllable, more reasonable. Not safe by any means, not safe at all, but more like a raging wildfire than Fiendfyre.

The Hungarian Horntail, on the other hand, is /mean/. I won't say /cruel/, because most animals can't be /cruel/ but the Horntail is a nasty piece of work.

Only seasoned Handlers deal with the Horntails and only in teams of dozens and still we lose Handlers every year to them.

We had a dozen Handlers for four dragons, four nesting mothers.

They told us it was safe. We were stupid to believe them.

The arena, gods above the arena, should have made us call it off. Never put an animal in a pit with so much noise and movement around them. Never corner an animal.

Diggory went first, facing the Short-snout. On a good day, with her usual Handlers, the Snort-snout can be almost friendly.

Kid was smart, trying a distraction. Shame about the burns. But everyone got out of that alive and he got his stupid egg.

The French bird, she got lucky, hopefully. Her Veela blood might have saved her life when the Green lit her like a match. The Healers are cautiously optimistic about her chances to survive this. Trying to charm a dragon to sleep? A nesting mother in a strange place with her clutch? Suicidal.

Everyone knows it takes teams of wizards to bring down a dragon by magic. And some schoolgirl thought she could do it herself?

Krum...Krum, I won't say he deserved what he got, nobody should go like he did, but Fireballs are severely endangered. We lost nearly an entire clutch to his stupidity. I was never one to follow Quidditch religiously, would catch a game now and then with my mates, but Krum was supposed to be a brilliant Seeker, the best of the best.

I guess nobody ever told him not to be on the ground when a blinded, hurting several ton beast is flailing around.

The coffin will be horribly light. His team is already looking for a replacement Seeker and I hear the Bulgarian Ministry, or whoever he belonged to is going to bring charges against everyone involved to the ICW.

Potter. Potter was maybe the smartest of them all. The unlucky bastard drew the Horntail.

People are calling him a coward, you know; people are saying he should have been able to save Krum. Bah! He's fourteen and he did the smart thing. He refused to meet the Horntail. Said he didn't care about whatever punishment the Goblet would give him. He'd rather be alive and not looking like Mad-Eye, thanks ever so.

No amount of cajoling, of bribery or threats could get him into the arena. He didn't finish the Task and he's the only Champion still in mint condition.

He still has his magic, so I don't know what that says.

Champions? Ha!

Those poor kids were sacrifices.

** A good hook for Cedric being the one who dies, is the canon setup that he is the only one whose teachers /didn't/ tell. Maybe Harry is a little less forgiving that Cedric is okay with all his housemates (and even Sprout!) calling Harry a cheat, and doesn't share the info. Or maybe Harry is still a bit naive and assumes---since he knows he, Fleur, and Victor have been told---that Cedric was also told (and, for once in his school career, doesn't think it's his responsibility to make sure).

It's not outside the realm of possibility that Amos would tell Cedric.

I feel that it is plausible that it was the most interesting thing that Amos' department had worked on for years. I feel that it would have been one of the first things mentioned if at any point over the summer he talked about his day at work over dinner. If only as 'its been so busy with half the guys pulled away to work on the tournament'.

Also while the teachers aren't meant to help, is there any rule against parents? Even if there was would you expect a father to let his son go up against an nesting dragon unprepared?

Easy enough with the setup we already have. Since Cedric DIDN'T know it was dragons ahead of time, he kind of freezes up when Fleur pulls the first one out of the bag, and doesn't step forward to take one before Harry. Cedric thus is the last to pull a dragon out, getting the last slot and the most dangerous dragon. He's pretty much doomed at this point.

No, he didn't; not in the books, at least. (I never saw the movie.) In the books, he spent an indeterminate amount of time standing at the entrance to the enclosure, waiting for his Firebolt to come to him. Then, he mounted it and flew off.

** I was playing with the idea that all three Champions before Harry are killed - in front of the audience, watching in horror. But the magic of the Goblet somehow makes it so that no one is able to interfere with the Tournament, so they are forced to go on. Maybe the Goblet feeds on the magic of Champions who are killed? And usually it's only strong enough to nudge certain events so that Champions are more likely to be killed, but the introduction of a fourth Champion, and one with a whole other soul - and that of a Dark Lord - in him, means the Goblet is super-charged for this particular Tournament. So it is able to kill three whole Champions.

And then Harry, kept isolated in the tent, knowing nothing, comes out to an audience that is silent and shell-shocked, but assumes it's just because everyone hates him. And then he outflies the dragon like in the book, is the sole surviving Champion. Actually what if he actually slays the dragon? He kills a basilisk at twelve, maybe this time he's flying, the dragon comes close, and the Sword of Gryffindor pops in front of him just when he needs it most?

Either way, he's now sole Champion, and still bound to compete in the tasks pre-determined by the planning committee while the Goblet waits, hungrily.

As an aside, I was kind of annoyed that Harry actually being a Triwizard Champion, which he did win fairly if you ask me, never came up. So much for eternal glory. But you know, even being an Eagle Scout, which seems way less prestigious than Triwizard Champion, seems to come with more benefits.

*** I've never liked the notion that it was the Goblet that was forcing Harry into the Tournament. It wasn't and it couldn't have been; if an object existed that could force someone into a magical contract against their will, it would've been used as a weapon against Dark wizards like Voldemort.

The Goblet is a convienient scapegoat for authors who don't want to face the fact that it was the Ministry, with Dumbledore's tacit support, that was forcing an orphan into a bloodsport against his will coz he had no adult who was ready to speak for his rights.

I like this. /I like this a lot./ Harry, the unwilling, underage but only surviving champion. Not the /killing the dragon/ part but surviving and completing the task part. And then, the Ministry and the three schools, having egg on their faces, cancel the rest of the Tournament and declare Harry as the winner. They also insinuate that it was fishy that an underage wizard entered and won while the other three died, and while openly not saying it, blame Harry for the deaths.

***** Absolute in what terms? Legal or magical? They may call it a binding magical contract, but they also call their government the "Ministry of Magic." It doesn't mean that the Ministry governs magic itself. Similarly, it's never stated whether the contract is binding as in /magic/ itself or *by law enforced by the Ministry. * It makes far more sense for it to be the latter.

The consequences of breaking the contract are never stated in the book or movie and that is something that is never discussed with Harry; which is something that would've happened if any adult had spoken /to/ him rather than /at/ him.

Also, Barty Crouch is under the Imperius curse at that point.

****** nobody said it enforces the contract, but it's clearly made through it

from the book itself  "We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. "

  "Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front," said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.

We can claim Barty is under the imperius at this point, it's probable but not stated in the books so there's no reason to believe he isWe can also claim he is lying, but why?

and then this  "Empty threat, Karkaroff," growled a voice from near the door. "You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?"

Clear as day, that Magic is enforcing the contract, meaning the most likely suspect, and therefore the only logical thing is it being the Goblet's choice of Champion enforcing said champions to compete, not the Goblet enforcing it, The Magic itself around it

also, the Ministry of Defence doesn't govern Defence itself, but the application of it for the country said Ministry is in.

No, it's in no way "clear as day." Contracts are legal and enforced by the Ministry, not some nebulous concept of magic around the Goblet. *The Goblet merely acts as the impartial judge, responsible for choosing a champion.* It's the Ministry's responsibility to ensure that rules are followed.

Given the fact that it's simply not clarified in the books very well and we've gone on a tangent not related to the original post, I'm going to stop here as it's clear that neither of us is going to convince the other.
