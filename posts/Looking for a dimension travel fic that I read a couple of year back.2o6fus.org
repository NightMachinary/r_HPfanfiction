A year or so ago I remember reading a fic where not only does Harry travel back in time, but across dimensions as well. I can't remember what it's called but I do remember the following details about it:

In this particular story, he takes over the body of his younger self that had been in a coma since Voldemort tried to kill him as a toddler. His parents are alive. He has a twin sister who's close friends with Neville, who becomes jealous of her attention on Harry when he awakens. In one scene the twin remarks, to one of the Patel sisters on how she now understand their twin bond.

That's all I remember from the story. It was on FFnet. Any ideas what it could be?


** Was Harry's Temporal/Dimensional jaunt intentional? Or was he pulled into the world by external forces?
