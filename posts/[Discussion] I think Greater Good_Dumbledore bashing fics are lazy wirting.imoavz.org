Most times these fics end up the result of Harry having insane powers or set up scenarios which make Voldemort an ineffective villain. At this point, the author realizes that the story actually needs an antagonist, leading them to use the insanely overused trope. The sad part is that he doesn't even end up being an effective antagonist either! The whole story turns into a silly power wank with Harry cruising past the canon obstacles without problems and Dumbledore's schemes being about as effective as Wiley E Coyote's.

I'll admit that this is perfectly fine in humorous stories. I enjoyed the first few of such stories too (looking at you RobSt), but I'm sick of this one trope more than any other.

I swear I'm going to lose it the next time I read Dumbledore say "For the Greater Good". /rant


** I mean, yes and no. Often those fics include lazy or unpracticed writing, but they aren't intrinsically bad. An Actual Palpatine-level Manipulator Dumbledore, who can take down half the nations of the ICW with a handful of words in the right ear, could be an incredibly interesting villain if done correctly. The kind of exquisite villain who you actually think might have a point, if it weren't for the methods they use. Likely have him motivated more strongly by Ariana and Gellert - after all, they don't even know who killed her. All that hatred between Muggles and Magicals breeds Chaos, and that leads to confusion and violence. So, in steps Albus Dumbledore, determined to tame the world and bring Order to it all.

Basically a mix between Jygallag and Handsome Jack in purpose, with extreme Palpatine-tendencies in methodology. Maybe a dash of Ozymandias from Watchmen.

So, yeah. Greater Good Dumbledore isn't necessarily bad, it's just all the fics written by those less practiced seem to have chased all the old-hand writers of the fandom away from giving it a try. :D

*** I would read that. Dumbledore has always been one of my favorite characters. I fully believe he won the war, pretty much from his office. You gotta treat the ol' dude with respect. He's like the ultimate wizard: powerful, eccentric, wise, secretive, old, always calm and composed, yet he can instill terror into anything he wants. Every time we see him do magic, it's friggin amazing and seems effortless on his part. He's the guy everybody runs to when they have a problem. Him being portrayed as ineffective and meddling and useless is just totally out of character. Voldemort may have called him weak and a fool, but that was never meant in regards to his skill and talent as a wizard, only towards his methodology and ideals, which Voldemort despises. When he fights Dumbledore, he gets desperate before he flees...because Dumbledore is just to badass to beat. Voldemort is screaming and hurling insults and Dumbledore is calmly talking to him like he's a schoolboy that just kicked a cat. Sure he has his shortcomings, but to the point he's a daft old spiteful man that just wants to steal Harry's fortune?

**** Yeah, Spite is definitely not Dumbledore's thing. And I think that's what makes him far more interesting as a villain. I love a good Knight Templar villain who genuinely cares and (fanatically) wants to do what they think is good. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? :)

He's definitely daft and old though. No doubts there, mr Nitwit Blubber Oddment Tweak. :D

*** I find that the problem is that this often redirects much of the fight to the political/economic arena, which wouldn't be much of a problem if the stories weren't trying to go on just too many directions with a teen as protagonist. Let's count: we first have the boarding-school life plot, which ties (but doesn't fully covers) the changing worlds plot (which treats the adaptation to the magical world), next we have the super/genius/Indy!Harry plot dealing with his success on the academic field and him growing up in power, then we have the Voldemort plot dealing with his interactions with the Said villain in particular (eg. fighting, ideology discussion, Horcruxes, emotional struggle, mind-link...), after that there is often the war plot for how the war is affecting the population in general, his close friends/family and him in particular plus how he will take part in it (going on a killing-spree, go pacifist...), to say nothing about the holidays plot dealing with who and how he is going to spend his summers, frequently we also find a love-life plot and a fame plot.

Now, dealing with all of those diverging plot-lines is hard and I can honestly say that I wholeheartedly respect JKR for managing to do it so well and in such a organic way -even if I would have enjoyed more world-building- but that list has an advantage, they mostly interceded in the power point with the social interaction aspect being only a reasonable amount higher than that of a regular human being. This allows authors to deal with many of the plots simultaneously since the MC only has to keep themselves reasonably social while growing stronger, but when you inject politics in the mix this no long holds as politics by definition depends heavily of social and formal interactions with characters that teens would frankly have almost nothing in common with plus a heavy dose of legalities that (being a made up system) would have to be build upon on the spot. Even if we consider time-turners there is still a limit of how much we can pile on a teen character during a given time-period while keeping it realistic and with the addition of a plot that so greatly differs from the rote the other plots take it gets much harder to stuff it all together without making an unbearably perfect character that will get boring for /everyone/ extremely fast or a drowning character that can't get anything done at all because there are always thousands upon thousands of other questions that need their immediate undivided attention.

**** The solution to that is simple - work it slowly and give him a way in, while giving the non-politics plotlines enough time to grow, die, or evolve.

If I were writing this, I'd have Harry take some leadership position in the student body at the school first, let him build up his Political Skills to a workable degree and really learn how to interact with and direct people and get respect from the Young People of the Magical World. Maybe have him pull the DA together into an actual organisation to solve some problem at Hogwarts (unite the houses, keep an eye on Malfoy, stop bullying, get Snappy fired, improve teaching, etc) and have that come to Skeeter's attention. Since he's already famous, she's got some impetus to go ask him about it. He holds his own against her - not fully enough to destroy her or anything, just a little bit, just enough to actively amuse her - and thus he gets his first link outside of Hogwarts. Not a strong link, but a link nevertheless.

So then, as he's a respected and admired unofficial leader at Hogwarts, some student comes to him and tells him that they know something outside of Hogwarts is happening and they don't know what to do (could be Percy asking for help on whether to report Crouch, for example) so he helps stop whatever was happening and trades the information to Skeeter for a complimentary article. Wizengamot calls him in as a witness, he politics his way through it, then has some more influence there. Again, not a lot, but some.

Maybe that person who passed him information gets penalised for it somehow and Harry successfully defends them, building up respect and influence just a bit more. Anything after that should just bring Harry into contact with individual members, I'd say. Someone mentions their parents are struggling to find something, Harry introduces their children to children of the people who have that thing, then they introduce their parents and are sure to mention how helpful that Harry Potter was. That kind of thing. Individual people do eventually add up. :)

In terms of actual active political authority, I'd have him grow the DA into some kind of lobbyist group first. Have him make deals and suggestions to the Wizengamot types, propose ideas to them from his group, etc. Maybe he calls in some favours, but for the most part he just asks for help - acts convincing enough and honest enough that people start to really think he'd be a useful friend to have. Maybe he makes friends with or gets a mentor role from one of the older members of the Wizengamot, who bequeaths his seat to Harry when he mysteriously dies. Thus, he gets into power. Harry is, of course, in well over his head the whole time, but with determination and the help of his friends (and an 'I believe in you, now go change the world' letter from his mentor), he manages to keep treading water. And technically he doesn't actually have to have stuff in common with the politicians, he just has to make them think he does. A harder-worked Harry at the Dursleys could bullshit knowing all about the delights of a well-maintained rose garden, for example, or share cooking secrets with the Tea Party Old Ladies to give to their elves. Politicians research and prepare, and Harry would have links to all of their children (through the Now-Political DA) to get that information.

If you do it slowly and right, it'd be quite easy to have the other stories grow with him, especially during the early days times when Harry is still building up influence with individual political members. The boarding school aspect of the Stranger in a Strange Land plot would decrease as Harry entered the political sphere more (still be present, but instead of whole classes taking up chapters, it'd probably just be a sentence or two here and there unless more was relevant/needed), while the Greater Magical World aspects would grow. Harry's romance prospects would probably end up coming with him in his political aspirations - either a stereotypical marriage-for-power type relationship or a partner who'd actually grow alongside him into the political role (possibly also a partner-waiting-at-home type, but that kind of relationship is slightly narratively dull to me so I probably wouldn't write it). Technically you wouldn't have to have the Super Genius Indy Harry plot, but that could quite easily be twisted as he focuses more on his political manoeuvres than his coursework as the story progresses. Genius needs conflict and engagement, after all, and as he tired of his scholastic pursuits and grew more interested and challenged by politics, it'd be easy to move his attention from one to the other). Not sure how Voldemort would work in this story - would he take polyjuice and join the political sphere also, would he take the opportunity to kidnap Harry while he's away from Hogwarts, would he just go about his Evil-Villain business while Harry is focused on politicking, etc. I'd have to put more work into this to work out what would fit best. Holidays would be quite easy to integrate into the 'making friends' side of politics, and probably a good 'Dumbledore is an opponent-antagonist, but not a villain-protagonist' subplot to play around with and introduce the idea of Dumbledore not always being on Harry's side. He obviously wants Harry to go back to the Dursleys, which Harry wouldn't want to do. So, you'd have a younger Harry lose and end up back there, then have him slowly work out and test new ideas to get out of there until something works and he can go make friends and politic around.

And well, there's technically no limit on how much you can pile on a teenager, just how much they can handle. If you actively had Harry freaking out about how much work there was and how stressed he was and how he couldn't do any of it, that'd still be realistic. Could have a big confrontation between him and Ron and Hermione, really convince him to bring more people in and ask for help. Could have him start to delegate some stuff to other members of the DA - gets them trusting and liking him a bit more and takes some of the weight off his shoulders. Every politician has a team of people behind them to help out, after all. Like I said somewhere above this, it's not a choice between drowning and walking on water - treading water is a perfectly normal state of affairs for politics.

Sure, there's a lot of problems with the idea of Political Harry vs Dumbledore, but if you sit and think about them you can always find solutions that fit the internal logic of the story. Human Beings are a delightfully creative bunch. :)

The main fun thing about that path, it lets Dumbledore stay in the shadows unrevealed to Harry for a lot longer. He's a manipulator with decades on Harry, so he's not going to be revealed easily, this way just lets you keep that without actually having Dumbledore have to actively do anything in the narrative to remain so. I wouldn't even reveal Dumbledore as a villain until mid to late Act II, myself. An occasional opponent-antagonist, sure, with them debating things and disagreeing in the political sphere, but not an actual villain-antagonist until late. Harry would just see and deal with the outcomes of Dumbledore's actions - seeing the chessboard, but not the player, so to speak.

Also, an additional bonus - you don't even have to use the Ancient Houses system to get Harry into political power. Just the things that make Harry Harry in canon - relentless determination, moralising fortitude, and other people caring about him.

***** That actually sounds petty awesome, the balancing would be tricky and such a story would probably be massive to be able to fit so much without rushing or ignoring important things, and with the time-line Harry would probably be done with Hogwarts (or at least be at sixth/seventh year) before either Voldemort or Dumbledore can have a bigger role through the war as before that Harry's focus on politics would likely make it so he didn't have the Know-how to fight them in anything close to equal ground (not actually something bad, such a brake from the canon plot would be good basis for a more original story -plus possibly having Voldemort actually die in 81 and trashing the war plot entirely- and having an adult protagonist that was well-worked through teenage-hood and built upon gives much more to work about than a teen) overall I would definitely read something like this.

****** Indeed to all of that. Plus, the focus on people over fighting fits the themes of canon a lot better - 'friendship is magic' and all that. :)

Balancing definitely wouldn't be the easiest thing, but I've pulled off more complex pacing in D&D games before - it's just patience and remembering that there's conflict other than one-vs-one strength-of-whatever competition. Remember the goals of the characters and what they're willing to do to get there and conflict (and victory) can come from so many places.

Think about people like the Joker. His goal isn't to kill Batman (most of the time, I don't think? Superheroes ain't really my thing), his goal is just to demonstrate that the world is only one bad day from being like him. So, Batman could kill him, but so long as he went a little mad while doing it, the Joker would get what he wanted.

So, you could have Harry get lucky and manipulate and out-move Dumbledore to Albus' end, thus technically winning, but Dumbledore dies with a smile because he knows that Harry will bring the Order to the world that he couldn't (the 'beat me at my own game... I'm so proud' trope). Hell, you could even... have Harry just plain /lose/ (*shocked gasp*). The sky really is the limit. :)

Isn't this like, tautological?

The whole point of calling something "bashing" is to accept it as a lazy or at least biased characterization. Is it really still bashing if you present Albus as a properly written antagonist with rational (if selfish or "evil") motivations and behaviour who acts in a way consistent with his image as a wise and powerful player? To me that's just a variation from the standard Albus, kinda like ravenclaw or slytherin Harry is a variation from canon Harry.

** I never quite understood why this trope gets pushed. Dumbledore said those words when he was a frustrated teenager and thought that some sacrifices were okay for the benefit of the many... until he had to sacrifice his own sister and, to a certain extent, his brother (because Aberforth never really forgave him).

I wouldn't really mind the trope though if the Manipulative!Dumbledore had a concrete plan or a clear outcome (say elimination of all dark arts or blood related bias). But it's always just Dumbledore being manipulative for the sake of being manipulative or gaining power. Which is quite ooc considering that he himself admits he doesn't trust himself with power.

** I think what people dont realise is that Dumblebore was at the end of the day the 'Leader of Light'. And everyone expected him to pull solutions for their problems out of his ass. Him being 150-ish does not help his case. He is a tierd old man trying to do his best. Him raising Harry like a pig for slaughter is what a good/competent general would do. No matter how innocent, the lives of many overcome the life of one. We also know that Dumbledore couldn't have possibly known that Harry would survive the second killing curse. Harry was an anomaly. He did what was needed to be done not what he wanted to do.

** I agree with true bashing fics, but I also think the term "bashing" is used too frequently with Dumbledore. I don't consider it bashing when Harry views Dumbledore as an enemy or when Dumbledore is manipulative or very utilitarian.
