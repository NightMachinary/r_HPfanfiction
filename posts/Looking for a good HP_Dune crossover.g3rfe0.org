Something along the lines of Harry chasing Sirius in Veil, and coming out with Spice, experience, etc...I dunno. I just keep picturing Snape wetting himself at such a potent, new ingredient, and leaving Voldie while getting a new mark from Harry...I'd write it myself, but for a little thing called talentüòÅ.


** Dune is singularly hard to cross well. The powers in it are largely intellectual and don't translate well to other verses. There might be some, but I've never heard of any being good. Perhaps the new movie will inspire new attempts.

*** You are, of course, 110% correct. That is why I was looking at HP bringing a little Dune back with him in the way of Spice, Sappho juice, maybe a teeny, tiny shai-halud, etc... All the Dune goodness, but filtered through a HP filter of simplicity. As I am your biggest fan...pretty please? If anyone can do it, it's you(wink, wink, nudge, nudge).

**** Without any false humility, I just don't think I could pull it off. I love Dune, but I don't think I could ever convincingly pull off a fanfic with it.

** I suppose you could have the brains from the DoM escape and become Cymeks intent on wiping out wizards...... hmmmmm
