:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm not even sure it was FanFic or what. I found this one while we were waiting for release of fifth book.

I don't remember much, but I remember Harry and comp. became animagi. McGonagall thought them. Maybe there was something with pyramids? In that story Order of the Phoenix was some group that they joined and I think they got something from joining. It is really hazy.

I read this a long time ago (must have been 17 years ago... wow).


** Was it a Harry/Cho story by any chance?

#+begin_quote
  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.
