** Of course there is logic behind the argument. Since there is nothing written to indicate otherwise, the first wizard could be anything and therefore any lore as to where and when magic was first seen in humans is valid and logical (or illogical as we are talking about magic).

Maybe they did start out as muggleborns. Maybe some divine power bestowed it upon his chosen people. Maybe muggles are the one who came from those who have lost magic. Maybe wizards are really just the descendants of the last surviving Marsians after their planet got robbed of water and air.

It really doesn't matter. Arguing about it is futile as there is nothing but guesswork about it. Being mad about it goes even a level higher and is, truly, the only utterly stupid thing here.

*** Gotta catch 'em all wizard men go!!!

In all seriousness though are there any fics that go into detail about the origins of Magical kind?

**** Linkffn(revenge of the Wizards) by darth marrs has an origin of wizards in the story. If you enjoy Star Wars crossovers I would recommend this one.

**** There are some that give ... speculations, yes.

I presume there to be some that go into detail about the origin of the wizardkind, but I have not stumbled across any as of yet.

** That is a good point. No one knows where wizard came from. Well I personally believe that the first magic users are 'muggle-born'. On the other hand, muggles might be squibs from an all magic user race.

** Personally I see muggles and wizards as two evolutionary branches or something that are capable of breeding with each other; heck, for all we know it might be that it's the introduction of the muggle blood to the wizarding bodies sometime in the past so distant that nobody remembers it is what caused the squibs to become a thing.

That said, we really do not know one way or another, and I don't mind any version anyone chooses to see as what happened in their stories.

*** I once saw a fic a long time ago that speculated that wizards where descended from neanderthals and that the reason why the muggles don't know what happened to them is because of the statute of secrecy.

** There is no logic in saying either way as its fucking fiction! Why people get so upset about somebody else's headcanon or their fic's universe's history just boggles my mind. It doesn't have to make sense! Despite [[/u/taure]] 's best efforts, this is [[/r/hpfanfiction]] not /r/hpExtremelyPedanticMagicalHistoryClass Y'all need to get over yourselves and learn to stop worrying and love the +cruciatus+ fics.

** in my headcannon a bunch of wizards got together when they decided magic is the route of all evil and performed a mass ritual to kill off their magic and formed a religion at the same time. way in the past. that's why they get confused or ignore blatantly magical stuff. there's spell holding the magic in is being passed down.
