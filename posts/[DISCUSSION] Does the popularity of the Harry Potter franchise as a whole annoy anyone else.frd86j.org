** I've got to be honest mate, no. That seems like a childish and gate keeping attitude to me. All the reasons you've listed are why it's popular and more than that, it's accessible too. You can dip into it as much or as little as you like and find enjoyment, whereas with other fandoms feel intimidating for their depth and technicalities sometimes.

Other people's enjoyment or dislike of Harry Potter doesn't affect my own thoughts and feelings towards it. I mostly only read and write canon compliant fanfic, if I started getting resentful of people who wrote AU or shipped pairings i don't like, i don't think I would get any enjoyment out of the fandom as a whole, and if I got embarrassed or annoyed at people who are fans but only of the movies, I would probably never be able to talk about Harry Potter in real life and that seems kind of sad.
