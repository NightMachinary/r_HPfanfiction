**** Hmm. I guess my feedback is that it's about the drama and writing. There really doesn't seem to be much plot, or what there is is hidden by the writing style. Maybe try to do a re-write?

Every word does not need to have an adverb/adjective. You'll want to vary that a bit. Good writing (which is very difficult!) means writing so that the reader can't see that you're a good writer and just reads through the whole thing excitedly. At the end, the reader realizes that it was an awesome story.

The other thing is that you're writing fanfiction. If the characters are canon, you don't need to explain every detail about them--readers will already know this and get bored.

Hope this helps!

**** Well, I guess my main advice would be to find a beta. You've got some grammatical, punctuation, and formatting errors (quotation marks and ellipses especially) that should be fixed. I'm pickier than most, but you are still doing your story a disservice by publishing it with less-than-perfect grammar. It tells readers "I don't care enough to proofread" and that's not a great impression to make. Even if you proofread everything to the best of your ability, stuff still slips through, so you ought to get a second person to look over everything. Your job is to put out the best product you can and the most efficient way to do that is to get a beta.

A beta could have also told you that summing up canon events is a big no-no. Depending on how it's done, it can make the author look stupid, it can make it seem as though the author thinks the audience is stupid and needs everything explained, or it can look like the author is just trying to cram in superfluous information to increase word count. In this story, it really just sounds like you're new to fanfic (which I suppose would be the case!) and haven't learned that such summary is dull and unnecessary.

One other small nitpick is that Hermione seems off. You've written the other characters quite well, in my opinion, but as a huge Hermione fan, I'm not loving what you did. Keep working on that. If you absolutely cannot grasp a character, avoid writing them.

Another thing is to choose carefully what swearwords you use. The wrong one in the wrong place can kill suspension of disbelief. When Ron said "No, shit" I was rather startled. It's a common trope that Ron swears a lot, but that right there felt forced. In my opinion, if a passage sounds like something that could have come out of the books, it's best to keep the language somewhat faithful to the books, too. I think that Harry and Ron having a somewhat-serious conversation at the Burrow would be one of those passages. And stay aware of any terms that are different from the books but refer to the same thing -- "BLT," for instance. In the books, there were no BLTs, but there were bacon sandwiches. Don't add in new terminology when there's something else you can use just as easily. You nailed this on the third and fourth chapters with phrases like "Thank Merlin" and "blimey." Make sure to keep that stuff consistent, because even though it seems minor, it is essential to keeping this in the Harry Potter universe rather than straying off into the real world (or worse, America).

I'm not a fan of your villain. How many dark lords can there possibly be in the U.K.? It might as well be Voldemort resurrected. I don't know where you were planning to go with that, but unless a dark lord is absolutely essential to the plot in every way, you really should choose a different villain. Either keep Voldemort or create an entirely new enemy, but don't use the same archetype with a new name. We've all read the Evil Dark Lord thing already in the books themselves.

I love the idea of the phoenix. I've never read anything similar to that. It's rare to come across a unique or somewhat-unique idea and I think you've got one here. That's very promising and where there's one unique idea, there's usually more to come. Hold onto the plot you've got here and either rewrite this story or start a new one with the same concept, because it would be a shame to lose that idea.

I also think that if you want to keep writing, you should try out short stories or oneshots before you try to write a novel-length saga. Stories can quickly grow much larger than you'd thought at first, so keeping it short and learning what to include and what to leave out is a good skill to learn. Novels also require more intricate plot threads to keep people interested, and that's difficult to achieve. It takes a careful balance: enough stuff going on to keep it interesting, but not so many that it gets confusing; enough time dedicated to everything to prevent confusion, but not so much that it becomes slow and plodding; lots and lots of planning ahead so that you don't end up with a plot thread that just disappears in Chapter 23; etc. You'll also be more likely to attract readers with short stories. I am reluctant to start out a novel-length fic from an author I don't recognize, so I always look for a short story to introduce me to their style. If I can't find anything, I'm unlikely to invest my time in the novel. WIPs are also less attractive to readers, so publishing something complete will help there, too. Not to mention the fact that short stories don't take as long to write, so you can get more feedback more quickly.

TL;DR: Promising story, but you tried to do too much for your first attempt and I'm not at all surprised that you gave up. If it's something you want to do, I encourage you to keep writing. Write some short stories before trying to tackle a novel. Brush up on grammar. Find a beta. It's easy to learn the technical stuff, but hard to come up with unique ideas if they don't come naturally. Luckily you've got the unique ideas. Just refine them and I can imagine you producing some awesome work.

***** This is exactly what I was looking for! I figured it would need some work and you have given me some great directions to start with! You have also given me the stark realization of the fact that, somehow, my villain is really just Voldemort with Quirrell. I may just throw the entire story out minus the Phoenix and start brand new. The ironic thing was I had a beta at one point...She just kind of fell off the face of the earth though...Anyway, back to the drawing board! I appreciate your excellent input!

** u/Bulwersator:
#+begin_quote
  Reluctantly, he listed them in his head, as he had done so many times before. First, of course, had been his parents. Murdered by Voldemort in Godrick's Hollow, His mother had died to save him and in doing so, gave Harry greater protection than anyone might have imagined.
#+end_quote

- AFAIK "his" in the middle of sentence should not be capitalized.
- What is the point in writing things obvious to anybody reading fanfiction?
