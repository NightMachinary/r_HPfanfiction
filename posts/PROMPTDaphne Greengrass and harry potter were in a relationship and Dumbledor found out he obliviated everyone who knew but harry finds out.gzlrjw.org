** Just go find some of the more extreme Dumbledore bashing fics. Then, because Daphne Greengrass is an OC, you can use a text editor to replace the names of whatever Harry's perfect love interest in that story is with Daphne Greengrass.

*** Sure, Daphne may not have any canon lore, but she's an established fanon character. It's like Batman. Sure, you could write a story about a Batman who wears a tech suit and kills indiscriminately with guns, but then are you really writing a batman story?

**** I'm going to be honest. If batman speaks like batman, has the background of batman, isn't actually an established fanon character because I've read many fics with her with different characterizations, and people only really like her because she's a great OC, then yeah it works.
