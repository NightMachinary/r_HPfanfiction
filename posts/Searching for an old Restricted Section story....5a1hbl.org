Hi All,

I'm looking for an old story from the restrictedsection.org site which had Canon pairings but Hermione was deputy headmistress and Harry & Ginny would occasionally get together for some fun with her.

The main story has the trio finding a hidden room that contains the lost treasures of Britain and a doorway that leads to the founders time while Hoggy Hogwarts is still being constructed.

Team is then trapped in founders time and has to help build Hogwarts by memory in the hopes that when they rebuild the door it will lead back to the future...

No idea what it was called but it was completed if that helps?

Any ideas on how I can find it?

Thanks heaps!
