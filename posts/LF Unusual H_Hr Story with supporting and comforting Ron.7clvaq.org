The Titel might be confusing or incorrect, but i didnt know how to describe it in a single line. What i want to know is, if there is a Fic with H/Hr, with Ron still as a close Friend. Harry lies in some sort of Coma, because of an Heavy Injury or whatever Reason (could also be during the War or after it). Hermione gets more and more desperate about his state, while Ron comforts and supports her. On some Point it seems to much to her and she asks Ron, to sleep with her..even starts to seducing him (she knows that he has/had a Crush on her (canon-wise)). Ron refuses of course, because Harry is a to important Person and he dont want to destroy his Friend Relationship and their (or his, Harrys) Trust in him, even so for Hermione. But she continues and very reluctantly he gives in....or he stays on his Point and after a certain time, she calms down and feels ashamed about her actions and Behaviour. Ron, being the comforting Buddy, keeping her calm. In the 2. Way "nothing happened actually". Anyway the Guilt and shame would also definetly come in the Sex part.

So here it is, i would be very interested in both ways, so the best point is a Fic that contains these alternatives as separate chapters or whatever (2 Fics contain the same scenario, but each is diffrent). The impact might be heaver in the end, if Harry wakes up, if they slept with each other.
