:END:
If I remember correctly, Draco finds a box of Sirius' stuff and for some reason goes to Privet Drive. Marge is also there and they end up making him stay for a while, and he gets to watch Dursley drama. Draco and Harry think there's something weird about Sirius betraying the Potters (or something like that) so they end up working together to find out what happened(i think?). And they lie to Hermione about having to work for a project at one point.

Forgot the rest but if you have some idea, uh, help? **awkwardly moves away**
