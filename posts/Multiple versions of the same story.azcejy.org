How would you feel about this? I'm currently considering trying a ship-based story, plot-heavy and kinda dark. Since I personally don't really care about any ship over any other and believe it's all about good writing, I can't decide on the actual final pairing. I've narrowed it down to a few that could work, less common ones since I'm tired of the same old thing every time.

Which comes to my question: If I wrote and posted the story three or four times, once with each pair, would that work? As I'm envisioning it now, acts 1 and 3 would vary somewhat depending on the people involved, the setup and resolution not quite identical, while act 2 would remain roughly the same apart from character interactions.

I'd be very clear in the description that they're the same story, just pick the version with your preferred characters. I feel like it could genuinely work well, but I don't want to put in the effort if it would just come across as desperate. :-3 Would that seem cheap/lame/annoying/pathetic? Or would you be fine with it?


** If the relationships are so inconsequential to the story that changing them doesn't change the plot at all, why bother having a relationship in the first place?

*** Because the entire plot is built on the fact of the relationship existing. Without a foundation of the deepest most unbreakable love, the whole story falls apart.

It's in the early stages, I haven't fully committed to anything yet, so it's still quite flexible as to who does what. It's not inconsequential whether the relationship exists, but I can build the story with similar effort around any one of the couples. It would change minor things, but since the core of the story is predetermined, it would still be mostly the same.

**** Ok, so the relationship is /very/ important. Now consider that a relationship is not one-way; as the saying goes, it takes two to tango. Unless you essentially rewrite characters to have the same personality and thus react similarly, changing who the protagonist is in a relationship with ought to significantly affect the story.

***** Right. But the guy is the same in every case, so his section in the middle will remain roughly the same, while the interactions on either side would be different depending on who he's with.

I don't see as any of those things. YOU are the author, do what you will :) It does sound like a lot of work though, even if the differences in each version are subtle.

If people really enjoy one version of the story, I can easily see them checking out others just for kicks, especially if the different versions of Acts I and III are clearly marked.

Speaking for myself, if it were a short story or a one-shot with a few different versions, if I enjoyed the first version, I'd definitely check out the others. If it's a longer work, I'd probably only want to reread the sections that had significant differences.

** If you don't care about a pairing I'd recommend not having one at all, personally for me I'm turned off of a lot of fics because of a pairing I don't like.

*** Well, the fact of the romance is very important to the plot, otherwise it wouldn't be a problem. I do usually prefer to read and write gen, but this story really needs a love story at its core.

** There was a story which also couldn't decide on pairing so in the end there was 2 or 3 ending. One with each pairing. If I remember well it was either Astoria, Tonks or Gabrielle. Didn't really like it because of this non choice but also because of the way it was brought. Just today I read a fic which obviously will be HP/HG but there was a platonic HP/DG relationship with some kissing but no feelings as they were both waiting for someone else. And I was thinking that I wouldn't have disliked to read an alternative plot where they do fall in love together.

So in the end it depends how you do it but a fic AU from another fic could be interesting. Maybe not for the relationships themselves but what it would bring to the characters? Would it change the outcome and choices of characters based on their interaction with others and loved one? The basic of an AU in the end but that's what would be the most interesting in my opinion. Not the relationships

** You should do a fourth story line about the power of platonic love and how you don't need romance to be a complete person.
