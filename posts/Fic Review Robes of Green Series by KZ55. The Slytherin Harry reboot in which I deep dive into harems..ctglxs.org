Trigger warnings for sexual references and sexual content between minors discussed below. I won't be linking the fic directly as it goes against Rule 8 of this subreddit.

​

*Premise*

The Robes of Green series follows Harry Potter had he been sorted into Slytherin, though the story picks up in book 3 rather than from book 1. This was to avoid getting bogged down in the details of the first two books and move onto when the plot thickens. Also it's a T-Rated harem fic.

The series follows Harry from PoA through to presumably DH, but is currently incomplete. For this review, I am only covering the first two installments -- Heart of Gold and Triwizard King, which follow the timeline of PoA and GoF respectively.

​

*Plot*

From what I can tell, it's a straight up rewrite of the series had Harry been in Slytherin. It's hard to comment on the plot because there isn't really one to speak of. It's not PWP, but there isn't enough deviation from canon to really call it its own story. Many of the same events happen, even when it doesn't make sense for them to occur. We didn't see the events of PS and CoS directly, but it's reflected back on enough that we are given to understand that Hermione and Ron were still the ones involved at every step, despite Harry not being a Gryffindor or friends with Ron. Harry still loves Hagrid, has deep respect for Dumbledore, and is ideologically opposed to Slytherin pureblood values. As far as a canon rewrite goes, I don't really feel like it adds a significant perspective.

Honestly it sort of seems to be a “Harry can have it all” rewrite. Many of the deviations which do occur are done in such a way as to give Harry a better outcome than he had in canon. For example, he gets tipped off early about Peter Pettigrew, so Harry sits smug in his knowledge whilst Ron gets a rude shock that his rat isn't a rat. Pettigrew doesn't escape and gets the Dementor's Kiss on the spot, so Sirius Black is exonerated and Harry gets to spend most of the summer with him.

Other deviations include 5 triwizard champions being selected from the Goblet of Fire, Cedric being replaced with Angelina Johnson as Hogwarts champion (though she doesn't die), a condensed quidditch season taking place during Harry's fourth year, and a twist on the big bad of book 4.

​

*The Writing*

The fic is written in present tense, which is apparently a [[https://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/the-pros-and-cons-of-writing-a-novel-in-present-tense][hallmark writing style of the millennial generation]]. And present tense is fine -- it can be great -- but it's a tricky thing to make it gel with your story. It's often coupled with a first person narrative as first person conveys a greater sense of intimacy than a past tense narrative. The idea is that we're watching something unfold as it's happening, living someone's life through their eyes rather than feeling like you're being read a story about something which has already happened.

In this case, the author has chosen to go with third person limited as their storytelling perspective. Even with the decision to write in present tense, this had the capacity to be done well. Turn by Sarasgirl also employs both third person limited perspective and present tense, but it flows very naturally because it is a deeply intimate slice-of-life story with heavy emphasis on introspection.

Robes of Green by contrast has a very casual feel to it. Although I'd also categorise it as a slice-of-life fic given how little emphasis is placed on the plot, it doesn't feel intimate either. The writing is mostly focused on the actions and dialogue of the characters, with very little on Harry's internal state. And to be fair, when the fic opens Harry is 13 years old; not exactly a prime age for an introspective journey. Understandable, but it shows why present tense was not a good choice for the writing style of the story. As of the 31st of July 2019, the author has decided to rewrite the entire series in past tense due to reader feedback.

I don't want to spend too long on this section as the real meat of the story is the harem, but aside from the above, it feels like it was written by a young author. It's unnecessarily wordy, even about very mundane things like exactly how Harry spends every hour of every day on his holidays, and the dialogue is stilted and clunky. I don't know if it improved in Triwizard King or if I just got used to it, but there were issues such as: people speaking for too long without a reply, everyone using the same dialogue markers and overuse of certain words. Apparently every character including the foreigners and the narrative itself finish their sentences with ‘indeed'. In the first two books alone that word pops up over 200 times and was driving me spare.

The way nicknames and insults were written was also very basic -- ‘Mister X' or ‘Miss Y' was the standard go-to -- usually something which was kind of just factual rather than insulting, which made you go “okay but why?”

They stood out so much that I started making a list of them. Here are some extracts:

Mister Noisy Egg Boy

Wannabe confident bully

leetle green Quidditch teddy bear

Professor Empty Classroom

big Quidditch famous seeker man-boy

Madame posh silvery-blonde Beauxbatons

Judging by the short time between updates, the author is extremely prolific but falls into the usual trap of quick writers -- the review stage either isn't happening or isn't thorough enough. They badly needed to get a beta in to be their second set of eyes, and probably to read some of this dialogue out loud to themselves to weed out what doesn't sound natural.

​

*Briefly, on my problem with Harry (aside from the harem)*

Harry himself is vastly different from canon Harry -- he's cocky, flirtatious and generally better at magic, but how and why he got to be the person he is isn't really explored. He's the Slytherin with the ‘Heart of Gold', who seems to generally be influencing the younger generation of Slytherins to be less racist by telling them not to use the word ‘mudblood', but in the same breath reads up on and practices the unforgivable curses /for fun/. Everyone is fine with this, so long as he doesn't cast them on humans. He is a highly performative show-off, to the point of calling the Hungarian Horntail a bitch and declaring that he won't just get the egg; he'll knock out the dragon first -- and does. He's bizarrely liberal with his money -- I think we're supposed to see him as a generous fellow, because he randomly gives people very expensive gifts, but it feels more like it's an overcompensation to buy friendship. Oliver Wood was sad about losing the quidditch final to Slytherin, so Harry makes up for it by buying him a full set of professional keeper gear and a new Nimbus 2000 broom, as an example. He also pays considerable gold to Ludo Bagman for his tips to give him an advantage in the Triwizard tournament, so he doesn't really have any qualms about cheating or unfairness. He's totally fine with the Malfoys upgrading Slytherin's brooms, but rages when Cedric's father does the same for Hufflepuff, and doesn't seem to notice the hypocrisy. All in all, it's hard to find him a likable dude.

​

*On Harems*

Let me preface the deep dive by emphasising that I'm not here to kink-shame anyone, and I have no issue with the idea of polyamory or multi-pairings, but the execution of these themes is still subject to criticism.

There are two harem tropes I'm familiar with in popular culture. The first is the anime version where a sweet and naïve every-boy is mysteriously surrounded by a cohort of women who love him deeply and vie for his attention. He has many emotionally intimate and ‘accidentally-almost-sexual' encounters with all of them before eventually deciding which one he loves.

The other kind is the smut harem common to fanfiction, wherein for various highly contrived reasons, everyone suddenly and desperately needs to have sex with our protagonist. This one is a pretty straight-up sexual fantasy -- they [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7mzibvUeY][get down to business]], defeat some Huns and go away -- everyone's happy.

Robes of Green isn't quite either of these things, but it's closer to the anime version, especially since actual sex isn't really on the cards (mostly). There's something of a femdom kink here that has a similar feel to how anime protagonists get treated by their older harem women. With the exception of Ginny, all the girls in Harry's life dote on him, treat him like a child, scold and berate him, order him around, and for a good while there feed him, and Harry loves it. The first time the feeding thing happened I thought it might have been a one off, but sexually sub-textual food kept coming back. In one scene, Hermione and Ginny spoon-feed Harry an entire meal. For reasons. Another time, Hermione and Pansy display their influence over Harry by competing to pile food on his plate, then demanding that he eat it all. On yet another occasion, Fleur demands Harry take a plate of food from the Gryffindor table, and stands over it whilst making Harry hand feed her in front of the Gryffindors. I don't mind if you have a thing for feeding but maybe tag that stuff? It's not particularly my cup of tea even in fics about adults, it's extra squicky to read about in 14-year-olds. I'm also not sure if the author is aware that being infantilised by girls constantly is not a sign that you're sexually attractive to them.

There are 4 main love interests in the harem -- Pansy, Hermione, Ginny and Fleur. Satellite love interests include the entire female population of Slytherin and Tonks as of the end of Triwizard King. And I don't wholesale have an issue with the harem itself? But there are definitely some pretty significant problems with it that are hard to go past.

There are things which could have been written to not be awful, but sort of end up that way. Like, Harry's friendship group is made up of Pansy (his BFF), and the Slytherin girls of his year. There's no inherent issue with a guy having better friendships with girls than with boys, but Harry has zero male friendships -- not even peripheral ones. The boys of his year hate him (because they're [[https://images.app.goo.gl/6xNqJf2amUFm1Lzv5][/jus jelus/]]), and he seems to see all of them as sexual rivals or below his notice -- because he's “rich and better” than them (direct quote). What's more, he /exclusively/ associates with girls he's attracted to. He doesn't call the Slytherin girls he spends time with his friends -- he calls them his girls. He is constantly exchanging sexual banter with them all and getting very touchy -- arm caresses, hand holding, spontaneous massaging, etc. No kissing or otherwise overtly sexual activity, but enough to demonstrate that he has no platonic friendships -- just sexual opportunities waiting to be cultivated. The author would like us to consider Harry a nice guy and a good friend (if a bit of a flirt), but what they're actually painting is more of a “[[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Guy][nice guy]]”, only this one gets all the girls he wants.

Some of the individual relationships are in and of themselves fine -- Harry and Pansy for example match each other pretty well for sexual banter and interest, and Pansy makes no secret of her attraction to Harry and her expectation that he will “sow his wild oats” before eventually settling down with her. Fleur pretty well commandeers Harry's time and attention for most of Triwizard King, and although they never talk about whether or not they're actually dating, are boyfriend and girlfriend in practice. Fleur is Harry's first sexual partner, and it seems like a pretty happy relationship.

​

*How to be a creeper*

The problems really come up when we look at Ginny and Hermione.

Harry is downright creepy with Ginny. In his opening scene with her in September of 93, he decides to gift her his old Nimbus 2000 since thanks to Lucius Malfoy he now uses a 2001 model along with the rest of the Slytherin team. Seems like a nice thing to do, except that whilst he's giving it to her he's making some pretty frank sexual insinuations about her, including a joke about having anal sex with her. Importantly, he's making these kinds of jokes to a girl who has /just turned 12/. I'm pretty sure if you saw any guy making a joke like that at a 12 year old girl you'd be getting her out of there quicker than you can say ‘budding sexual predator'.

As it is, Ginny blushes a lot and plays along. Partially this is author bias that every girl Harry flirts with enjoys his attentions, but in a sadder way it's a realistic response. Ginny has a crush on Harry. Harry has saved her life just a few months past, and he's currently giving her a very expensive gift that her own family could never afford. The problem with the gift giving accompanied by the sexual suggestions isn't whether or not Harry has the actual intention to do what he's joking about, but more that he's turning the gift-giving into a sexual transaction. Ginny is still too young to recognise what an older girl would -- that the price for accepting that broom is too high.

If this weren't enough, in several scenes Ginny light-heartedly jokes that Harry reminds her a lot of Tom Riddle. If that made your brain implode a little bit thinking about it, mine did too. We can't even assume in this universe that Ginny is fine and over the whole diary thing, because whenever dementors are around her she has the unique experience of hallucinating Tom, and if Harry is around, she literally sees Harry as Tom and loses her shit. Noping right out of this one.

​

Speaking of predatory behaviour, I'll touch on Tonks briefly too. Her entrance into the story shows her (in the morph of a boy) watching Harry naked in the locker room shower after a quidditch match. In their second meeting she changes from a boy back into her usual self for Harry in his bedroom, and the transformation somehow makes all her clothes fall off (yes, really), presenting her unashamedly naked. She then morphs the appearance of her ‘carpet' for Harry for a bit, before eventually putting her clothes back on. Cool cool cool. Tonks is in her 20s and practically a stranger to Harry. I want you to picture this scenario with the genders reversed for half a second. Now if you know any women who do this kind of thing, please report to child services immediately.

​

*How to be a filthy hypocrite*

Hermione is pretty out of character for the sake of the fic -- I don't know how many people read canon Hermione and thought she was a touchy person -- I certainly didn't, but she is here. However unlike Pansy, she doesn't really welcome Harry's advances. She's not a blushing violet like Ginny either, but her tact seems to largely consist of ignoring Harry's sex jokes and terrible names for her (‘Mugglebabe', ‘bushy-babe' and ‘pretty bush'), though there are exceptions, and situations where she can be read as flirting back in more low key ways. Overall though, she reads as someone who values Harry as a platonic friend and spends time with him in spite of his flirting.

Now, when Angelina Johnson is chosen to represent Hogwarts by the Goblet of Fire, Harry chooses to assume that Hermione and Ginny will not be cheering for him, and punishes them by avoiding talking to them for the better part of the school year. This is important context, because shit really hits the fan when as per the canon, Viktor Krum enters the scene.

Remember how Ron acted when he found out Hermione was going to the Yule Ball with Krum, even though he only asked her as a last resort? Harry does more or less the same thing, but worse. He has not been her friend for most of the year, and never once considered asking her to the ball himself (he was lined up with Pansy before switching to Fleur). But Harry gets into a jealous rage about Hermione daring to date Viktor. He lashes out at her multiple times, which she largely ignores (though to her credit does not feel guilty for).

For reasons, Viktor Krum plays seeker for Gryffindor in the final quidditch match of the season against Slytherin, and Harry uses the opportunity to have a pissing contest with him over Hermione. After Harry literally screams “HERMIONE IS MIIIIIINE!” at Viktor, they have a mid-air argument over her. Viktor says some very on-point things about Harry, like the fact that he's been fooling around with Fleur all year, and Pansy to a lesser extent, so what right does he have to get possessive about Hermione? He points out that Harry treats women like trophies to collect, and that eventually he will have to pick one.

Harry's counterpoint is along the lines of; he has good reason to like all 3 girls -- Viktor just can't understand, and that because he hasn't been kissing them all, this means he does not objectify them. He finishes by saying that he won't have to choose between them because “this is the wizarding world”.

I'm not aware that wizarding law permits bigamy Harry, but ok.

Let's take a moment of silence to ruminate over all this.

So. You could argue that Harry is an open-minded, modern dude who believes in free love and not putting a label on your relationships. If that were true, that would be fine and dandy. But as this conversation demonstrates, the freedom to be poly apparently only applies to him. [[https://jamesmsama.com/2015/02/27/5-clear-differences-between-a-good-man-and-the-nice-guy/][He has not made his intentions known]] to Hermione at all, nor to any of his other love interests, and he certainly hasn't told them that he has no intention of dating only one girl. Instead he suspends himself in the uncertainty zone, where he is not accountable to any of them for who he gives his affections to, but at the same time he feels entitled to their exclusive sexual and romantic loyalty, and doubles down on what [[https://images.app.goo.gl/LgjZyTKwKti7i5Kr8][he sees as his right]] to Hermione's sexuality. Doesn't Hermione get a say in who she dates?

​

#+begin_quote
  But this is just a conscious demonstration of Harry's immaturity! The author is just writing the realistic reactions of a 14-year-old!
#+end_quote

I hear you cry. Okay, but have it one way or the other. Harry is either far too immature to even scratch the surface of having a polyamorous relationship and this is the author showing how far he has to go, OR the author genuinely sees Harry's claims over four(ish) girls he has never asked out as legitimate, and Viktor just needs to shut up and go back to his wrong corner.

Narrative framing unfortunately supports the author being on Harry's side here. He is not held accountable and never has to apologise or reflect on how terribly he behaved, and his friendship with Hermione just gets an auto-reboot because bad things happen at the end of Triwizard King and she's worried about him. Fortunately in this particular case, I don't have to rely solely on narrative framing to determine how we're supposed to see Harry either. AO3 gives the author the opportunity to respond to comments, so here is one about Harry's choice to not pick one girl:

​

#+begin_quote
  Harry has legit reasons to be unable to choose a single one.

  This isn't a harem where everyone's just tossed in, there's Pansy for always sticking by Harry (especially since he was a 'scaredy cat' for some of first year). There's Hermione for being the first girl who's ever been friendly to him (and helped out a massive bit over the story). There's Fleur for not only being the most attractive girl to have visited Hogwarts, but also for also helping Harry through the Tournament.

  He also likes Ginny as well, since she's gine through a Voldemort ordeal too.

  I'm not guaranteeing it'll end up four witches for Harry, but it's definite that he won't end up with just one.
#+end_quote

LEGIT. REASONS. GUYS.

Upsettingly, this needs to be said: You can have feelings for more than one person, but having more than one girl in your life who is nice to you is not “legit reason” to never choose between them for a committed relationship. There is more than one type of relationship to have with a girl, and friendly girls =/= sex. It's okay to just see a girl as a friend sometimes; it does not make the relationship worthless.

*TL:DR*

People, by all means have your harems if that be your thing -- there actually are legit (if often contrived) reasons for them to work. Have them be anime-style awkward sexual tension moments, or have them be smut without plot. Go for your life. But have an awareness of what you're writing, and please don't try to dress up sexual entitlement as cute and romantic. Needless to say, this one is not on my ‘recommended' list.

Edit: Added trigger warning.

Edit 2: Updated a hyperlink to a better one.

** Ah, I stumbled upon this gem months ago while searching for new Harmony stories. The weird dynamics between Harry and Pansy, which begin to show from the very opening scene IIRC, and the horrible first-person writing made sure I didn't make it past the first chapter. And now he's rewriting the whole bloody thing? It's like man, just move on, learn from your mistakes and write something better.

I wish more people took the time to write analysis like these, they're always an interesting read, like you're opening a window for us to peek inside the mind of an author without having to suffer through their messes.

*** Thank you. Yes it's really interesting to me - the more I read and analyse fanfictions, the more I find I can tell about the person who wrote it.

** Props to you for writing a well-thought out review for what sounds like an above average harem (which isn't saying much). To be honest, it feels like your effort is wasted on a fic like this.

Harem is automatically trash. Doesn't mean I won't read them, but they will never not be trash no matter what reasons the author comes up with to justify them.

*** Thank you kindly :)

I feel like the harem genre is perhaps really only meant for one thing, and perhaps in-depth analysis is not part of that.

** I'm not sure I understand the the thought process behind writing an in depth analysis about your average inane fanfiction crap.

** I've always looked at this series and thought about reading it, but then I look at its review count and just know it's not good. I mean you have to work pretty hard to write hundreds of thousands of words, update regularly, to get hardly any reviews in the HP fandom. Even if the writing is bad, you get plenty of reviews on multi-chapter stories. This did not. 30+ chapters and less than 100 reviews on ffnet for the first story, and the rest of the sequels are the same. Something has to be seriously wrong with a fic to get ignored like that.

  CHAPTER 28 NOW UP! The academic year at Hogwarts reaches its end, but its closing weeks have left more questions than answers. Was the late-spring incident an unfortunate accident - or was it a sign of a darker agenda within Hogwarts's very walls?
