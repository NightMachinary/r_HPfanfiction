** Can you please link to this one? I'd like to check it out.

I've only come across the Snape/Tonks pairing while reading the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry/Laocoon's Children]] series. This pairing forms slowly during the latter part of the series, and I love it!!!

  Complete! Epilogue is up! In her heart, Nymphadora Tonks knows that Remus Lupin is the only man for her. Then why can't she get Severus Snape out of her head? Rated T for adult themes and sexual situations.
