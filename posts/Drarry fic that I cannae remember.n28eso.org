:END:
Oh god hi!!

There was this drarry fic that I can't remember the title of? There some sort of bond/connection/link between Harry and draco and they fall in love. I remember there's this one scene where they get into this sort of secret room with mirrors and this lake mirror that shows them stuff, and they're in there for a while but noone else can get in. Draco gets like sucked in to the lake pool because he's enraptured by what he sees. I also remember there's a scene where they're in the hospital wing with these lion and snake statues which are their guardians or some shite.

Anyway, please help! Thanks lovelies! :)

  HPDM slash, AU of HBP. Snape never swore a vow. Draco accepted Dumbledore's offer of sanctuary. But when Voldemort kills Narcissa in retaliation, and Dumbledore insists on creating a soul-bond between Draco and Harry to subdue the Horcrux in Harry's soul, Draco decides to use both the soul-bond and the sanctuary to keep his family safe. No matter what Dumbledore intended. COMPLETE.
