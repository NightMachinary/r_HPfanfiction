For the already established characters, maybe it showed you the why a character is the way that they are in a new light, or some such. Or develops in a believable way then canon or such.

No Weasley Bashing. If Harry is in the story, no OP Harry, Harry smarter and/or more powerful then Canon is perfectly fine, but I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it.

None of the usual Weasley's were using Harry for his fame and fortune.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new, canon or AU. Completed or not.

For pairings: (If any) I'm fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra.

No: The abuse at the Dursley's being worse then in canon, no: Rape, no Male Pregnancy, for pairings I'm fine with a 10-15 year age gap (If the characters in question are 17 or older). If the age gap is more then that, I'd be okay, if there was time travel involved.

Can be Canon Compliant, AU, Magical, Muggle, Time Travel, Traveling to another universe, or whatever. Can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  Or were they something else entirely, this trio who was not golden? They were the unchosen three: the discarded Horcrux and the last Weasley; the brave, broken backup Boy Who Lived; the loony girl who lost her shoes and had more friends in thestrals than in her common room.Ginny rallied an army in the Room of Requirement with her mother's knack for raised voices, Riddle's smooth words, Harry's agitated passion, and wondered if she was the hero of this story.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.
