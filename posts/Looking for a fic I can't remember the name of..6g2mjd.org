I read it fairly recently and I was looking for it so I could recommend it to my friend but I couldn't find it.

SPOILERS! I gave as much detail as possible so it is basically one massive spoiler.

It starts out with harry having gone to an orphanage and been adopted by a rich family that was kind to him but didn't care about him. He didn't like using a wand for magic as he felt it was unnecessary but it made magic way easier. he used magic from when he was young but it doesn't really show that in any detail. he carves runes into his skin that make him start puberty earlier and when he kills someone it lets 'the dark' into his soul so he has to carve runes into his skin that draw from stars to counter it. he loses his virginity in his first or second year before he starts to date tonks exclusively. he was friends with no-one in his first year but made friends with ginny and luna in his second but ginny ended not a friend. He breaks up with tanks because he was using soul magic on her to increase her pleasure and it was changing her, he started a harem a while after that and tonks ended up joining it.

I FOUND IT! if anyone is interested linkffn(11669575) its called 'for love of magic', by noodlehammer
