:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I fear it has been deleted, and sadly I don't remember the name, but it was very well written and popular. The basic premise was that the Voldemort horcrux in Harry's head regains awareness and sort of grows fond of Harry, helping her out, etc. Due to his influence she grows up to be darker but also still stubbornly good, though she's sorted into Slytherin. During 1st year the horcrux tries to make contact w Voldy and it goes really wrong, he promises not to do it again but second year strikes and... he does it again. Harry absorbs the TMR diary horcrux, and while at first a jerk, after a few years the diary Tom grows really fond of her and is actually pretty nice (if you can use that adjective) in a sarcastic, tsundere sort of way... whilst the original horcrux gets increasingly less nice, shall we say.

Later on Harry finds the locket and that one's added to the club, but I remember the locket being the least likeable one. Harry good friends with Draco in this fic and initially hermione. She eventually started dating Fred during 4th year, I think, though it was sort of obvious it would end badly. Also, she got a scar from the dragon during GoF that's sort of characteristic of that fic.

Case in point, the story had left off at the summer before fifth year. Very sad if it's been deleted, bc it was really good. Does anyone still have it?

EDIT: why do people downvote this? Seriously. If you don't like the pairing, leave me alone, but don't downvote! It's upsetting...

**** Have you tried looking through all 3 harry potter/tom riddle relationship tags? Most authors tag it with all three but some only do one and if you're looking through a different one it won't show up.
