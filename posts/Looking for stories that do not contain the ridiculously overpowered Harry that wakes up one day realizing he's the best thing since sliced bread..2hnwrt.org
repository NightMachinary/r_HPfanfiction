We've all seen those stupid stories in which Harry starts to gain incredible amount of power and thinks he's just the greatest thing ever. Usually he starts calling Dumbledore and Voldemort fools and easily defeats them like they're not two of the most powerful wizards to ever live. Often, they contain the ridiculous notion of an evil Dumbledore that has somehow not completely taken over the world yet.

I'm looking for a good, high quality story that is not like this. I don't care if it contains some of the things normally found in stories like this, so long as they're not ridiculous. For example, The bad Dumbledore from The Sacrifices Arc is fine.

I only have two qualifications. 1. Harry has to be the main character. 2. I'm looking for generally all around good stories, not ones that you liked but aren't actually good. So no Harry Crow, for example.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations you have for me.

Isn't SA!Harry OPed as well, though? With Harry being an /absorbere/, Dumbledore being an idiot and whatnot.

Here's what I'd recommend as fitting your request:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] --- Words: 52,712; [Complete].

What I'd recommend *against*:

- HP & Methods of Rationality --- 1. When confronted with a problem, Harry will often have a revelation in a relevant magical theory field on the spot and proceed to solve his problem with the freshly-acquired knowledge about the magical universe.
- The Other Boy Who Lived --- after Ch. 11-12 almost all enemies (from DEs to Dragons) get nerfed and the main characters get ridiculously OPed.
- The Denarian Renegade --- OPed protagonist.
- Firebird's Son --- OPed protagonist.
- Mastermind hunting --- OPed protagonist.
- Evil Be Thou My Good --- OPed protagonist.
- Travel Secrets --- Harry is a heir to several ancient houses at once, is immune to unforgivables, has twice his original magical power, etc.

While it is true Harry is incredibly powerful here, we often see him lose to other even more incredibly powerful people too. I'd say OP should at least give it a shot. It's one of my favorite AU stories.

For me, the important parts are whether characters have to work for their unusual abilities (which is usually tricky in an abnormally dangerous environment) and whether their opponents are similarly powerful. HPMOR is inconsistent on the former and good on the latter.

*** He is powerful in SA, but it fits with the world of the fic well and isn't done in that annoying way most fics do it. I'm not against an OP Harry, I'm against the overnight OP Harry that thinks his shit don't stink if you get what I mean. Dumbledore as well. I don't mind that he's not good, because he's not truly evil and certainly wasn't written as a weak character. He was written as a powerful, intelligent wizard whose character was twisted from its canon way. With Firebird's son, for example, his power is both explained in a rational way fitting with the world, is slow building, and does not feature the characteristics I find annoying. I also rather liked HPMOR, but I can definitely see why some people would not.

Thank you very much for all the recommendations.

**** Yes, in [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][the Sacrifices Arc]] Harry can absorb the magical power both from magical creatures (e.g. magical humans) /and/ artefacts.

He was prone to carelessly manipulating/wasting the gained power though, which I considered to be an Idiot Ball behaviour on his behalf.

***** It was incredibly frustrating to read. The author gives Harry a clear way to dominate the war, and he refuses to use it because the magic feels "dirty", even after having stated that with time and effort the magic could be purified.

This goes far beyond the idiot ball. This is a self-induced massacre of his friends and followers.

You might say that if he did that it wouldn't be a good story. If that's the case, don't introduce the mechanic in the first place.

/(ending spoilers)/

I agree. Unfortunately, that scenario repeats itself several times throughout the story, and you can imagine how frustrated a reader could get by the final iteration---at the finale of the story, where he harvests /all of the Voldemort's magic as well/... /and just pours it into the sea/. Literally.

#+begin_quote
  Harry climbed, and, as he climbed, he gave his power away.

  Oh, not all of it. But he could not live with so much magic squatting in the back of his mind, or racing about his head like a crown of song, asking to do things for him.

  He was Slytherin in his selfishness, perhaps, but not his ambition. Or perhaps he was more ambitious than others, to want to accomplish something without the magic that would intimidate many of his potential opponents before they even lifted their voices.

  So he cut Voldemort's power from his. [..] he knew what his magic should feel like. Everything else, he cut away, and sent elsewhere.

  One third went to the wild Dark. [..]

  One third went to the Light. [..]

  And one more third of extra magic to give away.

  He gave it to the sea [..] His magic vanished into the sea like a diving dolphin. Harry knew the waves would use it better than he would. Perhaps it would go to nourish hippocampi, to split the web on a kraken, or to encourage the flourishing of sirens. He could not know, and he was glad not to.

The story then proceeds to tell how---after learning about LV---Harry builds a new box and traps LV and his DEs to be hunted down during the second Opening.

Harry himself doesn't have any superpowers per se, in this story, but the way it is written and the way the plot favours Harry and all the “good” characters makes it look like a wishful crackfic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by jbern has a Harry that is rather powered up, but not outrageously so. It's a tri-wizard tournament fic, and Harry doesn't outstrip his opponents by a massive degree. Dumbledore is not evil, and Harry and Dumbledore get along well enough.

[[http://hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky is somewhat contentious. It's well marketed, certainly, and its fame is not entirely undeserved. If I were to complain about it, I'd say that it's a power fantasy from someone enamored of their own brilliance, and its only saving graces are good production values, writing that varies between acceptable and very good, and a balance of power.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] is a slightly crack fic that features a slightly overbearing Dumbledore and a Harry whose power grows organically.

** In general, I think Snape-adopts-Harry fics aren't prone to Harry being overpowered; they usually feature him as a delicate flower, if anything. I think they do tend towards evil Dumbledore, though.

For complete fics that I think fit these requirements, I've got these:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/750576/1/Never-Alone-Never-Again][Never Alone, Never Again]]. Harry gets sent to Azkaban after Cedric Diggory's death, and does not miraculously break out on his own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]]. After the events of book 7, everything goes to shit. I remember it as being horribly depressing. It jumps around a lot from Harry though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]]. Neville is the real BWL, Harry's in love with Hermione, but Harry's not a part of the horcrux-hunting trio.

And a couple of unfinished ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711029/1/A-Game-of-Style-and-Brutality][A Game of Style and Brutality]]. After book 7, Harry goes on to play Quidditch. Being the best seeker at Hogwarts means nothing here.

+[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6855183/1/Burnt][Burnt]]. Harry is disabled, and sorted into Slytherin. Does have evil Dumbledore though.+ Edit: Removed as a recommendation, after [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] reminded me what actually happens in this story.
