"Staffs are idiotic" Professor Moody growled to Hermione. Her raised hand was still partly up and her face scrunched with exasperation.

"yes but why, the accuracy debate aside, surely the power would more than make up for the downsides?"

"well then miss Granger, please do come to the front of the class, I have an old staff somewhere and we can have a little demonstration" Professor Moody responded gleefully/

Harry watched nervously as Hermione stood at the front of the class with professor Moody, a thick oaken staff held out in front of her in a combat stance. Moody's face twisted for a fraction of a second into a cruel grin as he raised his wand and uttered one word.

" /Expelliarmus/ ".

Hermione Ragdolled


** My head cannon is that staffs/wands are like computers, big and clunky when they where first invented but over time they became smaller and smaller, maybe in the future they are small enough to be ring or bracelet like.

*** Eventually you have wands that are just splinters, and then the designers realize that they overshot the size that feels comfortable to get as small a wand as possible, leading to wands 3 to 4 inches long - or you can get the Plus for an extra galleon and an extra couple inches

**** The thing about a wooden splinter is that at a size like that, you can get it implanted under the skin of your finger, if you can keep your immune system from identifying it as non-self. I bet there's a potion for that.

*** If you want more computer than fits in a standard laptop, you can still buy a dual-socket EATX board, put in two hand-sized Epyc CPUs, connect 128 dual-slot RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards using risers, and connect hundreds of such systems into a cluster the size of a room. You still get more computer if you're willing to spend more money and fill more space. It's just that for most purposes you can fit enough computer into a device the size of a deck of cards. Maybe you can fit enough magical focus for most people into a wand the size of a couple pencils, or even a bracelet. But people willing to spend more money and fill more space should always be able to get more power.

** The reemergence of staffs

The staff topic didn't die there, of course. If students simply took the explanation - with a graphical example - at face value, they would not be the petty little shits that inhabit schools all over Britain. Hearing rumours of a girl being sent bouncing off the walls only encouraged them. A few cushioning charms applied during the lesson, and then there was a veritable crowd of volunteers proclaiming the valor of wizard's staff to any who would listen... And perhaps especially to those who didn't want to.

Of course, the situation would not be complete without the Weasley twins.

"We hereby proclaim" started Fred.

"... that the staffs are awesome!" finished George. "En garde!"

Both redheads had long, thick, heavy pieces of wood in their hands. Their form, however, could use some work. In fact, it was unlike any dueling form ever seen.

"Expelliarmus!" cast Moody, his voice radiating boredom that got him apreciative nods from all those who still had to take History of Magic. It was high quality boredom, as if fresh from Binn's classes.

Of course, routine is an enemy. After sending so many students flying, Moody really didn't expect any other result. Anf he really should have.

The twins didn't assume a standard position because they didn't know it. They also didn't know how to cast proper spells with a staff. All they knew was how to channel magic through the wood - and they didn;t have the time to learn more. It was a bit of a last minute entertainment, so it was rather lacking the usual elegance of their pranks. No one really knew what they had planned, only that it didn't happen.

With spell flying towards them, Fred did what came naturally - he channeled his magic through his staff...

... and let his Beater instincts take over. The expelliarmus spell was both smaller and faster than a bludger, but it was also bright red. Very visible. And so, there was no chance Fred would miss.

The spell arrived and was met with hard wood and compressed, unforgiving wall of magic surrounding it. It lost, badly, and came zipping through the air back towards the professor, who didn't have time to react.

His wand was sent flying and Moody was propelled backwards, hitting a wall and sliding down, unconscious. His flask, which he never went without, detatched itself from his belt and rolled under a heavy wooden wardrobe used to store student essays.

Moody was swiftly resuscitated and continued the lesson after giving the twins a detention each. He would not notice the absence of his flask until he was in Great Hall, sitting next to the headmaster and conversing over the midday meal. Only then, when time came for his hourly drink, did he notice it' was missing...

But that, is another story.

** My thought is that all magical implements have symbolic strengths and weaknesses. The symbolism of staffs being tied more heavily to the strength and and stability of trees rather than the flexibility of branches. Wielding a staff is best suited for magic that spreads from an area outwards rather than directed magic like stunning spells. They also work best when the user is "rooted" to the ground rather than moving around a lot.
