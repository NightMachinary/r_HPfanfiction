Basically any fic where wizards (teacher/students) find Harry Potter to be average. Where he is utterly disappointing compared to their expectations of him (He isn't as talented as either of his parents. James, although I don't like him, was very talented in Transfiguration and became a Animagus during his fourth year, I think, along with his friends. Lily was one of the top students at Potions and Charms. And also the reason why Voldemort was defeated the first time, because of her sacrifice and love for Harry.) Anything close to his canon self, not really shining in any subjects aside from maybe DaDA and Quidditch. Where he isn't given any special privilege like being handed the Seeker spot on the Gryffindor team. Or being given a expensive gifts by teachers because it's not appropriate. Wouldn't mind SI or OC actively antagonizing him calling him out on his brash behavior and all his angsty attitude from the 3rd year onwards. Where they point at how he never really applies himself to his studies or reaches out to anyone outside of Ron and Hermione as friends. Probably a long shot but I'm tired of reading stories where he is as powerful and intelligent and as interesting as Voldemort/Dumbledore/Grindelwald by the time he is 15.


** You don't need an OC or SI to do that. That's basically canon and filled with characters like Snape, Malfoy, and Hermione (who is basically a JKR self-insert so the author as well). JKR did everything she could to strip anything special about him away.

"Oh, you can cast the patronus during 3rd year! Adults struggle with that spell!"\\
"Whoops. Not really. The DA learns how to do the spell including 4th years."

"You're AWESOME at quidditch!"\\
"Which... has no real practical application to fighting the bad guy. And even Hermione learned enough about Flying to outfly fiendfyre in the room of requirements."

"You won the tri-wizard tournament!"\\
"By... flying the broom, eating a plant and an adult clearing the competition out."

"You beat voldemort at the end!"\\
"Because he literally used a wand that you were master of. He'd have beaten you with literally any other wand in the world. He could have picked a stick up off the ground and done better!"

That is why so many fanfictions out there have him... not a complete incompetent?

*** I absolutely agree with you 100%

But please, they requested a fic, recommending Canon is really bad form.

*** Yeah true but there isn't any fic where the MC works against him and I don't count WBWL stories. Just any stories that sort of bashes him without it being the normal bashing story.

  What if the Dursleys sent Harry off without him learning his own story? No one ever explained anything. And Amelia Bones is quiet upset about it. Complete for basic idea. Feel Free to Adopt.
