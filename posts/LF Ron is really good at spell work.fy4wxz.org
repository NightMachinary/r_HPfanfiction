Can be in Defence, Charms or Transformation, or all 3. His homework or writing work might suffer but he's really good with spells and the like.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

It can be a main part of the story or a minor part.

Anyone can be the main character.

No Harem Harry or Lord Potter stories.

No bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash is usually a no go. Example: For the Greater Good Dumbledore, Weasley's were only using Harry for his fame and money, et cetra. None of that.


** Linkffn(fate by The TrueSpartan) I literally stumbled on this fic yesterday and was hooked immediately, amazing story. Ron is basically the best student in his year but there is a reason for that and he is not overpowered. I have barely started fic but I definitely recommend it.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
