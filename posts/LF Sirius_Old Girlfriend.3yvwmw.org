I've read a few stories where Sirius is cleared/raises Harry elsewhere, and when he comes back/is exonerated he meets up with someone he was serious (of course he was! Couldn't resist) with before the war. I've seen Amelia Bones, Marlene McKinnon, Hestia Jones, and Aurora Sinestra. I'm looking for any stories that involve this, doesn't need to be a major plot point, still Harry-centric, I just want Sirius to survive and maybe marry his old flame/love interest. If you need an example, linkffn(reunion by Rorschachs blot) has this happen at some point.


** A bunch of fics by whydoyouneedtoknow have this as a major plot point. Start with linkffn(Living with Danger) or linkffn(Be Careful by whydoyouneedtoknow). Warnings for excess fluff, [[/spoiler][Heir!Everyone]], and a fair few OCs. The fics are well-written - which is a pleasant surprise.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
