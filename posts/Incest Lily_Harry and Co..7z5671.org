** u/Deathcrow:
#+begin_quote
  pedophilia
#+end_quote

What a weird comparison to make. Pedophilia lacks consent by default and is therefore morally wrong.

Incest, when it involves contraception and consenting adults, is morally neutral.

** It amazes me when people compare incest and pedophilia. No, they're not the same. There is no consent on one side when it comes to pedophilia. With incest, consent can be given on both sides. How can you not see the difference?

Take two consenting siblings and make them never have kids. What's wrong with it then? Where's the harm? People read them because it's taboo, but a harmless one.

** peodphilia is not exactly a taboo in fanfiction.

as long as it happens between two consenting adults, i don't really see a problem with incest.

** People write them because they are inspired by it somehow. We allow them because inspired writing can be enjoyable to read. We don't censure them because sharing ideas through words is a technological gift that advances humanity and shouldn't be taken for granted.
