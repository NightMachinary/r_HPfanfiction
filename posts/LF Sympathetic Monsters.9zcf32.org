I am looking for fics where we are introduced to apparent absolute monsters as either a protagonist and antagonist but they are later revealed to still have a heart hidden in there somewhere.


** Does it count if that monster is Harry Potter? [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/155396590-harry-potter-and-the-thief-of-knockturn-alley][I've a next-gen fic]] where the protagonist is a kid of a Death Eater, raised to hate and fear Potter, the Auror.
