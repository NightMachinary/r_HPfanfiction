I've read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction over the years, but I rarely come across one where the magical and muggle worlds are integrated. I'd love to see a fic where wizards do jobs for muggles, or there are wizard celebrities in the muggle world and such. I'd prefer a fic with over 20,000 words.

There's a one shot called Spellist that I just read that inspired this fic request:

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.
