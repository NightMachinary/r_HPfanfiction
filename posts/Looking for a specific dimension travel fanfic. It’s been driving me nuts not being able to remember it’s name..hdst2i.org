:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
EDIT 2: First of all what even is my formatting even while fully awake and secondly thank you all for helping me out with this Fic I was looking And it was indeed found below by colorandtimbre, just want to say reddit always surprises me when they can take some persons vague memories and rambling and find exactly what they were thinking of.

Just thanks in advance for clicking on if you can help me find this fix or just curious about what it is, so I'll lay out what I remember.

EDIT: (Please refer to the other edit below for the details I wasn't the most coherent while writing out that entire block of just anything and everything coming to mind below)

Basically from what I remember Harry Potter travels to an alternate universe also possibly further back in time I'm not entirely sure. I'm relatively certain he is an adult or at least out of hogwarts, the main identifying factor I can remember is that after realising he has travelled to an AU he goes to check some form of register that records family trees pretty sure there is some mention of being a few copies of it but the one he goes to is at a sort of heritage place which isn't patrolled or what not. Then while he is there he runs into a student who snuck out of hogwarts pretty sure it's a girl who didn't exist in his world and whilst he runs into her some death eaters/knights of walpurgis (can't remember which have come after her for some reason, think it's because she is the ministers daughter but am again not sure). Harry ends up defending her and then obliviates her of running into him for some reason.

If anyone can figure out what this fic is even called off of my terrible description that'd be fantastic it's driven me up the wall not being able to find it off my admittedly half hearted googles and what not to the point I made this account because surely someone here is better placed to name the fanfic. Additionally I think it was uncompleted or possibly abandoned I just wanted to check back to see if it was any good like I remembered or had been updated.

EDIT: (Because I was way too tired when writing this post)

Here's a vague sort of timeline from what I can remember.

1. A Male Harry Potter gets transported to another dimension, I'm pretty sure accidentally. He keeps his own body, age gender, etc that all stays the same.

2. After realising that it's not just time travel or perhaps trying to simply find more information on his current whereabouts/situation he decides to check the ministry maintained registers which track family trees unfortunately only the purebloods I believe. He knows of a few of these registers but discounts all of them for being guarded or located in annoying spots (I think it was the ministry and hogwarts) so he goes to a third out in a sort of heritage place that is maintained but no one actually regularly mans.

3. Simultaneously while he goes to said place a hogwarts student sneaks out and decides to visit the same place (can't remember why).

4. Harry checks the register of family trees and notices various changes and what not then ends up running into the person who snuck out of hogwarts. He impersonates a ministry official and tells her its a class something restricted area (presumably I think he was trying to just get her away without anyone knowing about him.

5. While this happens a group of people have arrived to attack her (cannot remember if they were referred to as death eaters or the older variant knights of walpurgis, think I spelt that right). Pretty sure they attack her because she is related to someone important can't remember exactly who. Also she is a new character in the alternate universe who wasn't in Harry's old universe.

6. The adult Harry Potter that dimension travelled ended up fighting them And after defeating the group obliviates the girl of seeing him there in an effort to remain anonymous.

7. Can't really remember more beyond that apart from a vague recollections of the hogwarts student having emotions leaking through even after the oblivious eventually leading people to realise she had been obliviated and undoing it.


** I've absolutely read this, I'll try to find it but some more details: Bellatrix is the girls' mother, as well as the DADA professor at Hogwarts. She's overprotective, due to a past relationship with an OC who I believe is Riddle's son, described as very honorable and self-sacrificing. He died during an attack on Diagon Alley, I think, while protecting Bellatrix. There's implied romantic tension between Harry and the widowed Bellatrix.

The obliviation doesn't keep on the girl, and she eventually goes to a professor (McGonagall?) when she gets headaches. I think she's friends with Hermione, who convinces her to get it checked out. I'll stop trying to pick my memory and actually look for it now.

edit: I'm fairly sure he accidentally uses Parseltongue, which hints at his origins to the members of the new universe. This might also be the same story where he attacks the not-Death Eaters as a vigilante but is heavily injured and rescued by Bellatrix and not-Voldemort? (her father-in-law in this universe, I guess)

e: found it, I'm pretty sure. linkffn(Something to Live For by Grey Silver Hawk). No guarantees about its quality.

*** Yep this is the one thanks a bunch I was ever so slowly going mad while trying search term after search term to find this fanfic I vaguely remembered.

Now I guess it's time for me to read it despair on the memory of it hued by nostalgia and compare it to whatever it really is and see if it holds up so thanks once again really don't know how to end this message now that I've started rambling again so here's a full stop.

*** I remember that Bellatrix was in an unhappy marriage and the scene where he accesses the family tree/births and deaths was quite good.

My brain keeps supplying the word Stonehenge for some reason. Was that where he landed? I don't know.

Do you think this is the fic where all Wizengamot meetings are transcribed automatically into the archives, no matter if you are whispering to your neighbour or giving a speech to the entire audience? And someone illegally accessed them to find the password to ministry birth records? I have collected too many fic ideas in my brain and have no idea which one came from where.

Google search results went haywire when I entered too many terms. I tried searching Dimensional Travel communites on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] but got a lot of other extremely similar fanfictions.

**** I found it just before you replied :) I honestly don't remember much about it beyond what I wrote. Got it by looking through ffn stories with Harry and Bellatrix for dimension travel. yeah, they all kind of blend together after a while

*** Ah nah sorry mate that isn't the one although I'll check it out, that's probably on me I wrote this post last night while super tired so it isn't the most coherent I'll go back and edit it to try and give more details now that I'm awake.

***** Yeah like I said in my edit wasn't the most awake at the time of writing so I don't blame you lord knows I'm not even fully coherent when wide awake and alert. Again thanks a bunch for giving it a crack though and sorry about my ramblings.
