I had to look up linkffn(11246463) for someone and there's only one Harry Potter/Looking for Group story. Any other media that have a small number of stories crossing with HP? Just the amount and any cream of the crop--if there are any--would be great.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

I myself am writing an HP/Witcher crossover, which has an archive total of 8 fics. I haven't read the other fics and can't personally attest to their quality, but some of them are pretty highly reviewed/faved/etc. for such a small archive, so someone out there must have liked them.

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.

**** That was actually one of the big fears I had when writing the first few chapters of this fic. As you said, this isn't a fic where Harry and Co. fall into the veil and out into the world of The Witcher; they were born there, lived their whole lives there, and act accordingly based on that. And for someone to read and enjoy that kind of fic, it likely requires both a working knowledge of HP and The Witcher, because while the characters are familiar to a person who has only read HP, the lore, history, and situation these familiar characters are in, are most decidedly un-familiar to a person who hasn't read/played The Witcher.

Not to mention, the fic doesn't even take place in a familiar time-period for most Witcher fans, considering that it takes place around 200 years before The Last Wish. The only characters from the original series we see with any regularity are Geralt and Dandelion, and I didn't think many people would care much for that, considering some of the highly-reviewed fics in that archive appear to just be Harry/Ciri pairings, with no real mention of Geralt.

It was for those reasons that the fic was originally intended to be a short story about Harry and Ron seeing out a witcher contract, but soon, the idea of another short story featuring Harry and a sorceress Hermione came to my head and wouldn't leave me alone, so the plot grew, and now I've another arc being planned out as well. So, I guess I'm putting in a full shift on this one now.

***** Well considering that you mentioned Hermione and Harry's interaction before the contract, it was a loose end. You know how people hate loose ends; thus, people writing about the 19 years jn between the Battle and the epilogue.

Other than you placing another loose end during this one and Dandelion asking about it, you could wrap the story after the arc, or insert an adventure where Harry helps Gestalt in some way that is fatal to Harry, and the last arc is Gestalt telling said arc to Ciri.

And I think I've become too enamoured with the world myself, because I have at least three or four arcs that could come up after this arc. As for Geralt and Dandelion, I've been writing it as a framing story, so I definitely need more than two or three arcs for it to feel like a proper framing device.

*** My issue with all those Witcher x-overs is that we usually get Harry as Geralt or as another witcher. I mean, I like the concept of witchers, but it gets repetitive. Am I the only one that would love an x-over with Harry being trained as an actual sorcerer?

**** That might be interesting to some, but ultimately boring to me; one of the core strengths of the witcher universe is that the main character is an outsider looking into human culture. He sees how we interact with each other and with nonhumans, and even he himself is an undesirable. Some places he's treated as a saviour, but most places he's treated as an oddity, and an outcast. A freak.

Conversely, up until the TW2/TW3, people don't outright attack mages or insult them to their faces. In fact, throughout most of the Witcher books, people try their absolute hardest to keep sorcerers and sorceresses safe and happy because of all the good they can do, from healing, to helping with crops, to obstetric services. So, ultimately, while it makes more sense to have Harry as sorcerer over a witcher, there's a lot more thematic weight and complexity to a Witcher's interaction with people than there is a sorcerer's, and that makes for more engaging writing. At least, that's my opinion.

P.S. I understand where you're coming from, but I struggle to see how it could become that repetitive, considering that there are only 8 fics in the archive, and a few of them don't even feature Harry.

***** Ah. Little correction on my part; I meant all the x-overs as well as the Witcher fanfiction. I guess I know where you're coming from. Outsiders always make for interesting characters. Mages, at least in the witcher universe, can't really be considered 'human' anymore as well though. Sure, they look pretty and can blend in better because of that, charm people yadda yadda and are usually treated pretty well due to their abilities. It would be interesting to see life from a mage's perspective for once though, and then, with that character, go through the Witcher storyline, maybe even some x-overs, and see how the timeline would divert, maybe even scratching what we know of the story and make up something comepletely new.

****** Ah, I see what you're getting at. Yeah, it's pretty boring to have Harry become a witcher and then go through the witcher storyline because he essentially then plays the same role as Geralt. And if he somehow makes things better than they are in Witcher canon, it diminishes the role of Geralt entirely, because it posits that Harry was able to do something Geralt wasn't, despite having the same role in society as him, and ostensibly being on equal terms in ability and intellect with him.

That is boring. In that case, I absolutely understand making Harry a sorcerer because that's significantly more interesting than turning Harry into Geralt 2.0 and have him go along doing the same things Geralt does.

While I can't speak for the other fics in the archive, I've tried to avoid that in my fic. Geralt only appears in a framing story that takes place in the gap between The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, which takes place about twenty years before the The Witcher games, and the main brunt of the story (with Ron, Hermione, and others) takes place about 200 years before that. So, for the most part, this is about Harry interacting with characters we only hear about in Witcher canon, such as Lara Dorren, and Cregennan of Lod, as well as King Vridank and Queen Cerro, and even Falka and others. So, while it's technically /old/, due to the fact that the fic takes place before the canon plotline, it's also new because we know very little about these characters, and what we do know is from myth and hearsay in Witcher canon.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
