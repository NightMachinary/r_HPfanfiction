Two that really bother me are when people say that James was a seeker -- that was true in the movie, but in the books James was a chaser. Also, a lot of people seem to think that Gryffindor's sword can destroy horcruxes BEFORE it gets the infusion of basilisk venom. Only AFTER it comes into contact with the venom can the sword be used to destroy horcruxes, people!

What misconceptions bother you the most?

*** I definitely agree. Another one is when the Horntail breaks free of the chains and chases Harry around the grounds in the fourth movie.

Also this is probably too picky, and it's not like I will stop reading an otherwise enjoyable story because of it, but I don't like it when people base their physical descriptions of characters off of how the actors looked in the movies. For example, the twins are supposed to be shorter than Ron, and Vernon had black hair! Or at least a black mustache.

I know I should be understanding and nonjudgmental about people who have only seen the movies... but I just can't help it. I will not respect someone if they do that and still claim to be a fan.

- Hermione's eyes are brown. Maybe they're chocolate brown, and maybe they're coffee-colored, but brown does not equal hazel or gold.
- And as much as I respect AUs, Snape isn't a vampire. It's probably because I made the mistake of reading the Twilight series, but the only vampire in the HP series is Sanguini. I don't recommend writing a vampire AU for HP, sorry.

** Characters being incredibly OOC. Most note-ably making a character a huge slut, a ridiculous bad-ass, or bishie.

Some examples: -Hermione wants the D -Draco turns out to be a super-macho, manly, flirty playboy who's basically the most awesome thing ever to walk the earth (coming from the boy who gave you: My father will hear about this) -In random M/M couple there's always one who is downright a girl with a penis. Blushing all the time, stuttering, shyness, being overly cute and saying horrible feminine things (You know who you are Harry)

Also secondary characters: -The whole world is suddenly HELL-BENT on getting the two main characters together. Every supporting character has made it it's life goal to know about this pairing, scheme to get them together, talk about this paring or give advice to one about the other. -On the other side of the rainbow we have the huge Bitches/Assholes. These are the sluts/Mansluts who are either OC's or original characters pulled through the meatgrinder to be the biggest bitchfaces ever. They have no depth or redeeming qualities. They are just empty vessels that NEED to stop this couple by being sluts/ being mean/ being violent. (For instance in a Drarry shipping Ginny must be a maneating whore who is on her period the whole time hell-bent on getting Harry. No. Matter. What.)

** The truths that fanfiction writers forget:

- Albus Dumbledore didn't care about money

- Ginny is actually more attractive than Hermione. A lot more. She competes with the exotic students like Cho and the Patils.

- The Potter family is not noble. For all we know, neither are the Blacks

- Goblins don't care that you remember their name. Scratch that- goblins don't care about anything except goblins and money

- Snape isn't attractive- his teeth are green, his hair is perpetually unwashed and he's been obsessed with a dead girl for twenty years. This is the definition of a creep. Think of the ugliest scab-picking freak at your grade school and imagine him obsessed with Famke Janssen. This is not the formula for a great romance.

*** A couple of things:

I don't remember any precise evidence of the contrary (there is, however, tons of implied non-thief tendency, so I'll give you that.) I assume here you're responding to the fanfics with a written evil-Dumbledore that takes from the Potter vaults. But this is not a canon-established fact. For all we know, Dumbledore /could/ have been taking from the Potter vault.

Please don't use exotic to describe in-context minorities. It's insulting. Much of the hullabaloo about the Victoria Secret Oriental-inspired lingerie was about how dehumanizing the idea of being a fetish is. Also, again, I don't see how we know that. The girls aside from Fleur are not generally described by their amount of physical attractiveness. I think there may have been a few lines of "this pretty girl" or "that pretty girl" but otherwise, the females are not pitted against each other in the way you've described. State your evidence.

As Serpensortia said, the Blacks /are/ a noble house, or at least they call themselves such. I assume you mean related to royalty or own specific plots of land though, in which at the time of the story, would be true enough, seeing as even if Sirius had access to unmentioned lands, he ends his line.

I don't remember any passage in the books that describe Snape's teeth at all, let alone say that they're green in color, and I'm not so sure he's been as heartily obsessed as you would believe. I tend to read his character as in perpetual atonement. He did indirectly kill her, after all. I also don't remember any passage in the books that actually describe him as "ugly" aside from his perpetually unwashed-looking (a distinction from simply "unwashed") hair. Again, state your evidence.

** A few of the things that will make me ragequit a fanfic instantly:

- When Care of Magical Creatures is taken before 3rd year. It's an elective that starts at 3rd year.
- When everyone suddenly starts learning martial arts and wearing ludicrously-detailed outfits. This isn't Vogue, Cosmo, or Black Belt Magazine. This is Harry Potter.
- When Ginny's name is spelled "Ginerva." Come on, people. /try./
- OCs. Any OCs at all. HP has hundreds of characters, and you can't find a single one that would suit your plot? Yes, we know that you're writing yourself into the story and playing out your wish-fulfillment fantasies. An OC should not run the show, be the smartest and bestest witch/wizard of all time that everybody loves, nor should one of the main characters fall madly in love with you/them. Just stop.
- When Ron is the worst human being who ever lived. Stop bashing on him. He's just a teenage boy.
- When Ginny is a jealous hag with no limit to the depths of her depravity. She's just a teenage girl. She'll only go halfway to Hell to destroy a boy who spurned her, not all the way.
- When Harry suddenly becomes the most powerful/rich/handsome/intelligent heir/anything-involving-the-word-mage ever, due to some block/limit/potion/curse/Dumbledore's-clearly-at-fault-for-this.
- When copious amounts of sex are had and described, in lurid detail. This isn't Fifty Shades of Grey, this is Harry Potter. Tone it down.
- When the biggest conflict in a story boils down to interpersonal melodrama. Nobody cares what what's-her-name said to so-and-so about what's-her-face. The canon story was always driven by action, not drama. This isn't some soap opera, it's Harry Potter. Pull the plot along with action, drive character development with action, and then back it all up with more action. Show, don't tell.
