Harry has a twin sister who turns blind at age four for some reason. The Potters are alive and Neville is the supposed chosen one, Voldemort was caught in an experimental ward that vaporised his body. Everybody is resigned to accept that poor Sarah just won't be able to do the things of a normal witch. That is all but Harry. Harry dedicates his life to developing enchanted items to make life easier fir his sister so she can do everything that everyone said she could not. A broom with altitude warnings and wards to stop her leaving a set area, even a second seat so she can ride along with him. Never mind that Harry is terrified of flying but Sarah lived it as a little sighted girl. Brail was not something know to magicals and Lily had mever encountered it before so Harry sits and reads aloud to her every night. Transfiguration was always difficult with visualisation but Harry didn't give up on her.

The idea is a truly heart warming story abojt Harry's love for his sister and all that he sacrifices for her, oerhaos even a chance at love for himself. It would be a nice change from all the cold hearted political Harry's we see and hatred and resentment towards his siblings in other fics. Love was supposed to be a wonderful power and I want Harry to truly love his sister with all his heart.


** A prompt is supposed to give an idea, not the whole summary.

** This sounds more like you want a fic where she has a cognitive condition rather than one where she's blind. You seem somewhat misinformed on what it means to be visually impaired, to the point where I wonder what caused you to ask for this specific prompt, and I doubt Harry would play such a role for a twin if his parents were alive. A person with only visual impairment wouldn't need the intense level of care you mention. I genuinely believe him having provide it, even if she did need it, would lead to resentment, on her part or his, rather than the feelgood fic you want. You're literally asking for codependency.

Ngl the way you wrote this prompt felt so dismissive of the actual struggles disabled people face (including myself). Even fictional characters with disabilities deserve better than to be used only as a prop for a "typical" person's (in this case Harry's) development.

I kinda want to write a fic where she can no longer handle her brother treating her like an invalid and decides to never see him again because feelgood disability inspiration bs literally makes me sick.
