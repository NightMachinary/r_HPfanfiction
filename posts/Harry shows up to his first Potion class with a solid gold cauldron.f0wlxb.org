** If Harry thought that Professor Snape had disliked him a few minutes ago, he knew that he was truly hated the moment he pulled his cauldron from under the desk and set it down to brew. Dark eyes glittered from behind the greasy curtains of his hair like a dangerous beast glaring out of a cave, and the hiss made even Draco Malfoy wince and try to shrink himself smaller, as Snape stalked forward and loomed over Harry. A vein was twitching at Snape's forehead, and then the next word was scarily quiet.\\
"Potter."\\
"Sir?"\\
Harry knew that tone. It was the quiet that wasn't solved by mere shouting and a rough trip to the cupboard. He began to feel actually afraid. The classroom was so quiet, he could have heard a pin drop. Snape was absolutely still, other than his lips silently shaping the numbers one to ten, and his white-knuckled hand carefully pointing his wand, in jerky movements, down to the floor.\\
"I see that the Potter fortune was not diminished by your father's death, Potter," Snape said, in an almost pleasant tone. "How gratifying for you. And you have decided, in your infinite wisdom, to buy a solid gold cauldron and to attempt to brew a Cure for Boils Potion in it."\\
Harry swallowed. Perhaps this wouldn't be too bad. They had rules at school, didn't they? There would be shouting, Harry would lose points, but that all seemed inconsequential compared to the look Snape had given, and the way his hand had seemed to fight to point away from Harry's throat.\\
Snape turned away and moved back to the front. "Those of you who wish to hold onto your skin, move two desks away from Potter. Not you, Longbottom. We might as well kill two birds with one stone. Since you've spent so much, brought such a wonderful cauldron to show off to us all, let's see how skilled this progidy... this wonder of a wizard is, shall we?" He was looking at the Slytherins and gestured Crabbe a little further away.\\
Ron looked petrified, but he stayed close by.\\
"On your head be it," said Snape, his voice oily. "We have too many Weasleys in the school anyway."\\
Draco snickered. Harry noticed he had moved so far to the front that he was almost behind Professor Snape's desk, but Snape didn' seem to mind.\\
"You can borrow my cauldron," Ron said, pushing his rather battered-looking cauldron forward.\\
"Oh no, Weasley," said Snape. "Potter wants to show us what he can do, and we will let him." He smiled a horrible smile that didn't fit his face at all and slashed his wand at a point behind his back, so viciously that everyone ducked.\\
"The instructions are on the board," said Snape. "You have an hour left."

*** I really do love this passage, but gold is quite chemically inert, so I doubt it would interact much with a potion. It is possibly a better conductor of heat than pewter, so maybe that could cause the Cure for Boils to overheat and boil over explosively.

Sorry, science teacher nerd. I'll get back in my box now.

** I like to imagine that Gold Cauldrons are only used for making specific potions. Like Felix Felicis. That may be where the potion gets its gold tint from. It dissolves layers of the cauldron as it brews, incorporating it into the potion over time. Of course this would lead to the need for replacement cauldrons, but that could be a side note of the whole Cauldron Bottom Thickness thing that Percy was going on about in the 4th book. Maybe normally Gold Cauldrons are purposely made rather thick to allow more usage, but cauldron crafters purposely make them thin so you can probably get like 4 or 5 uses out of it before you gotta get a new one

*** If that were the case,it'd probably be easier to use a regular cauldron and drop in a couple of gold coins.

I'd suggest it's the opposite - some exotic potions in their partially-made state are so viciously caustic they dissolve right through the metal of regular cauldron. Only gold has the chemical (or magical) properties to resist this attack. As the potion is completed, it's properties change and it becomes safe to drink.

As gold cauldrons are never mentioned again (even Malfoy doesn't own one), it's possible they're specialist equipment that's only occasionally needed by highly experienced, professional potioneers doing very advanced work.

**** Maybe the gold cauldrons are needed because it evenly distributes the gold over time, whereas dropping the coins in would have it settle down at the bottom and probably leave little clumps of gold at the bottom that wouldn't dissolve in time. Or even a single coin would be too much gold for a potion, and it only shaves off enough gold from the cauldron to equal the same amount as half a teaspoon.

** “Mr Potter. Our new class.... idiot. Tell me, Mr Potter,” drawled Snape with a flick of his greasy hair, “what would you get if you brewed wormwood and asphodel in a golden cauldron?”

Harry shook his head meekly. “I don't know, sir.”

Snape sneered. "And if you were to mix ash wood and doxy eggs?”

Again, Harry didn't know.

“I think Hermione has the answer, Professor.”

“Well, Mr Potter," said Snape, ignoring Hermione bouncing in her seat with her hand raised, "If you had any sense and did not rely on your wealth and celebrity, you would know that a golden cauldron is used primarily as decoration, for the less cultured wizards who can't cook porridge let alone a potion."

Harry glanced to Malfoy whose smug face dropped slightly, though he sniggered to Pansy Parkinson next to him.

Harry nudged his cauldron away and offered it to Ron who stowed it away in his bag eagerly, as Hermione scolded him under her breath that he hadn't properly read the school requirements list.
