I recently read in a post that before JKR revealed that Blaise was male a lot of people actually thought of him as a female and wrote Harry/Blaise fanfics. He was sort of the prototype for Daphne Greengrass. Can anyone recommend me some good fanfics from that period? Only rule I hav is 'no harem'


** The website isn't coming up for me at the moment (502 Bad Gateway), but on [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], you can find three stories by Draco664: Apprentice Potter, Journeyman Potter, and Master Potter. The last time I checked, Master Potter wasn't complete, but the first two were.

I don't know if you'd consider it a 'harem' or not, but Harry is involved with Blaise and Hermione at the same time for part of the story arc.
