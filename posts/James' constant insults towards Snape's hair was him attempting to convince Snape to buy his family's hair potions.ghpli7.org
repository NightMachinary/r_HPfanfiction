Would be a fairly funny one-shot in my opinion


** James Potter had lived a very sheltered life before Hogwarts. His parents had had him rather late in life and consequently he had lived a very insulated and charmed life - even for an heir to a potions fortune. The main result of this was that he had socialised exceptionally little with children of his own age and it showed.

This "foot-in-mouth disease" (as Remus would fondly dub it in later years) seemed to manifest the most with one Severus Snape. For example, at the beginning of first year he once spent a good two minutes staring at the other boy in Greenhouse Three.

"What are you staring at, Potter?!" Snape said as snappishly as an eleven year old could.

"Your hair..." He replied absentmindedly. "It's /so greasy.../" He almost seemed in awe.

"I-it's potion fumes..." He turned red and muttered something about genetic pre-dispositions.

A more socially-literate child might have realised that between the angry blush, the greasy hair and the general air of neglect that perhaps they had accidentally hit upon a far deeper and more sensitive issue than hair care and should really shut up right now. James Potter was not that child.

"Nah. My Dad brews all the time and his never ends up like that." He scoffed. He brightened suddenly as an idea occured to him. "Hey, y'know what you should try -"

"- washing that greasy mop more than once a year, eh Snivellus!" Sirius interjected as he returned with a spare pot.

With a snarl, Snape turned about on his heel and stormed away.

"Grease Away Scalp Solution! Try Grease Away Scalp Solution with a little Conditioning Concoction! It will sort it out in no time!" James yelled after the increasingly mortified boy.

"Bugger off, Potter!" Snape yelled back.

"How rude! I was only trying to help," James exclaimed indignantly as Sirius silently died of laughter and Remus slapped a hand to his face.

Snape never forgot Potter's apparent condescension. His resentment was further exacerbated when Snape had a water-balloon full of Grease Away Scalp Solution dumped on his head later in the year by a well-meaning James. The fact that everyone kept complimenting him only made it worse. From that day forth, James Potter had an enemy that would last longer than his own lifetime; all that happened afterwards - Lily, pranking, and nearly getting killed by a werewolf were just icing on the cake.

*** Awesome!

I never thought of James' family biz, but it makes me wonder why he always had to use his hand to rumple his hair just right. You'd think they'd have a product for that.

** It truly wouldn't be the best idea. Insulting only leads to anger and hate, which would result in hating the person insulting you and, in consequence, their family.

But who said James was bright? Perhaps academically he is, but emotionally, hell no. ðŸ˜‚
