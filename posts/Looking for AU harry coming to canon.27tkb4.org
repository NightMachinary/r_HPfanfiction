I'm looking for any Recommendations for something like this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9250887/1/A-King-at-Hogwarts]] . Basically Harry from an alternate universe or some other fanfic comes to the canon universe.


** I've recommend this on the subreddit before, it's time travel, so I guess it counts as AU: Backwards Compatible by Ruskbyte. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594791/1/Backwards-Compatible][Link]]

*** Can also recommend and lament its unfinished status. There are some extremely satisfying parts of what's completed, though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts][Stunning Shifts]] has the reverse premise, in which Harry enters an AU universe and interacts with his counter-part, but you might be interested.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/20/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power][HP and the Elemental's Power]] has an AU Harry + an original character get caught up in a Time Turner accident, sort of, wherein they get moved to Canon. The story as a whole is quite cool, and this aspect of it was quite a fun read, but they do go back to their own dimension.

** There's the wonderful [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] which is dimension travel from AU to AU, where it's Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna. Some extremely funny moments, plenty of angst, and one of the rare ones where Luna is just right.
