Looking for two different themes this time guys if you would kindly help me?

1. I'm looking for fics that basically bash Dumbledore and the Weasleys. In the story, Harry discovers that Dumbledore paided off the Weasley's to be his friend and the family he found and formed a relationship with. Looking for fics specifically where Harry is paired with someone. Bonus points here if Harry is NOT paired with Hermione.

2. I'm also looking for fics taking place in Fourth Year, but Harry's name does not come out of the Goblet and there is NOT a fourth Champion. If you cant think of any of those fics, then by all means any good alternate fourth year fics would work. Again I'd prefer ones where Harry is paired with someone, and again bonus points if the pairing is not with Hermione, Ginny, or Fleur.

I'd really prefer no smut, but if its a necessity then as little as you can please.


** Sounds like a good story to me which probably why someone unfortunately thumbed it down.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Azkaban Parody) has a lot of 1. and it references a ton of fics in the chapters which are also the same genre.

  Azkaban Story! After reading so many Azkaban stories, I have decided to write a parody of my own. This is about how everyone is demanding that Harry forgive them for betraying him without actually asking. I am going for humor more than anything
