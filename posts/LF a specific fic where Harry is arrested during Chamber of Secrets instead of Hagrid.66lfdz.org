I think it was recommended here recently. Basically instead of arresting Hagrid, they arrest Harry "to be seen doing something. "

(Also, does LF mean "looking for?" That's the way I used it)


** It means Low Frequency. /snicker/

But Yes. And low fat. And line feed.

In any case, I don't know any where Harry is arrested halfway through the year in place of Hagrid after being exposed as a Parseltongue and being suspected of being the Heir of Slytherin.

I /do/ know a story where [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Harry mucks up the ending of Chamber of Secrets and destroys the Riddle memory's manifestation rather than the Diary]]; the spirit of Tom Riddle goes on to possess Lockhart and frame Harry as the Heir all along, sending Harry to Azkaban, Ron to St. Mungos, and leaving Ginny catatonic. Don't worry, Riddle!Lockhart's plans start slowly unraveling from the beginning and the story has a happy ending.

** I would be quite interested in reading a darker version of what you wrote sort of. If it explores Harry's arrival at azkaban, and the screams, his past, and the other death eaters in the prison who are sane enough to taunt him or threaten him.

  "The Ministry must be seen to do something", and with that, Harry Potter's wand is snapped. Expelled in his second year, he is invited to a new school famous for being the home of one of the Eight Great Repositories of Knowledge. But with Voldemort alive and the Chamber of Secrets still open, he will need every resource his new school possesses to stay alive in the coming years.
