Best stories you've read were Harry is a seer. I don't care if it's slash, het, or gen. As long as it's well written and the seer aspect of it is compelling and not cliche and dry. No character bashing An preferably finished or regularly updated


** linkffn(Written in Blood by siebenschlaefer)

linkffn(little seer by Huskywalker)

Those two are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

#+begin_quote
  The first war was won by Lord Voldemort. Harry, mercilessly used for his abilities by the rebels as a child, lives unnoticed as an assumed squib at Hogwarts. When an attack of the rebels endangers the Hogwarts students, his abilities are revealed, bringing him into the spotlight. With Dark Lords and Slytherins stalking him, and rebels trying to kidnap him, what should he do?

  Voldemort won the first war. Harry is happy to live as an unnoticed squib at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, visions and rebels don't allow that and Harry soon catch the attention of the dark lord.

** linkao3(The Emperor and the Star by wynnebat)

one of my favourite seer!harry fics. highly recommend for something light-hearted with some angst

linkao3(End without Sorrow by Aerlinniel)

unfortunately abandoned but I thought I'd link it anyway cause it is one of absolute favourites. goes deeper into divination theory

linkao3(Resurrection by Spork_in_the_Road)

in this one Harry isn't a seer but he does have a sort premonition/deja vu due to being resurrected. Might not fit your request but I'll recommend it anyway cause it's very well-written.

linkao3(Special Gifts by oldenuf2nb)

read this one years ago. It has a very interesting premise but the romance kind of dragged it down for me, also I'm not really a huge fan of clich√© drarry so maybe it's just that but maybe you'll like it. Also Harry is more of a medium than a seer.

linkao3(false prophets by tannintele)

This one is very eerie and dark but also kind of gorgeous. Harry is more of a clairvoyant instead of a seer so skip this one if you don't want that

linkao3(what happens to the heart by mossycoat)

Harry starts working for a seer and she trains him to be her apprentice. Mostly a romantic drarry story though with some angst.

EDIT: for some reason the fanfictionbot screwed up on the last one. here is the real link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25747555]]

  NEWT-level Divination student Harry Potter bullshits his way through a major arcana reading, best friend of the year Tom Riddle offers a marriage of convenience with no ulterior motives at all, and the wizarding world's changing future is much less important than the seventh years' love lives.

  He is the first seer the Potter family has ever had, but is it really as much of a blessing as it appears? Harry knows he has a chance prevent the horrors of the First Wizarding War from ever happening and set things right. Things don't go quite as planned, however, and Harry instead finds himself being part of a larger game with hidden rules. A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired pawn that is trying to survive the war that looms.

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after ‚Äúdying‚Äù in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.

  Harry is clairvoyant; a genuine one, not like that fraud Trelawney or Madam Umbridge, who claims that the dead communicates by writing messages in her cat's litter box. It isn't fun reliving the deaths of strangers, but when the antique shop next door is placed under new management, things get interesting.(Read prequel for context.)
