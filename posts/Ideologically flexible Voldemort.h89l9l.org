Looking for fics where Voldemort, as a certifiable psychopath with a lust for power, is not attached to his (current) extremest ideology and is flexible to adopt whatever will advantage him most.

Or basically one where he has no real strong connection to pureblood fanaticism, it is simply that he has no qualms with such a path and as long as that is the fastest/clearist path to accumulating power and arcane knowedge.

I think the best setup for this would be Horocrux!Voldemort, after possessing someone (Harry), decides that while he would have no problems going back to controlling the death eaters, the duel facts he is now embedded with "light" wizards and that if he went back he would have to compete with his other self makes doing so not worth it. Instead, he pursues becoming dumbledores apprentice and ruthlessly taking over the light faction, to get his power.

As opposed to all the mini horocrux volde's gather in room of evil and work together.

One of the ideas that has been kicking around in my head has been a ginnymort story where Diary!Volde ends up taking over Ginny's body in Chamber. My thoughts were if Volde found himself in a well established light family, the space to act on the other side taken by the prime version of him, that he would freely adopt whatever ideology that got him furthest, and if that meant opposing himself so be it. So (s)he decided to basically take over the light side.

I understand this is not canon compliant, as Volde is shown to be a bit of a true believer. Still, it seems interesting and wondering what has been written taking this approach.


** This isn't what you're asking for, exactly, but linkffn(The Imposter Complex by Notus Oren) is close enough to the example you gave.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** The only thing I can think of with this is an oneshot where the Sorting Hat goes back in time and resorts the Marauder gang (including others in that year). A muggleborn Slytherin ends up somewhat skilled with dueling and Voldemort doesn't let anything like a little ideological problem get in the way of recruiting useful minions.

  It's 1998, and Tom Marvolo Riddle has apparently won, so the Sorting Hat decides to travel back in time and *try* to do something about that. Alternate Universe results. Manipulative! Sorting Hat. One-off piece. Humour/Tragedy, rated 'M' for occasional swear-words or strong language. (Punctuation corrections, 9th March, 2014)

** I've begun writing a fic which has a /very/ similar Tom Marvolo Riddle (no ideological connection), though the setting is a rather different AU, where Tom Riddle realizes that there is a different way he can satisfy his need for power (it may not seem obvious, but there is a plot - it's just a long setup before you come to know /what/ exactly it is). Here, Tom Riddle didn't go directly into the Dark Arts. He instead pursued research in magic and became a famous researcher - as a result of which Dumbledore was rather happy to give the post of the DADA professor to him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, Tom is Deputy Headmaster and still scheming as one Harry Potter begins his first year at Hogwarts.

  Harry had heard tales of the great Dumbledore and the living legend Tom Riddle, but Dumbledore had passed away before Harry entered Hogwarts. Follow Harry's journey through Hogwarts with the mysterious and enigmatic Professor Riddle. AU based on what could have happened if Dumbledore had not declined Tom the post of the DADA professor.

** This is pretty much true in Methods of Rationality, but it's quite long, his mindset is only properly discussed late in the story, and opinions of it are very mixed. If you're interested in philosophy and rationally working toward goals, you might like it. It does have a lot of humour and some great Battle Magic classes.

Generally I recommend starting with the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.
