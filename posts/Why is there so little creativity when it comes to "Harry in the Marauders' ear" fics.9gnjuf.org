Basically, you have two and a half archetypes:

- Harry joins the Marauders, there are lots of pranks, cringeworthy nicknames, Pettigrew is bashed and there's a female equivalent group which is used to pair everyone with (that one also exists in regular Marauder era fics).

- Harry goes into "politics", hangs out with the Black family and spends time with Bellatrix, who hates him at first but it's ok since they will bang in the end. Also usually includes Lordships and Harry being heir to some long-gone family of great status.

- (Harry redeems/rescues Snape from his "path". Either Harry/Snape or Snape/Lily.)

While the average Hogwarts/post-war era fanfic does not offer more when it comes to creativity, there are many examples of creative plots. There's cracky stuff like "The silent world of Cassandra Evans" or some of the more emotional, eg "Dignity in fear", "Power of Love" series. But you also have stories like the "Sinistra Ward" series or even crossovers like "The Sea King", where Harry is a fisher in Alaska (or the Aleutian Islands).

Why aren't there more creative approaches to Harry traveling two decades back in time? I am not asking for authors to reinvent the wheel, but there has to be more than three or four plots.


** Because that kind of thing usually requires an original plot and writing those is very difficult for your average fanfiction writers.

*** I'm thinking about that, but my biggest issue would be Lily's initial reaction to Harry being who he is. I don't want some grand slow-burn, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9anphr/you_arent_james_time_travel_prompt/][so the plot is from my prompt a couple of weeks ago]] where Harry "dreams" that he has sex with a stranger (it's dark) after he died. The next morning, he wakes up, naked, next to his equally naked mother, who just wanted to forget everything after a fight with Petunia (get drunk, have a one-night stand).

I mean, Lily, at this point, has no feelings for Harry either way besides a slight dislike because he looks like James. And Harry has no experience with love (motherly or otherwise) either if you discount Cho.

**** I'm not entirely certain if anyone could pull off a realistic scenario without being a somewhat slow-burn. I feel that Lily would have to fall in love with Harry, not knowing the truth, and Harry tells her the truth because he sees what's coming and what's to cut off his own feelings as well. Then they drift back together anyway. I'd be somewhat put off if they both got over it quickly. Though I suppose you could portray Harry as not giving much of a fuck due to all the shit he's been through.

I've also thought about throwing Lily into Harry's time (dimension travel, I suppose) and have something go from there. I think it would be more difficult, though, as Lily would undoubtedly find out about herself as Harry's mother rather quickly. But man, I want to see Snape's reaction to another Potter getting with Lily.

I think I need to go outside.

I mean, just because they had a few rounds of drunken sex does not mean that they'd be in love. And teenagers do not need much of an excuse to become an item. I mean, I had a classmate who started dating some dude because she wanted to know how it feels to make out with someone who has a tongue piercing.

I was thinking about several ways the "morning after" could go, and the likeliest way would be for Harry to have a breakdown. He wouldn't care about the stigma of incest with his past, I think, but the fact that he can actually touch his mother would do the trick. Harry would babble out pretty much everything he knows (which would make things a lot easier, so I want this part to happen).

The question is how would Lily react. I know I wouldn't care if my bedmate turned out to be my time travelling daughter since I can't really comprehend the idea of having a daughter yet. But I'm also a 21-year-old only child, so my mileage may vary.

I'm not sure how to depict Dumbledore. From Harry's pov, Dumbledore just pissed a year away with home movies about Riddle's childhood, allowed Death Eaters into his school and didn't recognise that Snape was a traitor, so it would be logical to keep him out of the loop. At the same time, keeping Dumbledore informed makes a lot of stuff easier.

***** I have considered a dimensional traveling Lily for some time. Until now, it's generally Harry going to her dimension and kicking asses there, while she remains a quite useless parent with bad temper.

A badass Lily who dissed Voldemort in her world, but wished to have her child back, attempted a risky ritual and inadvertently ended up in the canon world, best in Year 5 or 6. The story can pick up from here.

It doesn't have to be Harry/Lily, a kickass mother-son duo (Sarah and John Connor?) can be a lot of fun too, and has NEVER (at least to my knowledge) been done in HP fanfics.

** And if Hermione goes back, she always gets shipped with someone from that era, with only a few exceptions.

I have a very different plot for Harry/Hermione time travel to Marauder Era:

- Since time travelers have only limited knowledge of this time (for example Horcrux locations are mostly unknown). perhaps it makes sense to keep the timeline intact until maybe around 1980.
- As a result, the traveler will completely remove him/herself from Britain. He/She will instead use their advance knowledge to make some good money in Muggle stock markets, preferably in America.
- The time traveler can use this competitive advantage to build up a powerful business and private army, made up of Muggleborns fleeing from Death Eaters in Britain.
- Of course, events in Magical Britain should still be followed closely. By late 1970s, it's probably a good time to send an anonymous tip to Dumbledore about Voldemort's Horcruxes and his Death Eaters.
- Give Dumbledore and his Order some time, and only intervene if they still suck as much as in canon.
- If they successfully defeat Voldemort, egg Barty Crouch on (bribe him with a small fraction of your now massive fortune, and send pieces of his Jr back to him whom you kidnapped a few months ago) to go totally merciless on any remaining Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to your knowledge.
- Once Death Eaters have been removed, try your best to incite another civil war between Dumbledore and the crazed Barty Crouch. Watching “fire across from the river” can be very satisfying, but make sure to save James, Lily, Sirius, and Remus.
- The end result should be pretty much the total destruction of Magical Britain's traditional establishment, and now you can move in as their ‘savior'.

This is, excluding hooking up with magical Nazis, the worst mistake when it comes to time travel and it would seriously fuck up the traveller since they condemned hundreds to death through their inactions. And Hermione would never let the Potters die, she cares too much about Harry to do that. She'd rather wait for Voldemort behind the door in Godrics Hollow with a shotgun at the ready.

**** I'm someone who utterly hates keeping the timeline in time travels, and I often emphasized this point in my comments.

However, if Harry and Hermione of early 2000s travel back to early 1970s, they will face significantly greater challenges than going back to 1991:

- No information about Horcrux locations
- Little information about enemy force composition
- Little knowledge about power structure of Magical Britain of that time

They can not carry out highly effective surgical strikes against Voldemort and his Death Eaters at this time. Picking off known Death Eaters of their time might derail Voldemort's progress somewhat, but also carry lots of risks to themselves.

On the other hand, they know a lot about what happened in late 70s, and that's why I propose to keep the timeline until that point, while building a massive power base (using their advance knowledge) somewhere outside Britain.

Lily's graduation in 1978 should be the point at which they have finished building their forces and ready to strike at Voldemort. Their opening move is to write an anonymous tip to Dumbledore about Horcruxes and their potential locations, in the perspective of a potential defector. This tip should also contain names of known Death Eaters.

Obviously, from that point on, the timeline will be totally messed up, and their active participation will be necessary.

** I agree with just about everything that the previous posters have said. I think that there's a lot of fear in changing the past so much that the future doesn't happen and lack of creativity.

For what it's worth, the one story I'm reading right now (and recommended in another thread recently) set in the Marauders' Era actually does avoid all these formulaic plot points. It has a Harry who's terrified of changing the future, so he tries to avoid everyone and pretends to be a squib (so that he doesn't go to Hogwarts). He travels back after 4th year, so he knows nothing of the prophecy, of horcruxes, of the Order. After about 70 some thousand words, there's been one short scene with James and Sirius, one short scene with Lily, no Snape, no Blacks. I like it because I really have no idea where the plot is going, but it's well done so far. I'm really curious to see if the author continues to make something new out of a worn-out trope.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel/AU cliché. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** It think that its partially because the nothing interesting actually happens then. Learning about the Marauders is important for Harry to grow as a person and provides a collective backstory, but Peters betrayal was the the only real turning point that we know of.

Another issue I think is that most writers weren't alive back then, and as we say "The past is another country". In part this perceived limitation is why so many fics stick to the wizarding world making the archetypes you mentioned all the more common.

*** All my stories are set before I was born, but that isn't really an issue with Google. And I bet that there are plenty of writers who didn't live in the UK in the 90s either.

And you had a civil war going on, there ought to be something interesting going on. Voldemort was on the brink of victory, there were events which lead up to it.

**** Its not a barrier if you want to do the homework, but it is a hurdle. One of the franchises greatest strengths was the repeatability of being an outsider in what was then mostly present day after all.

I completely agree that a civil war ought to be interesting, but the more I think of it the less it looks like a war. As far as I recall Voldermort didn't lead an army, he was more of a domestic terrorist and political mastermind. Reading about disappearances is rather different than pitched battles.

The only way I could really see it working would be a Life on Mars style Auror!Harry which would be interesting, but is beyond the ability of most authors (including me).

***** An asymmetrical war is still a war and Voldemort led high priority raids himself (final change, raid on Amelia Bones).

Look, if I can dig through Finnish weather archives to get an approximation of the Snow height near Inari in January 1997 or figure out how last names are gendered in Lithuanian to name a couple of Quidditch players for the world cup (there's a special form for married women, there are several combinations depending on which letter the last name ends on), a little bit of research isn't too much to ask for. I'm not expecting detailed description of the kitchen machines or vacuum cleaners of 1976, but the existence of the Soviet Union, the cold war and the current PM shouldn't be too much to ask for when it comes up. And most of the magical lore is made up either way.

** I read a French fanfic, "Amphisiologie", where the protagonist is a student at the same era as the Marauders'. The overall tone of the story is quite comical and absurd, and the protagonist at one moment basically says that she likes Pettigrew, that she's sure you could entrust your life to him. It's one of my favorite scene because the protagonist is obviously wrong, and it's different from all the other fics I read. If you can read French I really recommend this fic.

** Personally, if I read fics where Harry is traveling to the Marauder era, it's because I'm looking for the family drama aspects of Harry meeting his parents and stuff. Complex plots and politics can really take place in any time, so perhaps authors that are writing those plots just don't necessarily feel the need to push the time setting 20 years in the past? Just an idea, but I've never really thought about that lack of plot variety before!

*** But there are plenty of marauder era stories where he does not interact with them (pretty much anything with Snape or Bellatrix as main cast). And at 16, those were not his parents but only the people who would eventually grow up to be them. They might exhibit certain behaviours already, but the James of 1975 is hardly the James who took on Voldemort unarmed. And unless Harry changes stuff, his parents will die in a couple of years, so changing stuff should be the number one priority.

Hell, I'm thinking about writing a time travel story where the very first thing Harry does in 1977 is a drunken one-night-stand with Lily and the first thing he consciously remembers is waking up next to his mother, who is glad that she hasn't slept with James Potter. I'm pretty sure that this wouldn't fall into your definition of "family drama" either.
