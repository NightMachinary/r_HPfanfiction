I know there are a lot of fics out there where Ginny/Molly/Romilda/etc try to love potion Harry, and I vaguely recall a fic where it happens via a potions accident? but are there any fics where one of the characters love potions themselves on purpose?

This weird idea brought to you by the idea that Albus tells Harry that the Power of Love is what saved him, and its not like Harry paid the best attention in potions class to know that trying to force the feeling would be a bad idea...


** A crackfic featuring Harry dosing himself with love potions to fall in love with Voldemort sounds insanely fun. The whole plot could revolve around the various unsuccessful methods Harry employs to try to slip Voldemort a potion himself, so they could finally unite in destined soul bond love. Because let's face it, if anyone in the HP universe has a soul bond, it's Harry and Tommy.

And then Voldemort dies the moment he declares love for Harry, because of his mother's protection. Harry is devastated. Albus' dead portrait is supremely amused.

Hmm.

** I vaguely recall reading a Hermione centric story where she prepared or considered preparing a love potion for herself to force herself to want to be with Ron, but I honestly cant remember even the plot of it (it was a minor detail, but at least something exists?)

** I recall one with Ginny on her wedding day. She was crying because she was effectively forced into a marriage by circumstances beyond her control, and to mitigate the unpleasantness, she had three hundred sixty-five tiny vials of love potion attuned to her intended.

Of course, had it been any male character, the solution would have been to run away or staunchly refuse the marriage or some such. Even Ron -- though he might instead decide he's okay with a loveless marriage and not get sad. So while it was poignant, it's also kind of grating. I mean, /Ron/ wouldn't accept those circumstances; why was Ginny being meek and accommodating?

*** Can't remember what fic it was, but I read one where Ginny was in love with Harry, who got seriously involved with someone else, and so near the end there's a scene of Ginny in her wedding dress, getting ready to step out into the aisle, and right before she does she swallows a love potion she keyed to her groom (Michael Corner maybe), with the intent of sneaking the doses however regularly was necessary until that love was permanent. Clearly different circumstances, but in this case I kind of admired her for that.

** [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/2azsida7c4dj9xi/thedeathofnarcissablack.pdf?dl=0][The Death of Narcissa Black]] is a picture book someone made ages ago that was really good. It's depressing but well written. Stars Narcissa Black in her pre-Malfoy days.

** Part of the backstory in jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]] has (it's implied) Lily dosing herself in order to fall in love with James and, in the process, be able to position herself better in magical society. (I remember this distinctly because it was the first time I'd encountered the idea in fanfiction.)
