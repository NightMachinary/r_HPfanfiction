Are there any fics where bella breaks out of azkaban aligns her self with the light or grey and trains/ takes care of Harry?


** While it is a bit different from what you are asking, it is the closest I can come up with. The Child of Azkaban linkao3(15068012) features a Harry who, due to weird godfather magic, ends up getting teleported from the Dursleys into Azkaban to be raised by Sirius and the other inmates, and the wizarding world doesn't notice until his Hogwarts letter is addressed to Azkaban. Bellatrix considers herself his aunt and does train him some, though it isn't a major component from what I recall.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** This is a bit of a scary thought. Just imagine how absolutely bonkers Harry would have been.

** Obligatory no light or grey exists in canon.

That said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274529/1/An-Old-and-New-World]] fits your prompt well. Full version can be found at [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=an+old+and+new+world&sort=title]].

** I can't remember what they were called, but I can vaguely remember at least two fics of that type, shouldn't be too hard to find if you filter for stories with Harry and Bella. There are bugger all stories with them both tagged after all. (Sadly even less as a pairing, which is what I was looking for when I found MotherBella stories)
