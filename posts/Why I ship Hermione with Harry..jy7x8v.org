** I don't want to be that gal, but I am not a fan of these types of topics because they almost always end up in some form of argument. It's unnecessary. You ship what you want to ship. That's all there is to it. People ship Harry with Daphne and they had 0.5 interactions throughout all seven books if I remember correctly. That probably wasn't even a real interaction. Hell, I've started shipping Harry with Lavender because they are so much fun to write with my headcanon. I still like Harry with Ginny a lot as well.

People ship what they want to ship. This really shouldn't be that big of a deal.

** You're on a roll and I've been very bored

#+begin_quote
  Harry And Hermione Never Argue
#+end_quote

Because Harry literally did his best to avoid the task. He would lie or just stay quite until she was finished reprimanding then he'd do what he wanted.

  Everyone Expected It

Didn't see it in the 1st, but I definitely noticed in the 3rd. Hr/R and H/G were obvious by GoF.

â€‹> Because J.K. Rowling Said So

No, she said Harry might have been better for Hermione. She never said Hermione would've been better for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  a deep connection of trust and understanding exists between Hermione and Harry
#+end_quote

Harry lies to Hermione in almost every book.

#+begin_quote
  They Share A Muggle Past That Ron Couldn't Possibly Understand
#+end_quote

And one Harry wants to forget.

** Relationships shouldn't be based on logic. If Harry and Hermione get together - it should be because they fancy each other. Nothing else. Not because "they never argue" or "share Muggle past" or "they understand each other" - all these are nice to have and sign of good friendship and mutual respect. Doesn't mean they have to get together.

While I hate Harry/Ginny personally - at least canon relationships were based on attraction, not how many pros/cons each pairing had for being together.

Having said all this - if you like that ship - you do you. Just don't over think this.

** "Harry And Hermione Never Argue"

Except all those times they argue I guess

"who honestly believed that Hermione would ultimately end up with Ronald Weasley from the very first book? "

Me from literally their first interaction

"seemed more than likely that Hermione and the main protagonist, Harry Potter, would be endgame"

And thank fuck it wasn't . Protag gets girl is always boring as shit

" He also never had any problems with being accepted by others"

Except when like half the school sings about how poor he is

"Even the characters in the books, including Albus Dumbledore, were convinced something was going on between Harry and Hermione"

When was that ?

"Hermione never second-guesses Harry"

Except in 6th Year

"Knows first hand what it's like to live without parents."

LMAO no she doesn't

The only people who did were Slytherins, specifically Malfoy's group. Which really isn't half of the school.

Firebolt for one

"Lol okay. I guess you were a minority"

I really doubt that given that Romione is of the main pairings in the biggest media franchise ever.

This is why no-one likes Harmonians

She had a valid reason for that, and most importantly she was concerned for his safety. Even Harry realised that she had the best intentions at heart.

************ Harry didn't argue much with Hermione because he kept a lot to himself. I am going to list the thoughts and attitude Harry had towards Hermione.

PS: She's an annoying bossy know-it-all

CoS doesn't really count since she is petrified for half the year and the rest she is kind of OK.

PoA: she tells McGonagall about the FIrebolt. Harry always sides with Ron.

GoF: when Ron and Harry fight, it's actually stated in the books Harry prefers Ron's company over hers.

OotP: she is the constant target of his lashes.

HBP: Harry is constantly annoyed with her nagging him about the book of the Prince and not believing him about Malfoy. He is even grateful to Ginny when she calls her out on her behavior.

DH: Harry is pissed with her for being a bad cook, for crying over Ron, for destroying his wand (even if she did it by accident while saving his life), for not talking to Ron and for refusing to believe in the Hallows.

Hermione, while she has Harry's best interests at heart, can be quite petty. She refuses to believe his theory about Malfoy. She constantly nags him about the book of the Prince when Harry proves himself better at potions than her. In OotP she completely oversteps him by convincing everyone to join the DA with the promise that they'll hear Harry's story even though he wasn't ready to share it. In GoF she nags him about joining SPEW to the point Harry joins just to get her to shut up. In PoA, she doesn't even inform him about the fact that she reports the Firebolt to McGonagall.

On the other hand, while they bicker a lot, Ron always stands by her. Even against Harry (who doesn't do the same), who is actually quite nasty to her.

Finally, Harry and Hermione may share a Muggle background. True. But Hermione comes from a loving family from what we gather in CoS, while Harry just wants to get the fuck out.

I don't think the trio should have been in any romantic relationship with each other and what JK said was simply fan servicing and Ron is definitely the glue sticking the two together. Their fallouts are not so violent because they are not as good friends amongst themselves as they are with Ron, who is the guy always around but when he turns on you, it really hurts.

Also your arguments seem to come mostly from the movies and not from the books. Initially I didn't want to debunk all your buzzfeed-like article styled arguments, but the fact that you were so nasty to the user above prompted me to revisit it.
