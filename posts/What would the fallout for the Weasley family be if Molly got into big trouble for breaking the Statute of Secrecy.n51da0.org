** Well if it happened once and it was rather small, I think it would be a slap on the wrist or a fine would be the solution. Then depending on who in the paper gets wind of it. That could be a thing.

When Ron did it Arthur faced an inquiry from his job because it was his car. And I think there was a fine.

*** This.

Also, Ron and Twins' rescue of Harry from the Dursleys was a much greater potential violation of SoS, flying a car through a relatively dense Muggle neighborhood.

**** Yes but the didn't get caught, well they did by the Dursley's but they already knew about magic.

Not to sound too much like the Twins but did you really commit petty crimes if you never got caught for them? Lol

Edit: I had a second thought. I'd argue that what Harry and Ron did was way worse then what the Twins and Ron did. They flew it in the middle of the night, in a suburb. where Ron and Harry was Central London during the day.

***** Harry and Ron were seen by Muggles, while the Twins and Ron were not. That automatically makes it worse regardless of the circumstances.

** I think Molly wouldn't get in trouble. As far as I remember, she was yelling "... packed with Muggles--". Muggles don't know what she was on about, so at most they would think she's a weirdo.

And I like to think wizards would have the sense to put a Muggle Repelling Charm on the barrier.
