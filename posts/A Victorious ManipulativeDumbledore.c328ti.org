Preferably from his POV. We always see the Dumbles-bashing trope where he's a secondary antagonist and in the way of Indy!Harry before being outmaneuvered, exposed, and brought to heel. For a change of pace, let's see the stories where Dumbledore is the one doing the outmaneuvering. Bring on the fics where Dumbledore's machinations bear fruit and he reaps a harvest beneficial for both him and FOR THE GREATER GOOD!

Thanks in advance!

*** Dumbledore fucking died. He didn't gain anything. And since when did Dumbledore still have the mentality of Greater Good. He abandon the mentality the moment he "killed" his sister. wtf is wrong with this community.

**** Yeah he died, but his plan still was directly responsible for voldemorts defeat. And he abandoned grindelwald's idea of the greater good when ariana died, but in practice he still literally sacrificed harry for the greater good. Also dude chill a bit, were all fans of hp or we wouldnt be here so really no need for the insults my dude.

And that's a bad thing because...

#+end_quote

Which is the only way to defeat him because Harry is too weak arse to be called the chosen one and Dumbledore love Harry too much to make him a super soldier. Does. Not. Mean. He's. Evil.

Call him manipulative whatever you want, don't try to make other see it as a bad thing let alone evil.

I will never insult anyone if they weren't such a small minded fanatic of a certain character they hate.

If they wanna write ff of a character who is the opposite of they should be in canon. Go ahead. It's called fanfiction for a reason. I encourage it. It's for fun.

But if they decide to force it to become canon, not headcanon but literally HP Canon, Dumbledore is evil or Ronald Weasley is a jealous git or Molly is a literally a bitch. That's just pissed me off.

Edit: also what does Dumbledore gain from the war even if he's still alive? NOTHING.

****** Oh dude, sorry if I gave off the wrong impression, I dont think Dumbledore is evil at all, OP was talking about a victorious manuplitive Dumbledore and I was bringing up that canon Dumbledore filled that role pretty well. Never meant to assert the guy was some evil puppet master or something

** Sounds like a rather horrible time of fanfiction reading.

What would be the point? He did that in canon, and even sacrificed himself to ensure his plan continued correctly. Sounds like the story would be rather poorly written and totally nonsense like What Was Your Plan. It would only be written to go against the stream, and there could be no pay off. The evil guy wins, and then literally nothing can happen after that.

It's only horrible if done wrong. Which admittedly is much easier to do than getting it right. For me, I find it hard to believe that canon Dumbledore is really manipulative only because I realize that the series started out as a Roald Dahl-esque children's story and evolved into a young adult series, with JKR not quite making sure everything lined up correctly. Because of this, I'd rather read something where Dumbledore is actually manipulative and is successful in doing so, because we see a lot of unsuccessful manipulative Dumbldores currently.

#+end_quote

A well-written story is its own payoff, regardless if the protagonist is good or evil. To me the whole appeal of fanfiction is to see all the different possibilities that could take place using a familiar universe.
