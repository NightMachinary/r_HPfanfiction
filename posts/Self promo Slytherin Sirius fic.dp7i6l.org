Would like to promote my own fic here from AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16993962/chapters/39948861][Let Slip the Dogs of War]]. It involves Slytherin!Sirius but doesn't "soften" him like I've seen most Slytherin Sirius fics do which is a pet peeve of mine. Also it contains extensive stuff about being a werewolf from Remus' POV if anyone's interested in that kind of thing.


** Sounds interesting. I might check it out.
