I've noticed that many stories tend to try rationalizing the magic. Magical cores are a good example of this, since they impose a sort of limit or scale on the characters. Similar to power level scouts in dbz.

However, one of the main strengths of HP (I think) is that the magic is vague with no direct logic behind it. This is of course tedious for writers who want to explore and come up with their own stuff.

For those who don't know, this kind of thing is mostly a scale between what is usually called a hard and a soft magic system. It's a term coined by Sanderson and there are a bunch of resources online so I won't get into it too much.

The gist of it all is this: For the magic to be the solution to the characters' problems, said magic must be understood.

You'll notice that we get direct exposition and foreshadowing in HP to understand the solutions the Trio use to defeat Voldemort, whilst stuff like dish washing charms and potions are loosely defined (and by that I mean that we know what they do, but we don't know how / why and more importantly the limitations said spells may have.)

We know that intent is crucial component, but that might as well mean nothing since we also know that incantations and wand movements play a role.

In the end we get a rather soft magic system that functions like a black box. (Do stuff, ???, stuff happens)

Which creates the problem I kinda want to rant about.

Ff writers keep trying to create rules to a system that can't inherently sustain them. This leads to magical cores, light and dark magic, soul magic and various other tropes that have no meaning in the context of most stories.

This allows for a lot of creativity but at the same time it stifles the whole concept of magic. Magic should by definition be impossible to quantify. The core tenet should be that everything is possible with magic, as long as the caster is capable of doing it.

Don't spend time trying to define it, unless it plays a direct role in the solution of whatever issue your characters need to resolve. The main reason this bothers me, is because so many stories have over inflated word counts and tons of dry exposition and get hampered down in their own attempts to tell a coherent story.

What's your opinion on this?


** The problem is that JKR /did/ define (some of) her magic and it is a major component to the stories. Also Sanderson defines the HP world as sitting in the middle ground of soft and hard magic, with certain things being well defined but overall is vague. The problem ff writers fall into is that unless they are using the exact same magic that was used in the books to solve problems - the "hard magic" - they will automatically be treading into a territory that they need to explain for the story to make any sense. The HP universe does have limitations and rules about magic, and if ff writers want to create a believable or immersible story, they need to put some kind of explanation for their new magic, they just need to find the sweet spot between necessary exposition for a story and info dump.

To be fair those listed have support from canon.

Some sort of magic core/how powerful you are is in canon, as much as people hate acknowledging it. It isn't very defined, but it is clear that there is some system in place to determine how powerful you are or how much magic you can put into a spell. In book canon, off the top of my head, the elder wand and "exceptionally strong Confundus Charm" in GoF.

There is light and dark magic, but it appears that a majority associate this with good and evil, when in the book it doesn't do that. Almost every character in the book uses dark magic as defined by JKR. It's really only the Dark Arts that are evil.

Soul magic, there are hints of it in the book such as when Riddle speaks about his experience when the AK rebounded or the horcruxes.

*** Not really, for the first two.

A 'powerful' mage is used hand-in-hand or synonymously with skilled, talented or knowledgable. Dumbledore is powerful- because he is exceptionally skilled and learned. The confundus in Goblet is powerful because it was well-cast, not because the caster drank their magic protein shakes that morning. Consider Lockhart- he was very skilled at memory erasing. His spells could erase years of a person's life (including his own entire life). By reasonable definition, that's a very powerful obliviate. But was Lockhart a powerful wizard in any other respect? Would his stunners have been anything to sneeze about, simply by virtue of being cast by him? No, as much as he'd like to say otherwise. Or Harry- when he learns and trains in new spells, the focus is always on practicing the technique and learning the theory, not on pumping out repetitions or increasing the difficulty. That is, his shield charm becomes more powerful, because Harry got better at casting it, not because Harry got stronger.

'Light' magic is never used as a term (other than literally, I suppose, with Lumos). There are some spells that have been fanoned into being Light magic- the patronus for example- but that is not a canon term. Simply- we don't know exactly what Dark magic or the Dark Arts actually are. At times they're used as a social/legal descriptor: bad/evil, dangerous/harmful, criminal/illegal. Other times specific attributes seems to be applied: hard to heal, very intent/emotion based, possibly damaging to the caster's soul in some way... but in any case, there's no category of Light magic that stands in opposition or counter-part to Dark magic. At best, the definition we're given is just, Dark magic and not-Dark magic, ie. everything else.

Soul magic, though- yes absolutely that's a thing.

That is mostly fanon, or at least I don't remember it being anywhere in canon. That also says nothing about the elder wand, or AK requiring a powerful bit of magic (also canon), nor about the boat in HBP detecting magical power. Canon hints very heavily at there being some measure thing for how powerful someone is. I'm not saying it's not skill, talent or knowledge. It could be all those, but there is clearly something more that "ranks" (for a lack of a better term) how powerful you are.

I don't discount that, but again that has nothing to do with the elder wand. The elder wand's purpose is to give more power than any other. It is "a wand more powerful than any in existence." How can it be the most powerful wand in existence if there isn't some sort of structure in place to determine power. As a hypothetical: Maybe it's something like better at channeling all types of magic. If that is the case, then there could also be wizards who are better at channel types of magic and they would be more powerful in that type of magic. That would still be some sort of "magical core." The idea of magical core is just almost always executed poorly and it seems like most people like pointing at the fact that there is no power ranking within the books.

Expanding past book canon and including Pottermore. Portraits "he degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends not on the skill of the painter, but on the power of the witch or wizard painted."

So honestly, yea canon does support some sort of magical core/power ranking.

I never said it was used as a term, but it is hinted at and been defined by JKR as I stated. Taking JKR's definition of dark magic, which doesn't conflict with the books or anything else, it is magic that harms. If there is dark magic, there should be light magic, or I guess at bare minimum, neutral. There are "dark creatures" as well so it shouldn't be a surprise that there is dark magic.

Again, it is never explicitly stated, but there is support canon for both of them and didn't just come straight from out of nowhere.

This is a terrible comparison, because in Dragonball Z these numbers are entirely esoteric and just flair. They are exactly not there to 'rationalize' things, they are more like the esoteric/transcendental magic in JKR's Potter universe. If you had to make that kind of determination DBZ would be decidedly "soft magic". Just having numbers involved doesn't make it 'hard'. There's a good reason why "It's over 9000!!!" became such a meme (it's silly!).

So you don't believe in 'hard magic' at all? Well I politely but vehemently disagree: Of course you can quantify a magical system and make it reasonable. it's just not easily done by just attaching numbers to things.

**** Oh okay. Yeah, but then your whole argument is kinda a strawman.

A magical core can very well used to make a magical system 'harder', which is why I sometimes defend the concept of magical cores (it can give limitations to the magic or as you stated make the magic 'understood'). The vast majority (>90% of fanfictions) don't use them for that purpose at all.

They don't add these things because they want to follow Sanderson's laws of magic, but because they want to put a number/expression to how awesomely powerful their protagonists are (exactly like DBZ).

This has nothing to do with hard vs soft magic.

***** No. A magical core does not make a magic system harder because it is then subject to whatever the author wants it to be. “Oh Harry has cast 15 AKs but he's got dem big dick core so he can cast another 10. But when he reaches his limit, he casts another last one because of willpower” /s

This also trivializes magic, makes it seem like a sort of fuel, and introduces a bunch of issues like what do spells cost? Who decides these costs? What's the penalty for not being able to satisfy said cost, etc?

Obviously it can be done right. I also like the concept, I just hate the half assed execution of it all.

I don't think this discussion is very fruitful.

You want to discuss concepts, but then talk about execution. Color me confused.

Have you never heard of mana? This is one of the most common magical systems for anything that involves 'hard magic'. How can you be so stumped by the idea? This is not exactly rocket science.

** the reason hard magic exists is so that there's a story. In the end, magic is power, and if it is limitless than your character is infinitely powerful. There's a word for that, and that word is godlike. Not to knock godlike!character stories but well... they're boring. They have no struggle. They can wave their wand and make their problems go away instantly. And nobody wants to read that.

tl:dr there is a damn good reason calling someones character op is not a complement
