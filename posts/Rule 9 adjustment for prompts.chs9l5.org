I've noticed on quite a few prompt threads that people keep nitpicking prompts.

Is there a way we can add that to rule 9?


** I'm not sure that's a good idea.

It sucks when people pop into a prompt thread just to say "OP's idea sucks", but more often the discussion is on-topic and welcomed by the OP. It's extremely rare for prompts to actually get fulfilled, so discussion is often all that you see in those kinds of threads. Expanding rule 9 might give people the wrong idea that that kind of thing is discouraged, and then we'd just end up with prompt threads looking like ghost towns.

*** Perhaps constructive criticism only.

Sometimes, you get people arguing about whether it's in character, when this is a fanfiction forum.

Those are not mutually exclusive, you know. If someone suggests a prompt where Harry starts to sleep around after being cheated on, discussing how Harry would react will improve fic quality since there is a difference between going out to bars to score some and pulling Barney Stinson-esque ruses to get laid. The first would be in character, the second not so much.

Also, a lot of fanfics are canon-compliant and should therefore also be canon-characterisation-compliant. And people also enjoy seeing how the canon characters they have grown to love react when thrust into a new situation. Those fics should also mostly be in character, only diverging when it is justified by what has happened in the story or by what the premise changed.

***** The thing is that it isn't constructive though.

Suppose I ask for a prompt where Snape and Harry talk about Harry's mother. It's definitely not in character for canon Snape or Harry, but is criticism of said OOCness neccessary?

****** Yes, because there might be the possibility to set up such a situation without too much OOCness. For example, Harry dosing Snape with Veritaserum to find out if he deliberately hesitated when calling the Order before the DOM battle, Dumbledore putting his foot down and telling Snape and Harry to talk about it, a third party (eg McG) telling Harry about his mother and something related to Snape, which he then corrects.

******* Is that up to the prompt poster though? Part of the reason for the prompts are the varied responses.

I'd pleasantly surprised by that sort of reply and I feel putting too many conditions hinders the responses.

** Yeah you're right, what this sub needs is to discourage criticism and contradicting opinions.

In rule 9 it is said that there is the possibility to make a discussion post to discuss types of fics requested, it would be nonsensical to ask to create a new thread to discuss a prompt since it's really only a reply to the author of said prompt anyway, so it's either letting peoples 'nitpick' your prompts or straight-up censoring.

**** If you come to a threat to tell OP that his idea sucks as much as their mother, that is unnecessary and against the rules. But if you show up and say "your idea does not make sense due to x, y and z", that is very much constructive criticism and shows the OP what issues they need to work around before their concept makes sense and can be expanded upon.

***** I disagree. Prompts are not synopses. They are a place for a base idea, which the people who reply then expand into a short story.

Someone saying XXX character is canon personality, but uses love potions. Well, then you'd have to clarify about their ethics (although I would personally avoid posting to that thread).

** Pointing out that a prompt doesn't make sense because of in universe context isn't a bad thing and promotes discussion.

Like in your prompt for Harry going to Snape in year 2 for help in DADA. He wouldn't do that, at all it doesn't make any sense for his character and I pointed that out to you in the thread, but I never flamed you for your idea.

*** Nah, I was fairly unclear on my prompt. I totally get where your complaints were coming from.

I wanted a prompt where both Snape and Harry despise Lockhart to a degree that their mutual hatred of each other is minor in comparison.

In canon they would have never done so, but that's why I'm writing a prompt.

Funny thing is that I'm thinking of someone else's prompt where the first poster just nitpicks a single action.

**** when you write fanfiction you still need to pay attention to characters and how they act in canon their is a reason we have the trope of Canon Character OC where people turn a character like Harry into an OC by removing what makes Harry, Harry.

It's also why character bashing doesn't work.

***** While that's true (that character bashing doesn't work), some of the best fics have altered the characters' personalities completely, but manage to do so in fun, refreshing ways that captivate the readers. E.g., The Seventh Horcrux, which is arguably one of the most recommended fics on this subreddit, yet Harry/Voldemort is completely OOC. It's crack, but still, the point stands that it was a fic a lot of people liked, that is broadly considered to be quite good, yet completely discarded their canon counterparts' original personalities. So, to sum it up, I don't really agree with the argument that characters have to behave like their canon counterparts, and I don't think there was really anything wrong with OP's prompt.
