In canon, Arthur and Molly's children are, from oldest to youngest, Bill, Charlie, Percy, the Twins, Ron, and Ginny. It's an AU where, for example, they were born Ginny, the Twins, Ron, Charlie, Bill, and then Percy. So Ginny's the oldest, and is off playing professional Quidditch, Ron is a prefect (and probably much less strict then Percy) during Harry's first year, Percy gets possessed by the diary Horcrux as an 11-year-old, Bill takes Ron's place in the Golden Trio, etc. This is just one potential reordering. Even just switching Bill and Charlie and no one else could hypothetically have major effects (Charlie's a few years older and potentially more responsible, maybe he refuses to break the law and come get Norbert, Hagrid ends up getting fired) So mixing up all of them could wildly change how the books go.


** Ginny, the Twins, Ron, Charlie, Bill, and then Percy.

Interesting idea and I like the order you chose.

Ginny would work well as the oldest playing professional quidditch.

The twins could be living at home or in a small flat, running a mail order business while saving up for their shop.

Ron the perfect is one of the more interesting ideas. Ron's inadequacy with the success of his older brothers plus his resentment for living with hand me downs wouldn't be as big of a factor in his personality. I imagine that he would be rather like a mix of Bill and canon Ron. He'd be a cool older brother that wanted to make head boy to prove himself (I'm assuming that his desire to do so would remain, even without the canon comparisons to his siblings) and would probably also be playing quidditch as keeper. I'd expect he'd have played a lot with both Ginny and the Twins being quidditch players too. The eldest three, beaters, chaser, and keeper. Could even have a fun rivalry with Ron intending and feeling confident in joining the Chudley Cannons and leading them to victory against his sister.

I debated whether switching the order of Bill and Charlie as you have them would be interesting or not, but I think what you have works best. Charlie takes the Seeker position in his third year and takes Harry on as his protege. It loops the "third child slot" into the story earlier than canon, where Fred and George have milder roles until they introduce the map and start selling joke products. He can be asked for help about Fluffy and Norbert given his predilection for creatures and his interactions with Hagrid/escapades in the forest would be really fun to read.

Bill as the second youngest is actually the hardest to visualize. Personality wise I don't know what we'd see. If we'd see as much of the resentment of poverty as Ron had, if he'd still be academically inclined, if he'd still want to be a curse breaker. In a lot of ways I figure he'd be pretty similar to Ron, which feels a bit like a cop out, and thought would have to be given on how different Bill would be as the second youngest rather than the oldest.

I would write Percy as the baby of the family in a way where he's a smart, precocious, and rule following boy that wants to work in the ministry like his dad. He probably feels slightly offended that none of his siblings want to be like Arthur and is a bit of a daddy's boy. I also think his precociousness would result in a lot of condescending love from his siblings. They don't take the littlest with his dreams and his rules seriously, just smile and pat his head. Would probably end up as a really engaging character as he grows as long as he isnt railroaded down canon Percy's character arc.

*** Bill is a curse breaker in Canon, in this universe he could be the one finding hidden passages, even ones that aren't on the map (yet).

He could play a bigger role in the Horcrux hunt. Even though he might not be a *trained* cursebreaker. Give him somewhat of a knack for it. Or maybe he's a prodigy, like Ron & chess. Might be interesting!

*** Only problem I have with Ginny being the oldest is that she would be presumably less tomboyish then canon, perhaps with no interest in quidditch. Also let's just ignore the fact that Arthur and Molly had 7 kids because they were either very bored or really wanted a girl.

**** Its possible yes that Ginny's interest in Quidditch was due to having six older brothers, four of which played, but an interest in sports is not a gendered interest. Quidditch isn't a "boys club" that only tomboyish girls dare enter. I personally wouldn't describe canon Ginny as being tomboyish in the slightest either. Also we have no indication that Arthur and Molly kept popping out kids until they got a girl. They are a big family and happy with the size of their family. I don't see any indication in either of them that they would have preferred or chosen a smaller family if they could.

****** Maybe as seekers or keepers, but female beaters and chasers are odd. Baseball or cricket aren't sports that require a very high level of general athleticism, especially pitchers/bowlers and batters are relatively stationary roles, and still women can't compete with men generally. Of course every single semi-professional and up woman playing either is better at it than a random untrained male, but Quidditch is played professionally, not just recreationally.

************* Not special /Quidditch/ magic, but /flying/ magic - a broom is as much a magical implement as a wand, and is equally useless in the hands of a Muggle or squib.

And yes people rarely think about it but Quidditch is frankly far more about flying ability than it is about sheer physical skill - think /equestrianism/, not contact ball sports like basketball or football. In fact, the closest real-world sport to compare with Quidditch would be polo, a similarly mixed-gender sport where your horse's breeding, constitution and training (and your synergy with it) can make or break your plays.

Or even if he was in Percy's place, somewhere in the middle. That'd still have him thinking what to do in life, but maybe not as insecure about it.

Having Ginny not be the youngest in general could be rather interesting. Say Percy, Fred, George, and Ron have a cool older sister in Ginny, how their dynamics might change.

Seeing how an older Ginny would react to Harry, instead of being the I have a crush on you type, she could be someone really cool that has a lot of rule breaking stories and willing to help them out from time to time (if she's still in school).

He still gets noticed as having talent and is brought in as a reserve seeker to train up ready to immediately take over when Charlie leaves or needs to cut games and focus on his NEWTs. How does Harry change as a character if he's got an older student acting in a close mentorship capacity? Could be an interesting way to adjust his character early to be more assertive, more confident, more outgoing.

Having an opportunity to learn and practice being a part of the team under more experienced players, developing that aptitude into talent before actually playing would be amazing for him. He could play a match or two if Charlie was injured helping Hagrid wrestle some creature in the forest or given detention for sneaking into the forest himself. Maybe as his skills grew Charlie would step down after his fourth year to focus on his Owls and let Harry play starting his third year.

***** Good point. I did like the idea of Prefect Ron though. I don't think shifting Ron to third year would do much for him, though potentially shifting him to Charlie's position would work well. He'd be graduating at the same time as Tonks and could potentially join the Auror academy at the same time as her. Actually, that would work really well. I could see a second oldest Auror Ron being in a relationship with Tonks. It could also bring her character in sooner than 5th year.

5th year prefect seeker Charlie would also make more sense for seeking help with Fluffy and Norbert, as he'd be much more approachable than Percy was. Though while I feel like goofy 3rd year Charlie would totally be on board with Fluffy and Norbert, prefect Charlie might be more responsible.

I even know how the quartet can get together as friends on Halloween: someone (doesn't really matter who) badmouths Hermione, setting her off to the girl's bathroom, and Harry brings up how he's worried to the Twins, who, having served detention with Filch a week prior, pull out the map to help find her, only to see that there's a troll in the hallway, lumbering towards her position. The three race off, right as Quirrel arrives in the Great Hall, and through the use of some rudimentary, still-being-tested joke potions and Harry casting Leviosa (we want the twins to show off their own stuff, so Harry gets to be the unoriginal prat), the troll is defeated. While Harry quails a bit when the professors show up, the Twins' confidence and propensity for showboating pulls the spotlight to themselves as they talk up how great they are "and Harry helped a bit!"

Hermione asks how they found her so quickly, the map gets explained, ane despite her usual Rulefullness, she immediately sees its value, and starts researching what she can on its enchantments (she doesn't have a side project like looking up Flamel yet, after all).
