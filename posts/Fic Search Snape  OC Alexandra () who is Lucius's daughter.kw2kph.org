:END:
Hey y'all - I'm looking for a pretty old fanfic that I first read on Mugglenet Fanfiction back in...2010ish, I think? I /think/ it was called *Child of Darkness*, but I can't be terribly sure about that.

I barely remember the plot, but a scene that stands out in my mind is the main OC, Alex (I think?), is captured by Voldemort, who then orders Lucius to "defile her" and Lucius protests, saying, "She is my daughter." So Voldemort makes Snape do it instead, which he does to preserve his double agent status.

I've tried looking on MuggleNet Fanfiction but it seems the fic was taken down, because there's no fic called Child of Darkness on there. I also tried doing tailored google keyword searches, but I got no results, so I'm wondering if perhaps the author took it off the internet completely. But does anyone know the fic I'm talking about?
