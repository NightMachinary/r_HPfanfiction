  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.

** There's one that's a groundhog day type scenario where he keeps traveling back over and over again that involves Cedric. Does that sound like it might be it? If so, I'll track it down
