Looking for fics that feature a muggleborn character who internalizes anti-muggleborn prejudice and feels in some way inherently inferior due to their blood status.

(Usually, the only muggleborn who gets much focus is Hermione, and she almost always sees prejudice against muggleborns as simply an injustice to be corrected without internalizing any of it. Requesting this because I have my own internalized stuff and I'd like something relatable.)


** That is partially how Hermione starts out in my story "The Dark Lord Never Died", after having been raised in a Wizarding Britain ruled by Malfoy.

*** It really is a great fic, and as an avid Ron defender I really liked how you used him in your story.

** Oh! I actually know a story that does this! I can't remember the name but I know that people on here are good at finding fics based off descriptions so-

Warning Dark Harry Potter fic and a ship fic but a really well written one, I can't remember if it was ever finished or if it was abandoned so keep that in mind.

In the fic Lord Voldemort never dies in the first place because Harry is a sqib and so he goes after Neville. Harry is sent away from the war to the Dursley household by Lily and James who hope desperately for him to be safe in the muggle world even going so far as telling Petunia about Harry being a squib.

Eventually though its found out that Harry does have some magic, he's a seer, so the order go to find him in hopes that his ability might be able to save the all.

I can't remember the exact details of what happen after that but I know that Harry winds up at Hogwarts (death eater territory at this point) as a lab assistant to a still very death eater Severus Snape. With Snapes help he is hiding his Seer ability from Lord Voldemort but some how gets exposed when he tries to stop death eater soldiers (who are primarily teens going out into the field for the first time, Draco is amongst them) from going right into a trap, and we learn why Harry isn't with the order anymore.

Through out the story there is a constant theme of Harry belittling himself, and others belittle him as well, because he is a sqib and "just as bad as his Muddblooded mother."

I always remember the plots of fic's but never the names. I hope this is enough information to work with.

Edit: Neville is still very much alive and is at Dumbledore's secret school that teaches the children of the order. Hermione is one of the "lucky" Muggle-borns who get the chance at a "higher" education if the have the grades for it, I think she tries to correct some of the beliefs of the world but based of her characterization she might have internalized some things too but I can't remember...

  Voldemort won the first war. Harry is happy to live as an unnoticed squib at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, visions and rebels don't allow that and Harry soon catch the attention of the dark lord.
