As the title suggest, I'd like a copy of The General. It was recommended over at DLP but I can't seem to find where it was posted. If anyone has a copy (preferably on a virus-free page), that would be greatly appreciated.


** Sadly I don't have it, but I did chuckle at the "Preferably on a virus free page" bit.

*** Could you upload it to google drive, make it a publicly accessible file link, and then share the link? I'm not sure what phone you have but you should be able to upload an epub file to google drive. Thanks so much!
