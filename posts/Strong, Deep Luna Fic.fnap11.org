I've been looking around and don't seem to see many POV Luna fics, so... I'm looking for a well-written (please) fanfic where Luna is the main character. Preferably she has some sort of mental illness, and this is her stuggle with it.

Also, please no bashing.

I'd love a long fic, but a well-written, short one is good too.

Thanks!

*** Beat me to it. This is the best Luna fic of the lot.

And I love how the author got Pandora's name right more than a decade before its canonical confirmation.
