As the title says. I don't recall much, which is why I'd like to reread it, but I can't seem to find it in my bookmarks.

I think he went to Hogwarts when he's a bit older, not as first year. But I might be wrong. There was also something about him warding the dorms to prevent hazing from the older students, which was kind of a tradition in Slytherin.

That's about everything I recall I'm afraid.

Thanks in advance!

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
