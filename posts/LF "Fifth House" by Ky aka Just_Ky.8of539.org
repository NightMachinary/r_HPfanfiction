So I started reading the fic linkao3(Fifth House by Just_Ky) on AO3, and it is great, I recommend it, but I noticed there are only 25 chapters up on AO3, while the wayback machine tells me the author had 68 chapters up on the now defunct hpfandom.net, from which it was being crossposted.

The chapters themselves were unfortunately not saved:

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20160314051818/http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=42895]]

So my question is: does anyone happen to have a copy of chapters 26 - 68, or know where I could find one?

/insert puppy-dog eyes here/

  Harry Potter was quite honest when he informed Dumbledore's portrait he intended to get rid of the Elder Wand. But what if he'd had to use it one last time? Would the Wand of Destiny change the Savior... or save him at last?
