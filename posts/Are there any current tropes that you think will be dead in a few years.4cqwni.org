If not dead, at least significantly less common than they are now.

I may be wrong, but I think Dumbledore bashing may be dying down somewhat. If that is the case, I wish the Weasley's shared the same luxury.


** I agree with the Dumbledore bashing, I think it's on it's last legs.

I just hope time travel/do-overs aren't going to go out of style. I /love/ do-over stories done well.

To them, indy!Harry stories would likely be appealing, since it 1) Has Harry become much more active than his more passive canon counterpart and 2) has a completely different perspective of Dumbledore (albeit, a horrible one).

It's just that Indy!Harry is almost always associated with a lot of bad things, such as character bashing, author avatar/Gary!Stu, wish fulfillment, etc. When I meant Indy!Harry, I meant stories like Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny. (It's sort of like how the vocal, belligerent shippers became known as Harmonians, although it, at first, referred to H/Hr shippers in general).
