Is there any fics where Lockhart goes from a complete fraud like in Canon, then post-Obliviation he eventually gets to read his books, and starts training to be like the competent, vallaint hero he presented himself as? Is there any fics where after being Obliviated, Lockhart remakes himself as a genuine hero?


** This is brilliant. It's sort of like Harry pretending to give Ron Felix Felicis. If he believes he can do it, he has the confidence to do it. I can see him working really hard to “regain” the skills he thinks he lost.

** There is one where he ends up as a super awesome history teacher, but I don't remember which and I'm pretty sure he doesn't get obliviated before that happens.

** I remember reading a fic where ron's wand Rewrites reality to make Lockhart good and he ends up actually helping and saving the day in the chamber but I can't remember the name of it.
