There are plenty of fics where Barty lives past the end of the Triwizard Tournament. But all of them involve either Barty getting caught and escaping, Barty getting caught and going back to Azkaban, or Barty escaping without ever getting caught. I can't find a single fic where he continues to impersonate Moody throughout OOTP. I'm sure it would be a lot harder to impersonate him when not at Hogwarts, but there wouldn't really be a an interesting plot if everything the characters did was easy. Sure, Voldemort already has an inside man in the Order of the Phoenix, but I highly doubt that Snape has his complete trust having been defended by Dumbledore at his trial. What better way to test his allegiance than to see if the information he's giving him is accurate? Does anyone know, or are writing, a fic like this?


** Now that you mentioned it, I can't believe nobody ever thought of this. I guess it just seems logical to remove Barty as Moody from Hogwarts without him getting killed or being discovered, but people then forget about the opportunities that him not being revealed creates.

** If Voldemort had honest intell on the Order he would probably laugh and kick his feet up. Housewives and a guy the sells silverware out of his jacket hah!

V: You know what let the Ministry do it for me maybe I'll urge Harry to be a revolutionary then save everyone from him be the hero.

** its been a while since i read it, but i think linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) might have this. i remember enjoying it, but it very much has a manipulateive dumbledore, though im pretty sure its much more subtle, as in no obvious stealing from vaults stuff. even if it dosent, i still recommend it, its abandoned, but what is there is very good.

*** I read this one and it's great! Moody is Barty's godfather, which is the reason why Barty can impersonate him so well. Barty wasn't victim to the curse, as Moody was the one contracted for the job. Moody died a little after the year was over, and no one even knew he was impersonated.

*** Very subtle. This is, to me, the gold standard of Dumbledore memory rewriting. It's subtle. It's only noticed because of accidental magic. Even then, the actual modifications are only noticable because of oddities with the language development of parselmouths. It takes months of painstaking psychic surgery to fix the problem, and Dumbledore had a second backup plan in place the instant Harry started breaking the link.

** I have to thank you for posting this. I'm currently drafting the fourth year plot for a story I've been writing and the possibility didn't even register in my mind despite my wanting to depart from canon. It definitely sounds like something that could make Barty shine a bit more as a character.

**** I'd be happy to!

I know I already know how Barty continuing as Moody could come about. Namely, having him set up Karkarov as a fall guy. Given how complicated the plan already was I can easily imagine something like that being considered.

** Similarly to Vaccei, I recently started planning an OOTP canon-divergence story and I've been struggling to think of how I can change up the canon plot (keepin' things fresh and exciting ya know).... This idea is perfect though. I'm definitely going to incorporate it. Seriously, thank you for posting this.
