I've had this idea for ages, but since I can't write, like at all, here goes.

A Lily Evans who never married James Potter suddenly appears at Number 4 Privet drive. With no idea how she got there, or why. Turns out Harry(who may or may not know his own name) wished for someone to Love him, magic decided to answer.

​

That's the gist of it. I don't want to specify more because I know it's rather limiting. Bonus if this alternate Lily was not sorted Gryffindor(which leads to her having different friends, who might still be alive here, etc). Also, the War may not be over in her home dimension, up to you.

​

Also, if a story with this premise has been written already, please post it. Thank you.
