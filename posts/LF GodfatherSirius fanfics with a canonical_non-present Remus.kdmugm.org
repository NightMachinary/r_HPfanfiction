I love Remus as much as the next guy, but i think the fanon version of him is very much overrated and is nothing like the canon character at all. I'm looking for canon compliant/Sirius lives/Harry lives with Sirius after 3rd year fics (i especially enjoy the 5/6th year setting but that just feels like asking for too much) where Remus isn't really present/just doesn't live with them and all that. I'm not saying he can't be in it/play a role in their lives, i just desperately need more fanfics that are focused on Harry and Sirius, not the three of them. Or just ffs where Remus doesn't go around calling Harry a c*b and flexing his actually non-existing werewolf powers


** I will try to find it but there was a one shot where Sirius didn't act like a complete idiot and got himself exonerated at the end of third year then proceeded to wreck everyone's shit for actual or perceived slights against him and his godson ending with them ruling over the magical world It's not as ridiculous as it sounds it was a decent read

** Well I don't know how relevant this is but I think there is one where Remus kind of helps organize Sirius legal defense but us kind of likeva distant of favorite uncle that visits... I think in this one I can't remember the exact name of it Sirius and Harry live at Grimmold place after his third year and Remus take a a position as a private latin and ancient Greek tutor for a school in Wales so Remus is in the story but maybe 3 of the 30 chapters it's mostly Sirius and Harry

** Only one I can think of is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] by Firephoenix8. Haven't read it in ages, but I don't remember Remus being around much. Harry goes to Durmstrang, the prophecy is different, magical creatures, dark lords, Necromancy and more. HP/DM HP/LV
