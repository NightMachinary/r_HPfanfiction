** That'd be neat. Never seen it before, too. It could easily be done, post war, if Tom takes Harry's offer to actually surrender and try to feel remorse again. And then maybe they put him in prison, and Harry goes to visit him over the years. Something like that.

** I apologize because I don't know the names of them but someone else might read this and be able to supply them.

They are both completed fics.

The first one Voldemort has Bellatrix to keep Harry company on a vacation of sorts while Harry promises to stay out of Voldies hair.

The other one has Harry and Sirius gathering all the horcruxes and putting them back in Voldemort and with each piece of soul he gets back he also gets his humanity back.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Check out the Sarcasm and Slytherin series by sunmoonandstars.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]]

Book 5 (year 5) is currently in progress

It is NOT complete and so as readers, we don't know if Voldemort will be redeemed somehow. HOWEVER.... this fic series does seem to be trending more towards the Death Eaters and Voldemort not being nearly as bad as implied and propaganda being a major part of folks views. Think... "The winners of a war write the history" type of thing. So there is already some "redeeming" going on of certain darker characters and also some twisting of what it means to be light, along with an interesting viewpoint on what war can make even good people do.

Regardless I HIGHLY recommend this series. It is REALLY good and quite interesting and complex.

** There was a prompt similar to this about six months ago. Here's what I wrote at the time; I'm quite proud of it. In this, Harry obviously did not throw the stone away while in the forbidden forest. It picks up in the middle of Chapter 36, The Flaw in the Plan, right after Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix.

Harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last, and Merope Gaunt appeared beside him--thin and pale, in the not-quite-substantial way his family had been.

"I don't want anyone else to try and help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence that followed his reappearance, his voice carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this."

Voldemort hissed.

"Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "That isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?"

Harry shook his head. "Nobody. I'm not afraid of you anymore, Tom. This is one last attempt to save whatever is left of your soul. I've see what your horcruxes come to in the end, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone." A pained smile crept onto his face, thinking of his friends and family this man had killed. "Not even . . . not even you. Merope?"

He gestured at the woman--the girl, really, barely older than him. Her hands were covering her mouth in surprise and shock.

"Oh my boy, my beautiful, sweet boy . . . " she stepped forward slowly, towards Voldemort, her simple dress fluttering in a breeze that affected no one else. The entire Great Hall had gone dead silent.

"What trickery is this?" Voldemort whispered, his voice hoarse and more human than Harry had ever heard it. Merope continued her slow, steady walk toward him, tears streaming from her eyes.

"My son, my son whom I loved, I loved you, love you, so much, so fiercely . . . " she made no move to wipe her tears, letting them flow down her face and down her chin.

"Get back, woman!" Voldemort shouted and he jabbed his wand at her. Merope flinched, but whatever the spell was supposed to do, it failed. She kept walking.

"No one can bring back the dead!" Voldemort hissed, his red eyes flicking to Merope, to Harry, and back.

"I brought her with me." Said Harry, surprised at how steady his voice was. "Please, Tom, listen to her. If we duel again, it'll be terrible for you." He thought of the twisted, shivering infant from King's Cross.

Merope was very close now. Voldemort jabbed his wand again and again, and a grey light shot from it, then green, then red, then purple. Each of them passed through Merope as though she were nothing but a memory, cracking into the flagstones of the Great Hall.

Merope reached up, and touched her fingers to Voldemort's pale, snakelike face. "Oh my boy, my Tom, my Thomas. What have you done to yourself? What have you let the world do to you? Make you hard and cruel. . . I'm so sorry. I was a poor witch and a poor wife. Please, my son, let me take you from here, away from the bitterness of what you've become." Voldemort tried to back pedal away, but she'd grabbed his robes with her small hands and he didn't seem to be able to dislodge her.

And Merope Gaunt, fragile and pale and shaking, pulled Voldemort into a hug, her tears spilling into his black robes.

"Please, my boy, my boy, my son, I know this wasn't what you wanted, wasn't ever what you wanted. Let me be a better mother than I was a witch or a wife, let me . . . please, please, let me take you from this place, you'll be at peace, I promise . . . "

It was such a tiny gesture, so small that Harry almost believed he'd imagined it, but for a brief second Voldemort relaxed into his mother's hug and gave the tiniest of nods.

It started as a hiss of pain from Voldemort. He sank to his knees, his wand falling to his side from numb fingers, still embraced by his mother. A groan escaped from his lips, and his skin became even paler, somehow, before Harry realized that he was becoming semi-solid, like a memory or a specter from the stone himself. The moan of pain gradually grew louder and louder until Voldemort was screaming in agony.

And then the two of them, the greatest Dark Wizard ever born and his mother, disappeared.

Later, after Harry had thrown the stone away and explained what he'd done, Hermione would badger him about it .

"I can't believe you're not more curious about it, Harry, honestly, it's not like he's never disappeared without a trace before."

"I trust that he's never coming back, Hermione. His horcruxes are gone, so his spirit doesn't have anything to anchor it to the world anymore. And I don't think he could have tricked Merope; they seemed a little all-knowing, to me. He's . . . moved on. She took him somehow, and I think he regretted, finally, what he'd done."

Hermione wasn't satisfied with that answer, but it was the only one she'd ever get.
