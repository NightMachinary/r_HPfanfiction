HHr time travel fic where Harry and Hermione travel back in time and live next door to James & Lily. Anyone know the name? HHr develops (they aren't together in the beginning) and James & Lily eventually figure out it's Harry living next door. Thank you in advance! :)


** From what you can remember, what genre did this fic fall under? Is there any action/adventure? If so its kinda right down my alley. Not a huge fan of fics where it just follows daily life though.

*** I'm not a fan of fics following daily life either, but this was one of them. From what I remember, it was pretty well written. Don't remember the genre though, sorry.
