** The purebloods could get away with doing magic because the trace only detects magic around those who have the trace. Not who cast the spell. So you could cast as much magic as you wanted in diagon (adults may step in to stop you) because there's no way to tell who cast the spell and they're not going to charge students because a man walking past them on the street decided he absolutely had to remove his nose hairs via spell at that moment.

Now, as to the trace, it has to be on the person because Dobby didn't use Harry's wand to cast the charm he was blamed for. If it's on the body, it then depends on whether it's linked to some kind of registry (in which case it probably wouldn't work as no Harry Potter had been born/registered in that time) or whether it's a nebulous spell attached somehow to your soul, (which would remain the same age it is no matter what time travel or potion/spell is used to change your physical appearance) and lets off a detectable ping to ministry sensors until such time as you turn 17 and break the trace.

The Trace only detects that Magic has been used in the vinicity of an Underage wizard, and not /who/ that wizard was. That's why Tom Riddle was never suspected for the murder of the Riddle family, wizards detected that something happened in the town and went to investigate, but since they found their (thought) culprit, they never tried to find who triggered the Trace.

In Harry's case, Dobby could push the blame on him because the events happened in "his" zone. Basically, any magic happening in Privet Drive would be blamed on Harry unless proved otherwise, but if Harry were to use magic in another Muggleborn house (let's say Hermione), she would be the one blamed (at least until an investigation is made).
