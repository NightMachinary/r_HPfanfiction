I'm looking for fics I can get deep into that are usually pretty lengthy, involve a few subplots where every character feels like they're important to the story. Intricately planned, well thought out and well written, and where it actually feels like we're in a magical world.

What I mean is, a lot of fics tend to forget or leave out the magic part of the wizarding world and magic is only used in duels. I want something that also explores magic beyond the creatures and objects we've already met in the original series. Basically something creative and magical.

But mainly, I just want something that has a lot going on, lots of characters, subplots, adventure, etc.

Things I wouldn't prefer are Harry/Hermione, or Snape fics (like mentor Snape or a Snape pairing or a Snape as the main character), or next gen fics.

I do like the Trio and their generation, I like the Marauders era too, I can do rare pairings and side characters as the main characters. It doesn't have to be Harry-centric because tbh I'm kind of tired reading about Harry. Preferably not a slash main pairing (if there is a pairing).

But if you know a fic that doesn't exactly fit, please still recommend it!

The only examples I can think of for what I want are fics like ‚ÄòThe Arithmancer' by White Squirrel and it's exploration of magic and ‚ÄòThe Life and Times' by Jewels5 and it's plot and characters.

***** I love The Prince of Slytherin, but I have a few notes I like to give people when I recommend it.

- i didn't like the prologue, and it stopped me from reading it for a while, but once I got past it I was instantly intrigued.\\
- yes, James and Jim start out really shitty. They do get better.
- I found that the story really picked up in book 2. If you're finding it just ‚Äúokay‚Äù throughout book 1, I'd recommend you try sticking it out until then. It has my favorite Lockharts of any fic I've read.

** If your looking for a Snape fic with some damn good world building linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is the way to go. It's brilliant and is bursting at the seams with magic lore and plot and politics and everything else its incredible.

Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is also a fantastic adventure story with an amazing world and plot and drama and humour. Just brilliant. Very creative!

** Mine isn't finished yet (I mean it is 210k but not finished) but it has multiple complex characters who drive the story and focuses heavily on the magical world apart from just Hogwarts. If you're also a bit tired of Harry, that works because it is a prequel that does not focus on the trio. It explores a lot of magic outside of just dueling too.

IDK shameless self promotion but it seems to fit what you are looking for. I update about every five days and the ending is already planned, too. I will let you know if I stumble across anything similar too! I like these types of fics.

It's not complete but it has 53 chapters so far and around 480,000 words (give or take)

In this Harry is anctually a girl named Belladona Pandora Potter (-Michels) and has a twin sister named Prunella.

Lily and James were not killed and Bella is the GWL but they are also incompetent nutjobs and think that Bella is a squib that bullies her sister for not having magic (even tho they're one year of age) and give her to the Dusley family who later give her to an orphanage.

She's also a piano and skating prodigy and a Slytherin.

** The first fics I ever read were written by some author called HarryWriter who tried to pass his year 5 and year 6 fics as bootleg versions of JK's books 5 and 6. I believe that the fifth one was also called "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" and the sixth one was called "Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients". Maybe because I was 12 or 13 when I read them they seemed really cool but if I recall them well they were written pretty much in the same spirit as the original books with lots of mystery and adventures. It also included a lot of original magic such as a rare ability to turn into multiple animals and/or combine their most useful features into one shape or the wizard equivalent to the internet located in a different dimension where an oracle had all the existing knowledge from the world. The thing I didn't like much about it was that it had very long anime-style duels. Also unfortunately can no longer find them online although there might be some people who have a PDF/word copy of it on their drive.

This is a Dramione story with a lot of action/adventure. It also looks into Tom Riddle and Salazar Slytherin's past. Vampires are also a large part of the plot.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** Accidental Animagus, of course, if you haven't read it. I found it better than The Arithmancer and quite a bit more creative.

Seconding Victoria Potter - it's really creative and probably the most polished recent Harry-centric fic I've seen. Really expands magic in an organic way and infuses it into the world.

Alexandra Quick does this similarly and IMO more originally, but it's an all-OC story set in magical America after the war, so I don't know if you'd love it. It's its own thing, not really either postwar or next-gen. FWIW it does fit all your initial criteria. Probably does the best job of capturing Rowling's magical atmosphere to the wizarding world, but in a very American context.

Pureblood Pretense series read pretty similarly to Arithmancer for me, fits all your criteria. Very long and in-depth. The magic is a little more structured and explained, but not by much. Quite AU.

Lastly, check out the Anguis series by Slide, it's set during the Second War and follows a bunch of really great OC Slytherin characters. Really well-written and canon-compliant as well, with a lot of subplots and a good job capturing Rowling's atmosphere.
