Are there good fics with other Potters or some extended family like the Blacks? Reading "The Power Of The Potters" by RockIII and I want to read more stories with extended family and the whole family magic/Lord Potter trope. Be it AU, time travel, parallel universe etc. But please no slash or Ginny pairing! :)


** linkffn(Our Man on the Hellmouth) Spike is Harry's great uncle. Harry uses his forehead to put a dent in the table when he learns.

  A sequel to 'All things considered'. After the Second Wizarding War, Harry is at a loose end. When a certain High School explodes, that changes, and the Wizarding World and the Slayer collide. Start of a long and likely slow updating series. Buffy/Harry pairing. Possible Xander/Ginny.
