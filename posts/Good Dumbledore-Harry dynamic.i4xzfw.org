Where Harry and Dumbledore are close, and they's alot of interaction between then.

I've come to hate Dumbledore bashing and found when rereading the 6th book, that I want to read more about their relationship.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** I would like to thank you for linking World Trip. Except I can't, because you have now given me the mental image of Gilderoy Lockhart and Rita Skeeter enjoying a very /active/ relationship, and that is clearly Unforgivable. You can expect to mysteriously lose all comprehension of how to operate a doorknob within the next few days.

** I quite enjoy the relationship in Ingenio ab Artifex (formerly flowers for your grave). It's so grandfatherly and supportive and Harry really trusts him as a family figure and there's a genuine sense of connection in every interaction.

I can't link it; the fic has 'suggestive content' regarding Harry 'interacting' with a female character whom he doesn't inform of his age and though it is completely non-graphic, I think it might violate rule 8. It's worth searching though, IMO. Fun, Lie I've Lived type fic. :)
