So, what kind of narcotics do we think magicals could have? Would they be actual Muggle narcotics just amped up with magic, special potions, some alchemical whatnot, etc?

What kind of effects do you think a Wizarding Drug could have? Like, would there be a drug that makes you feel like sunlight? Or a drug that makes you feel like you're eating pancakes on a slow, warm, Sunday morning? Or maybe one that makes you believe you're a post owl?

Any fics with Wizarding Drug use in? As always, no filters. Slash, het, weird shit, whatevs.


** Here's a little excerpt from one of my fics in which Fred and George get their hands on a book called Magipsychedelia, from the restricted section of the library. They don't actually brew any of these potions in the story, they just consider them.

Fred flipped through the book. “Draught of Waking Dreams? Lotion of Wild Abandon? Giddy Gas? Manic Derangement Emulsion? Ooh, that sounds nice. Let's try that one.”

Charlie snatched the book out of Fred's hands and read the ingredients. “Datura? Henbane? Ergot? Venom of a Sonoran Desert toad? Mugworm griblick? These are poisons! Fred, George, you're first-years! You can't go brewing potions like these!”

*** I am now genuinely curious about the physics of how this would work. Like, would people in the room get high as I imagine they would if you actually filled a fireplace with weed - hotboxing is the term, right? (I am square as fuck, so my drug knowhow comes from uni lectures. I can probably make the stuff, but I have no idea what any of it looks like. Either way, please forgive my ignorance). Or would you sort of get infused with the weed-ness as you walked through, like one of those special candle things that you're supposed to put in your closet or laundry area to make your clothes smell nice?

*** I'm very into that opening, damn. Very "Lo, I shall walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death, shootin' shit all the while" of you. :)

Bookmarked, fellow internet person, bookmarked as heck. So, yeah. I'll allow the shameless self advertising just this once. :D

** I've seen fics where characters smoke gillyweed and feel like their “floating” (on the water) and when it's a bad trip they feel like their drowning. I thought it was creative but not necessarily too different from our own world.

Another interesting drug I think would be those pepper up potions, might result in some manic excitable behavior and happiness - addiction.

*** Weren't those just cold-cures in canon? Cough Syrup abuse is totally a thing, for the stronger stuff, anyway. I don't think people could get high off Calpol.

*** That would be interesting.

I'd like to see a fic where Fortescue is kind of like Garak in DS9 with his Happiness-Implant or the Drone-Shop guy in Shadowrun Hong Kong (Reliable Matthew) with his BTL-personas. He's got social anxiety or depression and just wants to hide away in his house, but he needs to get out to earn a living and so resorts to Cheering Charms to get him started. Then he keeps them going, so he can keep working. That'd be a really interesting thing to explore, in the hands of a good writer.

** If the Twins Patented Daydream Charm is not a drug, I don't know what is :D I mean realistic hallucination for half an hour with side effect of drooling and dazed expression would definitely qualify in muggle world
