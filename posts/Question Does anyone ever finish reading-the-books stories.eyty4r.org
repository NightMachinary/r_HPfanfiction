I don't like 'em but I see them everywhere and I've never seen one completed for all seven books.


** A decade ago, FFN was overrun with tens of thousands of them before they all got purged, and a lot of them had been completed.

I'm kinda sad, as I enjoy the concept... and I missed my chance to read them.

I don't feel like the fic needs to contain the text from the book itself, but I would love to read a completed competent one, at least one where the stupidity of the reading is preferably enforced by a ROB^{Random Omnipotent Bastard/Being} or something like that... to actually enforce the continuation of the reading when horrible stuff comes up.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** It took me a bit to understand, or at least i think i have... You are referring to the "characters read Harry Potter books" stories, right? Not having written one of those i can't tell you what might be going on in the authors' minds but i suppose they either hadn't planned everything out, lost interest, or got caught up in something else be it life, a fandom or just another new story they are plotting.

** No because that would mean messing with the plot of the story (or forcing the author to actually create a plot). Best to stick to copying canon (near) verbatim and having reaction shots.

** Sorry, I'm being oblique/

Do writers ever finish writing those characters-are-forced-somehow-or-other to read the books stories?

In other words, have you ever seen one labelled "complete".
