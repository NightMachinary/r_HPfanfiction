I was just scrolling through [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] earlier today and came across a post that mentioned Alexandra Quick and how amazing it was, or something like that, and it's weird because I've NEVER been recommended it, not once, and it sounded amazing, so here I am, asking for other fics that are old and good, but rarely recommended?

I hope you understood that

Thank you and stay safe


** u/DemnAwantax:
#+begin_quote
  Victoria Quick
#+end_quote

Are you not mixing *Alexandra Quick* and *Victoria Potter*? Because I don't know and can't find a fiction called Victioria Quick.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** There's something like linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) series. It was pretty popular.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]] by The Fictionist) was a big one I haven't seen recommended in a while.

Also linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464][The Definition of Normal]] by BrilliantLady) and the rest of the Perfectly Normal series.

A lot more than a couple of years ago, but there's also linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary - By Arabella]])

** I wouldn't say it's rarely recommended but it only seems to get recommended when someone specifically asks for Severitus, and I loved it so I always want to recommend it.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
