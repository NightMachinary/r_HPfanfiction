**** It's not that anything in the books disproves it. It's that the long hair was entirely the actor's idea. He talks about it in an interview, which is a great read. Here's an excerpt about the long hair:

#+begin_quote
  “I went to the set, and they had this idea of me wearing a pinstripe suit, short black-and-white hair,” Isaacs recalls. “I was slightly horrified. He was a racist, a eugenicist. There's no way he would cut his hair like a Muggle, or dress like a Muggle.” So Isaacs suggested instead that he wear a long white wig, and a particularly ostentatious wizard-like ensemble. “In order to keep the hair straight, I had to tip my head back, so I was looking down my nose at everyone. There was 50 percent of the character. I asked for a walking stick, which [/Chamber of Secrets/ director] Chris Columbus first thought was because I had something wrong with my leg. I explained I wanted it as an affectation so I can pull my wand out [of the cane].
#+end_quote

I think Jason Isaacs deserves credit for these creative choices because they were great.

People also define canon differently. Some people say canon HP is just the books; others say it's the books + everything in the movies that doesn't directly contradict the books, but I believe this latter view detracts from the many artists who brought creativity to the series and go unrecognized for their contributions to the HP world.

^we actually don't know this. Draco was born in 1980 when there were deaths on both sides of the wizarding war and arrests of Death Eaters.

I don't think Snape was Draco's godfather for another reason: Narcissa would've brought it up as leverage when asking Snape to murder Dumbledore in Draco's place.

#+begin_quote

We don't know how intimate the relationship is in canon either. Narcissa knows exactly how to get to his house uninvited, Snape is called "Lucius' lapdog," and Umbridge mentions Lucius speaks highly of him. I see why some fans could believe there is a close relationship in the background.

I also don't think Snape would ever enjoy or seek the company of the Malfoys, which would change the nature of the relationship, but that's just my own opinion getting in the way.

Cool. I like discussing too.

#+begin_quote
  My initial thought re 1980 was how many Death Eaters were still free as opposed to how many were incarcerated or in hiding after Voldemort's defeat.
#+end_quote

At 1980 during Draco's birth, the Death Eaters are at large until 1981. It's unclear whether they are winning at this point in time (June '80), but we do have some information.

#+begin_quote
  Rosier and Wilkes --- they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell
#+end_quote

That's only two, but it's proof of Death Eaters dying in 1980. Like I said, I don't believe that Snape has a good chance of being Draco's godfather in canon, but there's a chance that Lucius and Narcissa might not have as many candidates as one would first believe. A number of purebloods would have supported Dumbledore/been anti-Voldemort, which shrinks the pool. Regulus, Narcissa's male cousin, is already dead by this time (Sirius doesn't count). Maybe Lucius's own dorm mates are dead?

What's more surprising to me is that JKR didn't officially make Bellatrix his godmother as a parallel to Harry/Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  I agree that canon presents solid foundation for a relationship between them. The fact that it never confirms it, though, makes some of this stuff feel a bit less plausible, I suppose?
#+end_quote

Maybe we're saying the same thing? Canon does confirm a relationship, but does not embellish on the nature of this relationship (i.e. how friendly they are and exactly how both parties feel about one another, which could range from genuine fondness to mutual exploitation).

As for "plausible," I've seen the fic tag "canon compliant" used very loosely with other characters, so I'm a bit jaded.

#+begin_quote
  I also don't think Snape would ever enjoy or seek the company of the Malfoys, which would change the nature of the relationship
#+end_quote

You are certainly welcome to your belief, which canon neither confirms nor denies. I think he was the type to seek the company of Lucius as a teen given JKR's interview statements about Snape. Personally, I find the possibility of him somewhat liking the Malfoys more interesting than if he didn't because his role requires him to betray and deceive them. As for him enjoying their company, perhaps not, but there is a difference between his treatment of Bellatrix, whom he dislikes and mocks, and Narcissa in Spinner's End. At least in a comparative sense, I would strongly say Snape enjoys the company of the Malfoys more than the company of any other Death Eaters/affiliates.

*** This was hinted at in the books with the posters on Sirius's bedroom walls and the line in OotP when Harry wishes he could speak to Sirius and ask him about girls and what to do about Cho. Then it was made extended canon in the Remus Lupin essay from 2015:

"Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He's still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?'). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.'). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You'd know perfectly well who I've fallen for, if you weren't too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.'"

Anyway, I feel like I run into the opposite in fanfiction all the time, like writers go out of their way to make him completely uninterested in women (and/or men), which I've been told is based on how aloof he seems when a girl is checking him out in Snpe's worst memory. Anyway, I think he definitely is coded as someone who gets it a lot and is growing bored with it, but to each their own.

*** Well to be fair with Sirius, that's how adult Sirius is, after years in Azkaban, we aren't 100% sure how he was as a kid or teenager. Though it was declared that Sirius and James were both smart, we don't know too much else about kid or teenager Sirius.

** Goblins ARE NOT NICE

Ok. Maybe this started out because One of the first fics I ever read was an Indy Harry fanfic. I keep forgetting that one of the goblins Bogrod I think betrayed them.
