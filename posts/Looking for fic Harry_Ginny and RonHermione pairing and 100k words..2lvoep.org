I really enjoyed The Refiner's Fire and it's sequel by Abraxan. Anyone know of something similar/better?


** Not so much a story as a hub of canon-pairing romance/action stories: your mecca awaits at [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][Sink Into Your Eyes]].

*** SIYE caters exclusively to Harry/Ginny "shipping" stories that satisfy a steep set of requirements: Neither Harry nor Ginny can have significant relationships (particularly sexual ones) with others prior to hooking up, no drugs or heavy alcoholic intoxication is permitted by Harry or Ginny, Ginny may never (intentionally) be unfaithful, Ginny is not permitted to die, and the story content shouldn't be anything that's objectionable to the site's owner, who is devoutly religious.

Another site that sticks to canon pairings (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione) is [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/][Phoenixsong.net]]. Several of their top-rated stories are quite good. One in particular I remember enjoying when I started HP fanfiction (and these were the only pairings I'd read) was hwimsey's [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/4304/][Coven of Echoes]] (completed, novel-length), which I believe is only found on that site.

You might also try some of the stories by other authors on [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/][fanficauthors.net]]. Kokopelli wrote several Harry/Ginny stories, as did MrIntel and Jeconais. They list their pairings up front, making it pretty easy to choose by pairing and avoid the handful of Harry/Sirius slash tales or Kinsfire's Harry/Hermione/Hermione's mother smutfests.

Edit: redundancy removed.

**** I had no idea they were so safety-minded and Victorian about it. In truth I'd only heard about them when I was exploring my Harry/Hermione phase on Portkey.org.

Portkey operates in a similarly 'devout' set of by-laws requiring adherence to their designated pairings, starting with Harry/Hermione, and including Ginny/Draco and Ron/Luna. It's like bizarro-SIYE.

Basically, follow [[/u/__Pers]] recs over mine.

**** For anyone who was curious about the rules on SIYE:

#+begin_quote
  SIYE is a shipper archive for Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley fan fiction. Stories submitted for posting on SIYE must feature Harry and Ginny as the primary couple unless prior arrangement has been made with the SIYE Administration.

  SIYE reserves the right at the staff's discretion to reject stories which are deemed to be hostile to the Harry/Ginny ship.

  SIYE shall not be held responsible for the retention of any material submitted. The author is solely responsible for maintaining a copy of their submission.

  Each submitted chapter must be of 1,000 words or more. Author notes, quoted text or lyrics, summaries, etc do not count towards this minimum.

  When submitting stories, ensure that your chapter is correctly formatted, with a full blank line between paragraphs.

  Your story will be declined if we find canon spelling errors or an excessive amount of general SPaG (Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar) errors.

  Ratings only apply to the story itself and any author notes. All openly visible material must be suitable for a general audience.

  Your story summary must be relevant and is subject to the same rules as the story text in terms of formatting, spelling, and grammar. An uninformative, irrelevant, or incorrect summary will cause your story to be rejected.

  No markup of any type, including HTML, is permitted in your summary. If found, they will be deleted without warning or notification.

  Titles must be presented in title case, with all words (except prepositions) capitalized unless a prior arrangement has been made.

  Stories must be correctly rated. While chapters may be individually rated, the highest rating represented must be applied to the first chapter as well, to ensure that the story as a whole is correctly rated.

  Your story should be submitted for the correct category. If you have trouble deciding on the right category, contact a staff member for advice.

  Your stories should be single entities; all chapters of a single story should be submitted as part of that story, rather than posted individually.

  The predominant language of your story must be English. While other languages may be used to add color, they should not be integral to understanding your story.

  Both American and British English are acceptable, but usage should be consistent.

  If your submission is not accepted, you must make at least the changes the archivist has specified before resubmitting. Do not re-submit without making the required changes. We encourage you additionally to take the opportunity to improve your story as far as possible with additional proofreading and editing.

  SIYE is a privately owned site, and publication of fics here is a privilege, not a right. Your story may therefore be rejected on plot, characterization, or any other grounds if the archivist deems any element of it to be incompatible with the aims and standards established by the site owner. In particular:

  Canon characters should be recognizable, not simply original characters with the same names.

  The depiction of self-harm is prohibited.

  The use of illegal drugs by characters is prohibited.

  Authors should exercise good judgment in the depiction of sex and violence. Sexual or violent content should not be gratuitous or overly graphic.

  If you feel your story has been rejected unfairly, you may contact the SIYE Administration to appeal the decision.

***** If Harry is considered too much of a cad, they'll boot the story as well. My /A Mother In Law's Love/ wouldn't make it onto the site because they couldn't accept a heartbroken Harry hooking up with a stripper for a one-night stand.

The site's organizers really just want a place dedicated to OTP shipping stories. They aren't aiming for inclusiveness; there's fanfiction.net or AO3 for that.

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr.

**** Glad you enjoy it. It's long been one of my favorites.

I'd also advise you to check the link after on Phoenixsong.net on chapter 30, where you can find a one-shot done by one of sib's betas covering the time after Harry's and Dumbledore's duel.
