** Alrighty time to list my favorites... again plus more

Make A Wish - linkffn(2318355) - Most original thing I have read, and I wish there were more stories like it. Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is original and a good read.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - Most touching fic in my opinion and one that is always going to stay with me.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - I just like this one a lot

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - This one is cute and I like to share it.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - One of the best Harry and Daphne fics out there and has good read and reread quality. Its sequel is just as good.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - A good crossover story that great for killing some time and is very touching and original in its execution.

Inspected by No 13 - linkffn(10485934) - A good fun crack-fic that is well done. One to be shared with others for sure

From Southampton to New York and Beyond - linkffn(12300252) is another great story and the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass][Dorothea Greengrass]] a good few other interesting stories to read.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A well thought out and interesting world-building story that also delves more into the magical culture.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781) - A great Marvel x Harry Potter crossover that is really well done.

Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion - linkffn(11610805) Is also a good story done by the same other.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - A lovely story about Harry becoming a father.

Sigh, I really have an issue, I read way too much. I hope that you enjoy any of these stories and if you ever want more feel free to PM me for more reccomendations.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** Not the OP. I hate the cliche, bad tropes as much as any other avg reader. I just find it hard to digest fem!harry. Canon Harry is a guy through and through. How he behaves, his friendship with Ron, the camaraderie he has , his interaction with girls. The books would have been truly different if it was fem!harry. There is a scene where Harry and Ron talk abt Ginny and Hermione , that scene is so hilariously true because that is pretty much the most you talk abt to other guy about the girl you like. Also when he is going to give himself up to Voldemort he conjures up his loved ones using the stone and he asks one thing “does dying hurt” . That is such a guy thing. I mean you want to say so much and ask them so much but you have to tough it out till the end so that one question sums up all your emotions if you're a guy. Just as there are something's intrinsic to women, there are something's intrinsic to men. And Harry checks all those boxes.

Which is exactly the point, isn't it? What if this manly Harry suddenly wasn't the one? That's for the gender-bended!Harry.

Harriet-was-always-a-girl is very AU, I agree, and the author just has to write completely new universe (unless it is a porn, and she just want to get Harry to bed with Draco/Snape). linkffn(The Videus Charm by OfPensandSwords) is not completely horrific, because the author just gave up on the romance. linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) just makes completely new universe and so far it does pretty reasonable job about it (slightly too much failing into the dreaded Viscounts-and-Heiresses junk, but it has nothing to do with fem!Harry).

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created.

Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

**** Except all fem!Harry stories are AU, right? So, this argument is completely invalid. Moreover, it is exactly the point of fem!Harry (or genderBender!Harry), isn't it? What if this manly guy with all insecurities and fun of being a guy, suddenly finds himself/herself being a girl (sexual preferences and smut put aside: there is no reason why magic while changing reproductive organs couldn't change his mind)? How would he react? How would his friends react? How would his enemies react? These are legitimate questions which could be investigated in a story. And yes, of course, 95 % of all fem!Harry stories are porn (which is no surprise, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's Law]] still holds), but it doesn't invalidate that one or two stories which could be interesting. E.g., I am not completely persuaded that linkffn(Magical Metamorphosis by Eon the Dragon Mage) is the best story ever written (it is /too/ slow), but it seems to me like a honest story written by somebody who knows what he/she is talking about.

But even considering that there is no fem!Harry you would be willing to swallow, my original question still stands: why is this abomination worse (and the only one worthy of mentioning) than Lord Hadrian Peverell-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin, or Ginny-the-goblin-warrior?

***** I think that is the question to OP because Lord Hadrian Gryffindor Ravenclaw Slytherin Jesus and tropes just as similar are pretty shit for me too. It's true that fem!harry is AU so it should be treated that way. This is just my personal opinion . I find it very difficult to change Harry's gender. Also I get that magic can change the male body to female . But I definitely don't think that magic can change the culmination of experience as a guy which have been hardwired into the mind to think like a girl. It accounts to lazy writing in my opinion if that is how Harry is made fem!harry.

Completely agree. I haven't said that writing fem!Harry is easy and even less that most fem!Harry stories do it well (linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) did half competent job about the transition, and perhaps linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi), except I will never forgive the latter the name and it is just Drarry by other means).

****** And I have to mention linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), where unfortunately the author couldn't decide whether he writes a serious story or porn, so it is not good in either department (too much human anatomy in action for the good story, and too much story and character for the latter, I guess; I am not good judge of the latter). However, when ignoring smut and kink, there is really nice story lurking behind.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.
