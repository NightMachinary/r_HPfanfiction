Hey I've decided to write a fanfic about a George Weasley and the muggle girl he mentions in the half blood Prince (Christmas,after pissing off Ron). And I've been in conflict about the name, just can t decide one , if you guys could just suggest a few names I will pick one.

THANK YOU.


** Sarah Cobbledick. "Just so you know, 'Sarah Weasley' would be a bit of an upgrade."

** I've always liked names like Elenor, Delilah, Astrid, Hope and Faith :) You can definitely make a lot of puns with the last two and any character with a flower name would have an â€˜aww' moment if given the flower she is named after!

I hope this helps!
