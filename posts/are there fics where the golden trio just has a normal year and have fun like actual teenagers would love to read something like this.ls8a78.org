** The Strange Dissapearence of Sally Anne is like this. Harry and Hermione try to figure out what happened to this missing student.

It reads a lot like the first few HP books. Just an innocent mystery. I haven't finished it but a lot of people have recced it and so far it is sweet. Big Philosophers Stone vibes.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.

** That's pretty much every year in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). Voldemort is an occasional minor nuisance; the real plot is about opening up the school to other magical species, learning to become Animagi, Ron latching onto space flight as an ambition that will let him stand out and building a magical spacecraft... And working out why it is that Nora the Norwegian Ridgeback seems to be learning to speak.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
