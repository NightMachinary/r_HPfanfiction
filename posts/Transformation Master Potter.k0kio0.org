If you use Engorgio on a cup of water or on some food, does the food get bigger meaning Harry would have more food/ more water if his cup got bigger?

  “Your mother can't produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigur ---”

  “Oh, speak English, can't you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out from between his teeth.

  “It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, /you can increase the quantity/ if you've already got some ---”

*** If I'm reading this right, food could be expanded. Would Engorgio work. Let's say Petunia get lil Harry an apple and he did a accidental Engorgio on said apple, he would have more food.

**** Yes. And yes, it is weird, and I think it is one of many unintented consequences of JKR jokes, which are horribly dangerous to use, because then your story becomes really really weird and it runs straight to the Uncanny Valley.

** Given that the concept of a cup of water includes the water inside the cup, I'd say it's safe to assume that the water would be expanded as well.

**** Just put a Refilling Charm on it:

#+begin_quote
  “The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon “dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.”

That's straight from HBP.
