One of my friends recently got into fanfiction, so I'm trying to show them the best there is to offer.

Ideally, I'm looking for fics of moderate lengths which don't use too many established fanon cliches without explaination


** Try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), or so.e other crossovers, like linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) I think those can really show the strength of fanfiction.

** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is great and really funny, but I'd suggest to start with linkffn(The Lie I've Lived). Jbern is now a published author iirc, and this is imo his best fanfic. Enough deviation from canon to be interesting and exciting, not so much that it feels like you don't understand the world any more.

**** Yeah, all of his fic are set in the same canon-based universe, though some are in the past so not technically "continuation". I read all genres, from strictly canon to completely AU, but I always rec him for canon continuation because he's the best ficcer in that genre that I've come across.
