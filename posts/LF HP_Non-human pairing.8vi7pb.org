I'm having issues describing what I'm looking for.

I want to read about HP with some sort of not-human being. Like a new magical creature or an alien or something like that.

I /do not/ want beast. Think more like Veela or some type of Elf, less like Hedwig.

Linkffn(12382624) is a good example of what I'm looking for. The soul bonding stuff isn't necessary, but it'd be cool.

I would /prefer/ that the race be fleshed out, and at least slightly alien to Harry. With their own culture, government, laws, etc.

I recall a fic awhile ago were Harry was soulmates or something to a.. Dark Elf princess? But she died and left him with a baby. It had a bunch of magical races, and culture surrounding them. I can't find it, but it's another decent example of what I'm looking for.

*** Yes, that's it. Thank you!

I honestly wasn't a fan of the scenario(Harry suddenly has to take care of a baby), but I /really/ liked the setting and world building.

I've always enjoyed reading about fictional cultures and their quirks, dunno why. And that fic has a lot of that.

Off the top of my head, I believe there's a decent amount of Dresden Files in Child Of The Storm, and it's sequel. Dresden himself is a minor character, and I /think/ the Summer Knight and Lady make an appearance? It's been awhile.

Could I manage to enjoy it decently enough? I'm okay with occasionally needing to Google something.

*** Holy shit, thank you /so/ much for that rec.

That was a fantastic read, not quite /exactly/ what I was looking for with this request, but damm is it close. So sad it's abandoned. Right when the romance was getting good, too!

You said there's a couple more crossovers similar? Could you share? I'm gonna search myself, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Especially if it's not in the crossover category like that fic.

**** You've probably found the Denarian trilogy by now. I don't know if I should recommend it, HP/Maeve(Winter Lady)/Amaris(Choiceling) during an arc was far better developed than the author's intended romantic pairing, which is a real shame. HP/Amanda had so much romantic/sexual tension for an entire 1 million words through, but the pairing was not realised. Which sums up Harry in that fanfic pretty well, 1 million words and zero character development.

A less heard of HP x non-human pairing that is better than the above would be found in linkffn(11860415). HP x OC Veela (female) with Athena (the god, not an OC) as his guardian. Has a sequel, but was abandoned very early into it, may have something to do with the original author receiving harassment and deleting all their stories.

Also there's a good HP x Disgaea fanfic. linkffn(5501817). HP x female demon. It was good, and is also complete. I'm not into anime/manga but it was still enjoyable to read.

And this HP x Mass Effect fanfic. Linkffn(10784770). HP x Talia (a purple humanoid with no immune system?). Most of it was good, but either had no ending (incomplete) or the ending was so bad I forgot it.

#+end_quote

Tali, not Talia. Your description of her is pretty accurate, though.

I didn't really like it, wasn't written very well from what I recall. Maybe it was the fact that I'm a pretty big Mass Effect fan, I don't know. Might give it another go.

I've tried reading the Denarian stuff before, it's just never really grabbed me. I'm confused though, was he in a relationship with those two(Maeve, Amaris) during one arc, and they broke it off? Then he ends up with someone else? Is that what you mean? Because I'm not going to like that at all. Might read it regardless, though, I dunno.

I keep meaning to read Gorgoneion, but I've not bothered yet. I keep putting it off. I didn't realize he had Athena as a guardian, that's bound to be interesting. I read somewhere that the Veela OC in question is kinda a mary sue? Is that fair in your opinion? Will definitely put this on my to-read list, though.
