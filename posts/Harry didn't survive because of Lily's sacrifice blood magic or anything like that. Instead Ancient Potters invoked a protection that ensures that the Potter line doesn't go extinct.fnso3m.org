Can be cracky because Harry (LITERALLY) cannot die until there is atleast another Potter


** then it would make sense that James was born to elderly parents. His dad wasn't ready to give up immortality.

​

But imagine a dark Potter lord, húnting down the other Potters for it, maybe that is why there is such a thin Potter line in the first place

**** Well it would normally only apply to his dad.

But that is why he encouraged James to behave risk-taking and reckless. Like buying him a racing broom to ride alone when he is pretty much just a toddler and maybe even give him the idea to become an animagus so young and spend the full moons with a werewolf. And while he never would hurt directly because his wife who doesn't know about it) would murder him he tries, he doesn't really love him and is quite absent and only just buys him whatever he wants

** I like it. In an attempt to ensure his own immortality, he brings about Harry's.

Perhaps Tom Riddle learned the Potters were immortal and sought out James to learn the secret. He didn't understand it though, thinking they would just live a long time but could die like any other (like the Flamel's).
