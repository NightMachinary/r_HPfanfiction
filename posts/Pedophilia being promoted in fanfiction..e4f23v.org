AO3 and FFN have largely a preteen and teen base. What do you think is happening when one perverted person decides to write such content and thousands of minors stumble upon it, attracted to it because it is a some fantastic time travel fanfiction.

This leads to potential pedophiles, who have fantastic stories written, grooming children who become their fans!

Exactly. These sites have large preteen and teen fanbases, a large number of them having crushes on Alan Rickman, or in that phase where they can't yet seperate between bad boys and legitimate psychopaths. These lot also relate to and see themselves in the main characters, such as Harry or Hermione. So nine times out of ten, a Harry/Snape fanfic is just a thirteen year old kid writing about his celebrity crush.

For me the worst thing is the amount of people who practice dark magic after reading HP fanfiction, though it's probably not as bad as the people who read fairy tales and now practice child abandonment, who read the bible and keep stoning women, who read romeo and Juliet and now engage is hereditary blood feuds, and LITERALLY ANY FORM OF MEDIA that contains any problematic elements...

**** I haven't found that post. But I'm sure I heard somewhere that a kid raped his sister and police concluden, by looking at his porn search history, that it might have influenced his decision making.

I'm not saying that a decent guy would have done that but a guy who has it in him to be able to rape someone, might have done someone else than his sister.

Just like a person who has pedophilic tendencies and a low moral compass might be influenced to do something similar.

Is it really that far of a stretch?

***** I suggest looking at scientific articles which have examined the the correlation vs. causation side of this topic more rigorously. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_child_pornography_and_child_sexual_abuse#References][This Wikipedia article]] has a decent collection of such research articles as primary sources.

Judging by the mix of results, there's no scientific consensus about whether or not child pornography consumption leads to more people committing child sexual abuse. Of course there are studies which have shown that people previously convicted of such abuse also consume related pornography (i.e there's obviously a correlation). However, other studies have reached conflicting conclusions about whether or not consumption of child pornography is correlated with a higher chance of repeat offenses. A 2010 study even showed that decriminalizing fictional child pornography on a country-wide level was correlated with a decrease in cases of child sexual abuse in the years afterward.

tl;dr The jury is still out on whether fictional child pornography affects the prevalence of real life child sexual abuse.

** This topic has nothing really to do with HP. It's a [[/r/writing][r/writing]] or [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] type topic. It also comes across as gatekeeping.

I have a friend in one of my fandoms who writes similar stories involving children and adults. What most people don't know about said author is that writing that stuff helps him work through some traumatic things that happened to him as a child and well into his teen years. Writing helps him cope, and from what I've read in comments on one of his stories, has helped at least two others in similar situations.

It's not always about satisfying some fantasy. Everyone has their reasons for writing what they do. For some people, yes it probably is about those kind of fantasies. But that doesn't mean every story ever written has that motivation behind it. That's called generalizing, and it's what gave fanfiction the reputation it has today.

You also might as well be going against rape, abuse, drugs, and murders being written as well. All of which are bad and should not be endorsed, but none of us know the author or why they write these things. You have absolutely no place to be telling people what they can and can't write.

Don't like? Don't read it. Simple.

**** It's actually a normal coping mechanism to write about traumatic things. Those events never go away. For some people it's a struggle to get past it and get up every morning. They wonder why me? They wonder why they bother continuing living. When there's trauma that goes on for years it can seriously affect a victim's psyche, and processing that becomes even trickier.

A lot of times it's also not something that victims can talk about easily. An example would be men being raped. It's entirely possible, equally traumatizing, yet most male victims don't feel like others believe them or try to down play what actually happened. Accepting/understanding what happened and finding a way to move on is a lot harder than you would think if you have never been in a situation such as that. Writing helps people get those feelings and experiences off their chests, and gives them a way to communicate when they feel alone in their situation.

As I said before, this isn't going to be the case for every single story out there. But it is for some of them. Generalizing it all as being written to satisfy some sexual fantasy without knowing anything about the author or their motives shows a lack of maturity and understanding on so many levels.

Also as I said before- don't like it, don't read it. No one is holding your face to a screen and forcing you to read stories with triggers.

***** Writing 'trauma narratives' is a well documented method of exposure therapy for people recovering from abuse, but I don't agree that it's healthy for someone struggling with that PTSD to post those stories online. Doing so opens them up to hateful backlash from people who find such things disgusting as well as unhealthily positive comments from those who read such stories for sexual gratification. Rather than contribute to healthy desensitization of their previous trauma such interactions are more likely to increase the recovering victim's emotional stress. There's a reason that therapists don't recommend such writing exercises outside of monitored therapy sessions.

****** That makes a lot of sense about posting potentially getting a lot of backlash and not helping a trauma victim. I am in no way a therapist, I simply speak from experience and what I have learned about some of the readers and writers in my fandoms. It was the best example I had of someone writing triggering stories that I actually knew.

Saying all stories ever written about a certain sensitive topic, such as pedophilia, are sick sexual fantasies is completely false though. That's like saying every murder/mystery book was written by a killer or wannabe killer, and the people who read those books decide “hey, it's ok in this fictional book, so that means I can go do it.” Most people out there know the difference between fiction and reality.

****** As someone who experienced childhood sexual abuse, I really hate that these are even stories that I have to filter out or see recommended on this subreddit. It doesn't help with trauma, it makes me sick to my stomach every time I accidentally stumble upon a fic with pedophilia. I feel like so many people excuse promoting content like that with the excuse that it's just fiction without considering that unlike dark magic and other horrible things in fanfiction, sexual abuse is something that happens to real people.

I agree with you about writing them in monitored therapy sessions. If that works for some people, then that's great but it's exhausting to see people on this sub praise fics that include the worst thing that's happened to many children.

(Sorry this is kind of a jumbled mess, it just bothers me a lot and it's hard to put into words)

*** So far I have not read anything here about defending pedophilia. What I did see is people arguing that it is incredibly hard to actually stumble on a fic with that theme, aka where a 15 year old or younger gets together with a full adult. And I agree with that. I can't think of a popular fic with that theme right now, but I might just be forgetting the many, many popular fics with it or I might just focus on the wrong type of fic. What is pretty widespread, but definitely not pedophilia, is two underage people getting together or like a 16/17 year old getting together with an adult.

Both these things might be questionable when a big part of readership is underage themselves, but not even remotely illegal or anything.

But maybe I am just too naive and people here are just using those arguments to defend it.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. Recommended quite a bit a while back. Falls pretty heavily under the "not /technically/" category.

Many stories with 'pairings' like Tom/Harry or Snape/Harry on ao3 are even exclusively about the rape and torture of a young teen. But that's alright I guess because it's only fiction... Fiction that is incredibly detailed in thousands of words written as a porn for a specific audience... that is about to downvote me... watch.

Some people seem to like it and defend it with the "but it's fictional so no one is getting hurt" argument. But I don't understand it. It costs literally nothing for artists and writers to draw and write adult characters. Nobody's stopping them from writing all the smut they want to. Just do it with adults FFS.

Normally I don't mind smut and fetishes and despise censoring. But the sexualization of children is the one thing I'm firmly against and think should be banned.

Okay, going out on a limb here, and make a bold assumption: people who like this do like the idea of such a relationship, probably for some sexual reason. So it does "cost" them enjoyment of writing such a story, which is literally the only reward you get for fanfiction.

I'm not saying that this is right, that I support it, or that it is or should be acceptable, but the "why" seems fairly obvious to me - so it's a bit weird to me that you can't even fathom it on a purely theoretical level.

** EXACTLY. thankfully I've never come across this type of thing on ffn.net but AO3 is literally filled with it.

And I don't mean old/young pairings but older characters raping younger characters. There's literally tens of thousands of these types of 'fics' on AO3 in the Harry Potter fandom alone. And people who actually masturbate to it.

It is indeed a heaven for pedophiles. The comment sections of these stories are often filled with appreciaton for the the written work and suggestions for the writer to write even more weird/fucked up shit.

By allowing this, a community is created where those kinds of people can share their ideas and no longer feel alone. No one's there to reprimand them either because AO3 actually protects them. Therefore in their minds they can start to think that hey, maybe it's not so weird and maybe it's not so evil.

Yes, instead of them getting professional mental help, thanks to fanfiction websites they actually have all the content to indulge themselves and worsen said psychological disorder, potentially leading to a real life crime.

Sadly, nothing's going to change. Those people who refute your claims by saying 'I don't see it' or 'you're trying to take away our rights of free speech!'. Well, it's the same thing as Mark Zuckerberg saying Facebook is a platform of free speech whilst all he's really saying is: it's too expensive to monitor all those pedophiles/terrorists who use Facebook :).

Those people who quote the free speech stupidity things are either:

A) Completely indiffetent people who don't care that there's a problem and lack any real empathy or; B) Those that actually don't want to see it removed because they're the groups of people that read it :) or; C) Idiots.

It's not a matter of free speech but giving those people a MASSIVE reach, potentially worsening the problem greatly.

I find it disgusting aswell that these pedophile smut stories hide themselves as being 'fanfiction' while anyone with any sense of intellect and moral compass knows them to be what they really are: a different type of child pornography.

At the end of the day the only real advice I can give you is this: when visiting certain fanfiction website only search something BEFORE using all possible filters. Tell you're friends who are only just getting into fanfiction to be careful. If you have children, carefully monitor them on what they're searching and/or restrict certeain websites untill they're a certain age.

*** It's not about free speech.

Pedophilia is a crime. Being a pedophile isn't. What's the difference? You don't chose to be attracted to children. You do chose to rape them and scar them for life.

A pedophile that is not acting on his urges isn't doing anything wrong.

Pedophilic material (ie pictures of nude children) do hurt children, because a child had to be hurt for the photography to be taken. That's why they are illegal. Pedophilic fanfictions or anime do not hurt any children even indirectly, so they are not banned.

False. Anti-Obscenity Laws in the USA and elsewhere still apply to fictional depictions. Here are a few recent cases that were prosecuted in the United States:

#+begin_quote
  The Miller test was developed in the 1973 case Miller v. California. It has three parts:

  - Whether "the average person, applying contemporary community standards", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,
  - Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law,
  - Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

You'd be hard pressed to find a judge or jury anywhere in the United States who would say fictional child pornography doesn't qualify as obscene under that standard.

Literally nobody is calling a relationship between an 18 and 16 year old pedophilia.

I understand that pedophilia/rape is often unavoidable in the more darker stories but it doesn't have to be centered around THAT and it sure as hell doesn't have to be as explicit or that long.

And guess what it is allowed. As long as it serves a purpose in a story, anything can be allowed. Further, several popular fanfiction universes base themselves in a feudal world. And guess what, it makes sense that their sense of morals are not the same as ours.

The basis of our modern morals came about by the end of WW1. It is a rather insignificant blip in comparison to how long we've lived without them. And I find implanting modern morals and ideals into a feudal world more false than to to have teens be in a relationship.
