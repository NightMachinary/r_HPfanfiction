Looking for stories where Blaise and maybe Theodore Nott are well written.

Please if Daphne is in the story I don't want her to have the cliche ice princess personality, why is that so dang popular anyway? Something more believable with her please if she's in it. Or at least something more to Daphne then typical Ice Princess.

Same with any other characters, well written and believable characters.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

No Crossovers

Would rather not have Weasley or Dumbledore bashing.

I just want more interesting characterizations of minor Slytherin Characters in general really, not just them.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione unless it's written believably enough.

Has Ginny in Slytherin and it so wonderfully done. Even if you hate Ginny, try it. She is so unlike what we usually see.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

** I literally just recommended this in another thread but it happens to fit your criteria as well, so there you go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba]]

And its sequels.

4 Slytherin OCs, lots and lots of drama and romance and angst and sexual tension and a surprisingly large body count by the end of the series. WARNING: the characters are not always likable... and that's the best damn part about them.

*** Really glad to see someone else evangelizing this series. A million words of perfectly developed OCs and careful, canon-compliant plotting. Should be mandatory reading for everyone in the fandom.

Even beyond the 4 main characters, many of the other OCs are great. And when canon characters make appearances, such as Harry in the final book, they're frequently pitch perfect too, and don't steal the show from the world Slide builds.

**** Some of the non-protagonist OCs were incredible. Aurora was cool (Toby's dad's friend), and Jennifer Riley honestly stole the show once she got a bigger role. Also Annie MacKenzie. Oh, and /Nathalie Fucking Lockett/, who is so cool, she even gets a supporting role in the next-gen fic!

I also want to praise Idaeus Robb as a villain. He felt more threatening than Voldemort even though he was less powerful and basically his subordinate.

I /do/ have a gripe with the series though. Slide has a habit of [[/spoiler][Anguis Spoilers]]

***** Lockett is just really fucking awesome (maybe even too awesome), and Riley is an incredibly strong character who develops from a minor role to basically star in the last book - at times she feels like the entire emotional focus of the story. They're both great and add some gender balance to the series which helps prevent every female storyline from revolving around Tanith as they sometimes do in the first two books.

I was never crazy about Annie - she doesn't strike me as that interesting, but then again [[/spoiler][spoiler]]. Robb is great because he feels like a more realistic villain than Voldemort who is mostly a cartoon villain in canon despite JKR's best efforts later in the series.

As for the habit - [[/spoiler][spoiler]]

****** Tanith and Tobias were /so/ Ross and Rachel. Both the good and bad parts. As for Annie, for what it's worth [[/s][spoiler]]

I have to say I didn't enjoy Thanatos as much as Idaeus. As a Greek, I couldn't get over the dissonance of a name that's literally the Greek word for 'death' going with such a blatantly Welsh surname as 'Brynmor'. Plus he was a bit cartoonish as well, which is odd because Robb was even more depraved than him and yet he managed to pull it off because he was so cool. Plus the name Idaeus is cool as fk.

-- see, this is what makes the Anguis series so cool. You can talk about the characters for hours because they have their own flair like proper novel characters. That's not something you can say about many fanfics.

******* Yup, which is why it's insane that they only had like 20-30 faves each last time I checked. Some of the best work in the fandom and there's absolutely no audience for it because Harry / Hermione / Draco / Snape aren't the protagonists. It's a ton of words and still always worth rereading.

Meanwhile cliche crap with 1D characters, lazy bashing, no development, and minimal plotting get tons of readers. Fanfiction should be more than wish fulfillment.

*** Don't need them to be likable, just merely interesting. Since even though there was a Gryffindor/Slytherin feud we didn't see much interaction between Gryffindor/Slytherin besides Harry and Draco. And thanks for the rec, will check it out! If anyone knows any more let me know!
