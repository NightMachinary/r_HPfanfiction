The main points are these:

- Harry, Fleur, Cedric, and Viktor return to the day the goblet puts their names out.

- They all have all their memories from the original timeline, which I think was rather close to canon with the exception that the war lasted longer, viktor took a more active role in the war, and Harry/Fleur had a thing going on.

- They competed in the tournament, but didnt take it seriously and it was sort of a comedy.

Is it this one? I know I've read such a story before, and this one definitely looks familiar after skimming over the prologue.
