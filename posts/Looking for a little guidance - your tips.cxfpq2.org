I've written HP Fanfiction for a number of years but I've never published any of it anywhere, it's all just been for myself really and is sat on my computer. Never been brave enough to let anyone read it. I do go back and read it as I still write (some of my early stuff is terrible, I like to think I've improved!)

I was thinking about maybe publishing one of them somewhere, my most recent - it's about an OC but she's Voldermort's niece, in Harry's year at Hogwarts so obviously there's changes I've made to canon in the fic in order for him to have a niece .

I'm not sure if I'll post it yet but I noticed while browsing that there were alot of writers and readers on here. So just wondered if anyone had any advice on what they wish they'd known before they first posted their own fanfic's or any advice from readers who have read lots of them on what's a big no for you?


** I think that it would be good to start posting if you are looking for feedback. I would at least look into getting a beta if I were you, someone to bounce ideas of and who can look at your writing with fresh eyes.

As a reader I'm looking at least for something legible. That means proper grammar and structure, proper spelling of canon names and at least a little research done. I also appreciate continuity (something that at times goes wrong for authors that write as they go). Beyond that I appreciate being upfront with what I can expect from the story. You'll find that many people are really turned off by some things and dislike it being sprung up them halfway through a story. An example for me is Hermione bashing, it is something that I dislike a lot so I prefer to not read stories with that. Knowing a story has it means I can make an informed decision whether to spend my time on that fic or not.

Things like bashing, (fem)slash, pairings, dark!Harry, etc. are things that people like to know upfront.

** I reckon if you jumped into the sub's discord or IRC channel you would find people willing to read a few bits and give you some tips. I know in the past there have been a few people all with a google docs file open at the same time checking it over for someone. Just ask, don't push.

** I'm writing and posting OC as well. I planned to share it from the beginning because I wanted feedback that would either help me improve, or affirm that someone else could derive some enjoyment from my writing.

For my experience, reviews have consisted almost entirely of the latter kind; in other words, if you're hoping for helpful critique from readers, you're likely to be left wanting. I've had one constructive review because I asked it of another writer. However, I've received a few shorter reactions and thoughts from those who are following the story's progress, and they've all been motivating to read and reread, because it means someone is (or had been) at least a little invested. Even checking the views once in a while serves to spur me on. Overall, the decision to post has done well for my enthusiasm.

Based on this, I'll say if you want to post your story to share it with readers and see how they take it, you should! But if you only want criticism aimed at building your skills, you're better off inquiring after writers for a mutual exchange, or finding a beta.

It's worth considering the impact posting may have on you mentally, particularly if you live with anxiety or low self-esteem, and you know you'll find it difficult to throw off negative or nonexistent responses toward your work. In this case I would advise you give it a shot anyway and see how you feel, and take it down if the experience does you more harm than good. Keep in mind that you'll never please everyone (so write and post what you most want to), and that no criticism or praise is automatically valid, no matter how eloquent or harsh the wording; it's down to you to decide what merits the reviews have and react accordingly.

If you decide to post something you have completed, release it one chapter at a time, once or twice a week. I've found the best time to be Sunday evening, I think. Staggering the release like this extends your exposure, and readers enjoy following a story with a consistent schedule. If you attract a mean-spirited guest review, consider leaving it up; it may incite someone who liked the story to contradict that sentiment.

I hope there's something helpful buried in my rambling. Good luck, have fun.

*** This is so insightful and I'm really grateful for you taking the time to share your experience.

It's good to know about what other's experience of receiving reviews is and a scheduled release per chapter sounds like a good idea.

I think I'll do a bit more browsing of other fanfics and see how they structure their releases before going ahead.

Thankyou

** Bro, I'm always looking for new content. As long as it's structured properly, I'll leave a review and see how you could improve. My biggest pet peeve are those docs where grammar goes right out the window.

*** Thankyou! I will let you know once I decide for sure and am ready to publish something. My biggest pet peeve is grammar too so hopefully mine is good mostly, haha!
