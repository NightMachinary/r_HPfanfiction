#+TITLE: Do you suppose that it's ethical to grow and harvest Mandrakes because they're an annual plant? Germinating, reaching adolescence, maturing, producing seeds, then dying off (after which it's much less bad to cut them up)?

I mean, if they can reach maturity in less than a year, it's entirely possible that they'd die off within the year as well, after doing their reseeding. Like plants, not animals.

It'd help make the use of the Mandrake Restorative Potion a /bit/ more ethical, at least; instead of sadistically murdering plant-people in the prime of their life, it's just harvesting their organs after their death. Grave-robbing instead of serial killing.


** Or they're not even sentient, much less sapient. They're just regular old magical plants that some nutbag wizard gave zits to while making them.

*** So...mandrakes are philosophical zombies? Creatures that accurately mimic human-like physical/psychological/social behaviour, but in fact have no actual cognitive functions and don't experience qualia?

**** All we know is that they cry and they jump between pots to mate. This is not really a sign of any particular level of intelligence above your typical farm animal.

But in any event, I doubt they have souls.

  Mandrakes not only resemble humans, but also have similar behaviours to them. In the 1992-1993 school year, the Mandrakes, at one point of time, *became moody and secretive, which indicated that they were reaching adolescence.* Later on, *they threw a loud and raucous party*, which is comparable to humans when they are teenagers,

I don't know, they sound sentient enough to me.

** The idea of protecting animals, children and the poor from unnecessary cruelty started to gain traction in the late 18th century - So it's entirely possible the wizards just missed it.

Take house elves for an example. The Blacks are allowed to execute and display the old ones, despite them being practically deformed humans.

** We don't know if mandrakes lose their magic after their prime. Considering that potions used timing pretty regularly I'd like to assume that magicals only harvest mandrakes at the point where their magic is most powerful. Also, like [[/u/Astramancer_][u/Astramancer_]] said, we're not even sure if they are sentient.

Of course you can make the other side of the arguments. Wizards are stupid and unethical, that harvesting mandrakes after they died is a possible alternative.

  Consider the curiously humanoid mandrake root, or mandragora. It is hideously ugly, deadly dangerous, and a powerful restorative. Why would anything else matter? * * A tale of horror. Please review. * *
