** It's from a deleted fic "what everyone missed" by chelseyb. Chapter 3 specifically.

** I feel like it's called something like “what everyone knew” but I can't find it now. I think every chapter was a character finding out about Harry and Tonks? I could be mixing it up though

** That's hilarious, though I'd prefer a slightly different pairing for Tonks, I'd honestly read Tonks/AlmostAnyone just for that prompt. And the people observing don't even have to Fred and George.
