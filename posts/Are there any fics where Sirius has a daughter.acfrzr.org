*** It's genres are really Angst, Drama and it would have been too long if it was just 10% of it's actual word count. Guess it's alright if you have literally nothing else to read...

** The entire Dangerverse is a family-centric Universe of very well written fics, and Sirius has a daughter. Their relationship and family dynamic is very important to the stories.

If I remember correctly, this was originally finished back in 2003-2004, so is pre-HBP and pre-DH. That said, I think of this series when I think of stories I like more than HBP and DH.

**** Yeah, I love it. My only issue was Harry's animagus form. Melanie's wolf form was cool, but Harry's weird Liger with Basilisk venom wings and fangs was just offputting.
