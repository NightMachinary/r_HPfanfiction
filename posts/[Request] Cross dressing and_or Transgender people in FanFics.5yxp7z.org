Point Me towards stories featuring cross dressing or transgender people, please and thank you.

Bonus points if the story is longer than 40k words.


** The entire plot of the Pureblood Pretense series is just femHarry crossdressing.

The Harveste Addams series also features a crossdressing Harry, although he's a boy dressing as a girl in this one.

** linkffn(Harveste Addams)

Its a good story next to completely fulfilling your requirements. I love it because Harry / Harveste just /owns/ her being "not normal", embraces it even.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

*Holly*, linkffn(7236252): trans!Harry/Snape

*Truth in Transformation*, linkao3(2659871): Post-DH trans!Harry coming to terms with being trans.

*A Stranger in Your Own Body*, linkffn(8455342): trans!Harry fic starting from early childhood in an orphanage.

*Season of Change*, linkffn(9928419), *Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool*, linkffn(8175132), and *Becoming Harriet*, linkffn(11578510): These are all more in the genre of "Harry gets turned into a girl", but still worth mentioning.

  Harry reads a chapter of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to his children before bed every night and through the story, he and his middle child find an ally in each other as they, along with Alice, discover a world that just doesn't seem to make sense when taken at face value. The more aware Harry becomes - embracing his child's reality - the more motivated he is to build a wizarding world that is fully inclusive, and by processing these life lessons finds he's able to connect with another person in ways that have always eluded him.

*** There's a lot of shit that Harry doesn't see, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist in-universe. How many fanfics have we read depicting foreign countries in the Potterverse? Or exploring the personalities of OCs and minor characters?

#+begin_quote
  How many people with Down Syndrome did Harry see at Hogwarts? How many people with Autism or Aspergers?
#+end_quote

Polite magical society can barely handle squibs. How do you think it would handle low-functioning people mentally incompetent to use magic? Like, for example, Ariana Dumbledore? Do you think they'd be paraded about?

As for the higher-functioning individuals, I'd imagine that they just pass for struggling neurotypicals in the Potterverse.

*** The Wizarding culture would, at best, shun or kick any "abnormals" out of the family, like the fucking /Weasleys/ did with their /squib/ relative (WTF Weasleys?), or even outright exterminate them, as I imagine Purebloods like the Blacks would. Most squibs would fail the "bounce" test (WTF Longottoms?).

As for the rest? Do you think Hogwarts would accept any such students, considering the rampant bigotry and discrimination in the Wizarding culture? Lucius Malfoy was the chairman on the Hogwarts Board of Governors. I'm surprised they allowed +mud+ /muggle/borns.

Lupin doesn't count. Nobody knew, and he obviously was one of Dumbledore's pet "projects" since no other werewolves were admitted.

Lovegoods.

That said, Down Syndrome could well be exclusive to muggles, like I imagine spattergroit is exclusive to wizards.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Classifying sexual/gender preferences as "mental abnormalities" is surprisingly unpopular outside very conservative and/or Christian circles. As the downvotes here should tell you. And the expression "stamp out" is just ... no.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States][I admit this is for US, but I can't find a UK study, but it is saying a .3% is trans, and 3.8% are LGBT.]] Furthermore schooling ends by 17, and people that come out as LGBT happen late teens, early 20s on average. Plus again, Harry knew like a dozen people close enough that he would have a chance of knowing that about them.

#+begin_quote
  The American College of Pediatricians urges healthcare professionals, educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex. Facts -- not ideology -- determine reality.
#+end_quote

Fuck off. The "reality" of the situation is that I can either be a "chemical and surgical impersonation" or I can be a miserable waste on the brink of suicide.

#+begin_quote
  Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of male and female, respectively -- not genetic markers of a disorder.
#+end_quote

Define "disorder" in a useful way, and I'll get back to you.

#+begin_quote
  No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one.
#+end_quote

No shit Sherlock. That doesn't fix gender dysphoria.

#+begin_quote
  A person's belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such.
#+end_quote

No transgender person is disconnected from reality in this way - the very basis of gender dysphoria is being able to /recognize and comprehend/ the sex characteristics of your body, and to dislike them and/or wish to change them.

To call oneself a gender in opposition to one's sex characteristics is a coping mechanism, not a delusion.

#+begin_quote
  The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.
#+end_quote

That's nice, it doesn't fix gender dysphoria.

#+begin_quote
  Puberty is not a disease and puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous.
#+end_quote

Define 'disease' in a useful way, and I'll get back to you.

Puberty blocking definitely can be dangerous. So is gender dysphoria.

#+begin_quote
  According to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.
#+end_quote

The DSM-V actually says “Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%.”

#+begin_quote
  Pre-pubertal children who use puberty blockers to impersonate the opposite sex will require cross-sex hormones in late adolescence. This combination leads to permanent sterility. These children will never be able to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology.
#+end_quote

Yes, it does lead to sterility. That's why going on hormones or hormone blockers is a choice that does have drawbacks and must be considered carefully.

#+begin_quote
  In addition, cross-sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.
#+end_quote

How do you think bioidentical hormones and sexual dimorphism work, exactly? Gonads aside, all sexual dimorphism is driven by hormones; if you're on the correct doses of bioidentical hormones then you will respond to them the same way the opposite sex would. This is the entire reason that puberty works.

And meanwhile, untreated gender dysphoria is associated with dangerous health risks like depression and suicide.

#+begin_quote
  Rates of suicide are nearly twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery, even in Sweden which is among the most LGBTQ -- affirming countries.
#+end_quote

The ACP is misinterpreting the study they quote from here. Discussing /that/ would be a post on it's own, but the authors of the study themselves would reject this interpretation.

#+begin_quote
  Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.
#+end_quote

Is it normal? Probably not. Is it healthful? Well, it's certainly healthier than doing nothing in many cases.

#+begin_quote
  Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.
#+end_quote

Ah yes, "unnecessary" "mutilation".

#+end_quote

I'll just point out that the data used for this is very old data from the time when actual sex-change--related stuff was fairly primitive and didn't give good results, the people who did it were mostly older which further hindered their transition, and the level of acceptance everywhere was even lower than it now is in bigot circles of USA, which resulted in people making attempts at their lives due to ostracism and being treated as shit by everyone around them. With people who get treatment and aren't ostracised by those around them the suicide rates nowadays are on a level close enough to that of the general populace that they can be treated as the same.

I doubt you'll get to the person who posted this rubbish, but at least people who do care but didn't know will learn something new now.

They probably wouldn't care. I think Rowling was trying to depict a society with /different/ kinds of prejudice (pro human, pro pureblood) rather than a society with more prejudice altogether.

Yeah. Human transfiguration is dangerous, and teenagers love doing dangerous things. I'm honestly surprised that we don't see more of it; I'd imagine there are or have been fads for magical body modification in some parts of the world.

Not to mention that with magic, the Wizarding World might not be under the same pressures (e.g. sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive needs) that caused us muggles to adapt with conservative scarcity morality. All of this is speculative, of course.
