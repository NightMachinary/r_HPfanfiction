*** Seconding the recommendation for Lily, it was a great read if a bit too surreal in some places. 'A Long Journey Home' is also pretty good

**** Its one of my favorites but its heartbreaking that its been over a year since the last update. I should send the author a message to see if they are still around.

EDIT: I am referring to Long Journey Home.

*** I dont know what it is about that fic. I enjoy it when I read it, but every time I've tried I peter out about when the group leaves Harry's home on Kashyyyk. I mean, I really enjoy The Havoc Side of the Force which has many similarities and I enjoy long fics in general but for some reason I can't get past that point in I Still Haven't Found What I'm Lookng For

** Unfortunately the only recommendation I got is a Sailor Moon cross. I won't link it since you said no anime, but I'm interested to see what other people have to say! This is certainly an interesting take on Harry!

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

It has a fem!Harry and isn't finished but is definitely one of the best stories in the fandom.
