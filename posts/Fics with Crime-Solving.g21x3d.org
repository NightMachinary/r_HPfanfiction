So, I'm looking for some fics where a character is trying to solve or investigate a crime. They can be an actual auror or whatever headcanoned branch of Unspeakable Not-CIA-But-Basically-CIA types you can think of, an independent gumshoe (Private Investigator/Detective), or just a citizen wrapped up in something they shouldn't. Or hell, even another criminal trying to find out who did something to them so they can make the culprit go sleep with the fishies.

But yeah. Fics where something illegal happens and some other people are investigating, please. If they go into the actual details of investigating magical crimes, that'd be extra good, but I don't think there'll be many of those, so I'm open to anything that has characters investigating crimes in any way at all.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D)

EDIT - Added the last line because I forgot to add it in initially. Man, I take so many words to just say 'post everything you got!'. (Insert cry-laughing emoji here). :D

*** Do I need to know anything about DC stuff for that? The only DC movie I've seen is Logan - though the newest Wonderwoman is on the list - and I've never read a superhero comic. Put it this way, I had to google to find out Gotham was Batman's turf. That's my level of Superhero ignorance. :D

**** I don't believe so. The story does a pretty good job at explaining itself. My DC knowledge is pretty mediocre also. There are three big DC names in the story that I know, and I only ever seen Batman. Only know the other two by name. The bad guys name probably should ring some bells, which could add to the story, but I don't know him either.

I think that the story is focused enough on finding Neville that anyone should manage. You might not make some connections, but the overall story readable.

** linkffn(12315670) is largely structured around exactly such a thing. In the author's profile it's described as "A magical whodunnit" (although in the interest of calibrating expectations I'll mention it's no more solvable by the reader than a randomly-selected case of Sherlock Holmes ðŸ˜‰).

(Per your request: the story overall has an M rating and starts off with a warning about a sex scene. It is in chapter nine, and if you would like to skip past it, you can search for the text "Oh Harry. How do you keep getting into these situations?". You will have a fairly good/gradual indication of when you may want to do so, i.e. not right away.)

*** Yeah. I don't think I've seen a fanfic that 'plays fair' when they do the whodunnit thing yet. Mystery is hard to write, after all. But thank you for calibrating in advance, both in the mystery and the smut. I've enjoyed some of LeQuins other works too, so that bodes well for this one. Thanks for the rec!

As I remember, there's no smut in those.

*** A very interesting introduction - does the Snape-Harry Romance have some actual build-up/growth to it or has Harry gone mad/obtained a moderate to severe case of amnesiac masochism to shack up with his bullying ex-teacher? Which is probably a somewhat harsh-sounding way to ask if Snape is OOC or grows away from being his canon bitter old bastard self, but I didn't mean it harshly and the translation is there if you need it. :D

**** I read the fic a while back but I recall Snape being somewhat OOC and the romance taking some time to build up to. Honestly, the mystery parts of the fic outweigh any romance in it.

***** Cool. It won't stop me reading either way, it's just something I've found is good to check on first. Setting expectations and all that. Helps me feel a little less squicked out by a pairing between what is essentially the Magical version of a Nazi and a half-Jew.
