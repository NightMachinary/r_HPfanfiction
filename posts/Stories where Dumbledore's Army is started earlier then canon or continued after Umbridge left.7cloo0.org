Just as it says, looking for any stories where Dumbledore's Army is either started earlier then it was in canon or continued after Umbridge left and we saw it happening. Bonus points if more students joined.

I always thought it was a shame that it wasn't continued, at least not until seventh year with the Death Eaters in control. I just thought it would have been good because Neville seemed to be doing good, even Ron seemed to be doing better at Defence and the other students there was definitely improvement.

So yeah any stories where Dumbledore's Army is either started earlier or continued after Umbridge left.Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No character bashing please. And would rather it not be Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine. Am fine with het/slash/femslas and any rating is fine.


** linkffn(My Brother) A DA-like organization is started in Harry's third year and uses the Room of requirement.

linkffn(Return of the Marauders) The DA was still going strong in seventh year, until Harry had them rebranded as part of the Marauders.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
