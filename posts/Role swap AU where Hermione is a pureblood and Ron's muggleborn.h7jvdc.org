Hermione Granger comes from an old pureblood family. With both her parents as healers in St Mungo's, and her talents recognized and nurtured since infancy, she enters Hogwarts as well intentioned, but a complete know-it-all.

Arthur and Molly Weasley are normal, loving parents who struggle to get by on a dead-end government tech job. When all seven of their children begin showing magical talent, they're excited and enthusiastic about this new world, albeit a bit apprehensive. Now that Ron, the youngest boy, is starting Hogwarts, he struggles to fit in and find his own place in this new world.

Enter Harry Potter.

How would this change alter the story? What differences would occur, both in terms of plot and character arcs?


** No Chamber of Secrets. The whole reason it happened was because Arthur Weasley was doing raids in search of dark artifacts in canon. That has a whole host of knock on effects.

As for ancestry...

Perhaps one of Arthur's ancestors was a Marius Black? This plays off the fact Arthur's mother was a Black in canon. Prewetts, I think would be replaced by the Blishwicks, and the Grangers would become the Dagworth-Grangers. So, Hermione's mother is a Blishwick, and Hermione's father is of the Dagworth-Grangers.

*** Though this could be ever more dangerous as when Voldy return's he would have that memory version of himself (diary), and he might try to get himself to that version of him, and as it happens later on they might not be aware, or the Basilisk could be big thread in the final battle.

*** The chamber could still happen. The Malfoys still hate muggles and think it's funny to slip an evil artifact into the hands of an unsuspecting Muggleborn. Especially one who hangs around with a pureblood and thinks they're worthy. Or they disapprove of Hermione hanging with Muggleborn riffraff and slip it into hers thinking to take her down a few pegs. Doesn't make it impossible, just have to have a different reason for why Lucius gives the diary and maybe who he gives it to. From school it could end up in anyone's hands, so he could even send it with Draco and tell him to “lose it” in the library.

*** I've read a lot of fics that had squibs were spelled so that they can not talk about being a squib at all even if one of their kids or grandkids end-up with magic. Their magical family not wanting the shame of having a squib in the family or of having a "Muggle-born" show up wanting a part of the family fortune. Or were Obliviated.

Now if all 8 of the Weasley family's grandparents were squibs from different lines I would love to see all of them meeting as children in a hospital/orphanage/group home/support group/all patients of same doctor as victims of a kind of mass amnesia, because all 8 were over obliviated and were found completely lost around the age of 10.

Picture end of World War 1, 8 youths estimated to be about 10 years old having been found near hospitals or churches or wandering around London with no memory on how they got there. They band together, ending up paired off and getting married around the mid 1920's. Have kids around 1930ish, who end up together and have Arthur and Molly around the early 1950's, who get married and have Bill in the fall of 1971.

**** This is really funny because imagine some classmate noticing that the Weasley kids have mildly pureblood-like features and then they see a picture of all their grandparents together and freak out because some of them look basically identical to a lot of their cousins. And. What the fuck. The Weasleys are just sorta vibing with basically the "purest" blood and everyone thought they were muggleborns y'know.

***** Who would need a photo? With the 8 grands all being Squibs they would live longer than muggles, so at the time Ron enters Hogwarts they are in their early 80's and still look and are as active as Muggles in their late 50's/early 60's. I could see the 4 couples of Grands all taking a train in to London to be there as there youngest great-grandson (Ron) or great-granddaughter (Ginny) comes home from school the first time or even the last time. SO they are all right out side platform 9 3/4 and are spotted by either a pureblood who ends up outside the platform by accident or a halfblood who knows their pureblood halves family tree well.

*** "No, it's /not/ a broom, it's--- look, it's like the Hogwarts Express, right? But scaled down so three people sit in a row, and it follows a looping, sloping track through the air, and while the twins are right in how it's /like/ a broom, it's a broom, on rails like a train, with buckles and a safety bar and everything is safe six ways to Sunday so you get the excitement of being scared without any of the danger!" Ron gives an aggrieved sigh as he rubs his face, apparently already feeling a headache coming on. "Harry, help a mate out here, will ya?"

"I've never been on a rollercoaster, but if it's at all like flying, I think it sounds fun."

Ron started to relax as he noticed Hermione take on her "I'm thinking don't bug me" look rather than her "I'm trying to kill you with my eyes before your stupidity infects me" look, when Harry just had to ruin it.

"Of course, the exciting part will be that I'm not in control; scary to happen mid-flight, but if it's all on rails..."

** I'd expect that Arthur would be just as enthusiastic about combining muggle tech with magic as he is canonically, but with the twist of doing so for economical purposes.

Why have a flying invisible car, when they cam just make both his and Molly's cars never require petrol? That's loads saved in bimonthly top ups. And we know the Queen and Prime Minister already know /of/ the Magical World, even if they're not connected enough to be in the loop, so what if whatever spellwork Arthur got done was applied to all Government cars? That'd be a massive decrease in funds needed to keep them running, freeing up budget for other projects---and if you're a government worker who is told "you don't need to refuel the cars, they'll be taken care of while they're parked," you'd probably just be relieved you don't have to worry about it to ever give it a thought, all without necessitating mass notice-me-nots or confundus spells.

A decent salary increase for Arthur after all that could easily explain their ability to travel to Egypt without winning a Wizarding lotto.

Percy's no-nonsense drive to become part of the Ministry of Magic could be given a new twist as well, with him doing so hoping to get into the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office to help his father get more magically enhanced muggle artifacts considered legal.

The Wesley's being pragmatic good guys like that would be a really refreshing change to the fanfiction layout.

** These changes would affect the story from the very beginning. How would Harry even get to Platform 9 3/4? He would probably have to get help from someone else. It's possible he may or may not end up friends with Ron and Hermione. It would be easier for Hermione to adjust to Hogwarts, and I don't think the troll incident would take place. The whole chamber of secrets plot wouldn't exist. How does Scabbers play into this? I don't think he'd stay at the Weasleys. Maybe he stayed with another family. Sirius Black escaped because he saw Scabbers in the newspaper. So that also gets affected! Just a few initial thoughts.

*** Platform 9 3/4- same way. Molly (Muggle) is escorting her children the same way, or alternatively Fred/George spot him and give him a friendly hand.

Troll incident (and her inability to fit in) is caused by Hermione's know-it-all-ness, not her lack of magical knowledge. I don't see why this couldn't happen the same way.

Scabbers-replace with Crookshanks, or have Hermione have Scabbers. I do think replacing with Crookshanks is more Hermione-like. Although I don't see why Ron couldn't have a rat that his brother found at Hogwarts or something similar. Bill could win the lottery instead and invites his family to come to Egypt with the winnings. Lots of possibilities.

** Well he would know of magic already, as all his older siblings where magical. Maybe his parent have some help from goverment as they are muggles now, and when Billy and Charles start working, they could have started helping financially somewhat.

They could still live in country side, but instead of gnomes in the garden they would have moles or badgers.

They would have went to school before Hogwarts, so that would change some things education wise, maybe Ron had different interestes as muggleborn for studying.

It could still be Ron/Hermione and have it be more focused on Hermiones family as well, like her parents visiting the muggle family (Arthur and Molly) and wondering on things, have Hermiones parent's have a magical job, maybe they invented some potions for teeth etc.

I would like to believe that Harry being the boy who lived and Ron a muggle born, would make his live somewhat different, he would not nessesarely know about Harry, unless his brothers talked about it, but he might still not know much, so their dynamic could be different, though as Harry wouldn't know much about magic either, they would be discovering it together.

I would see Arthur and Molly going to stay with Charlie or Bill for safety from Voldemort in 7th book timeline, and hide with them.

Oh and Weasley's would have some type of mini-van to fit all of their children.

And Molly's brothers instead of dying in the Wizarding war, would have been in army and died while in war/conflict (not sure about what was going on in right time) and that would have also different effect on her and the family.
