Hi Everyone! I'm looking for a fic where Harry and his sibling don't know that the other exists and they meet for the first time at hogwards. I would like that they have a good relationship after meeting and also they distrust Albus for separating them. Do you know some Fic like that ? Thak you in advance!


** I read this fic, not a hundred percent of what you want,they meet when they go to Diagon Alley but the rest of it is pretty much spot on here it is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11642616/1/]]
