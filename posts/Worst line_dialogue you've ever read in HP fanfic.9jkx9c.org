There's some really bad stuff out there- sometimes intentional, sometimes not. Share your favorite!

I'll never forget reading over a decade ago about a character reaching down Hermione's pants and fingering her through her "vagina hair". It will be with me always.

Always.

In prose there's something of a convention that "no contraction = formality", but in real life, failure to use contractions in speech is a sign of lack of fluency, not sophistication.

****** Oh yeah. Contractions in spoken English are like liaison in French. If the stress pattern of the sentence permits it, they are mandatory. And there's tons of contractions English speakers say, but don't write formally. And stress patterns/contractions vary by dialect and accent.

The frustrating thing for me about learning Spanish is that in all languages you have to mush your words together and slur your speech. But every language does this totally differently, and not doing it properly is a huge red flag that you're not a native speaker.

******* I wouldn't say it's /mandatory/ to use them, but I would say that unless you have a good reason to do otherwise you should use them when it's possible to do so. Because not using a contraction is a good way to put emphasis on the second word of the two that are contracted, what with it being on the first word by default.

That said, if someone claims that not using contractions at all is speaking English properly then they're a lost cause. It's like writing in Russian but without using the Cyrillic script and claiming that this is the proper way to do it.

I think we're both saying the same thing, just phrasing it differently. The rules in my head are (1) in English comparison/emphasis is conveyed by stressing a word and (2) contractions cannot occur in certain areas (e.g. when the 2nd word is being stressed).

In all other cases, not using a contraction makes someone sound weird to me.

Yeah I agree with your second point; one possible reason could be that a lot of contractions are accent-specific, and certain accents are valued by society more than others. So if a contraction happens in a stigmatized accent (e.g. Imma or ain't) people will inherently think of it as "not proper english."

So I wonder if maybe hundreds of years ago, contractions everyone uses (e.g. "it's", "i'm") were similarly stigmatized, and it just stuck around?

No clue tbh.

****** Do you not stratify them by skill/experience?

In the US, you'll have the team that you compete with (Varsity) and an entire secondary team of players who you're training to eventually be on Varsity (Junior Varsity). The idea is that your JV team isn't super good, but by putting them on a team, by the time they're Varsity they'll be a lot better.

How does the UK train younger players? IIRC Hogwarts only has 1 team per house and tryouts are basically an open season.

******* UK schools do sports teams by year group. Year 7 (in HP, First Year) will have a team, Year 8 will have a team, etc. If the school is big enough, there will be an A team and B team for each year group.

If the school also has a sixth form college attached (in HP, Sixth Year and Seventh Year), then the lines might become a bit blurred. There will be a "first team" and a "second team" which roughly correspond to Upper Sixth (seventh year) and Lower Sixth (sixth year) respectively, but skilled Lower Sixth players will be put onto the first team (and in rare cases, someone from Year 11 -- Fifth Year -- may also make it onto the first team).

Appendix

Year 7 - First year

Year 8 - Second year

Year 9 - Third year

Year 10 - Fourth year

Year 11 (take GCSE exams)- Fifth year (take O.W.L. exams)

At this point students may choose to leave school, or attend a Sixth Form college to take A-Levels.

Lower Sixth - Sixth Year

Upper Sixth (take A-Levels) - Seventh Year (take N.E.W.Ts)

**** And semester, extra credit projects, assignments, advanced classes. These writers need to read up on English boarding schools of the late colonial era before they try to write Hogwarts. St Trinians, whatever school Enid Blyton set her tween series in, etc.

Also people thinking Harry and Ron were mediocre students. OWLs were school leaving qualifications, and just passing them meant you were a reasonably competent witch/wizard/warlock. They're looking at these characters grades through grade inflated modern eyes in a society where a bachelor's degree is now considered a basic school leaving qualification by most middle class people. In the old days, just passing University Entrance was a huge deal, because not many did.

It can make sense for a muggleborn to say things like "Christ, Sweet Jesus, Oh My God, variation there-of while a pureblood talks Merlin, Godric's Sword, Circe, etc. Then if you want to throw in another layer, older muggleborns tend to use the pureblood swear more or catch themselves and change to it to better fit in.
