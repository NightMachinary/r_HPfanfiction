** Hey, OP! Good luck on your beta search.

With the new wiki, I've added a page for authors and betas to connect and get noticed. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/authorbeta][Here's the link]]. Everyone listed under the "Beta" section is available and okay with being PM'd, so feel free to reach out to them.

***** I've never heard it called that, ha! Always say Dramione. No, it is not, thought there is a bit of flirtation between them. :)
