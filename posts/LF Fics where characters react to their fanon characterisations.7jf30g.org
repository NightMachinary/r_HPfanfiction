I'm aware that this is an incredibly cheesy idea, but hey, sometimes that's what I want.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender-flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

*** Wow. Just, wow.

You put JUST the ID. Literally, that's it. AND the bot didn't work.

There was absolutely no description for me to go on. Literally nothing but the ID and I had to PUT THAT IN MYSELF to get to the story.

So MUCH working against someone reading this, and it's absolutely FUCKING hilarious. This might be one of the most refreshing things I've read in months.

I'm seriously shocked.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
