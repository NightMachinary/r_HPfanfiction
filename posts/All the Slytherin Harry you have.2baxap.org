*** I have seen this recommended here a tonne but the crossover aspect has always caused me to shy away from starting it. Is this really worth reading? How much of the crossover aspects affect the story?(if that makes any sense)

**** Being the author, I'm afraid to say I have to give it a recommendation.

But the story isn't really a crossover. The EG world doesn't exist. The story inspires it, of course, but the influences are only that. It isn't a plot lift

***** Haha fair enough, as I say it has always intrigued me but when it comes to crossovers I generally turn my head. Thanks for clearing that up for me.

**** KwanLi isn't in a position to recommend it, but I am.

I dislike most Harry-centric stories, and loathe most crossovers. I love Ender's Game, and have an automatic dislike of everything that tries to copy it in some form or another.

And yet, this story is awesome in my eyes. Even if this story goes on the H/Hr route (which is a pairing I particularly hate, because in my opinion that's just about incest), the characters and premise are developed enough for it to work and still be awesome. It's up there with Applied Cultural Anthropology at the top of my "can't wait for an update" list. It succeeds where others fail: great action scenes, developed characters, a compelling plot, and most of all, no forced romance (because it's not needed, the story can stand on it's own without that particularly overused crutch).

It's a must-read, and if you don't have a problem with Harry-centric stories, this is probably the best work in progress out there.

***** Yeah, I recommend it too, I think it's my favorite story that's actually being worked on.

I kind of disliked the part with the Unspeakables, it seems that they're too overpowered for the story to work unless they're miraculously on the same side, but that's the only flaw I can think of.

Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!

Rated: Fiction T - English - Harry P. - Chapters: 60 - Words: 244,659 - Reviews: 1,280 - Favs: 1,468 - Follows: 867 - Updated: Dec 7, 2009 - Published: Jul 31, 2008 - Status: Complete - id: 4438449

As the Author's note says, you don't need to know anything about the DC/Vertigo comics to catch on to what's happening with Harry. That said, familiarity may help you to appreciate the style of storytelling a bit more, as the author tries to keep things moody and atmospheric similar to Neil Gaiman's writing.

***** Yea, I always felt there wasn't enough humor. Although it won't be a collection of short stories that are mostly humor based, I'm still going to have a lot of humor. I wasn't planning on Harry to be as dark as "On The Way To Greatness" but somewhere in a mix between the Harry from Slytherin Selection and WWSHD.

** I realize this is 2 months later but if you haven't come across this one already, I'm about to blow your mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] by Dethryl.

This story is really long and really good with the exception (in my opinion) of excessive Ron-bashing. Basically, Harry and Draco become friends when they first meet in Diagon Alley and it shapes the rest of Harry's Hogwarts career. Years 1-5 are already written and I'm holding out hope for 6 and 7!

Also it has many non-canon pairings!

*** Well, like I said. Hopefully nothing too un-canon like that didn't ever really have a chance of happening in canon, but if it's believable, (and seeing as how I don't want romance to be the main focal point of the story anyway) and part of a good story, I wouldn't say no.
