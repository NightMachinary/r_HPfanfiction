Hello, it just occurred to me that the subject aforementioned could be a source of infinite tear-jerking sweet, sweet drama, and I can't remember having ever read it truly exploited in any fashion.

So, if you have ever seen that in a fic it would be great if you could share it.

Otherwise, perhaps some of you who are the most well-endowed in the dramatic quill department- in which I am personally sorely lacking- would like to give it a spin.

Seeking the feels, yours, Caterpi.


** Fawkes cries years onto Dumvledore's hand.

Doesn't work.
