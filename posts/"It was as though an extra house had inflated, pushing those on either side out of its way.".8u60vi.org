There's another thread on this subreddit at the moment about a flying base in Harry Potter and [[/u/hellstrike]] made some compelling arguments as to why it would be untenable - mostly because it would be too easily detectable. But then, his argument made me think about the Fidelius Charm.

The Fidelius Charm, to those outside of the know, seems to literally fold space so that the object being hidden essentially /doesn't exist/. This is a Discussion Thread about how, exactly, the Fidelius Charm functions. Because canon often seems contradictory on what, exactly, the Fidelius does to hide its secret.

  I assume this is what the fidelius does. In my headcanon, you simply cannot know that #13 Grimauld Place exists. Like your brain will never assimilate that information.

  So your brain fits in the gaps. There is no space folding. Nothing is moving. But your brain simply blots it out so cannot see it.

I would go so far as to say this is actual canon, not headcanon. When the Fidelius is described in PoA, the following is stated:

#+begin_quote
  As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!”
#+end_quote

The protected location is not physically out of space, but rather out of perception/comprehension.

***** I would not say that the Fidelius operates directly on the minds of the people it affects - that would require the spell to have global and potentially even universal scope, where in general HP magic requires the target to be within visual range. It's not possible, for example, for you to just cast an obliviate on everyone in the world. If it were, maintaining secrecy would be a lot easier.

Rather I would propose that the magic works on the information directly, like how the taboo is placed on a word. This means that the magic is not over a large territory - information has no location - but nonetheless affects everyone, everywhere.

****** Magic doesn't have to be in the targets visual range. Voldemort's name taboo had a global (or country wide) scope after all (one of the most impressive and underrated bits of magic cast in canon imho). The trace seems to work in a global way too somehow. Furthermore, the curse on the Defense position didn't even target a person but an intangible concept.

**** In canon sunlight still reaches Grimauld Place, you don't feel anything out of the ordinary (no heat, no compression) when you enter, and Taure put some quotes above where Flitwick talks about the charm. Characters can breath normally in Gimauld place, air pressure is pretty similar to standard levels, and you can see what happens outside the home.

As long as whatever system you devise fits all of that, there's no reason it can't be how it works. To me this is just the simplest thing that hits all of those issues.

Honestly, I think so. Similarly, if you put a giant piece of metal on the front porch, a metal detector in the area would still beep.

In my headcanon, that's why wizards also put wards and stuff on their houses to protect against those kinds of attacks.

** In addition to [[/u/JoseElEntrenador][u/JoseElEntrenador]]'s post on physical vs perceived concealment, there is another issue relating to the Fidelius worth addressing, which many people seem to struggle with: whether you can be the secret keeper for yourself.

We will shortly see that the question is poorly put. Here's what we know about the mechanics of the Fidelius Charm:

#+begin_quote
  “How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.

  “An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical *concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul*. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!”
#+end_quote

We can extract a lot of information from this.

Firstly, secrets are treated by magic as real existing things which are located within souls and can be transferred. This is par for the course in HP magic, which often treats abstract concepts as magically real. It especially lines up with the line in CoS that to share a secret is to share a part of your soul:

#+begin_quote
  “If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her...”
#+end_quote

Secondly, the Fidelius Charm works by *transferring* the location of a secret, into the soul of the Secret-Keeper.

If there is a transfer into a soul, then the question arises: where is the transfer coming *from*? We might logically suppose that there is also a "Secret-Giver", the person in whose soul the secret was originally located.

So the answer to the question "can you be your own secret keeper?" depends on whether or not you can effect a transfer of the secret or not.

Scenario one: you want to hide a location which you currently hold the secret to. You cannot perform a transfer and so you cannot use the Fidelius with yourself as the Secret Keeper. You can hide the location, but you need a third party Secret Keeper.

Scenario two: you want to hide a location which someone else currently holds the secret to. They can transfer the secret to you via the Fidelius Charm and the location will be hidden.

Notice that the concept of inhabitation of the location is not a part of this system. It's all about transfer from Secret Giver to Keeper. Nor is the person casting the spell important.

So consider James and Lily. As a married couple, who both lived at and likely jointly owned Godric's Hallow, we might suppose that they were both in possession of the secret of its location. Therefore they cannot be their own secret keeper, because they already hold the secret. They need to pass it on to someone else.

On the other hand, consider Shell Cottage. We don't know who owns this cottage but in the movies it is stated to be Muriel's. I don't consider that canon but it is suggestive. Whatever the case, so long as Bill and Fleur are not the Secret Givers, then it's perfectly consistent for Bill to be able to be the Secret Keeper and live there.

Of course, this all pushes the mysteries of the Fidelius into two questions:

1. What information counts as a secret? Presumably it is not all information that a person knows. It seems to be limited to locations, for a start.

2. When is a person considered to be the natural possessor of a secret? This is important because it determines when a person has a secret within their soul, the existence of which is a precondition of being able to use the Fidelius to hide it via transfer. In the above, I have supposed that ownership of a location is an important factor in determining in whose soul a secret is located.

One imagines the answers to these questions are complex, thus why Flitwick calls it a complex spell.

*** For context: I've read your HP Magic System doc and thought it was well-written and a great read. But it left me with a question (that's far more philosophical than constructive).

Something I've always wanted to ask you, since you're a big proponent of deducing Harry Potter's magic system from canon quotes. Where do you draw the line between facts and just character speculation?

For example, who's to say Flitwick hasn't dumbed down explanation of such a complex charm for Madam Rosmerta. Physicists do it all the time. Off the top of my head, particles aren't spheres, this is just something used to teach to kids.

Similarly, Genetics doesn't really follow the Punnet Square model. We just show this to high schoolers because it's a good starting point for later learning how genes actually work.

Are "secrets"/whathaveyou just like "particles" in Physics? Like they don't really exist, but Flitwick isn't going to teach a bartender quantum mechanics.

Similarly, when Riddle says his spiel, I always interpreted it as figurative. Like no one's pouring their soul, it's just that Ginny is trusting Tom' s influence more.

Now obviously this is a slippery slope. For example, you could make this argument for most of canon magic, at which point we know nothing about it. And what's the fun in that? But I wonder if you have some sort of internal checklist of what makes a valid source, or do you take every quote as valid?

**** Well, rule 1 is that anything stated by Hermione or Dumbledore is true, because JKR has stated [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0302-newsround-mzimba.htm][in interview]] that she uses them as "word of author" info-dumps.

After that, things are less strict, but I generally adopt the view that what a character is saying is true unless we have a reason to doubt it. This would be especially true of teachers and other figures who are known to be good at magic.

In general, I do not think that JKR intended for Harry to be an unreliable narrator, so I don't think it's necessary to take everything with a pinch of salt. Harry knows a lot more about the magical world than the reader does.

For example, when the narrative notes in GoF that Fleur is a quarter-Veela, I take this at face value. I don't see a need to question it on the basis that Harry is not an expert in Veela.

***** So maybe this is something I've missed, but it's been a question I've sort of answered for myself with no basis other than (what I deem to be) common sense.

There has never been a mention of male Veela, and Veela themselves are described to be beautiful females (as I recall it, off the top of my head). Now, if all Veela are female, how could it be possible for Veela to be half/quarter/eighth? Wouldn't the race simply die out the further along the generations go?

Wouldn't it make more sense for any Veela to be born to be a "full Veela"?

Unless, of course, I missed the part where male Veelas do exist and I'm just stupid.

****** The folklore origin of the Veela are the slavic Vila, which are fairy-like nature spirits with the apperance of beautiful women. If we follow this conception then, while Veela can reproduce biologically with humans to produce part-Veela offspring, "full Veela" would not be born biologically, but come into being magically, like boggarts and poltergeists.

Incidentally, Vila die if you pluck one of their hairs, so if that also holds in HP then Fleur's wand takes on a somewhat more sinister tone.

** Warps spacetime, enclosing target volume in a region not dissimilar to a warp bubble

The neck is detached from its local spacetime and attached to, and passing through, the Secret Keeper's soul or magic or whatever, and from there to the spacetime it is attached he fo.

Telling someone the secret gives the recipient the ability to pass through the SK's soul.

If the SK dies, you get a complex geometry where everyone who knew the secret is a gateway. If enough people are SKs, the geometry is unsustainable and the spell collapses.

The memory aspect is actually a separate portion of the charm.

It might work pulling some weird time travel paradox shtick, since we're already bending the hell out of spacetime.
