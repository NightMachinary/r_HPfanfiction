H/Hr/L or pairings for bonus points, but really as long as those 3 are main characters I'm into it


** I have to recommend a story by robst (don't hate me), since it's the first (and only?) that comes to mind:

Lunar Harmony is already a quite endangered species, so there's little to nothing for such a specific request. Maybe DP&SW would fit, but there's very little interaction between Hermione & Luna in that story.

*** Out of curiosity why don't you like robst? Ive never seen a don't hate me as part of a red for one of his stories. He's not the best author, but there are many who are far worse..

**** I didn't say that I don't like him did I? If I don't write a disclaimer like that ("don't hate me...") I'll get downvoted.

Robst for me is like some of those old cheap fantasy paperback novels: very predictable, but entertaining. Even the two stories of him that I like (the rest are just decent or sometimes bad) have some glaring issues (his characters are super clich√©d and stereotypical).

He's clearly a competent writer and better - in terms of technical ability - than 99% of fanfic authors. I just can't think of any of his fics that I could recommend without some kind of caveat.

***** To be fair robst has also improved to get to that point. Some of the earlier stuff, the reason for criticism is clear.

It should also be remembered that, at least when I entered fanfiction, robst for better or for worse was perhaps the most popular H/Hr writer and the first exposure to it for many, back when shipping wars were still a thing in this fandom. So that obviously complicates feelings both for and against his work.

****** Sure, but I think he contributed a lot to some of the bigger problems with the H/Hr pairing in the fandom. It's very obvious when someone writing H/Hr is inspired by robst and it's rarely good.

I think robst's better qualities are his technical abilities and his plot ideas - not so much his romance. It's almost laughable when I think of some of his poorer fics (like Harry Crow)

******** Robst is probably partly responsible for so many people believing that you have to ship Harry or Hermione with Death Eaters (or worse, Ron) in order to get interesting relationship dynamics and conflicts. It's really obnoxious how they act like an old married couple in his fics and call each other "dear" and "sweetheart".

**** His writing style gets a little tedious after a while, but I like all of his stories. But I can see why the disclaimer was given. There are a lot of people on reddit who don't like robst at all.

***** Yeah, that's fair. I agree that he is a very technically competent writer, with interesting plot lines. My issues are usually limited to shallow characters and unbelievable plot points.

*** That series started off very enjoyably, but now it's practically unreadable. Ginny dying her hair black and into dreadlocks, Harry sermonizing about homophobia, and that juvenile kind of "Harry belittles, insults and berates adults, who all just meekly take it and agree with him because Harry is the only real thinker surrounded by sheep" bullshit,
