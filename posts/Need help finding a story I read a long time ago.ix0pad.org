:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, this is what I remember of it -

- Long, well-written, complete (I think)
- The first chapter starts with Harry, Petunia and Dudley at Vernon Dursley's funeral, where Harry spends some time alone at Vernon's grave and lays out all the abuse that he suffered as a child. I think Harry is there, scolding Vernon's grave for quite some time

  - IIRC, Vernon's "spirit" sees this, and he starts feeling great remorse
  - Vernon is given (I don't remember by who) an opportunity to start things over, a second chance at living a good life (including being good to Harry)

- The chapter after that shows Vernon back in time, I think at James and Lily's wedding, and he makes a better attempt at connecting with them, becomes friendly etc..
- The next chapters include the Dursleys being very saddened by the murder of James and Lily, them taking in Harry, treating him kindly, telling him the truth about his parents - and being supportive when the time comes for him to go to Hogwarts
- Canon pairings (H-G, R-Hr) are an important element of the story, but happen sooner than in canon
- Two random details I remember from the story

  - Harry and the Dursleys meet with the Queen of England (but I don't remember how that comes about...)
  - A muggle kills a Death Eater (I think?) with a gun, and he later on becomes professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts


** I think it's this one as I have also read it before. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/]] hope this helps :3

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

**** So I have to ask before I embark on another long fic. How much is Vernon's pov and how much is Harry's? Cause for me it's not Harry Potter if it's not at least mostly harry pov. Just a personal failing I guess

******** Linkffn(soul scars) basically harry and 3 girls are soulmates and because of this when one gets hurt the others gain the scars from it as well. Thing is it starts before they ever meet. Namely on Halloween 1981. Within this mythos that shouldn't be possible. Cant really say more without spoilers but it's pretty well written and really deals with Harry's mental state after years of dursley abuse. Rather than the usual "soul bond ex machina I'm all better now" after it comes to light.

  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.
