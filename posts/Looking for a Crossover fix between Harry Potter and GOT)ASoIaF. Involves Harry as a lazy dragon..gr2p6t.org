So basically Harry is a dragon that saves Elia Martell and Rhaenys during the Sack of Queens Landing. Adhara Dayne comes in later on in the story. The ending is edgy as the author lost motivation to finish the story iirc. Hit me up if you know this one! Tyvm


** Was it on FFN? Was it in the Game of Thrones-HP crossover section or was it on the A Song of Ice and Fire-HP crossover section? Try asking [[/r/TheCitadel][r/TheCitadel]].
