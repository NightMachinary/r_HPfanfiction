There were 2 different stories, one from Hermione's POV and the other Fleur's. In the sory its self Fleur falls mate-at-first-sight with Hermione duringnthe welcome feast in GoF. GoF proceeds as canon. Fast forward a few years and Fleur is dyingncause shes not with her mate (Hermione) so to help them get together Dumbledore has Fleur bena teacher for Hermione's 7th year.

If you know what either one of these are, thanknyou. If not oh well, thanks for trying.

  Fleur is not an expert in the ways of love, but in Hermione's final year with time running out, the learning curve is steep. Written, with permission, as a companion piece to Dreiser's "No Defense for You" in Fleur's POV. Please note: a slightly more updated version (less typos) lives on AO3. Any chance of a sequel will be posted there as well.

*** Yeah, they're very well known Fleurmione stories, if you're into that kind of thing, and I would have linked them right away if I'd checked reddit yesterday.

Yay, someone else who likes femslash! It can get a bit lonely on here :P
