This story is listed as Harry/Lily but the actual incest stuff happens near chapter 46 ish of 50.

It has 50 chapters but was left incomplete.

Harry's twin is probably named Bill.

Harry's youngest sister is named Lily, often called Little Lily.

One of Harry's twin sister is named Sakura.

Sirius is not in jail and has married a Japanese woman with whom he has a daughter about Harry's age and probably a younger child. Sirius had to have sex with his mother in-law to prove his worthiness as a husband for his wife, something like that.

  He was tutored by Dumbledore, the Flamels, and several of the most advance and intelligent Order members during the times of war. He easily outclassed Hermione in knowledge and practical usage. Currently, he was Head Boy, Quidditch Captain, and Hogwarts' most eligible bachelor. Yet after Ginny, he refused to date anyone else again, he was afraid of feeling all that pain again.

I'm gonna say, "no".

Edit: trying anyway.

  All three members the golden trio were quite powerful for their age, but Harry was even more powerful then possible. Because of his achievements and power, he was given the nickname like Dumbledore. However, unlike Dumbledore, Harry was called, 'The Hero of Light.' It was a magically binding contract when it was given with his Order of Merlin 1st class, which they neglected to tell him until he had already accepted his Order of Merlin.

Yeah it's not good.

**** It's hilariously bad. I also don't know how one can make the same simple grammatical mistakes 240k words into a story. There's no way no one's pointed them out.

**** It really is hilariously awful. I want to believe no one can write like that without knowing exactly what they are doing. But I'm still on the fence about it.
