I recently finished reading Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgance and have stumbled across the brilliance of a good time travel fic. What are the best complete time travel fics out there that don't have the exact same plot as the originals but he Harry knows everything. I do enjoy a good Dumbles/Weasley bashing or just exclude them entirely.


** linkffn(12744735) Currently updating.

linkffn(12511998) Regularly recommended.

linkffn(5511855) A classic on the genre.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** Delenda Est is one of my favorites, and its linked in one of the other comments. I'd add:

linkffn(11053807) - Dumbledore has Hermione extensively train for the war using a Time Turner - the time turner is used multiple times. Pairing HGSS

linkffn(10772496) - A massive story with multiple arcs. The time loop is set up really well and connects the past with the future smoothly. It's a slice of life type of fic. Pairing HG/SB, HG/RL

linkao3(12801672) - Hermione is an Unspeakable who is still fighting dark lords after Voldemort with her friends. She ends up deaged into a fifth year in the 1940s in a time where Grindelwald is a huge threat. This goes very in depth into magical theory and how the changes Hermione makes will affect the future. This is also a slice of life with numerous characters involved. Pairing: Hermione/Tom

linkffn(13001792) Thirteen year old Bellatrix Black travels forward in time to 1993. She's very OP and crazy. Bellatrix is from an alternate universe and has a patron Goddess who she embodies. Lots of stuff about dark magic

linkffn(12132374) - Right after the battle in DH, something happens and Hermione is sent back in time and put into the body of someone who was previously dead in the original timeline- Cathal Rosier. The original Hermione also exists in this story. This is very character driven, and the "mystery" is what went wrong at the Final Battle for Hermione to end up this was. There's a lot of focus on pureblood society

linkffn(10610076) - really good MoD Harry

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.
