** Personally, I like first person, both reading and writing.

I like writing it because I've been running D&D games for over a decade and taking on the role of characters is natural to me and because I enjoy writing that film noir monologue style of "I watched her walk in, knees up to here with a face like heaven and some really poorly maintained nails. Egad, woman, get a mani-pedi already." where you get to see a character's inner thoughts and ways of describing/seeing the world - and also because trying to create and maintain a distant third-person narrator voice is irritating sometimes so writing it in a character's voice is easier.

I like reading it because it can give an extra level of understanding of a character and can be more fun to read - we don't often think in perfect grammar, so there's a lot more smoothness and colloquialism to it that I do enjoy.

I understand why many people don't like to read or write it though. Basic gist - it's really hard to do right and it's really awkward to read when you get it wrong.

- Balancing introspection and narrative is difficult,
- You have to show character flaws without too much self-awareness of them,
- There should be a reason for it being told in first person (eg. the story is being told by a dude to his buddies in a bar), otherwise it can come off a bit 'Why is this person telling me all these personal things?'
- It's a bit too 'I've already experienced all of this' rather than 'Events are unfolding ahead of me',
- Really easy to make characters seem narcissistic as fuck ('I looked in the mirror and saw my shiny, lustrous hair') or a self-insert fantasy ('man, everybody keeps talking about how I'm the chosen one and I have to save everything.')
- Lot less 'Reader puts themselves in the position of the characters' when it's all 'I did this, I did that, I did the other thing'
- Lots of bad examples switched people off
- Writing-wise, it's quicker and easier to rattle off a third-person story than to put in the work for a first-person one.
- First person is automatically an unreliable narrator, since it's an actual person telling the story rather than an omnipresent god-thing, and that's also hard to do well
- I know I said introspection already, but it bears repeating that you have to touch on inner thoughts of the narrator in every scene rather than just describing what happens. IRL, we think about events as they're happening, with very little description because we're actively seeing things, so that balance between character psychology and narrative necessity is hard to keep going.

There are probably more reasons, but those'll do for now.

** I don't know what I have against First Person Perspective but I can't actually enjoy it. Couldn't even read Percy Jackson.

** linkffn(The havoc side of the force) linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity)

Two well received first person Harry Potter fanfictions. I don't think people here care that much about POVs as long as it's well written

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** It's a storytelling choice, no more, no less.

It's harder to do right than your basic tight-third-person narrative, so it can come off a bit crap in the hands of a beginner, but there are some stories that have to be told that way to work well.

If the writer has the skills and drills to do it, fair play to 'em.

** This is insightful and well-put. This truly helped my perspective on ya-first person and first person in general.

Personally I love first person (main ex. Percy Jackson) but I don't feel confident enough in my writing to attempt that within the HP universe even though I want to do that.

Thank you for your thoughts and even though I'm in literal shitty first drafts of my story, I'm going to write it out in both first and third just bc of your posts. See you in a year
