Are there any really good hp fanfictions where after voldemort and hogwarts, harry works to find science behind magic and (preferably) builds a spaceship. It would be nice if it were with hermione.


** Browncoat, Green eyes by nonjon is a Firefly crossover. Its set well into the future. It's definitely one of my favorite fics.

** jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][The Next Lord of Kobol]] is a HP/nBSG crossover.

nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]].

Also, Perspicacity is apparently working on one as well based on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/8/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this one shot]]. Who knows when he'll publish it though.

I've got the absolutely perfect fic for you, other than the Hermione bit (Though if I remember correctly they do eventually have a few kids together, sort of, can't remember the ships/details of ships correctly).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig]]. After voldies defeat (which if I remember correctly follows canon), Trelawney makes a final prediction before her Death, spelling the possible doom of magic and wizard kind.

Harry, and after he convinces everyone, including his disbelieving friends, build a spaceship mostly using magical means (100's of "booster brooms", magical shielding and such) and attempt to escape Earth before the muggles destroy them all, by means of using the Sun as a floo.

--------------

Everything below this is more or less a slight spolier:

Eventually (I believe it's a matter of centuries, but I won't spoil it for you how most everyone is still alive) another prediction is made, forcing them to go back to Earth and wage war on the muggles, who, for the most part, are now less advanced than the wizards.

I particularly enjoyed the somewhat insane religion some of the voyagers/settlers created, hailing Trelawney as a savior/goddess.

End of spoilers

--------------

It ends on a cliff hanger, and the sequel has unfortunately been abandoned, however I still think it's well worth the read.

** A murder of crows by hogwarts 91 isn't set in the future.but adult hermione has a science phd and uses it to modernise magic. It's a good read. But it is a hg/ss story. Not every ones cup of fire whiskey. Interesting and well told though with real world scientific tie ins

** There are quite a few HP/Star Wars and HP/Stargate crossovers, but none have stood out more to me than the Harem Series stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]]. The first story is HP based, the second Star Trek, and the third Star Wars Its got some flaws, mainly the ability for 4 gals to all have a successful relationship with 1 dude, which often gets painted over by the "Magic can fix everything" brush, but even with its flaws, I think the series explores a lot of interesting conflicts and sci fi ideas while including Harry Potter in the best ways.

** What you're looking for will largely be found in HP crossovers with sci-fi movies or TV series. In these kinds of stories you'll often have to contend with the different explanations about the source of magic depending on the particular fandom the Harry Potter universe is paired or merged with. In many cases it is also less about Harry building a spaceship from magic, but rather where he uses magic to enhance the existing technology or uses it for completely different purposes entirely.

Well, let me list a few stories worth mentioning that fit at least parts of your requirements.

The first chapter hasn't been posted a week ago as of today, but I have high hopes for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10216662/1/The-Legacy-of-Death][The Legacy of Death]] by Anonymous00. He/she is only just starting out to write a HP/Firefly crossover in which Harry remains the last magical human alive on Earth, until he leaves on a magically enhanced Ark ship for a new home on another planet. I have no idea what is to come in this story, but after a well written 12k words in the first chapter, I hope it is good. We're due another good HP/Firefly crossover, after nonjon's masterpiece so long ago.

runick4's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9320787/1/Last-Ancient][Last Ancient]] is a crossover with the Stargate 'verse. In this one Harry isn't magical, at least after Voldemort's attack on the Potters, but the heritage of the Ancients shine through in him. Although large parts of it deal with the happenings in the Stargate timeline, there are bits and pieces where both Harry and his mentor try to approach magic scientifically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5931066/1/Oma-s-Choice][Oma's Choice]] by jacobds is similar in scope, although very different in many of its details.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9920217/1/The-Astria-Porta-Project][The Astria Porta Project]] should actually fit your requirements the best, because in this crossover with Stargate, we see some magical alternatives to the established advanced technology.

In the sadly unfinished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6893932/1/Commander-Potter-of-the-Starship-Ascension][Commander Potter of the Starshpi Ascension]] Harry builds his own spaceship and meets wom3 remnants of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol as they flee from the Cylons. The Ascension is very much a magical ship, but from what I remember when I read the story a while ago, there's little science involved in it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7966035/1/Lightning-among-the-Stars][Lightning among the Stars]] by Leonineus shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it can be an entertaining read. If you want a lighthearted tale about a twisted Harry and Hermione after they somehow landed in their own future, only a few years before the happenings of the first Mass Effect game, then you might want to give this story a shot. There's also an NSFW version of it on some other site, HPFFA I believe. By the way: while there's not so much about the science behind magic, their magical way of building ME-type ships rocks!

There is without a doubt a lot more of this kind of stuff out there, but these stories were what came to my mind immediately when I read your request.

Oh, I also remembered reading one more story, this time not a crossover at all, but the title has eluded me and I can't for the life of me remember where to find it again. In the story Harry studied some old magic, maybe of the time of Merlin or before, when he became convinced that the descendents of wizards were in truth extraterrestrials. In the end, Harry builds a magical spaceship which he uses to travel to the source of the magic, where the great magic users of their world originally came from. I have no idea where I read it, possibly on fanfiction.net or fanficauthors.net, but that's just a guess.
