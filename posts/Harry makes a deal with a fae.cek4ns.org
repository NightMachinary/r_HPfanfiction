:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am trying to remember this fic I once read. Harry some kind of ongoing deal with a Fae/Faery/Fairy. I'm pretty sure she is some kind of queen (possibly something to do with the Unseelie court) and she has ice powers. She is not “good”, but she's not an evil character either. I recall something about her saving Harry during the dragon task in the 4th book, and she makes it snow. Or maybe Harry channels her power. Idk. She makes Harry have sex with her as payment, but i don't think it's graphic. I'm pretty sure there's also a scene where he somehow travels into her forest (which is on a different plane) and sees her and her entourage. Now this part, im not even sure if it's from the same story, but Harry somehow finds a tiny fairy and tricks her into spying on the fairy queen for him. He feeds her fruit and yogurt, and this is a weird detail, but she can unhinge her jaw and open her mouth super wide. She's super violent when she eats, and can eat a lot. Anyone know what this might be?
