:END:
Harry/Ginny, Soul Mates, at one point both Dumbledore and Molly's noses get blown off by a bat-bogey hex


** So, I'm not sure if it's this one because I've never managed to get through it all the way, but it /might/ be linkffn(4936039). The Weasley parents and Dumbledore do some pretty shitty things in this story, so I wouldn't be surprised if their noses were bat-bogeyed off /at all/.

  The summer after the Chamber of Secrets was hard. Why can't Harry remember what happened? Realizing he's missing memories, Harry and Remus set out to find out what happened. What about that red-head he's been dreaming about? Soul-bond fic. H/G, B/F, R/T
