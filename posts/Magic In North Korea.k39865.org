So, I don't think I've ever seen this discussed, but in countries like North Korea (isolationist, totalitarian hellscapes) how do you think ANYTHING magic works?

E.g: When a child comes of age to learn magic (presuming it's at 11 like it is in the UK)

• Do you think the state knows about magic?

• Do you think they let magical children study abroad or have their own state run facilities?

• Do agents from Mahoutokoro (assuming there aren't any other magical schools in the whole of Asia) has to send staff to retrieve them?

• If the above is true, how do muggle families explain the absence of their child? Would the child have to choose to leave or stay indefinitely?

And that's just this specific facet of the discussion: Do they have a "Diagon Alley" equivalent? What are Pureblood North Korean magicals like? How does the state propaganda effect the magical portion of their population?

** Given the relatively small size of NK, I think all wizarding families left during when it became clear what kind of government was taking over. They all live in SK now, but perhaps some old families still have estates hidden in the NK wilderness that are absolutely protected from the muggles and that they go to for vacation.

I'm not sure if there's a specific SK school for wizards, or if there's a larger school for Asia (that's not the Japanese one). Either way, the kids would go to school there.

Communism seems distinctly anti-magic to me (what with the sharing of everything and the conformity). There might have been some wizards who were swept up in the fervour of the revolution, though I think they (or their descendants) eventually all realised they had no place in a strictly communist society.

Speaking of communism in general though, because China was so like North Korea for a few decades, I like to think the same thing happened for Chinese wizards. Like most left during the civil war and settled in Hong Kong or Taiwan.

On the other hand, some old families who did not want to leave their ancestral lands may have completely isolated themselves in historically wizarding villages away from muggles during the revolution, and there are direct pathways from those villages to Diagonal Alley equivalents in HK and Taiwan.

With the relative opening up of Chinese society, some younger wizards may have returned live for longer periods in their ancestral homeland, though the governing body is still outside the mainland.

I have imagined whole scenarios of ancient East Asian wizarding families and how magic permeated the legends of China Japan and Korea, but you defs did not ask me to word vomit.

**** Haha okay, well i mostly only know Chinese history and legends, so:

There has long been stories of Daoist immortals roaming the Chinese countryside and living as hermits. These are definitely all wizards, and their pervasive stories in Muggle culture indicate a very different attitude in the Wizarding community towards secrecy and isolation. Stories about them are stuff like immortality, flying while riding on clouds, healing people with a wave of their batons, taming animals etc etc.

The same goes for many of the martial arts sects that have traditionally been seen as semi-magical. Not sure if you know what Wuxia is, but they're basically traditions that mixed martial arts with a type of physical magic related to your body and qi and channeling nature, and I think that was a certain school of wizarding discipline. Like, you would choose to send your child to a school like this, where they would learn a more physical manifestation of magic, or you would send them to a more academic setting, where they would learn more word-based spells.

Emperors of old definitely had various sorts of magical advisors through the centuries. I don't think most were aware of how organised the wizarding world was, or perhaps, because Chinese tradition has so family-based historically, there was no organised government like the MoM until very recently in history.

Perhaps historically, Asian wizards operated in large family units just like their muggle counterparts, with a “clan” all sharing the same surname, and a council of elders from the main branch to make decisions relating to the family. It was all very much based on seniority and being from the main branch of the family, and also patriarchal, but age and generational seniority defs mattered most.

Anyway, back to emperors: they were just aware that some families could do various forms of magic and predict astrological events. Some families helped the emperors they liked to win wars or build infrastructure. (i'm thinking Zhuge Kongmjng was a very learned man, but also a wizard, and Emperor Sui Yang Di had wizard help in building the Grand Canal).

Of course, there were also emperors who did not like the magical presence in his peripheral visions, and tried to persecute magic. Think Han Wu emperor's attack on “Wu gu” magic. Like western witch hunts, there was usually a political reason behind a lot of this, and most victims were muggles.

Again, because wizarding governance was so decentralised, it was up to individual families whether or not to involve themselves in the affairs of muggles, and whether they would use their magic in that involvement. Some maybe just sent their non-inheriting children to get a normal muggle education in order to have some family members in the muggle bureaucracy. It all depended on individual family tradition and the ambitions of the heads of family at any given time.

I do think most magical families adapted Confucian philosophy in regards to family interaction around the same time muggles did, though they have evolved less from their Han Dynasty origins. It is just the perfect way to ensure people in a large family got along, (though I will admit it doesn't do too much for individuality or personal freedom). But things changed less for wizarding families, and so wizarding culture and family is still pretty different from muggle ones with more antiquated practices. For example, they might still traditionally have low-rise tables and floor seats in their homes, because they didn't adapt the chairs that came in with the invading northern tribes in the 300s-400s CE. Idk just throwing out some ideas.

Lol lmk if you have specific questions. I haven't written any of this down, just imagined bits of it, but if you want to explore something specific I can help you brainstorm.

***** Thank you, this was a really interesting read. I'm actually working on a story at the minute that involves issues with the Chinese MoM but your points in these comments have made me rethink how I'd like to setup magical China. Would you mind if I used a few of these ideas?

Particularly the idea that China's magical governance was mostly decentralised and clan based until recently, the subplot of the story revolves around the ICW and the things they had to do to inact the Statute of Secrecy.

** The purebloods probably still live there, and the muggles are largely irrelevant to their lives. They're probably more careful to keep away from muggles and better with disguises and obliviation. They might still think of Korea as a totally unified country, given how behind the times wizards are. I don't think the state would be able to do anything about the bougie wizards, so they'd have an uneasy tolerance thing going on. There'd probably be a secret plan somewhere for getting rid of wizards that never gets put into action. Or maybe they don't know?

Muggleborns and their families would probably struggle, and they might have to be smuggles abroad by other wizards.

I think it would be worse for a wizard to live somewhere where witchcraft is still illegal, like Saudi Arabia.

You could just have the secret wizard version of Islam declare the magic the wizards in the Harry Potter universe use different from the magic the koran forbids and thus helal and instead have certain kinds of dark magic fall under that prohibition (e.g. summoning demons, monkeying around with the soul and so on). The king of Saudi Arabia (and maybe some other bigwigs in the Saudi gov't) knows that and doesn't interfere with them.

** It good be a great idea.

The only mention of North Korea ever in any fanfiction I have read was (from “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862)): “‘Oh, and you've got acceptance letters from literally every school of magic in the world except the training camp in North Korea,' Andi added.”

Actually not. When I was searching my archive of fanfiction stories I found also subplot in “Annals of Arithmancy by White_Squirrel” linkao3(15287883) with North Korea setting of their own nuclear bomb (and question whether North Korean wizards were involved).

It was also mentioned in passing in “Ah, Screw It! by mjimeyg” linkffn(12125771) and in “Stag, Dog and Wolf by Blasta6000” linkffn(13423203).

** Wizards are good at keeping Muggles away. They don't need to pay attention to them at all. The government contacts (with the PM or whoever) aren't really necessary, just a courtesy to help make things a bit easier. And it's not like wizards have to worry about Muggle borders

So, aside from the issue of the families of Muggleborns, I don't see a totalitarian regime being any different from any other Muggle government. I'd imagine the wizards either relocate the families somewhere else (like South Korea), or else just take the children and obliviate the families (or make them think the child is dead).
