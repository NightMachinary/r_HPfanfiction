Severus Snape is such a divisive character, especially in this sub reddit. Rather you like him, hate him, or somewhere in between, I'm curious what fanfictions have some of your favorite characterizations of him.

Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc, doesn't have to focus on pairings.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing, if possible. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion.


** linkffn(Crime and Punishment; The Peace Not Promised) both portray him well IMO.

Snape is usually treated either as this evil irredeemable bastard, or this weird "nice" suave person who secretly is a nice fluffy person inside. I think both of the above fics do a good job of portraying him with all his canon flaws without making a point of making him a horrible irredeemable person in the process. I especially like the latter fic (The Peace Not Promised) for IMO doing a very good job at showing actual character development, able to truly show how he could slowly mellow out into a better person without skipping several steps in the process like a lot of Severitus or Snily fics do. I think Crime and Punishment makes him a bit too unreasonable at first, but is one of few fics that show a more realistic take on Severitus while allowing him to develop in the process.

Generally, I prefer Movie!Snape portrayals over Book!Snape ones because the former version is "nicer" without going too far and helps me read Snape-centric without wanting to punch him in the face. But my ideal is Book!Snape but where he's shown to realistically develop into a better person, which the above fics picture well.

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed, un-Britpicked, unapologetic.

** The Long Road Home by Penelope Muir linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]])

Ananke by Eunike linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke]])

Both of these have brilliant Snape characterisations. I prefer the first one as there's no bashing of other characters, and Remus, Sirius and Regulus Black are treated especially well throughout.

The second one is a bit bad for bashing Dumbledore and James, but has one of my favourite characterisations of Lily in ff.

*** While I think Ananke portrays Snape well, IMO The Long Road Home's Snape is "too nice". Better than "too evil" IMO (since I like to read Snape-centric fics), but not ideal. I do agree that Ananke bashes Dumbledore too much though (some of that fic's James can be explained by Lily not really treating him well), it's the fic's biggest flaw to me.

**** I am probably biased because I enjoyed it more for Regulus and the Black side of the story. Thinking about it, Severus probably does come across as too nice during the earlier Lily aspects of the story, but he was so horrible to Harry later on that this must have erased all of his niceness in my mind lol.

I agree about Lily treating James poorly in Ananke. I loved it until the second part of the story, before all that came about, but do still enjoy the first half.

ETA: I've been reading Puzzle today and second that recommendation.
