Hi, after reading a ton of grim dark fics like Circular Reasoning, I really want to read a paragon of light Harry Potter to cleanse my pallet.

I want to read about a Clark Kent type Harry Potter.


** A few decent curb stomps from good guys go a long way in countering grim-dark stuffs:

*Petrification Proliferation*, linkffn(11265467)

*Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue*, linkffn(11961978)

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382)

*Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, linkffn(10959290)

*A Riddles Universe*, linkffn(8678567)

*Gryffindors Never Die*, linkffn(6452481)

*Searching For The Power*, linkffn(5790760)

*Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law*, linkffn(6049450)

*Oh God Not Again!*, linkffn(4536005)

*What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix*, linkffn(5265558)

*A Black Comedy*, linkffn(3401052)

Pretty much everything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Robst]], as long as you can stuff his Weasley bashing and 'good' Goblins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][pottermum]] generally writes low conflict, fluffy H/G fics.

I wouldn't describe Harry and Ron from *Gryffindors Never Die* as good guys - they're more lovable rogues. (*A Black Comedy* is similar, but not to the same extent.) Still, they're both good palate cleansers because of the focus on humour throughout.

To be honest, I don't really like lawful good heroes, and I enjoy chaotic good types far more.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  In which Harry discovers there is more to being the Heir of the Four Founders than than just having really cool tattoos. Powerful Harry, Multi-Ship. Post OOTP. No Slash.

**** Heir this, heir that...just once I'd like to see a fanfic about Harry inheriting the Founder's Hair. The Founder's Incredibly Messy Hair.

...Now there's a thought. A typo in an age-old will/contract/etc pits hair vs hair vs hair. Harry's hazel mess vs Ron's carrot top vs Draco's blonde coif vs Snape's slick n' greasy vs Voldemort's baldness. You will fear the true power of the Hair of Slytherin.
