A Harry/Snape paring tag makes me shudder.

A/B/O dynamics, I have a habit of reading the tags on ao3 and I know where these stories go.


** parent/child incest

Harry/Voldemort

Mostly child/adult relationships. Also the ‘slutty Harry' fics where Harry's pretty much raped by everyone

*** I tried reading a time-travel fic but couldn't get past the Harry x Sirius pairing because it felt so incestuous. The only Harry x Voldemort fics I'm okay with are the ones where they're both like centuries old so a few decades don't matter, and the ones that happen between Harry and the diary horcrux. I just can't get past the age difference and power imbalance

******* Yes, but that role is not /biologically determined./ The lead animal in a pack has fought to be lead animal - he or she is the strongest, or the most successful hunter, or the one the other animals most want to mate with. That's most people's issue with ABO - the roles are predetermined and you're one or the other and the other wolves can tell by scent or some other such crap.

Of course societies, both human and animal, have hierarchies. But they aren't based on biological characteristics, they're based on things like strength, intelligence, economic power and so on.

********* I read one. I noped out.

No, the idea is taken from a misunderstanding of biology, a decades old disproven theory and ideas prevalent in a lot of the rubbish teen werewolf fiction out there. Brave New World uses the idea of classifying people as a form of social control, which is a really interesting topic. ABO fics basically run with the premise that "this is how wolves are naturally and magic means you can sense if you're a leader or if you're a bitch. If you're a bitch you must be subservient and available to the leaders all the time, even in human form." You can imagine how this ends up with the sexual dynamics...

It's just generally gross. A wizarding world set fic based on Brave New World's premise, however, is something I would absolutely read. Make the Sorting Hat into something a little more sinister, have people never able to move out of the social class it puts them into... Yeah that would be a really interesting take.

I could never separate the trope from these things, so every ABO fic that's not about dismantling the hierarchy just reads as massive yikes to me.

Bashing or any sings that a story will bash any character. Anything that would suggest the story is about independent Harry taking matters in his own hands, or super-powered Harry who discovers his true powers.

********** Two heroes can still be antagonistic to each other even while working for a common goal. It's clear from the books that he doesn't have Harry's best interests in mind no matter what he's trying to achieve. So, it is my opinion that to Harry, he is actually an enemy that he happens to need to work with and has persuaded him that he's not actually an enemy.

** I think most of the ones I would normally say already got said, so I'll pick a different one.

Summaries that read like "What if Harry never did X? What if XYZ never happened? What if everything changed forever?" are fics I'm never going to touch.

Those summaries are non-descriptive garbage, and the fics attached to them are usually pretty bad. It's a pretty common summary, and most of them fail at actually saying what the plot is about, so they fail at summarizing.

*** What's wrong with Harry raised by Sirius? Most of those are just amusing fluff about a cute toddler and a single "dad" who doesn't have a clue, in my experience anyway. Each to their own, obviously, but I can't see what's so offensive about the Raising Harry genre.
