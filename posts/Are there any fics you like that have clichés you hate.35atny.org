For example, I don't normally like SuperPowered!Harry or fics with overly formal, old fashioned wizarding courting systems, yet I still like The Marriage Stone, which is full of that kind of stuff.

So, what fics do you like, even though they have elements that you usually hate.


** There are many good fics that incorporate the "magical core". Its such a, for a lack of a better word, anime thing to do. I mean, yea, Harry and Dumbles are strong. But there gotta be a different way of making that visible without making me picture a glowing ball of energy in their chests. In some of the more ridiculous usages of these cores I half expect Ron to ask for a power-level at some point. And its definitely over 9000 for Harry.

**** I remember one from a few years ago that had a definite Avatar: The Last Air Bender feel to its handling of the magical core. They made it so that the magical core had more to do with the pathways of the body that the magic could channel through than actual strength of the core itself. It reminded me greatly of the Chakras in TLA

**** Yeah, I've seen a few that just mention them, but seem to treat it more like a muscle. It can be exhausted, it can be strained, you can increase it through training. I don't mind that, because that gives the characters some power to change their circumstances and they're not just 'born' with a level of 9000 or 2, but can become powerful through learning and practice.

**** I don't think they can be used well. Magical cores result in two things:

A) Characters who are innately more magically powerful than others from birth.

B) Characters running out of magic during an action sequence.

Both of these points undermine the role of characterisation in a story. Instead of events being dictated by your characters' personality and choices, they're dictated by arbitrary factors which the author fixed. That's just bad writing and unsatisfying to the reader: conflict is best resolved in a way that stems from the characters' natures.

I always like to draw a comparison with a car chase in an action movie. You don't want to see someone win a car chase because the other guy ran out of gas. Nor do you want to see someone win a car chase because they were born with an arbitrary number of "car chase points".

You want to see the car chase determined by the hard-earned skill of the drivers, and their strength of will/bravery/perseverance.

***** While I don't enjoy magical cores in Harry Potter fanfiction, I don't think the idea is necessarily a mark of bad writing, particularly in other fictional works (e.g, Butcher's /Dresden Files/ or David Drake's /Lord of the Isles/).

For example, your reason B) still involves the choice of when and how to use one's magic if it's a limited commodity. This in many ways is more satisfying to me than someone just spamming spells all day in a jbern-esque spellchain.

Reason A) may set up a hierarchy in the magic power stakes, but so what? Aside from the quantifiable aspects, is this really any different from any skill in real life?

For instance, I can play piano decently for an amateur and have some natural gifts that help make things easier for me (I have perfect pitch and unusually large and flexible hands, e.g.) While I don't use up "piano mana" when I play, I do get fatigued (mentally and physically) when I practice for too long and I have to work to make sure my limited time at the keyboard is efficient. I also know that others (my son, e.g.) are far more naturally talented than me, can practice for longer, with better focus, and had better instruments, parental support and teachers during the key formative years.

Like any skill worth doing, effort and ability both matter. We can control the former; the latter is luck of the draw. True prodigy requires serious amounts of both and recognizing the existence of natural talents in addition to manufactured ones doesn't diminish the idea of prodigy significantly, in my opinion.

Edit: typo and additional text to clarify.

The difference is essentially one of complexity, and therefore realism/believability.

No one could doubt that natural talent plays a considerable role in musical skill. However, admission of natural talent is a long way from being equivalent to magical cores.

Natural talent at piano is the result of innumerable factors both genetic and developmental which affect brain structure and chemistry in ways so complex that they're still far beyond our current understanding. It likely involves thousands of genes all interacting in different ways with environmental factors during formative years. On top of that you have the issues of discipline, hard work, and quality of training. Not to mention more physical factors like hand size.

Compare this to a single numerical value which accounts entirely for differences in natural ability at a broad range of technically and theoretically diverse skills.

The real world is complex, and while magic is not biology, it should be of a convincingly similar complexity if it wishes to convey a sense of realism to the reader.

This is why I like the "no core" approach, because it makes magic essentially determined by mental and physical factors in a similar way to non-magical skills.

I think magical cores /could/ be done well, if they were shorthand for a kind of fully developed "magical biology" in which the human body had a non-physical magical system equivalent to a biological system of organs, vessels and tissues. The configuration of this system would depend on a large number of factors which could alter the system in innumerable variations. Instead of outputting a single value of magical skill, the various configurations of the system would preference natural ability with certain types of magical skills, though rare individuals would have a natural predisposition to all (or at least a great many) skills.

I agree that "spam magic" is boring, but I don't think that's the natural result of non-exhaustible magic. If the attacker has non-exhaustible magic, so does the defender. That means that spamming a spell at someone isn't going to overcome their defence: if it wasn't strong enough to overcome their defence the first time, it wouldn't be any other time, which just repeats the exact same circumstance. This means that the only way to overcome someone in such a situation is either to out-think them tactically, or be the superior caster of magic (i.e. you have a spell stronger than their defence in a one-to-one comparison).

Indeed, it seems to me that it's the exhaustible system of magic that more favours spamming spells at people, as it's only in an exhaustible system that you can hope that the defender will "run out" of magic before you do.

** /Wastelands of Time/. Not only is it unapologetically Super!Harry, but the Harry in that story seems to have /nothing/ in common with the Harry Potter from canon. I usually hate this sort of thing, but Joe somehow makes it work.

/On the Way to Greatness/ is almost completely a rehash of canon events. I have very little patience for rehashes in general, yet OtWtG happens to be my favorite story of all time.

/Backwards With purpose/ has many tropes I dislike in time travel stories -- Harry does his school years again, they try to change the timeline as little as possible, Harry admits to time-travel readily to characters in the new timeline etc. I still love the story and many of my favorite moments in fanfiction are part of it.

/Equal and Opposite/ has that ridiculous love potion Ginny trope that I always despised. I despise it in this fic as well, but the rest of the story is good enough to make me overlook it. Still, I like the story /in spite/ of the trope, and most certainly not /because/ of it.
