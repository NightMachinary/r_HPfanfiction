Hi everyone, I'm pretty new to the Harry Potter fanfiction community and after searching for some good stories I can't help but notice that the majority of them have just completely one-dimensional characters, usually Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione. Is there a reason for this? Sure, I get that some people just don't like certain characters, but I've been part of a few fanfic communities and I feel like they aren't nearly as bad as this one.


** The reason bashing is so extensive in HP fanfiction is mostly due to four interrelated things.

1. It's one of the biggest fanfiction communities out there. With more fics in general, there are going to be proportionally more bash fics.

2. The books were written for children and a lot of fanfiction writers are/were teenagers, who feel their emotions very strongly generally. This leads to really hating various characters and not having the writing ability to express why they dislike they character without it being "bashing"

3. There are a lot of bashable characters in Harry Potter. This is due to the changing tone of the series as readers got older, JK Rowlings issues with consistency, and strong enforcement of JK Rowlings morals in cases where they don't particularly align with character motivations, among other causes. From a literary standpoint, much of these problems were necessary, like the Stupid!Adults trope required to make 11 year old children the heroes of the story. But those actions taken without the lens of literary necessity are often quite negative.

3.5. Harry is the reader. As in many works of fiction, the main character serves as the focus through which the reader experiences the world of the book. We are supposed to identify with Harry, to see ourselves in him. So when Harry's best friend abandons him twice in hours of need it touches sore points for people who have issues with betrayal. When Dumbledore places Harry with a family that hates him and locks him in a cupboard it stings those people that grew up abused.

Not to say that every Dumbledore basher is an abuse victim, but for any reason, some readers are more affected and upset by the actions characters take in the books. Which leads to the strong emotions that can come out through bashing.

1. Feedback cycles and fanon. There are a lot of bashing fics, out there and there are a lot of people predisposed to dislike the actions of certain characters. Especially when first starting to read fanfiction do people read more bashing fics (you'll find a lot of people that "outgrow" that taste after a while). Reading a lot of bashing fics that highlight, exaggerate, and emphasize the negative traits of characters builds up the negative emotion a person associated with that character. When they read enough that canon starts to merge with fanon, those bashing tropes get confused with canon and they end up with more reasons to hate a character than actually exist in canon. Few bash fics were ever written by someone that hadn't already read bash fics first.

** Eh, some people just...hate certain characters and just don't want to give them any redeeming qualities (whether on purpose or on accident)

Sort of like you hear of “Mary Sues” who can do no wrong, there's those characters that can do no right - because the author intentionally wants you to hate them.

I prefer stories that make sure we see both good and bad qualities of the characters, even if they aren't typically well-liked characters.

** Sometimes it's just the authors dislike of a certain character, sometimes it's a lazy way to create an antagonist for Harry. For example, if you make Harry a Slytherin, and friends with Draco, Ron Weasley is the obvious choice for many as Harry's obnoxious same-year rival.

*** I would agree with your example. A Slytherin Harry even if he doesn't become friendly with Draco is much more likely to end up friendly with the twins and Hermione then Ron. And if he is friendly with Draco then Ron is almost always his rival/enemy.

** Typically for one of two reasons:

A) The fic is from the days of the Great Shipping Wars between Hermione and Ginny as OTP where many a teenager decided that therefore those they don't like must die.

B) Rowling's idea of morality really sends character motivations out the window by Book Seven so it's almost canon. Let's be honest looking back Snape is basically an incel in how he turned evil because one woman rejected him and then "turns good" because of some weird obsession he has with her while Dumbledore just happily has Harry fed to the wolves to unexpectedly die in the long-run.

** It's partially that the fanfic community for Harry Potter is long standing. There's folk who've been writing fanfics for around 20 years now. When you get a fandom that's been around that long, and has reached that many people, on that deep a level, to the point where there are college courses about it, and giant well attended conventions, you're going to have the crazies. And unlike the people who do extremely good work, the crazies outnumber the good ones by a fair good click.

To be honest, the heavily bashing stories tend to get really trite really quickly. It's almost like a shining beacon of “really annoying fanfic tropes ahead.” You'll see all kinds of goofy stuff that has nothing to do with common sense or cannon. I have yet to see a heavily bash type fic be done genuinely well.

Honestly, be grateful for the warning that you're in for a real corker of a read, and either skip it, or enjoy it for the trashy fun that it is.

One other reason is that most of the characters are complex. They have their own motivations, not all of which are strictly good or altruistic or pure. I can guarantee you that someone got to certain parts of the book/movie and felt a mighty rage at a certain character, and wanted to vent their spleen in a safe space. So they write a fic where that character is one step up from the dark lord himself, and go to town. If it were a more classic hero's journey type book, you'd have way more obviously all 100% good characters in the protagonist's corner.

** If you read on Ao3 I reccomend filtering out character bashing and other like tags. It really saves a lot of time and irritation.
