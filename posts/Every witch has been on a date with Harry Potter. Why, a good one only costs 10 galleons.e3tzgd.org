It's late so I'm not gonna write a whole little thing like I did last time. Jumping right into the promt!

Harry Potter, for whatever reason(maybe he has money problems, perhaps he's tired of the endless amounts of post he recieves from witches asking him on a date. Could be that after the 10th assassination attempt after he graduated Hogwarts he needs a large supply of body doubles), sets up an escort service.

An escort service where the only person available is Harry Potter. How is this achieved you ask? Polyjuice Potion. Lots of it.

(1 galleon for an untrained Harry, going up to 100 for a professional Harry Potter Double, Matching Patronus Guaranteed!) Any witch or wizard can buy a Harry for the night. In fact it wasn't an uncommon sight for multiple Potters to be seen at the same large social gatherings.

Of course there is an oath to be sworn to protect the Real Harry from any legal actions.

Does this make sense? I haven't slept in like 40 hours. Is galleons spelled right?

***** The ministry covers the difference. Aurors for personal protection are annoyingly expensive, and after two wars in a short period good ones are on short supply anyway.

The more Potters there are running around, the less protection needed.

Its from linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon). It's even more hilarious because the gay couple who were polyjuicing into Harry decided to Polyjuice into Harry and a girl because and I quote Harry Potter oozes manliness and I can't imagine him being gay.

** I had one idea for something marginally tied to this a while back: Nymphadora needs to go undercover. In order to do this, she has to impersonate someone dead that used to be close to a Death Eater, down to perfection. The fic is from the DE's PoV and is only revealed to be fake later.

**** It was my initial idea, yes. However, having been dead for almost 2 decades (I pictured this as happening during 7th year), I don't think she'd be able to fool him, having known Lily since childhood and probably having residual childhood stories Remus never got to know (the one besides Snape closest to her that is still alive).
