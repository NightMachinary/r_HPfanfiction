I'm just a bit irritated that fic writers often forget that they can't just give time-travelling firstie Harry Godric's sword and let him loose on horcruxes. Until it was coated in basilisk's poison it couldn't destroy them. Yet it's often forgotten.

Or am I wrong? I'm almost sure it was canon.

** You're right but I've never seen it done that way. They normally have Harry get the Sword and take care of the Basilisk, and THEN go Horcrux hunting. Either with Harry Mary Sue'ing out a Rooster and turning the badass fight where Fawkes prevented it being a tie into "Lolroostergg let's stab the corpse and get Basilisk Venom in the Sword" or some other lazy excuse

***** Yeah, but contrived conflict (i.e the Basilisk being actually difficult to deal with when you have foreknowledge of its existence and weaknesses) is also not good plot.

The tough part of time-travel fics is finding a way to create new conflicts while not being able to treat the canon conflicts as too threatening. Best way of doing that is unintended consequences.

Like if you killed the Basilisk 1st Year and outed Pettigrew, but this meant that Lucius Malfoy never gave Ginny the diary, instead being scared by Pettigrew's capture into keeping it safely at home. This has the knock-on effect of making acquiring the Diary much much harder.

******** I do think this sort of thing probably happens sometimes, but more because the Ministry don't want to bother with the hassle of punishing the Dementor as because they can't.

Even going strictly by canon, they could just lock the Dementor in a room with a Patronus for a few days, that would probably be pretty unpleasant for it. If the Ministry really wanted to execute a Dementor, they could keep it locked up until it starved, of course, or take it back to London and kick it through the Veil --- though I think doing so would be seen by the other Dementors of Azkaban as breaking the wizard/Dementor "agreement", and they'd have a rebellion on their hands.

And there are hints in canon that there /are/ non-Patronus ways to hurt Dementors, besides (Snape disagrees with Harry on the best way to fight them, it's offhandedly mentioned, leading me to speculate that there is Dark Magic which works on them; possibly Fiendfyre).

If she's not, she's an animal who cannot be blamed for what her trainers made her do, and jumping to slaughtering her is sheer animal cruelty --- not to mention, she's the last Basilisk on Earth.

But there's no telling how long one takes to hatch and grow up, if nothing else. Considering that a Basilisk lives hundreds of years, it could take 10 years for one to hatch, and still more for it to grow to adult size.

(And as the creation of Professor Slytherin himself, the Basilisk would, on top of the sheer rarity of a fully-grown Basilisk, have great historical value, methinks.)

******** Well, maybe they're still rare but there some somewhere. Maybe hidden somewhere in India (I'm just thinking about snake charmers and that maybe there are more parselmouths there). Or it's injured and serves as an exponat in a magical zoo. Who knows.

There are so few of them in England because breeding them was banned in Middle Ages. And because if a breeder is not a parselmouth then he will face (heh, a pun) great difficulties in interacting with it. So there should be more in areas with parselmouths and not so vigilant ministry.

Also we can't be sure that basilisks aren't widely known. We experience HP's world through Harry himself and he's not very informed person (come on, he didn't know about Knight Bus until his 3rd year, and it's a usual magical method of travel). Also the trio was in the 2nd year and students start studying magical creatures only in the 3rd year. Also we can assume that there were no studies of basilisks' killing stare due to, well, their killing stare. So it's understandable that nobody in HPCoS could even think about a basilisk because victims were alive. All these facts can make us think that very few people even know about basilisks' existence. In my opinion, they are more widely known than that.
