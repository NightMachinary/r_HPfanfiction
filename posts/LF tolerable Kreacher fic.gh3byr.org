What the title says, but he doesn't have to be a main character. I was thinking of fics where Harry or someone was living in Grimmauld Place and either got on his good side or managed to do something that got him to respect them.


** LinkAo3 (Sarcasm and Slytherins) has kreacher nice to harry by the fourth? Book. Sadly it has been orphaned even though it is a great series

** Well, that's the canon, isn't it. You can just follow the progress post-war and you have the tolerable Kreacher. Most post-war fics have some kind of relationship with Kreacher.

One of the few things I liked about linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) was exactly the substory of the ancient Kreacher who creates his own garden on the top of the Grimmauld Place.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
