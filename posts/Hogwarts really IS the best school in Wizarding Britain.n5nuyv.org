This claim is made multiple times yet is also seems to be the only school.

So lets explore scenarios in which it isn't. There are two ways I see this going:

Hogwarts is a super pricey private school (e.g Eton)

Maybe its a private school and most people can't afford it. It would explain why Harry's name has been down since birth something that happens with particularly in demand private schools in the UK. And of the muggborns whose backgrounds we know about Justin Finch-Fletchley was down for Eton (for non Brits Eton is a super posh private school its where Princes William and Harry went to school) and Hermione's parents are both dentists so they will be on high salaries it wouldn't be unusual for a kid from that background to go to a private school anyway, maybe not Eton but there are more options in the muggle world as it is larger. The cost would also explain the Weasley's poverty despite Arthur being head of a government department they have a lot of children and they aren't poor instead they are prioritizing their children's education over luxuries. It might also add to Petunia's hatred of Lily (maybe their parents spent all their money to get Lily to Hogwarts leaving nothing for Petunia). You would need to find a way to explain the attendence of some students (e.g Tom Riddle who had no money and whose parents wouldn't have put him down, maybe there are a certain amount of scholarships or something).

Hogwarts is like a grammar school with particularly tough entry requirements

Grammar schools for non Brits are free schools you have to pass an exam to attend and less common than they used to be. Maybe there is a way of measuring magical power on some sort of scale and you need to be over a certain threshold to attend Hogwarts. It would explain why 18 year old Percy is able to walk into a high flying position after graduation if Hogwarts is the magical equivalent of Oxbrige. Maybe Crabbe and Goyle are borderline and most of the magical population are like them. It would explain Neville's gran's concerns over his ability to attend Hogwarts. Another thing this could explain is the predjudice against muggleborns if Hogwarts is seen as the ticket to the best opportunities in life and wizards and witches see children not raised in the magical world take spaces they want for their children (like how racism is sometimes justified by lack of resources and used to make poor people hate refugees rather than the elites).

Are there any fics that explore either of these concepts of have similar ideas. Because Harry is Mr Oblivious it would be amusing to see a fic where he realizes this when he is like 18 or 19 and looking for a job and it never occured to him all these doors open for him because of Hogwarts.

This would also have implications for the size of the wizarding population which would presumably be larger than canon if not every 11 year old goes to the same school.

Also linking to an amusing video for what other schools could be like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-2ZxldMO-M]]


** Given that Hogwarts is implied to have about 40 students per year (yes, other years and houses could be bigger, but especially with magic flying around much more than 20 per class is stretching it I feel), that only allows for a wizarding population of a few thousand. I head canon it as there are several schools in the country with Hogwarts being the most prestigious.

Those who send their children there are in the upper tier of society. Lucius is rich and influential in government, the Longbottoms were decorated Aurors, the Potters were rich and historied. Even Arthur Weasley is a department head and incredibly well connected at the Ministry (see the World Cup, both how many people he knows and getting top box seats).

The exception are the muggleborn. I assume that there is some sort of historical quota for muggleborn which is then allocated somehow, maybe by money or school performance or randomly.

*** This would put my weight behind Hermione not wanting to get expelled. Maybe there was a Ministry person when she learned about magic that said she would need to study really hard to stay there.

An AU of Colin failing the first years exams and McGonagall has to push for him to stay on since he was petrified for 6 months.

*** you could also add, that some of the poorer families are basically grandfathered in due to going to Hogwarts for numerous generations.

so while the weasleys are poor now, due to a long history of going to hogwarts going back to its founding.

hogwarts will always welcome a weasley.

which causes resentment amoung some of the newer rich families who never managed to gain a slot into hogwarts

** The fic I'm working on (but haven't posted) uses this concept.

Muggleborns are allowed to go to hogwarts for free. It's a reason why many purebloods have some resentment towards muggleborns.

Otherwise, your acceptance is determined by your legacy (if your parents went) and a very large fee from before you are even born.

It explains why hogwarts is primarily pureblood and muggleborn even though the majority of the wizarding world is halfblood (or so Rowling says)

** I've seen multiple fics using some combination of that (though sometimes with the insinuation that it's not actually giving the best education). Loose Cannon, for instance, uses something resembling your "option 1", with the caveat that Muggleborn are all assigned to a school by the Department of Mysteries, so Hogwarts is the "best" school in the sense that it's the oldest and wealthiest and has all the Ministey connections (but other schools have been basilisk-free for longer). That Glorious Strength goes darker with it: Tom Riddle gets Ministry permission to found his own school as a way of keeping mudbloods and uppity half-bloods from trying to get into Hogwarts. New Blood I think was more #2, with most magical people attending minor regional schools or apprenticing at a magical trade (and a whole class of magical peasants whose children don't go to school at all). I don't think I've read a fic where the other schools are intended to be as good as or better than Hogwarts and fail...

Personally, I like stories where there are other schools in Britain and they give their students more skill and knowledge more effectively than Hogwarts, but the value of a Hogwarts education is greater because of its admissions selectiveness and alumni network (exactly like how the value of a Harvard diploma comes from the admissions office and alumni office, not the classrooms in between).

** I just think that Hogwarts has figured out 'one person, one value' concept that so many real-world social reformers try to achieve. The son of a low-level government worker like Ron Weasley attends the same class as an aristocrat's son like Draco Malfoy - because wealth inequality has been separated from the opportunities given. I think the only requirement to attend Hogwarts is to possess magic (‘We believe he has qualities we are looking for.' - Dumbledore to Mrs. Cole), and the school itself takes care of all the fees and equipment cost if the attendee themselves cannot procure them.

Isn't this what Dumbledore tells to Tom Riddle?

#+begin_quote
  When he had finished he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, ‘I haven't got any money.'

  ‘That is easily remedied,' said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. ‘There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on second-hand, but -‘
#+end_quote

Easily remedied... That's what Dumbledore says to Riddle's financial problem. Of course the school fund isn't going to allow him any more money than is necessary (second hand books and robes, but a first-hand wand), but it is still /enough/ to attend the school and classes.

I think the reason why the Weasley family, and Ron in particular, had to go through yearly financial crisis for books and robes was simply because they refused to go to the Hogwarts fund for money. Had they done that, at least Ron wouldn't have had to enter Hogwarts with a second-hand wand.

If Hogwarts is super luxurious then I don't think Weasley family would be able to afford it at all, they barely keep their heads above the water with little to money in reserve. In fact, I'm certain that St. Mungo's in all likelihood also has similar system for the under-privileged in need, because I don't see how Arthur and Molly could've afforded that Nagini treatment in fifth book. Also, I don't think dentistry is a luxurious job. Comfortable yes, but I don't think Grangers are swimming in gold like Malfoys.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** The idea of there being multiple wizarding schools while unsupported by canon makes the existence of OWLs and NEWTs make a lot more sense. If there was only one school in wizarding Britain what would the point of a standardized test be and why would the government develop such a program for a singular wizarding school.
