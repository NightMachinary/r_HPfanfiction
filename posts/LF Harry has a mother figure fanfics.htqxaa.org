I'm looking for fanfics where Harry has an actual mother figure in his life. Extra points for this woman raising him most of his life, but I'll settle for him getting a mother figure once he's in Hogwarts too.

No Molly Weasley. Not because I don't like her, but because her being Harry's mother figure is pretty much canon, and I'd like to read something different.


** Linkffn(9104885) and its sequels may be your alley. Minerva McGonagall is the mother figure in it.

  First in the Promise series. AU from the end of PoA. When McGonagall finds out what Dumbledore condemned Harry to by leaving him with the Dursleys all those years ago, she is determined to do something. Now being translated into German by EliasAmyNightcorePotterGleeFan!
