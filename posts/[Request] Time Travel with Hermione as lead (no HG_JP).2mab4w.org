I'm looking for recommendations. So long as she's not with James (marauder) I'll read it. I dont mind slash if its the side pairing. Any time period (past/future), any pairing.

Preferably complete, or lengthy and still being updated. I also prefer when shes traveling alone, or at least without Harry. He makes everything suspicious.


** Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404/chapters/2266336][One Hundred and Sixty Nine by Soupy_George.]]

Hermione goes back in time to kill Voldy, meets Sirius, etc. etc. It's complete and well written; I really enjoyed it. (Plus no Harry)

*** Oooh yeah I've read this one :). Sirius is actually my favorite with Hermione and I remember really loving this story. Maybe I'll reread it if I don't find a good one. Thanks!

***** I've read so many and didn't keep track. I know of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2255955/1/Bed-of-Roses][Bed of Roses]], which has a sequel and the author has a few one shots.

Oh yeah found [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8574349/1/The-Trick-of-Time][Trick of Time]], which is a beast and really good! This author has another story, The Last Marauder, that's HGRL and I love it.

Then [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2713644/1/Changing-Yesterday][Changing Yesterday]], this is a trilogy. I think I only read the first one for some reason lol. Can't remember what I didn't like about it...

I'll dig up more, stay tuned for more edits heh.

I pretty much had to deviate from my fave and ended up with a pile of great fics where its Hermione and RL, SS, or TR lol. I like when the pair are both teens (hence the time travel).

** It's time-travel of a sort (future-Hermione sends a cryptic message to her child self), but Larry Huss's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] probably meets your requirements; 114k words, WIP (last updated in September).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.
#+end_quote

Perspicacity had a longish one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/Yule-Time][Yule Time]] that's been recommended on this sub.

#+begin_quote
  Augustus Rookwood, former Unspeakable, escapes capture at the Battle of Hogwarts. He develops a new form of time travel, which falls into the wrong hands and seals the fate of trillions of souls. Then, something remarkable happens.

*** Second Palimpsest. Don't see it recommended nearly often enough. It really is great.

Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][the Witch Queen.]] I've only read some of the first chapters so far, waiting for the completion, but what I /have/ read seemed good.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]] is a complete HG/GW time travel fic that I think is pretty good.
