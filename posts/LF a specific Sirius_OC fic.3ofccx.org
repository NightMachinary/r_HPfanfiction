So the premise is that James Potter (while trying to make Lily jealous) asks another girl (the OC) to be his fake girlfriend. OC eventually ends up dating Sirius. OC is, of course, very clumsy and awkward. All else I can remember is that she was really good at Care of Magical Creatures?

It was kind of dumb and lolsorandum but it was cute and one of my first fan fictions that I read! If anyone knows, I'd be sooo grateful.

*** Lol. Checked out some of the chapters' mini-summary-thingies, and the writer sounds like a riot. Now, if only it wasn't an OC-first person pov fic...
