I'm trying to find a Harry Potter fanfic. The general premise is that Voldemort either adopts or kidnaps Harry Potter. Wants to make him his heir. Snape in order to protect Harry Potter convinces him to use a potion to become Voldemort's daughter/heiress instead. Other relevant parts have Narcissa Malfoy going too far teaching the fem harry how to be an heiress. I can't remember the name of it. I do know it's a good length.

  After having been kidnapped by Death Eaters, Harry Potter is offered a unique opportunity: to die or to become someone else. But could a new life that would be dictated by his archenemy even be something worth considering? And could death truly be so much worse? Harry has to find out what he wants to do with his life and time is not on his side. Warning: femHarry, character deaths

** Still looking for this. Further info I can remember.

Narcissa is forcing fem harry to learn things. Voldemort gets pissed at Narcissa when he learns of this. Harry rebels learning it.

Voldemort was going to make Harry his heir but with a potion becomes his heiress via Snape trying his best to keep Harry out of the war and honor his promise to Lily.

I think Harry's female name is Catherine or something like that. Can't fully remember.

**** Pretty sure it wasn't a Fem Harry / Bellatrix pairing. Think it was heading toward a Fem Harry/Draco pairing, but it wasn't definite.
