*** Summary? Well, basically the story delves into what happens when the kids go to Hogwarts. This has got some Indian version of magic in it. Rowling had mentioned some of its characteristics in her other books like Quidditch Through the Ages. So, you know, you get to read another adventure. This is really good.

** This is very, very detailed worldbuilding and adds a lot to the original Potterverse. If JKR could sanction the travesty that was The Cursed Child, this is definitely deserves recognition.

*** Exactly my thoughts. Cursed Child was such a disaster. I found the link after I read Cursed Child and I was so happy that it brought tears to my eyes.
