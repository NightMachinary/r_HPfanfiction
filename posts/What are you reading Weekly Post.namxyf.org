** I had a somewhat less fulfilling week for reading.

I read about 25% of Harry Potter and the Problem with Potions by Wyste before I got frustrated and gave up. The long quoted sections from the books felt like lazy writing to me and we're told that Harry likes potions but we never really see that in action. If you want to read someone who really shows their love of potions, check out female Harry in The Pureblood Pretense.

I also read about 25% of Heroes Assemble by Stargon, which is an MCU/HP crossover. I wanted to like this one, I really did, but once it started rehashing the entire MCU I got bored and stopped reading. I also wasn't a fan of the pairing (Harry/Skye). There was also some Weasley bashing, which is unfortunate because they're barely mentioned at all and when they are it is the bashing cliches.

I read Esama's Wizards in Space fics ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]]) and I really enjoyed them. My only complaint is that I want more. I want to know what they do in sixth year and how it effects the war. You don't need to be familiar with Stargate to read the fics, but it's a nice bonus if you are.

I started reading All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 and I'm enjoying it so far. It's a very interesting take on Remus that I didn't expect. I feel a little bit sad reading it because I'm assuming that it's canon compliant and Remus will end up heartbroken at the end. It's a bit of a bummer reading with that expectation (I much prefer happy endings), but the fic is good enough that I still want to read it.

  Harry Potter, recent vanquisher of the Dark Lord and potions apprentice to one Severus Snape, is absolutely certain he is going to have a peaceful year learning the secrets of the most elegant magical art. The mysterious baby girl Snape declared his daughter after the Battle of Hogwarts can't possibly cause any trouble, surely? She's a baby. Babies are easy.

Well, yes, you should do that ;). Or if you want a story where Harry is unusually powerful and it legitimately isn't all that great for her (it gives her very poor control, draws attention that she can't afford, and sometimes outright makes her a target).

Or if you like the idea of Tom Riddle being both right /and/ wrong, bigoted and dangerous and yet having goals that turn out to be possibly better than everyone just going with the flow (unless someone can come up with an even better solution).

Or a story where she belongs in Slytherin and her best friends are there, but she still gets along really well with the Weasleys and with her family and with Professor Dumbledore.

Or if you just like seeing James and Lily survive (because there wasn't a war; instead there was politics).

i think there's quite a bit not great about a 19 year old expressing romantic interest in a 14 year old, especially since their interactions are almost textbook grooming

pierce's works were written in the 1980s and had a more medieval/high fantasy setting, so perhaps it's more excusable as an artifact of its time, but i find it much more ^{^{^{^{for}}}} ^{^{^{^{lack}}}} ^{^{^{^{of}}}} ^{^{^{^{a}}}} ^{^{^{^{better}}}} ^{^{^{^{word}}}} problematic, in a more modern context

********* Actually book 4 is complete now (as of January).

I'm not so sure his behaviour can be considered textbook grooming when he's doing things like introducing her to other people who would look out for her safety, encouraging her to be honest and open with her family and friends, and training her to defend herself. I was under the impression that grooming classically involves making the target dependent on you and isolating them from other support. Harry isolates /herself/; Leo encourages her to relax. He was the one who suggested that their parents meet each other, while Harry was hesitant about that. Doesn't seem to me like what a predator would do.

Also, the magical world (at least in this series) is culturally a bit mediaeval, with young and arranged marriages being fairly normal.

while these are often common methods, they're not required - grooming is simply the act of developing an emotional connection with a child for the purpose of committing sex acts. sure, it's that last point that may or may not be met - by all accounts it seems like leo truly just wanted to be friends with harry, and that the feelings came naturally, but (at least to me) that doesn't really change my negative perception

i think as a whole your defense of the series here rather misunderstands my comments - i've been quite careful to never accuse the author/work of any impropriety, or even suggest that others not read it on this account. i've merely been expressing the primary aspect of the series that i had the most problems with

you know, i had 3000 more characters of text written above, but i don't want to bother because i in fact don't believe this is true. at the end of the day, unless you believe in absolute morality, ethics are simply preferences, a proposed implementation of our fundamental guiding principles. clearly, ours differ enough that any normative claims we attempt to make are simply incompatible. as far as i can tell, you're going to simply repeat variations on the statement of "it's only grooming if it fits these arbitrary criteria, otherwise it's just sparkling manipulation", and maybe i'm just cranky for being up for 30 hours, but i have no interest in continuing this conversation.

** I just read an older story which was four one-shots set during Voldemort's first rise to power. There are four chapters (i.e. four one-shots) altogether, about four different people who did NOT join the Order of the Phoenix in the first Voldemort war. In order they are: Amelia Bones, Marlene McKinnon's brother Michael, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Dirk Cresswell. The first two chapters were good, the third chapter was amazing (features Kingsley repeatedly arresting James Potter in his vigilantism), and the last chapter took me completely by surprise in how good it was. Dirk Cresswell, Head of the Goblin Liason Office. Just, I would read a whole long story about his character as presented in this chapter. I was shocked--I'm not usually one for unknown characters like this, but wow, he was so well done and interesting!

I say they're one-shots, but they definitely build off one another, so I recommend reading them in order. (And I definitely recommend this, 5/5 stars):

** After having spent a few months reading up most of the mainstream parts of the fandom, I've been getting into the unexplored and forgotten corners.. Good fics you are unlikely to have seen on this sub:

Linkffn(A Walk In Your Shoes by Spirit007) Pre HBP James/Lily bodyswap romcom. Having predated most of it, this fic is relatively free of the usual cliches. No Snape shenanigans and the maurader pranking/bullying isn't as obnoxious as in your average Jily fic. Quite refreshing.

Linkffn(Just a Harmless Joke by CrazyGirl47) Fred/Hermione romcom from 2004 . Short, fun and complete. The characters are a bit OOC, but not unforgivably so. Doesn't overstay its welcome with the short word count.

Linkffn(Eden by obsessmuch) Pretty much opposite in tone to the previous two fics. If you thought /Manacled/ was too dark then you clearly haven't read this one. Hermione/Lucius fic where she is captured by Death Eaters before DH. Lucius and friends are their bigoted sadist selves, so don't expect any fluff. Most of the first 100k is just your standard interrogation/torture scenes (no non-con fortunately). After that things get interesting with Malfoy. No redemption or sympathetic backstory arc in this one. Well written with an /excellent/ ending and appropriate quotes from classic literature scattered throughout. /Mind the warnings./

Linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement) Haphne marriage contract fic. One of two I would recommend. Liked this one purely for Daphne's characterization. Plus it's refreshing to see fics in this genre where people actually go /no this ain't fine/ on /both/ sides of the contract.

Linkao3(The Ghost Of Privet Drive) Not as obscure as the others but interesting nonetheless. I couldn't get past all the British pop culture references every other sentence the first time I tried to read it. Ignoring those gives you an SI fix-fic with some excellent worldbuilding. Lily's protection in particular was inspired. Lacks tension or competent antagonists, but otherwise a good read.

** This week, I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28324026/chapters/69397968][The Long Way Around]] by InwardTransience which is clearly inspired by Rakeesh's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/][A Long Journey Home]]. Only 4 chapters, but it looks interesting. Fem!Harry thrown back to the Founders time and now she is back in the present day. Hermione POV only so far. It's certainly above average in terms of qualilty, but the author has some stylistic quirks that makes me a bit ambivalent about wholly reccing. Characterisation and Worldbuilding while consistent and for the most part good, is also consistently a bit too AU for my liking.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12953614/1/Tales-of-Three][Tales of Three]] by AutumnSouls updated this week. Pithy summary is that it is the story every bog standard Indy!Not-Light!Fem!Harry story imagines it were. Particular highlight is the relationship between Iris and Dumbledore and how Iris is allowed to be antagonistic towards him /without/ the need for the narrative to indulge in Dumbledore-bashing. Biggest cons for the story are that the story is a bit snapshot-y and infrequent updates.

** I'm loving Knowing Where to Look, which just had a new chapter posted: Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5026437/1/]])

It's a post-war fic that picks up immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, showing the Ministry's and Harry's recovery and journey through the eyes of Gawain Robards. The writing is excellent, all of the OCs (of which there are several) are unique, well thought-out, and have interesting back stories, and it has its funny moments and its heartbreaking moments.

I almost never read post-war fan fiction, but this is one I highly recommend. It's in progress with somewhat regular (usually about once a month) updates.

** - “Tangled Strings and Technicalities” by tabbycat linkao3(13552503) Really good people-get-to-Marauders-time fix-it story. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna get back to 1977 with the experimental and probably slightly faulty time turner from 2002 (well post-War), and they are joined by Sirius, who gets thrown there from the Veil, because he was not supposed to die. Hilarity ensues. It has really well described heavy atmosphere of war time, painful experiences of deaths of one's friends, and stuff like that. It was my first time I encountered Sirius/Hermione and Ginny/Remus pairings, and I am kind on the fence about it: both of them had some great parts, but Sirius/Hermione seemed like kept together just by external forces, I have never been properly persuaded they really want to be together on their own; Ginny/Remus was better one, but I am not sure whether it is more because of their chemistry or because Ginny is very well written. Also, the final battle seems to be cut out (Voldemort is killed just in the background), but that didn't bother me that much as I have been again persuaded that time-travel (meaning jumping around in time, not one big failing back in time to get the story moving) is just the most certain killer of a story (as one bad fanfiction involving a cursed child testifies). The resulting conclusion seems too much like /time travel ex machina/ and discovery that somebody had actually access to the working time travel machine whole time makes the story full of plot holes. Just don't touch it. Otherwise, although it is a big story (412,349 words) and it could use some cutting (especially in the middle), I was not crying in the pain from boredom, which is exception for most fanfiction stories, so that's good. Mostly recommended, especially if you like the oppressive atmosphere of the First War, or Regulus Black POV (yes, he turns up as one of the main characters of the story), and some really good dialogues.

- As I tried to be mostly positive with the previous story, “Surprise!” by FirePhoenix86 linkffn(5253648) was just one big disappointment (and I have never finished reading the story). Original premise of the story and the beginning was really good: soon after the War Harry finds out that his parents (and it turns out later, Sirius as well) are not dead, but just stashed away in the long term magically induced coma. They are recovered, and the promised crux of the story was re-establishing roles and relationships of everybody involved. Lily and James must learn they are post-War, many of their friends are dead, everything is different from what they were used to, and particularly their own son is not a year old baby, but a man who won the war, has fiancée, and his own life. On the other hand, Harry has to learn what does it mean to have parents, some authority over himself, and somebody who actually cares about him. That would be really good story, and while the author kept to it, it worked really well. But then apparently he/she decided that in order to make the story longer than The Order of the Phoenix (the story clocks lovely 320,833 words) it must add a filler and the characters decided to engage in the long prank war, and the rest of the story is buried in detailed description of various nonsense. Just kill me.

** I'm currently in the middle of linkffn(Harry Potter: Half-born by Herne)

I really loved how this story started, but I'm starting to question if I still love it now that we're halfway through and heritages and bloodlines are being discussed. I'm not going to give up on it, because it's well written and still very intriguing, but I'm REALLY hoping this doesn't turn into one of those "Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slyhterin-LaFey-Sidhe-Unseelie-creatureheritage-OP" sort of thing.

Harry is actually quite neutral and reasonable as far as his moral compass goes in this story, and I quite enjoy it.

Very AU, Lily & James live, WBWL, manipulative but also fairly puzzled Dumbledore, lots of cool exploration of fae cultures and a blending of fae and human history. 👍

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23649316/chapters/56762986]]

Basically, it's an au where Tom is the minister, and james and lily are both alive. Harry also has 2 siblings. From what I have gotten from the fic, apparently the first war never happened so many of the death eaters like the Lestranges aren't in Azkaban. But the prophecy was still made. Harry is in ravenclaw. It also bashes a lot of light characters like James, Lily, Dumbledore, Hermione and Ron.

My impressions: I really like to read these types of fics where they bash many of the main characters in canon so I really enjoyed reading it. It also features pure blood society, rituals and the pagan holidays which was interesting to read. The fic is so far only 8 chapters long but the chapters are very long so I wasn't complaining. The author's regularly updating too.

Overall, I really enjoyed reading it since it was so good that I pulled an all-nighter to read it. The only thing that irritated me were the many grammar mistakes but they the fic was so good that I was able to ignore them.

Not sure why because it has a lot of the common stuff (Guardian Snape, best friend Draco, ex-Death Eater Lucius, etc.). Very interesting characterizations of some other characters, like Neville, and some good OCs. Overall would recommend, if for no other reason than to see someone write a successful Petunia Dursley/Lucius Malfoy romance.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
