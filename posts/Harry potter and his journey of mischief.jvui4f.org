Ok so I know Harry's years at Hogwarts were never quite cheerful and happy, bit after all, he was a teenage boy, he must have had some fun and mischief and late night kitchen journeys with his best mates..

I need that

Just some light-hearted and funny fic where Harry and his friends rule Hogwarts.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD. DISCONTINUED

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
