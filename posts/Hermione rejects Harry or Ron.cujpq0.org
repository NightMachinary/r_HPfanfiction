I have read a lot of fanfics where either Harry or Ron don't want to date Hermione and she is the one bashed. I would like a fanfic that has Hermione refusing to date either Harry or Ron and she is not bashed because of it. I don't mind other character bashing just not Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.

Links? Cuz I've seen mainly the opposite. Or rather, Hermione rejecting Ron for Harry.

*** I've seen one Harry rejects Hermione. It was some story where he decided to be a healer after his 3rd year. Can't remember what it was though. Otherwise Harry rejecting Hermione is unheard of.

**** Which is odd, because canon Harry would.

** There's a pretty good one on ao3 involving Ron 6th and 7th year where she Rejects Ron for presuming she'll date him, but stays friends. She ends up dating a ravenclaw. I'll take a look after a quick nap.

I'm of the opinion bashing in this case is wrong. I'm not a fan of Hermione, but book 7 where Horcrux-addled Ron presumes she has to choose between him and Harry bothered me a bit.

Hermione attacking Ron with birds in book 6 also bothered me.

Harry just is there. He acknowledges Hermione as pretty, but he really isn't attracted to her.

Sorry for rambling. I like fics like this, but going for canon issues that were glossed over.
