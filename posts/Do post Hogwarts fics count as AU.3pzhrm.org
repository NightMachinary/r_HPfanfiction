I was having a discussion with a friend the other day about AU. She believes that all post-Hogwarts fics are AU, including the fics that are canon compliant because we have so little to go on. I'm divided on the issue and was wondering what you guys might think.


** No.

AU explicitly changes something known about canon/assumes a different universe as its premise. Something can build extensively from canon, and so long as canon is complied with, it is not AU.

E.g. Alexandra Quick, Unatoned, and The Pillars of Power, are not AU. Alexandra Potter, Renegade Cause, and OTWTG are all AU.

** For me, I consider any fanfic that has any difference in canon /before the start/ of the fanfic an AU.

Also, anything that explicitly changes how the actual Harry Potter universe works is also AU.

Stories can divert from canon and not be AU. Right up until they are. But not always. More of a judgement call.

That's usually how I categorise an AU.

** Not really. I don't think AU is really applicable unless the /main body of work/ is somehow changed in a drastic way.
