It has been a while. Hermione is blind and lives on her own, and Lucius gets trapped in a painting which ends up in her possession.


** Is this fic more than 10 years old and could it have been a mirror instead of a painting?

*** Yes, I read it ages ago. Hmm, mirror does sound more familiar.

**** I think the author might be shilohdarke. I remember corresponding with her way back when only a handful of us were writing lmhg. I think it was posted on adultfanfiction.net but a glance at her profile there doesn't show the fic. She has posted an original story on amazon that seems to be adaption of that fic so it's likely that she took the fanfic down.
