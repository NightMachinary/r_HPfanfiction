how would one get accepted into a teaching profession at hogwarts? what questions would be asked? what is the procedure they'd have to follow?


** Thank you for applyin for the DADA position at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Please answer truthfully, are you afraid of the following:

A grizzly death?

Memory loss, and/or loss of sanity?

Being ousted as a werewolf?

Being held captive and impersonated for months at a time?

Being a lackey for a wildly incompetent politician?

Being tricked out of an early retirement by a manipulative old man?

Mysterious curses and general mayhem?

If the answer to all of the above is no, then you may consider yourself hired.

Regards,

Minerva McGonagall, deputy Headmistress.

** Based on my own experiences.

Two degrees, one in a field, one in teaching (though I doubt the teaching degree is a real think in wizard land)

Lengthy application detailing so much personal essay information about interests, hobbies, how you'll contribute to the school, professional development and how you hope to improve and all information you know about educational policies.

4 person interview about the school your applying for, how you will uphold the ethos, subject knowledge and classroom management/policies and safety.

Then a year minimum 'trial period' (which in Hogwarts seems to be a literal survival test) followed by two more years until you can actually be made permenant.

Aside from the certainty of death, I can see why they struggle getting DADA teachers, becoming a teacher is a fucking nightmare.

*** We know for a fact that the interview panel for Hogwarts consists of only Dumbledore - Trelawney gave the Prophecy at her interview for Divinations professor, and was witnessed only by Dumbledore and eavesdropping Snape.

** From the few examples we have seen in Canon, the recruitment of a new teacher (at least at Hogwarts) seem to be at the complete discression of the Headmaster. In case of vacancy, he would search for applicants (either thanks to a notice in a newspaper or word of mouth), and then decide by himself who he would hire among them. If we follow the example of Trewalney, applicants should be given an interview to prove their mastery over their field, but it doesn't seem to be a requirement (I don't think Lockart could have demonstrated anything). As a pure guess, I would say that the interview would also be the occasion to exchange with the applicant about his goals and motivations (a bit like he did with Tom Riddle when he asked for the DADA position).

In some case, the Headmaster could also completely ignore the search and directly approach someone to propose him the position. That's what happened with Lupin, Moody, Slughorn, potentially Hagrid as well as McGonnagall before she was made as old as him. There didn't seem to be any interviews in this case, but it's probably due to the fact that Dumbledore already had a clear understanding of the skills of these peoples.

We also know that, should the Headmaster fail to fill a position, the Ministry can send someone as a replacement. But since they send Umbridge, we can say that in this case, the recruitment is made at the total discression of the Minister himself.

â€‹

Also, I want to say that the magical world doesn't have any concept of "Higher Learning" and that the NEWTs are the highest possible diplomas one can obtain. Some positions may need an additional formations once they recruit someone (like Aurors, and probably Healers), but there doesn't seem to be any Magical University. Because of it, applicants need to prove their mastery over a subject themselves rather than show a diploma. But as long as one can show his experience, no diplomas are needed to become a teacher (Hagrid because the Care professor with a 3rd year education, and without Dumbledore, Dipet would probably have recruited a 17 years old Riddle with only his NEWTs).

*** Basically it is how wizarding Britain is functioning. The Minister of Magic has all liberty of action with no counter powers to his own. The Moment that he has lost the public trust he is outed perhaps by the wizengamot or the Department Heads. Similarly the Headmaster of Hogwarts once selected by the Board of Governors has free reign by discretionary powers, he can have much influence over the Governors and only the unanimous vote of the Governors can suspend him.

And The ministry can seize control of Hogwarts at their will.

*** I think it wouldn't be out of theme for there to be a Mastery after Hogwarts based on each subject. It might not specifically qualify you for anything but would be a boost in reputation. And perhaps the Mastery could be for subjects not taught in Hogwarts like Alchemy. A top marks student would search for a Master to learn from and they'd have to demonstrate near perfect proficiency.

** "Come in, please, Mister Riddle, have a seat. A lemon sherbet? Thank you for coming in for an interview!"

"The pleasure is all mine, Professor Dumbledore."

"I seem to recall that you had previously applied the Defence position and were turned down by my predecessor."

"Indeed, Professor Dippet encouraged me to reapply when I was older and more experienced."

"Ah, yes, old Armando was rather old-school... Now, then, your resume...

"Education... Straight O student, 12 OWLs, 12 NEWTs, Slytherin Prefect, Best Boy, Special Services Award..." Dumbledore looked up. "That is rather impressive, Mister Riddle.

"Moving on, work experience... Five years as a clerk at Borgin & Burkes... Hmm... And then, there is this ten-year employment gap you have." He put the resume down and looked up at Tom. "These seem to be some odd choices for someone aiming at a teaching career. Would you care to fill in any details?"

"I would not, but..."

"Then, Mister Riddle, I am afraid that I will be hiring someone with more relevant experience. Thank you again for coming. Wonky here will show you out."
