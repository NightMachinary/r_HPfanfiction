Because the idea just struck me the other day, and I feel like haven't really seen it done? Anyone knows a fic wherein young Draco chances upon TMR's diary in Lucius study or something, completely by accident.

** I don't remember the name but there was a fic where the horcrux awakens inside Harry and manipulates him into doing evil shit and in the same fic it was Draco who ended up with the diary.

** Found it! (I think) it's only a fairly minor part compared to the rest of the story, but I'm 99% positive that Draco does become possessed by the diary in this fic linkffn(12433976)

  A strange bird appears in the dungeons. One that is hurt and might be a wizard with a depression. What will happen when he finds out that the bird is the abused son of the hated James Potter? Will he be able to help the boy? And what about Severus' friends the Malfoys. What will they say if they find out that Harry Potter is a Shadow Phoenix that is living with Severus Snape?
