I am looking for a fic where harry himself drives the action. Far to many works fall into the category of shit happens to harry he gets a new power then more shit happens, author realizes that they need to be going somewhere with this so they realize they have to make harry kill voldemort so they have somewhere to go with the plot. What I am really looking for is a preffereably HHr fic where the main characters drive the action towards a goal preferably with a mix of hogwarts and abroad action, but most preferably it NEEDS fast pace. Bungle in the jungle would almost fall into the category I described except it has pace shit happens to harry at first but harry makes shit happen later. I understand that narrative pace is just something that a good work does properly but does anyone know of a fic where harry has and completes a goal relatively quickly. While it has it's flaws Vox Corporis comes to mind as it states its goal and sticks to it, it doesn't have 5 different subplots where dumbledore and snape are in a relationship, and fudge leads his time traveling thestral herd to resurrect Voldemort.


** The problem you are having is that typically heroes are reactive, while villains are proactive.[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact][There is an entire TV tropes page on this, in fact.]] This only makes sense, as most of the time Harry would be perfectly content to live out his life in peace, except all this crazy stuff keeps happening. This is largely true in fanfiction as well for the same narrative reasons: the good guys protect and defend, while the villains despoil. It's also a part of the three act structure: the Hero has a call to adventure, usually because of something the villain did.

That said, some time travel fics feature a more proactive Harry. linkffn(Backwards with a Purpose Part I: Always and Always) has a very proactive Harry who hits the ground running hell bent and destroying Voldemort and saving everyone.

linkffn(Long Live the Queen) has Harry and Co actively seeking HRM help, though admittedly after a lot has happened to them.

linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) isn't about Harry, but Ron is certainly very proactive (and Harry is in the background) when it comes to gathering information and acting on it to defeat two Dark Lords.

*** Yeah the more I think about it i'm realizing I really just need to read properly edited work, I guess you could call it amateur fatigue you read enough fic and you realize you just want to read something all the chaff separated from the grain.

** My story, [[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights]] , fits your needs perfectly! :) My female Harry Potter is the absolute driving force of the entire plot, and she's aggressively proactive in setting and accomplishing her own goals, and she globe hops the entire time as she /makes her own plot./ It's to the point that other characters can't keep up with her, even!

And I do think the pace is pretty fast. Sometimes I think I have made it too fast, really. I'm not finished writing it yet, but I just got story arcs and outlines finished so I do know where I want to go very clearly now. I update like once a week or a week and a half. :)
