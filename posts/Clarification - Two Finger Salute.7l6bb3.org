I was reading a story the other day - i can't be bothered to look it up - and one of the characters gave another character a two finger salute as a goodbye. It was wildly out of character, and nobody bothered to point it out in character. The only conclusion i could come was that giving a two fingered salute does not in fact mean that someone is using both of their middle fingers to say 'fuck you'. What is a two fingered salute, if it's not 'fuck you'?


** When a UK person gives the 2-fingered salute, they are not using both middle fingers, but rather the index and middle fingers like you're giving the peace sign, but with the knuckles of the fingers facing the person being saluted. The story goes that in the Middle Ages, the French would cut those particular fingers off of captured archers, making them unable to use their English longbows. The English bowmen developed the gesture as a "fuck you, I still have my fingers and I'm going to shoot you" thing.

Now, you haven't provided any context for this occurrence in the fic so I can't say whether it was OOC or not, but in my own personal life, I've certainly flipped the bird to friends and even my husband as a joke. It's not always a serious fuck off--context definitely matters.

*** Also that story is complete bogus. We never actually cut archers' fingers and this sign is way more recent (18th century I thinkj).

**** I don't know if this story is true or not, however I do know that cutting the fingers from the ennemy's archers was a common thing to do in the Middle Ages.

*** We actually talked about this during my English class the other day. I'm pretty sure it actually means "up yours", and not fuck you.

**** Up yours, fuck you--kind of all of a piece. My BFF and I learned about it in high school when she had her British pen pal visit over the summer. We participated in a knowledge exchange and demonstrated the bird and the double bird. We also learned that "bum" meant something very different! It went something like this:

Brit: Plays joke on American friend.

American friend: "You dirty bum!"

Brit: "Oi! You wot, mate?"

**** Never listen to an english teacher if it's about anything rude. He will always lie to make it easier for him. Two finger salute is "fuck you", a simple 2 minutes google research will proove it.

** I'm gonna assume it's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-finger_salute][this one]] in context, rather than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_sign#As_an_insult][this one]]. :)

** A two fingered salute in this context means bringing your middle address index finger to your head and saluting.
