It depends on how well it's written but predominantly, i always feel that Harry should point out to them he's NOT their son, just a stranger who wears his face and they're just strangers who look like his parents.

It feels disingenuous for Harry to instantly fall into their arms. For lily to instantly feel that he's theirs is a bit more normal because she had a bond that was broken but for harry, aside from dreams, they never existed except in words.

What are your thoughts? Am i just a cold, heartless bastard?


** In those very popular fics where Harry met his parents in another dimension, he was generally very reserved towards them, for example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925)

He warmed up to them eventually, but only after getting to know them well. I totally agree with this approach.

And on the other hand, Harry could have gotten to know his parents better via use of the stone of resurrection, and yet he chose to instead discard it somewhere where nobody will find it. Of course he did have other reasons, greater than his desire, but considering how the stone is supposed to tempt people I do think it is a sign that he did actually come to terms with it at least somewhat and as such wouldn't need to treat some people from another dimension as his parents' substitutes.

There's a very very large realm of possibilities between the polar extremes of treating them like strangers and thinking of them as substitutes for his real parents. Wanting to get to know them and build some kind of familial relationship doesn't mean he hasn't come to terms with the death of his real parents.

Yes, but do remember that this isn't the first time Harry encountered something that was dangerous in quite a similar way, and this time he was able to reject it on his own whereas the previous time Dumbledore needed to tell him to stop and actually make it impossible for Harry to continue. Faustian themes aside, that might or might not mean that he did come to terms with the fact that they are dead and won't come back, because this time he managed to stop on his own rather than only when someone else forced him to stop.

Not to mention that there really wouldn't be a universe in which either James or Lily would have the exact same experiences as his parents (because that set of experiences led to them dying), which means their personality could also be different. Sure, that doesn't necessarily mean much, for the very fact that they are wearing a familiar face might be enough to make Harry see them differently than he would any other people, but automatically presuming that they will each be a “perfect replica” is also way too simplistic.

*** I see two problems with this answer:

- she is not 'a stranger that just happens to look like your mom'. She is your mom from another dimension. She would have the same personality, character and (depending where the dimensions split off) the same history and background.

- Harry is an orphan who desperately wants to get to know his parents. He has a different mindset than people who had parents growing up.

People are shaped by their experiences. If she made different decisions and lived a different life, it means she is not the same person; she could have been, but she isn't. This also means that her personality might not be exactly the same, and in any case Harry didn't really know much about his parents. As such, whether or not he would react to a person like that depends on him rather than some kind of set-in-stone rule.

Harry didn't know his parents, and his efforts to learn about them were never desperate; this means that trying to show him as “an orphan who desperately wants to get to know his parents” isn't really right. And as for the different mindset, let it be known that he talked with the shadows of his parents through the stone of resurrection, and yet for all we know he never did it again; this shows him to be someone who would be content with being himself rather than trying to present himself as somehow related to people from another dimension just because they are similar to his parents.

To be fair, he does see his parents in the Mirror of Erised. Meeting them is his heart's greatest desire. He spends several nights just looking at them, till the point he almost loses contact with reality.

Yes, of all the Hallows, he says that he wants the Stone - to talk to the dead. He doesn't use it because it's not wise. But if he could, he would have.

Harry has a yearning for his parents and that does come across several times in the series. The Mirror of Erised in PoS (like I said above), in PoA, he's so sure that his father is going to come (that's his first guess), in GoF, he says that he thought of his mother more than anyone else during priori incantatem, in DH, they are the one he turns to when he's about to die...

********* Yes, definitely. I forgot to add that I was mostly talking about a young-ish Harry - like till his 4th year or around. I would say Harry's age is an important factor in this question. A young Harry would probably not hesitate if it means being with his parents.

An older one, though, would be more wary. I feel like he would want to be with his parents. The yearning would still be here but he would also think of the 'family' he left behind (Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Luna...) It would be an emotionally torn Harry. Plus, he would be a bit wiser and realise that it's another Lily. Same as his mother but not his mother.

********** I think that's the crux of the difference between the two answers, then. A young Harry definitely hadn't come to terms with it yet and he most likely would try to get closer to people from another reality who are the equivalents of his parents. The stories where Harry travels across dimensions generally are about an adult Harry, which is why my comment higher up the chain pertained to that one rather than a kid Harry.

Young Harry, sure, he would try to get closer to anyone who could in any way be family to him. I mean, he kept on trying with the Dursleys up until the very moment when he left for Hogwarts if not for longer, he immediately accepted Sirius, Hermione was like a sister to him and Ron like a brother. Throw Harry of that age into another dimension where James and Lily are alive and I can see them needing a crowbar to detach him.

I would be the rare ones that would just break down into manly tears. You see, I've always been a very emotional person. It could be because of the mental conditions I have or my less-than-happy childhood.

If my mum died and I somehow lived on and I saw her in the street one day I would probably cry and begin to apologise for every wrongdoing I did in my life, even if it didn't concern her. I'd turn into a clingy child and just force myself to be with her. I would be the easiest person to fool in that aspect because I would ignore any different mannerisms in order to spend time with her.

I agree with you on some extent, I just wouldn't be able to walk away. I know that it wouldn't be my mum, but I would do it anyway.

They always seems really genuinely happy about the discovery, but aren't sure about where to go from that point, what to do, what the relationship is, etc. I think a happy yet uncertain, semi-reserved outlook would be the best on both sides.
