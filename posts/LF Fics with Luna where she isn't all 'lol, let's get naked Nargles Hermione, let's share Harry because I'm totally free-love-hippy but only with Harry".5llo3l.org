Luna is one of those characters where I used to enjoy how nearly everyone portrayed her as some lolrandom kinky cutie pie, but now my skin itches when I see her act like she's been hit on the head too much. Are there any fics where she's not part of some Harry/Hermione/Luna threesome, or some super crazy conspiracy theorist or way too into how often Harry showers?

No genderbending, mpreg, romance driven plot or pottercest, please. I'm okay with bashing/slash/crossovers. Thank you!


** Linkffn(11923164)

This fic does an amazing job with Luna, really sticking true to her character. I think it's fully canon compliant, actually.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** I was hesitant to read that one for months, but when I finally did, I was pleasantly surprised.

It takes some skill to write a /friendship/ fic with an in-character Snape, never mind Luna. This one accomplishes both, while making me wish that it had an AU ending.

Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

Luna is an important character in the excellent "Not From Others," which is Ginny's POV of /Deathly Hallows./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others]]

And this one is the Luna fic I hold above all others--it has its faults, but given that it's /pre-HBP/ it's remarkable how much "Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection" holds up.

** Not sure I have anything you wouldn't have read already. Honestly the only ones that spring to mind are Protection from Nargles and Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor, which are an incomplete series. Maybe also Help of a Seer, but it's been years since I've read it, and I can't vouch for the quality anymore. linkffn(7548963) linkffn(7352166)

Unfortunately, Luna is a difficult character to write, and it's easier to write a nymphomaniac who only longs for Harry than the weird but lovable girl from canon.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.
