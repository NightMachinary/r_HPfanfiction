*** This fic is pretty gen, but it shows the differences in canon that would have to occur for the basis of the ship. It's covers books 2-4, the sequel linkffn(No Journey's End) picks up at book 5 and has more shippy undertones (so far).

**** This fic is actually really good! Harry's character is really well written and the plot is good. And even though the summary says there is a future HP/SS pairing, there is no pairing or romance at all so far even though quite a lot of the fic is written already. I can't stand that pairing and I love this fic.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?
