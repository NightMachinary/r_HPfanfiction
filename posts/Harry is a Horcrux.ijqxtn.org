Harry hunts down all the horcrux and destroyed them. Voldemort was the last to be destroyed, leaving only Harry as the last remaining horcrux.

Harry is nearly indestructible and, because of his status as a horcrux, is also immortal.


** !linkao3(A Station South of Canon). Harry is indestructible from the get-go and takes liberal advantage of it.

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.
