You know like the invisibility cloak, resurrection stone, elder wand, Philosopher's Stone, etc?

Personally, it's Project Guardian, which is basically a larger version of the Marauders' Map but on a scale of Wizarding Britain which shows where trouble is at the moment. I thought it was pretty neat and useful for a place that is war ridden.


** Probably "Language Lozenges", the sweets that allow you to speak a foreign language while you're sucking them. They have a very Harry Potter feel, in that they're very tactile. Their effect is also well balanced: good enough to be extremely useful, but limited enough to explain why everyone in the world doesn't speak 20 languages.

The one addition I would make is to have their flavour derive from the language. E.g. the French Lozenges would taste of garlic.

****** You may be thinking of a different story there. PKH is by Perfect Lionheart/Skysaber (and yeah, the name says a lot about the guy, doesn't it?) and it's pretty typical of his works.

That is to say, there are some interesting ideas and the prose is pretty decent, but he keeps adding more and more plot threads rather than actually following his original premises to any kind of conclusion, his main characters tend to turn into OP Mary Sues and between said Mary Sue-ness and his apparent sociopathy + whatever weird-ass religion he follows creeping in around the edges you'll generally find yourself asking 'wait, are these supposed to be the /good/ guys?' by around the halfway mark.

None of this is helped by the fact that he's incredibly thin-skinned and tends to throw temper tantrums over any reviews that aren't absolutely glowing with praise, often posting long-winded rants in response and then going on to deliberately do the exact opposite of any suggestions he receives out of spite.

In this particular story [[/Harry%20decides%20to%20get%20serious%20about%20studying%20while%20in%20Diagon%20Alley%20the%20summer%20before%20third%20year;%20which%20butterflies%20the%20dementor%20encounter%20on%20the%20train%20enough%20for%20him%20to%20get%20attacked;%20which%20shakes%20loose%20the%20horcrux%20in%20his%20scar%20enough%20for%20him%20to%20gain%20access%20to%20Voldemort's%20skills%20and%20memories;%20which%20leads%20to%20him%20discovering%20that%20Dumbledore%20is%20actually%20ridiculously,%20over-the-top%20evil;%20which%20leads%20to%20him,%20Hermione%20and%20Luna%20meeting%20and%20becoming%20the%20champions%20of%20the%20Fairy%20Queen%20because%20she%20too%20is%20threatened%20by%20Dumbledore's%20evil;%20which%20leads%20to%20shenanigans%20with%20time-travel%20and%20space%20exploration%20and%20so%20on,%20and%20so%20forth...][spoiler]]

**** I may simply be misremembering it. If so, I prefer this version.

I don't doubt that there *is* a magical way to learn languages, because Crouch Sr. couldn't possibly speak over 200 languages fluently without the aid of magic*. But equally, from the fact that Crouch's language skills are still considered laudable, there must be some difficulty to this process, whether in terms of difficulty in performing the magic, or otherwise an investment of time.

*A Muggle who had an incredible mind for languages and devoted their life to language learning could probably learn 200 languages over their lifetime. But they wouldn't be fluent in them simultaneously, because by the time they got to 200, loads of the earlier ones will have become rusty. And in any case, Crouch is clearly not devoting his life to learning languages.

******* Huh. Interesting.

I had a similar idea, if far less extreme; to make a Language Lozenge a person must give up their fluency of a language, to be stored in the lozenge.

This, along with other expensive ingredients and the labor costs that a highly skilled enchanter/potioneer would demand, makes them extraordinarily expensive.

Possibly very limited in quantity too. I imagine this might be a product that costs the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you may need to order them months in advance.

*** I really like this idea, and agree that there needs to be some balancing mechanic.

Prince of Slytherin has "language potions" which confer permanent fluency of a language, but the tradeoff is (1) it's super expensive and (2) the potions need to be manually updated, so all the languages are super out of date. Hermione takes one to learn Italian, and she speaks like she's from the 1920s.

It also works nicely because it fits into the world of the fic (where similar potions exist for all subjects, with the same restrictions) and is integrated well (the government issues all children born in wizarding households Math and English potions to the 8th grade level, but as a result the purebloods talk differently than the muggle borns, since their potions are somewhat out of date).

** My favourite was actually from [[/u/Taure]] where there was a flame in the Department of Mysteries that symbolised/powered the floo and a handshake sculpture that allowed people to form binding magical contracts.

*** Ah, so much packed into that scene.

The story behind the clasped hands sculpture is actually not that it created the ability to form binding magical contracts, but rather that it "captured" the power, which was previously wild. Historically, anyone could form a binding magical agreement, but in bringing the power under the Ministry's aegis, the Ministry gained the ability to vary and even void magical agreements.

There's a lot of backstory in some of the other objects mentioned.

For example, the stone map of the UK with a blackboard next to it is the Taboo. You write a word on the blackboard and it becomes Taboo, showing up on the map as a light any time someone says it.

Meanwhile, the wand on the cushion in that scene is Excalibur (which became a sword in legend as the story was repeated and changed over time). It is a special wand, crafted by Merlin, which cannot be used to cast normal spells but can be used to perform "national magic" which has effect over the entire country. The Trace and Taboo were made using it, for example, and when the Ministry of Magic asked Dumbledore to upgrade Britain's magical defences in the 1930s, he used it to create the Sound.

This was also a part of Alexandra Potter's backstory, if you ever read that. The "First Lord of the Wand" is briefly referred to. This is a title granted to a senior, powerful wizard who is loyal to the Minister for Magic, who historically acted as the custodian of Excalibur but in the present has a position of power somewhat similar to the IRL Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Rather than the wand becoming a sword through natural story evolution, wouldn't it be both more likely and more straightforward if it had been one of the alterations made to the stories when the Statute of Secrecy was put in place? We know they fudged about the Arthurian Story, most glaringly by pushing it back a few hundred years in history, thus obscuring all remaining archeological evidence of it and allowing it to slip into obscurity. It stands to reason they might have changed a wizarding Arthur to a Muggle one by the same token, and, as a result, changed Excalibur from a wand to a sword.

Wayjournals where Harry and his SO could maintain contact then as they got older, could 'interact' via it. I forget which story that was.

There was an evil harry in space story on fictionhunt that's dead. He used magical components and weaponry components and his own blood to make artifact guns for his muggle troopers which was dope af, stealing that for a story.

** I really like the Cup of Magic from linkffn(12299677).

From the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The thing that changed the world forever, is on a raised pedestal in Level Minus Twenty-Eight surrounded by a shimmering cobweb of blue light. It's a mug - a stained, slightly cracked, ceramic mug with a list of easily-pronounceable anti-hangover Charms printed on the side, along with its former owner's name (misspelt), filled with what looks like glowing vanilla ice cream.

  As you descend the stairs, Albus Dumbledore, the Chief Warlock will tell you that the ordinary background magic concentration in, say, Wales -- is around 0.0001 thaums per cubic centimetre. He'll also tell you that within the body tissue of a wizard, it's five thaums per cubic centimetre, and that up until 1931, the highest magic concentration ever recorded had been in the central locus of the Cup of Dawn when Merlin created the Interdict -- about one hundred million thaums per cubic centimetre.

  At this point, curiosity piqued, you'd naturally ask him: "How many thaums per cubic centimetre does the cup have?"

  To which he would respond: "Around ten to the forty-one."

  This is the unimaginatively-named Cup of Magic. It was created when a Junior Unspeakable named Reginald Rookwood sneezed during an experimental ritual to turn water into whiskey in 1931, and in doing so, knocked out every electrical grid in the Northern Hemisphere for four hours, permanently melted an entire Ministry corridor, caused an electrical storm to form over a corner store in Diagon Alley, and created a new island in the North Sea. Some people say it broke magic and doomed wizardkind forever, but over the sixty-three years between then and now, the Cup of Magic has powered over six hundred and eighty thousand rituals, several of which involved creating objects with a larger mass than the Moon and had to be conducted entirely in outer space.

*** That fics needs to be recommended more. It's really good from what I've read. The best sides of /Discworld/, /HPMOR/ and canon rolled into one. Bit of an incoherent narrative with the time shifts, unfortunately.

  Featuring a Cold War where both sides were helped by wizards, Hermione as a straitlaced bookworm who also blows up buildings sometimes, Harry Potter as a mind-clone of Tom Riddle, three transnational corporations figuring out how magic can be their competitive edge, and Ozland Cunningham who's a little confused about the whole thing (HPMOR fic, AU but not just for the sake of it)

  After the confrontation with Voldemort after the third task of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry doesn't get sad. He doesn't get mad. He gets even.

*** It's from the Unbroken Universe which starts with Promises Unbroken, followed by Promises Remembered and ends with Promises Defended. It's got a really interesting twist and truly shows you and makes you wonder how things could've been. The premise is basically what would've happened if Sirius had been the secret keeper instead of Peter. I honestly loved this characterization of Peter, he was so precious here as weird as it may sound but his characterization was pure gold and well-done in my opinion. It's rare to find such a great Peter. It's centered around the Marauders and Snape and they're very well-written.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.
