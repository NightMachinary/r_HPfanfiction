I heard someone mention something like this recently, and I wanted to see if people agreed.

Obviously, "sufficiently large number" is rather vague. But I think that, with Harry Potter having the most fics, we can start there...and I'm skeptical that anyone can come up with a fic that's actually better than the original book series. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot that I love and read over and over again. But they just can't compare...

Of course, there's also a debate to be had over what "better" means. I'd be interested in starting with the basics (e.g. prose, plotting, pacing, characterization, enjoyability) rather than things like originality, worldbuilding, or ability to stand on its own, which would complicate things a lot, seeing as this is fanfiction. So, does anyone have any arguments? I'm really curious to know what people think!


** I think the only part where a fair amount of fics are better than Rowlings work is worldbuilding. Rowlings world is paperthin, while many a good fic build complex and engaging wizarding worlds.

** A complicating factor is that Rowling's work isn't uniform in quality. Some of the books in the Harry Potter series are quite good (e.g. /Chamber of Secrets/) while others aren't, to put it gently (e.g. /Deathly Hallows/). If you want a fanfic which is better than the best of canon or canon as a whole then you have a much higher bar than if you're just looking for fanfic which is better than /some/ of canon.

Anyway, I'd suspect that a fair number of fanfics are better than the worst of Rowling's series while few if any match her best work.

*** That part about some books being better than others comes down to opinions, though. Everyone has their own opinion on what book is the best (although I do agree with you about Deathly Hallows).

About the discussion itself: it comes down to too many factors to come up with a law like OP is suggesting. Writing a novel allows you an incredible amount of freedom, with infinite possibilities on how the story would go. So you've got an infinite set of possibilities for the original novel, and then you've got to take into account how varying the fanfictions about that story can be (another very large number).

In the end you would have a very dubious formula that would probably have an answer that's way too small to be taken seriously. It's just not feasible.

*** Interesting, I would probably put CoS as my least favorite.

Opinions! Crazy things!

*** You think CoS is good? Wow. I mean, it's not bad, but it's def not the best of the series at all.

Re: your last point, I think there are a few that do match her best work, and maybe one or two that surpass it, but it's subjective to some extent.

** None of the fanfictions I've read comes even close in terms of characterization, creativity, world building, and writing quality of the original books.

But I have serious beef with some plot elements in the books. The most major one was that adults (Voldemort, Death Eaters, Dumbledore, OoTP, the Ministry) were INTENTIONALLY DUMBED DOWN so the kids could play heroes. The first two books, though fun to read, were the most guilty in that aspect. Later books were better, but JKR had already painted herself into a corner by then.

As a result, I found several fics that I enjoy more than the books. For example, [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822&format=choose][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has excellent characterization, writing, and world building. I would say its plot is significantly better than canon. The Dumbledore in that story is brilliant, and his struggles against Tom Riddle have been well explained.

I agree with you. My least favorite part about the series is how a lot of the adults are either mindbogglingly incompetent or criminally negligent.

** "Better" is always relative. But with over 700K stories on FFnet alone, odds are there is at least one story you like more than canon.

** Short answer: no.

Long answer: no, the only “law” there is the one saying that most stuff is shit.

There might or might not be stories that are better than canon, and the likelihood of them existing increases as the number of derivative stories increases, but there's no law saying that it must be a thing.

** I don't think fanfic can ever be better than canon. If you think a story is better than canon, you don't really like the original source and you're really after something completely different.

** Well, as you said, a great deal of it comes down to personal preference.

I, for example, like HP a fair bit, but enjoy fanfictions based on it much more than I enjoy the original work. I like in depth worldbuilding, I like competent and intelligent adults, I like creative and varied magic, I like fascinating characters with depth and moral shades (Shoutout to my man Snape, and probably Dumbledore too). Canon was interesting enough to read through once, but it lacked in too many areas that I personally find important.

However, the friend who introduced me to fanfiction loves HP canon, and there will never be a fanfic that surpasses canon for him.

In the end, the only thing you can say for sure is that we have enough fanfics in the HPfanfic-verse now, that for most people, there will be at least one fanfic they enjoyed more than canon.

Doesn't mean it's inherently better, but neither does it mean it's worse. (I get irrationally upset when people insist that nothing can be better than canon because it's canon.)

** Apparently not, because no HP fanfic is better than canon. I don't read fanfiction of other fandoms though, so that can be the exception to the rule.
