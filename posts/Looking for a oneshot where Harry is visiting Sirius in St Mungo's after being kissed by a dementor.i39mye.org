It's been a while since I've read this one, and I've been trying to find it again ever since. It was on FFN, and fairly short. The 'punchline' is... Sirius is slowly becoming a dementor, as that's what happens when kissed.

  The Patronus charm requires a happy memory. Harry Potter doesn't have many, and the Dementors get Sirius, after all.But the story is far from over.
