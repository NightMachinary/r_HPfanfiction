:END:
In a world where the Fates shape your Path, a child is born to the First. The Form is chosen shortly after and the first Shape is set, the Path given the first Turn. The child knows not the Form and sees not the End. The child simply follows the Path, cobbling it along the way stone for stone, making Shapes along the Path. And so the Weave of Fate is woven, crossing, entwining and bridging.

The Path is Formed by the First, Shaped by the Second and Ended by the Third. But while all may know both Form and Shape, none but the Third may know the End, for to force the End is to violate both Shape and Form and constrain the Weave.

A child is born, his Path twice-Ended by one who knows not the Weave, and so the Weave knots and twists, one Path distorted by the next and all that which was is changed. And the Fates see that which has, is and will be shudder, twist, collapse, Form anew and nothing now is as it was, for the very Fabric of the World has changed.

/END PROMPT/

Yeah, another idea that just didn't want to disappear - a very open-ended prompt that has taken multiple rewrites just to get at least part of the picture into words.

As with all my prompts, I hope to inspire writers to seek out unique twists to minor or major parts of their storylines, be it a minor change to the way Magic works or a new way to just flip the chessboard and start up a game of poker for shits and giggles

This prompt started out as an OC for One Piece and it just mutated in my brain into this... you know your brain is twisted when you change fandom and base idea within 30 minutes
