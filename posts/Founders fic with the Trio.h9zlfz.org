Exactly what it says. Founder fics that involve the trio. Maybe the trio travel back to Founders era or the Founders are reincarnated as the trio or Founders somehow become their mentors or... anything really. As long as it involves the founders and the trio. Preferably long and multi chaptered. No bashing please.

*** Yeah. Read that one twice already. That was what inspired me to post this actually.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

The founders return posing as fifth-year students to investigate and end the Ministry's involvement at Hogwarts. Godric and Harry's friendship is honestly really heartwarming. All the pairings are slash and femslash.
