I just thought it'd be a fun thing to think about.

What would each character write about? What themes/settings/genres would they be interested in, based on who they are?

Harry I could see write about family and friendships genres.

Ron I could see write about adventures, mystery and the like.

Hermione: Likely school settings with characters, exploring magic, and different elements

What about you guys? What do you see them writing about? Or other characters outside of them, if you'd like.


** I can see Harry and Ginny wring crack fics trying to one up each other

Ron would be action

Hermione would be those long fics either as a crossover with LOTR or a retelling with everything included

** Harry: Fluff

Ron: Adventure or humor

Hermione: Those fanfics where the plot is just a vehicle to show off their extensive world building

** Ron would write Quidditch epics. Hermione mysteries solved by obscure Hogwarts' A History facts.

Snape would write angst.

Dumbledore musical comedies.

Ginny Action.

** Interesting question! Think Harry would write himself as a background character or secondary to not be the center of attention.

** Hermione would write stories with extremely long infodumps and background that assume everyone has read Hogwarts, a History.

Ron would solely write play-by-plays of matches where the Chudley Cannons win.

Harry writes auror reports explaining how the dead guy was /definitely/ actually a dark wizard.

**** Arthur would be the type of dad who makes up voices for every single character. And even make up his own noises/sound effects while reading.

** I can imagine Lavender and Parvati writing fanfics.

Parvati would be the kind to write rare pair one shots as a gift to Lavender for on special holidays or something.

Lavender would write a 500k+ angsty slow burn fic following multiple characters and their relationships. Heavy drama and lots of smut. Includes every trope you can think of. Cheating, accidental pregnancy, amnesia, secret second family, enemies to lovers, mutual pining, forced bed sharing, love potions, time travel, major character death, etc...
