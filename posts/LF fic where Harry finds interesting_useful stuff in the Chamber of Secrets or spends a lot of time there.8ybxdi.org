  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry's been learning about pure-blood culture, with Pansy's help, and trying to blend in as an ordinary wizard. But will all his attempts at seeming normal be ruined when they find out he can speak to snakes? His Slytherin friends take the news differently than the Gryffindors. Smart!Harry, Sane!Voldemort. Complete. Part 3 of "Perfectly Normal".

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

** Linkffn(Animagus Mishap!)

Kind of a crazy fic, but it does involve the chamber of secrets....

There is one out there where he finds the staff of Salazar in the chamber but I can't remember it.

  The story starts in Harry's Fourth Year at Hogwarts; after a summer of un-suspected twist and turns, being able to spend time with Sirius, learning to become an Animagus and realizing some home truths, Harry returns to Hogwarts as a different person: one that won't be controlled by others. DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE NOT 18 OR OVER! Harry/HUGE Harem. Please Read & Review!
