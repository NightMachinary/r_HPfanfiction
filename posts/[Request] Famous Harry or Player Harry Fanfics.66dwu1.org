Hi all,

I've been through similar posts on the page, and I'd like your updates recommendations!

I'm looking for your recommendations as to any fics that are based around the idea of Harry actually being famous. By this I mean like Superstar quidditch player or simply being truely famous as the BWL. Can be really AU, and Harry doesn't have to be BWL so long as he's famous.

Bonus points if: - He has multiple gf's (not harem, but one after another etc.) - Is also powerful

Amazing Bonus Points if: - He's a rock star

Examples include: The Rogue's Bet The Quidditch World Cup Etc.

Please know I've read a tonne of FFs so please dig out your most obscure recommendations

Please no slash, complete preferred but not abandoned WIPs are fine

** linkffn(harry potter and the hogwarts harem)

Year 8 fic where Harry is friends with benefits with basically everyone, largely because of his fame.

linkffn(harry potter and the veela nation)

AU with No second blood war. Harry is an adult diplomat and James is the minister. Not exceedingly well written, but Harry is rich and connected and sleeps around quite a bit.

#+begin_quote
  After the defeat of Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter finds himself being even more famous than he was before. Returning to Hogwarts for the finally time, there doesn't seem to be an end to the amount of beautiful girls who want to physically thank him. This is an Adult alternative-timeline Book 8, filled what-ifs and hook-ups. Strong sexual content and language.
