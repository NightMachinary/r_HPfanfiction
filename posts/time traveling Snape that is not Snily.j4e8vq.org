any fics where Snape time travels into his younger body, but it can't be Snape/Lily. because, all (and I mean all) of those go like this:

/Snape: oh, Lily, you are amazing. I always wanted to tell you, but I was stupid!/

/Lily: Severus, you are so mature now. I decided I'm in love with you./

/\/smoochy smooch**

it can be either marauders era, first war or Hogwarts era, just so he is fixing the past and nothing of the "can't change past because time travel paradox" bull. slash/het/no romance, all fine.

I don't keep lists so it's incomplete, but I remember already reading these: the boy who died a lot, to shape and change, no strings, hallowed king (this had worse romance than any Snily, but eh), I've also read one that focused on making a cure for werewolves, he visited a potions conference in Africa and it was discontinued which was a bummer. don't remember the name of that one; tongue and cheek (that fic was horrible though, only managed one chapter or so??? but it fits my request), different colors or redemption (a new one I don't like, but it fits)

to the toxic anti-Snape user that spreads hate in this community, don't even bother writing here, or I /will/ report you. you know who you are.


** Reboot by Kallanit is a good read

*** "Do you really want to marry a girl who looks just like your mother? Seriously? Do you know how disturbing that is? Besides, can you honestly tell me that she wants to marry Harry Potter and not the Boy-Who-Lived? That she even knows who Harry is?"

did you link the wrong fic

**** If you actually read the fic you will see that the pairing are snape x oc and harry x Hermione. The part you are quoting is a trope (Ginny or molly using potions on harry and death pointing it out) used in nearly all death sends harry back in time fics.

The difference in this fic ( as the OP asked for) is snape goes back as well but to an earlier point in the time line and becomes a brother like figure to lily and petunia which changes things.
