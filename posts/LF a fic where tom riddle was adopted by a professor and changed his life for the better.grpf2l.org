:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for that one fic where Tom was adopted by the ancient runes professor I think his name was Tofty?...Tufty? I can't remember, though I think he was in fact Harry Potter who time travelled. I remember that instead of Dumbledoor taking Hogwarts letter to Tom, he asked Professor Tofty?Tufty?..to take it.

*** Just read the whole thing in one sitting, very good. It is a tell and not show kind of story, with plenty of time skips and skimming over details, but when you have a great premise is works.

Loved it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry goes back in time due to a quirk of being the owner of the invisibility cloak (reincarnation deal). Time-travel, professor Harry with new (OC) identity, child Tom Riddle. No bashing involved. HP and canon belong to JK Rowling. Complete. This is less of a show and more of a tell story i.e. Dialogue gets really scarce at about ch. 13 and lots of time jumps.
