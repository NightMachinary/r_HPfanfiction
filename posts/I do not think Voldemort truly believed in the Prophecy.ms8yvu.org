After rereading the books (again), I had a thought concerning the Prophecy, and its importance for the characters. Canon makes it pretty clear (in OotP) that neither Harry, nor Dumbledore truly care, or believe in the Prophecy. Dumbledore doesn't tell the Prophecy to Harry because "you have to be the one to kill him", but rather because "he will never stop targeting you until you are dead". As for Harry, he is preparing to fight because he knows Voldemort would never stop (to quote Canon "/having the choice between walking into the Arena or being dragged in/", but also because it is not in his nature to let Voldemort kill innocent.

​

But the point I was wondering is "*Does Voldemort truly believe in the Prophecy?*".

If we judge his actions in Canon, it could be pretty easy to say "Yes", but I am not so sure, especially when his character is taken into account. Voldemort was someone obessessed with the idea of vanquishing Death, someone who saw "/the worst possible act of magic to not die, something so horrible I won't explain here how to do it/" and decided "/let's make seven of that/".

With this kind of character, it is obvious that he would not let any "prophetised enemy" live, not because he would truly believe in the prophecy, but more in a "just in case" mindset. The fact that the 2 potentials babies are both from members of the Order of the Phoenix makes the decision even easier (not that being born from Death Eaters would have saved any baby fitting the criterias). The 2 families are already on the "To kill or recruit" list, so it is just a matter of bumbing them up a few place in the priority order.\\
I mean yeah killing babies is horrible, but it's not like a sociopath like Voldemort would care, and why take a 1% risk when the 0% is attainable? This lack of trust in the Prophecy could also explain why Voldemort seemed open to the idea of recruiting Harry at the end of PS, even though I personally believe it was more a matter of needed his assistance and that Harry would have had a life expectancy of around 5 minutes after Voldemort got his body back (4 of them spent being tortured).

​

Of course, there is still the problem of OotP, where Voldemort is pretty much obessessed with the DoM and the Prophecy. But at this point of the series, Harry have already survived 3 fight with him (4 if you cound CoS with the Diary Horcrux), using every time some either unique or very rare form of magic :

- Prologue: Survived a Killing Curse in the face and somehow destroy the caster's body
- PS: Used his hand to litteraly burn him (or rather his host) to death
- GoF: Somehow raised the spirits of the fallen to help him escape

Every time they faced each other, Harry somehow escaped thanks to some esoteric magic. And Voldemort preparing a counter to one of these spells (like getting his blood in GoF to be able to touche him), Harry would just unlock a new skill and use it to escape. After all this time (and several failed murder attempts), Voldemort willingness to finally look into the rulebook is more than understandable.

Voldemort obession with Harry (at the end of the series) may also come from the fact that Harry's survivable made him a symbol. Both a symbol of his own failure, and one of hope for his opponents. Harry was a political symbol (which is exactly why the Ministry wanted to use him in HBP), and he had to die so his control over Britain was finally complete. This is also why he had to be the one doing it. A minion being able to do what he failed to may have made them proud and prone to betrayal.

​

To conclude, I don't really think that Voldemort truly put any more faith in the Prophecy than Harry and Dumbledore. His decision to kill him was first a logical one (he represent a very little risk, but he is killable and no risk is better than low risk). And after this, Harry refusal to die (or stay dead) made it personal.


** Yes, Voldemort was a megalomaniac afraid of being defeated. He outright did a "See! He's not so special. How could this be my defeater?" in GoF. He kidnapped Ollivander and switched wands to even the field.

But he believed in the prophecy as well. His decision to kill Harry was born of the idea that Harry was prophesized to kill him. Yes, Voldemort wanted the prophecy to learn how best to defeat Harry, but that also tells us he "set store by the prophecy."

Essentially, he wanted Harry dead to prove he was the best and he was using/wanted to use the prophecy to do it.

The fact that he attacked the Potter shows he gave some attention to the Prophecy, but what I was wondering was his motivations behind this act. Did he decide to kill Harry because he thought he had to kill him, and did just do it "just in case it comes back later".

If I had to make a comparaison with superstitious people, did Voldemort avoided to pass under the ladder because he was afraid to get bad luck, or did he just do it by habit because it costs almost no energy to just go around?

**** The most we can do is assume his motives were for targeting the target of the prophecy (i.e. Harry).

What we know from canon was that Voldemort was on the winning side of the war. But his reach seemed to stay at Wizarding Britain because of Dumbledore.

So, it's likely that Voldemort didn't want to have another obstacle rise up - one that was "prophesized" to defeat him - while his current - and biggest - obstacle is still alive and could potentially raise or protect Harry until he grows up to be the next obstacle.

** When I was a kid, I had a dog. One day this dog found a wasp and tried to bite it. The wasp stung her mouth.

My dog got /mad/. She tried to bite that wasp again and again and again, and got stung again and again and again. Eventually, my mother had to grab her and kill the wasp so that she would stop. My dog hunted up and down for that wasp for ages afterwards, and from then on whenever she heard an insect buzzing she went for it like a thing possessed.

Voldemort always reminded me of my dog when it came to his relationship/obsession with Harry Potter. I think it stopped being about the prophecy rather quickly and started being about Unending Rage. I think it started being about How Dare You Survive I'm Going To Make You Pay.
