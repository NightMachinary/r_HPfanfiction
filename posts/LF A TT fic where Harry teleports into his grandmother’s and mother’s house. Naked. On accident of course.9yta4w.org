Basically it was a marauders era story, with the usual Harry breaking all in story magic system rules because he's so speshiul and GR8

kindly appreciated if anyone remembers this story <3


** Linkffn(9762328) - Throwing out the Script by Formulaic. By bizarre coincidence, I ran across that one yesterday. Only a few chapters and possibly interesting, although I don't recall much if anything in the way of him breaking the rules. Seemed more in the vein of I'm Still Here or Wind Shear or Whiskey Time Travel.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.
