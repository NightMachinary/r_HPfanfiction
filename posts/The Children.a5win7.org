Looking for ff.net fic written pre-ootp. I think it was called The Children, but for some reason I can't find it.... AU of the aftermath of the war. Draco is blind and tells the story in 2nd person. Most characters have injuries and ptsd. Snape has white hair, and Sirius is missing a hand. It was a one shot. Thanks for the help!


** Not second person but the rest sounds like this copperbadge's fic. linkao3(787150)

**** This was it, thanks! I was thinking of one paragraph towards the end that's in second person.
