:END:
Hey guys,

I'm trying to find a fic harry/draco.

I remember pretty much everything but the name :(

Harry is an auror trying to investigate this potions mystery (has to do with the fountain of youth I believe) and finds the only one who can help is Draco Malfoy (working in a potions shop in a lowly job and constantly discriminated against for being a death eater). Over the years Harry keeps going to Malfoy even though his boss forbids it and is wary. In the end, Harry realizes that his boss his corrupt and has corrupted Ron through a potion. He goes to Draco, the only one he can trust unfortunately to investigate and gets poisoned in the process.

​

The only way to protect Harry as Draco tries to find a cure is to de-age himself, transferring his years. Later on Harry de-ages as well I think.

​

If someone could help me that would be amazing!


** /Away with Childish Things/ by lettered - it's very sweet! I postponed reading it because I thought it would be a kidfic and all about children, but it's more about psychology and has a good plot, as well.
