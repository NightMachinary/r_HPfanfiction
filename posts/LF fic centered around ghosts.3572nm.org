I am looking for a fic that explores ghosts. I have some questions that aren't really answered in canon, such as:

- Do ghosts ever change clothes or do they just wear whatever they died in forever? (Silly question, I know, but it just bugs me)
- Can all magical beings become ghosts? What about werewolves, do they still change? And metamorphmagi?
- Do they have emotions in the same way wizards do? I mean, they can hardly blush without blood, and we've only seen a few "emotional" ghost-scenes in canon.
- What kind of control does the Ministry (Spirit Division) have over ghosts and how?
- Do they ever (ab)use the fact that they have more knowledge because they have seen more? Or that they can walk through walls?
- How far can they fly? Can they apparate?

I have read some fics that suggested that ghosts don't have to live forever, and disappear as soon as they can /live/ with being death, whether it be they forgive their murderer or finish something they left unfinished when still alive, or something along those lines. This is an intriguing idea. What are good fics that explore this concept?

It would be rather interesting to read a story focussed on the "lives" of some ghosts, to see how they deal with revenge, emotions, change in the wizarding world, etc. Does anyone know of such a story? Does not have to be canon-consistent, I am just curious about the possibilities


** May not be quite what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2230284/1/Unfinished-Business][Unfinished Business by Ramos]] has, as its main plot, Hermione dealing with becoming a ghost.

*** Adding this to my reading list, thanks! This will definitely answer some of my questions. Not a big fan of the prematurely-killed-by-potion-theme, though

** The best fanfic I've read that features a ghost prominently is Bookreader94's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8495049/1/If-I-Die-Young][If I die young]]. Vernon kills Harry before his 11th birthday, but Harry stays around as a ghost.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/34/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Sword of Gryffindor]]; Gryffindor turns up to help out Harry as a ghost. It turns into a crack-erotica fic though, with such strange things as Harry's home in Godric's Hollow being an amusement park, but still.

Not centric, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A black Comedy]], harry is a ghost animagus.

To answer some of your questions, in the first two books, yes ghosts appear to have emotions, and considering book 7, I'd say they do anyway, Grey lady seemed sad enough for it.

No ministry office for it, never seen any ghostly ministery office in any fanfic.

Only witches and wizards become ghosts as far as I know in the HP verse, never heard of a werewolf or metamorph becoming one but I imagine they could.

*** Thanks for the suggestions! There is a minister office for it, although it is only briefly mentioned in book 4 ([[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit_Division]]). I am curious as to what is done by this department, since they didn't seem to be involved in book 2 when Sir Nicholas was petrified. The department must have something to do with regulation, more than care, I pressume.

Do you believe they have the same emotional range though? Some emotions just seem odd to me, without blood.

  The *Spirit Division* is one of three divisions under the control of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. It deals with all duties and problems concerning those magical creatures classified as a "Spirit" by the Ministry of Magic. As mentioned by Newt Scamander, ghosts objected to the prejudice against the living-impaired implicit in their being classified as Beings (they consider themselves Has-Beens), so they're handled by the Spirit Division. ^{Interesting:} [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Being%20Division][^{Being} ^{Division}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit][^{Spirit}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Beast%20Division][^{Beast} ^{Division}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pest%20Sub-Division][^{Pest} ^{Sub-Division}]]

**** Huh, didn't know that, wonder why fanfics don't use that? Sounds like the kind of thing that would be popular to write fanfics about.

As to emotions, I think it's largely age and distance. Most ghosts we saw in the books and movies were centuries upon centuries old; and the livliest ghost in terms of emotions, usually anger and depression; Moaning Myrtle... Well she only died 53ish years before we saw her, relatively young compared to the rest of the Hogwarts ghosts.

** There is a fic whose name escapes me where V becomes a ghost.

There is another (whose name also i cannot remember) that has Harry exploring Diagon and neighboring Allys. One shop is a Necromancer that deals with ghosts. Harry becomes an apprentice of sorts. He also gets a job doing ministry inspections of the shops.
