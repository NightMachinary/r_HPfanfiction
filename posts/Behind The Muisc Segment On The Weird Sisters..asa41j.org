** Not really a reaction to the prompt but rather the observation that for a series that had a decent amount of music in it (Wizard radio, school song, popular band like the Weird Sisters and Celestine Warbeck) there are very few fics that do something with it. There are song fics, but those aren't actually about playing music.

I'd imagine with many muggleborn children playing instruments growing up and music being a factor in both worlds that there are people who want to play together. I've proposed this idea before but a fic about Harry forming a band with people from different houses in Hogwarts is really interesting to me.

*** I remember this one fic where Zacharias Smith runs away from home and winds up forming a band with a group of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.

** This was inspired by a fic where Alicia Spinnet was the illegitimate daughter of Celestia Warbeck who was dumped on her birth father's doorstep.
