**** If you bash Ron, it's usually so that you can add the Leather bound Draco into the trio and/or so that Harry and Hermione can be together. Same reasons for the Weasleys. It happens when you want the normal bad guy (Draco) to be good, then the ones that hate him the most (Ron/Weasleys) have to be bad. The Ron the Deatheater trope goes into that.

As for Dumbles , well then isn't Draco /somewhat/ right?

I have found that people that like Draco hate Ron/Weasleys/Dumbles for what ever reason so they marry the tropes so that they can 'fix' the tale in their opinion.

***** Oh right of course. Ron and Draco aren't very compatible without doing a bunch of work on character development and personal conflicts for both of them. Not exactly an appealing idea to work uphill to make a story with both work

edit: work, work, work.

*** Tom Felton is a nice lad and all, but I'd like to give fans a bit more trust in that regard.

Maybe it's because Draco seems really redeemable? He's Harry's dark reflection in the story (though moreso in the movies). He might be a mean, spiteful bigot, but he was raised by Lucius Malfoy. He was groomed from birth to be a death eater from birth. It would take a miracle for him to have a decent moral compass with that upbringing.

I loved Draco in MoR, where his development is treated quite respectfully. Also he's a somewhat realistic 11-year old kid. At the same time, he seems like less of a bastard in Methods, since Harry is a bit of a cunt.

***** urgh. That's even disrespectful to the movie and the actor at the same time. Draco seems more relatable in the movie because the acting and directing shows us Draco pushed to the limits of what his mind can bear. I generally talk a lot of trash about the movies, but late movie Draco is obviously stressed and scared.

Making movies isn't easy, and I think they did a great job. Just saying "He's so hot" cheapens that achievement and the fandom, by comparison. ew

*** My best guess is also that, it has to do with their financial situations, fanfics tend to make their characters more well off, than they are in canon, and the Weasley´s who barely make ends meet, don´t really fit into the fantasy. I don´t want to say it like that, but many of those fics kinda have elitist undertones, especially when the characters act like nobility, or what the author thinks, nobility acts like.

** I don't think that's necessarily true.

It's obvious Dramione and Drarry shippers will always redeem Draco, but most H/G and Harmony shippers bash Draco even harder than Dumbledore and other Weasleys.

It's especially interesting to note that according to my experience, H/G shippers bash Dumbledore/Molly/Ron just hard as others. Some of the most popular H/G writers (Brennus, Epeefencer, hermyd, kb0, sbmcneil) are pretty hardcore Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashers.

--------------

With respect to Dumbledore, I perfectly understand their sentiments. I either think he was a hopelessly dumbed down plot device (which really sucked as a literary character), or he was senile. Even Rowling herself admitted in her interviews that "although [Dumbledore] seems to be so benign for six books, he's quite a Machiavellian figure, really. He's been pulling a lot of strings. Harry has been his puppet".

In [[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/extended-transcript-j-k-rowling-and-the-creative-team-behind-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/][one of her most recent interviews]], she fully acknowledged that Dumbledore (along with Snape) was the most hated character (among the good guys) by fans. Here is the exact quote:

#+begin_quote
  JOHN TIFFANY: The first scene of our play is the last chapter of "Deathly Hallows," so we see Harry and Ginny and Albus, Harry's middle son, at King's Cross, as well as Ron and Hermione and their daughter Rose. And as in the last chapter, also the Malfoys are around somewhere, aren't they, as well. And they're sending Albus and Rose to their first day at Hogwarts.

  James is the older brother, Harry and Ginny's first son. He's already been at Hogwarts. But we see Albus. Albus, being the character that, as Jo was saying earlier, she was most interested in, because he's called Albus Severus, he's named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, two of the kind of most loved characters from the books.

  JACK THORNE: And the most complicated.

  J.K. ROWLING: And the most hated, as well. Yeah.

I, however, don't think further bashing of Dumbledore would make for a better story. I prefer to see a Dumbledore who fully acts up to his reputation.

*** Harry/Daphne fics also tend to give Draco a bad end. I've seen a few fics that start with Draco trying to sexually assault Daphne just so Harry can save her.

** Probably depends mostly on the focus of the fic or what pairing there is. Sometimes it could fit happen because it fits better with the pairing, i.e. Harry with a Slytherin girl or really just anyone other than Ginny and so all of the Weasley's freak out. Or something happens and Harry goes dark, obviously the situation you ask about would make much more sense if that occurred.

However I think it is most likely just that the people who are most likely to enjoy or want to read a fic that hashes the Weasley's/Dumbledore/(Hermione), are also more likely to want to read a "redeemed" version of Draco. Whether as a replacement friend or simply just as a friend from the start who happens to be a better person then what we see in cannon. Sometimes it's also to give a new perspective of the character that we know as Draco. Still the same mostly but in cannon we truly don't know that much about him aside from a few blatantly exposed personality traits that are meant to make us feel a certain way about him.

** Take Snape and Draco out of cannon Harry Potter series and suddenly Dumbledore and Harry don't quite as good anymore. Its a balance thing where if the good guys are bad, then the bad guys are good.

I mean really, cannon Dumbledore has committed many outright criminal acts in order to do what he believes is right. Take away the "in order to do what he believes is right" concept and suddenly Dumbledore is a lot more dark.
