:END:
For the life of me I can't remember the title of this fanfic I read over 10 years ago. I've looked through pages upon pages on fanfiction.net and no luck. Maybe someone has read it and can help me out?

I *think* it was the second part of a 2-part series. It starts with a flashback of the doors of the great hall flying open forcefully. Harry enters with a male OC character who I think used to be a teacher at Hogwarts in the first part. Harry and him both have Death Eater tattoos.. though Harry was a good guy I believe. I don't really remember what happens next but after a while it cuts to the past and shows how Harry received the Death Eater tattoo.

He and the OC character went on some journey through a desert? mountains? in a carriage? and I remember they arrive at some house where there is a horse.. and I'm not sure but the horse might have had a Deatheater tattoo as well. Maybe there was some flying carpet and a flying city ? Or I am imagining it..

I don't remember much more other than Harry and Snape had some kind of bond.. either he was adopted by Snape or Snape was his guardian/mentor.

I also think that Harry was a Professor at Hogwarts at some point and Harry and Hermione might have become a couple in this story.

Feel very nostalgic thinking about it so hopefully someone knows it! Thanks in advance!
