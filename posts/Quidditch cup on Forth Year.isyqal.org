Was it really understandable to cancel Quidditch for the Triwizard Tournament in-universe? Or was it just writing convenience to make the book less convoluted?

How about a special cup with a selection of Hogwarts vs the Quidditch teams of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons? Maybe even banning champions from participating?


** Obvious answers are “no” and “yes, that would be a great idea”.

** If you don't ban the champions, Durmstrang wins without contest. Krum came within 10 points of singlehandedly carrying his team against the world champion, and none of the Hogwarts teams are even close to Ireland.

If you ban champions, it becomes a championship of background characters and OCs, which would be difficult to make interesting because the result is irrelevant. Ron does not have the nerves in book 4 IMO (he still struggled a year later) and Ginny isn't out of her shell yet either.

*** Well Cho and the twins could try to carry the weight of the story there. Specially Cho considering her status with Cedric-Harry in book 4.

**** A story about Cho and the twins playing Quidditch while Harry and the other champions are fighting for their lives... I don't think that works as far as narrative tension goes.
