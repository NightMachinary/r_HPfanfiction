Yeah, basically what the title says. If wizards paid attention to muggle developments after the SoS was established and stopped them, how different would canon be? How would Muggleborns be treated? Where would we be without the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution? The civil wars and the civil rights movements? How would wizard society be?

Bonus points if the wizards take these ideas (/cough/ Hogwarts Express /cough/) and uses them for themselves. And take the credit.


** I always thought that it would have been more likely that the wizards would have gone to war instead of establishing the Statute of Secrecy. They would have had such a massive lead in mobility, intelligence, firepower, etc, that I honestly don't see how they could have lost if any significant percent of the magical population supported it. And considering how many wizards look at muggles as intelligent animals, I would have thought that the thought of hiding from them would be humiliating and demeaning.

*** Do you find it demeaning to separate yourself from spiders and ants?

Wizards live in isolation, not hiding. They can still go where they want and do what they want. They just obliviate the Muggles afterwards.

That's my thought too. Either they're intelligent animals and you aren't scared of them, so there's no reason to hide, or they're savages that you should avoid. It really makes no sense to live in "secret superiority", as it were.

The wizarding world really enjoys eating their cake and having it.

**** Strangely enough, I believe Hagrid said the truth when he explained Harry they didn't want to be bothered.

Except to carress the ego of some sadists, Wizards have absolutely nothing to gain by enslaving the Muggles. They already have lands, ressources, and even have magical servants that are way more efficient (and loyal) than any Muggle could ever be.

On the other hand, revealing themselves to Muggle may lead to a war. And while Wizards would probably win this (thanks to all the advantage given by magic), there is the problem of a new Witch Hunt and the true victim of it, Muggleborn children (without any magical protector, or knowing spells, I'm convinced a lot of children really died during the Witch Hunt), and while losing the Muggleborn would not be enough to truly put the Wizarding World at risk, it would still be a big annoyment.

â€‹

So for me, Wizards are in hiding because it's easy, while the other alternative would necessite of lot of work and would give them absolutely nothing except a sentiment of superiority they already have.

**** Well yeah, but let's just assume there was, back in the middle ages. Wizards would win, hands down. Hell, they'd probably win today, or at least have a Pyrrhic victory. But in a hundred or so years? A lot less likely.

Even if the wizards came out of hiding, if muggles could replicate most things a wizard could do with technology, then there's no point for them to fight much over it. True, there'd probably be a war (individuals with power like that unchecked?), but it'd be more for security/defense reasons, not resources.

** Presumably, Muggleborns don't want their siblings dying in the fields, so they'd start to become a substantial voting bloc in favor of improving Muggle lives. And when Theo Bessemer notices that the miraculous new engine that Astarte Malfoy 'invented' looks exactly like that sketch his cousin was so excited about all those years ago, he might have some objections about his family's genius being denied his life's work just to get some asshole stolen brownie points in a post-scarcity society, he might even be feeling a little rebellious.

And, of course, most wizards are not sociopaths and would /like/ to help Muggles when it doesn't impact their own lives all that much (just like modern first-worlders).

** The thing is, technology isn't linear like in Civilization. The Chinese had coke (the fuel) in the 5th century while its widespread use in Europe was one of the first steps in the industrial revolution. Same with certain ploughs which triple or quadruple the yield of the soil. So technology which revolutionised England was old news in China by the time the Vikings came around.

Also, advancement is very relative. A WWII rocket battery (eg Katyusha, Nebelwerfer) is a weapon system known since the Middle Ages, just improved. Even Leonardo da Vinci had built similar, if cruder batteries.

*** Oblivations and Imperios run rampant to ensure muggles "stay in their rightful place".

That's not to say they caught all advancements; just most of them. The life expectancy increased a bit and childbirth isn't as deadly as it used to be, but for all intents and purposes life is almost exactly like it was in the late 1600's.

** I remember a story where a post-Voldemort Harry Potter travels to an alternative timeline where Dumbledore and Grindelwald combined power to overthrow and enslave muggles and Tom Riddle was running around as the leader of the resistance. It was a fairly dark fic with sexual slavery and paedophilia. I can't remember the name of it though.
