** Personally, my preferred view of Dumbledore is one where he hopes to avert the prophecy entirely; he doesn't tell Harry or give him special training or anything because he's only 11, Dumbledore thinks he can handle the vestige of Voldemort himself, and even if he fails Harry should have time to grow and become a heroic Auror or whatever before he has to face Voldemort again.

**** Sounds a bit like canon. Called away during Philosopher's Stone, makes it back in the nick of time.

Booted out of the castle in Chamber of Secrets, Fawkes comes to help against the basilisk. Prisoner of Azkaban, his hands are (metaphorically) tied but he still covers for Harry.

Are you hoping for a story with scenes like the end of Order of the Phoenix where Dumbledore shows up late and proceeds to dominate the battle?

***** What I'm thinking is something AU where Harry isn't incredibly lucky in all his confrontations, but survived because Dumbledore got there in time to beat the living tar out of the bad guys. Quirrelmort doesn't get burned to death by Harry, but before he can kill him Dumbledore shows up and fries him with a thunderbolt. Harry can't kill the basilisk, so he decides that if he's gonna get bit, he's taking Tom with him. As Fawkes cries on him, Dumbledore shows up and corrals and slaughters the basilisk. Harry goes back in time and manages to hold off the dementors, but the sheer number is slowly smothering his corporeal patronus. Queue Dumbledore's patronus going off like a nuclear bomb directly in the middle of the Dread Horde, setting dementors on fire from the sheer power of it.

Stuff like that. The DoM battle, but plus 5 deatheaters, and Albus STILL wipes the floor with them.

*** Relevant to this and [[/u/fflai][u/fflai]] : It's important to keep in mind that prophecies don't /need/ to come true. When Dumbledore tells Harry about the prophecy in canon, he points out that the only reason it'll be fulfilled is because Voldemort will constantly seek out Harry as an enemy, and Harry will never side with someone who killed his parents. Prophecies aren't written in stone.

Relevant to this, I think it's hard for many people to understand why Dumbledore would keep Harry with the Dursleys, especially as they've morphed into this hyperabusive cariacature in fanon. Dumbledore admits that he makes mistakes which are often of a greater scope than others'. Harry's life, while it wasn't great growing up, wasn't all that bad either.

** You can't really blame authors for what they are given. The whole manipulative/greater good Dumbledore trope came about because of Rowling's inconsistent writing. In the first few books which were effectively books targeting kids-teens, Dumbledore was written as a bystander so that the trio could actually accomplish what they did in the first few books. If Rowling had written Dumbledore(and other adults) as competent then there is no way the trio would have had their adventures.

By the end of book 4 the books started to be geared more towards young adults(gets darker), Dumbledores attitude towards Harry changes and he becomes more hands on in Harry's life. We start to see a more competent Dumbledore in the later books where he plans ahead, even to the point where he plans for eventualities that occur after his death. This makes the readers question why he wasn't more hands on earlier in Harry's life, why he didn't help Harry more than he did, why he didn't intervene more when the school was in danger etc etc. This gave birth to the manipulative/greater good trope and subsequently took a turn towards the extreme i.e. Dumbledore is evil.

No, but you can blame them for using it badly. If an author's going to use a manipulative or Greater Good Dumbledore, it's their responsibility to recognize the issues these cause and fix them reasonably. That's more or less the essence of good fanfiction which divides it from bad.

*** I completely agree. What confuses me the most about canon Dumbledore is how much he knew about Harry's childhood at the Dursleys. In the book, he mentioned that when he saw Harry for the first time at Hogwarts, he looked reasonably healthy but not very well cared for. Did he only start to pay attention to them after that? And how did he know about the damage they had inflicted on Dudley by spoiling him?

**** In later years, he had people watch over Harry, whatever the actual worth of those guards was (go to ... someplace bad, Mundungus), which is how he could have learned about Dudley. Earlier on, there was an obliviation squad working on Marge before the third year begun and he might have happened to get some information from them.

That said, people do forget that Dumbledore came from a world where children were not as cared for as in our world and from a time when the same was the case, so we can't really say that “he knew abuse was happening and enabled it” because for all we know his way of judging what is acceptable when it comes to raising a child and what isn't might very well be /very/ different from our own. I mean, seriously, assuming a normal civilised place you'd have social workers going in and Ariana going into therapy for whatever it is that caused her trauma, rather than her being kept away from people and that was it. Heck, had he been raised nowadays it would be weird for him to reach for intimidation upon meeting Tom and learning of ... certain things pertaining to his life in the orphanage, and yet though we do know it to have been a mistake it is something you'd expect from someone raised at the beginning of the 20th century or even a bit into the 19th century learning that a child has been doing stuff like that.

In the same vein, I think that him thinking that Harry was happy, even if just as Hogwarts, was for him a sign enough that Harry wasn't really treated all that badly so there was no reason to get involved. His later speech about whatever suffering Harry had to endure /probably/, as far as I see it, had nothing to do anything he could have seen as abuse and all to do with Harry not being able to do magic amongst the Dursleys and Dumbledore projecting /because Ariana couldn't use magic either, even if for a wholly different reason/. The “not well cared for” bit probably was something else too; it's a bit harder for me to guess what it could have been as /at Hogwarts/ Dumbledore has only ever met Harry while Harry was in his wizard robes which means he would have anything to go with, but there is the fact that it was Hagrid who went to fetch Harry and it wouldn't be beyond the man to assume that the conditions the Dursleys were living in were how they normally lived and then tattle to Dumbledore about how “those muggles lived with little Harry in a horrid place, there weren't even beds for everyone and they didn't have enough food” which could have at the time been construed by Dumbledore as them having a bit too little money.

** Love what you said about GreaterGood!Dumbledore jumping at the chance to save Harry if there was an option.

I think Dumbledore didn't come to the Harry has to be a martyr decision lightly. What I hate is that a lot of young fanfic writers use "greater good" as some black hole of morality but it isn't simple. I mean, he knows Voldemort is deadly and so long as there's a bit of him around people will die. And once you get rid of all the horcruxes he could take over Harry's body.

Ultimately after everything you could explain a lot of his behavior with Dumbledore quirks or thinking he's doing the right thing. The only thing I have trouble reconciling is placing Harry in such a terrible environment growing up. Sure you don't want him turning into a spoiled brat but there's growing up in a cold environment and growing up in a hostile environment.

If Dumbledore was unaware, he's incompetent. If he was aware, then that's just heartless.

The real Dumbledore was a wise, very intelligent wizard who held Britain (and probably a big chunk of the wizarding societies) on his shoulders like Atlas the world. He made mistakes, some small some rather huge, and since he wields so much power, some of those were even lethal to his followers and (in the end) to himself. He was manipulative, I think that's a fair statement to make, but not out of evil intent.

** Probably an unpooular opinion in this subreddit, but I can't stand "Dumbledore can do nothing wrong" stories just as much. Things you have to balance for him:

- Make him dumb enough to be believable.

- Make him smart enough to be able to oppose Voldemort

- Make Harry dumb enough to never question anything and follow his Mentor unquestioningly

- Make Harry smart enough to be believable

Honestly, canon!Dumbledore is just a giant mess and the bi-polar relationship of the Fandom towards the character perfectly reflects the frankly inconsistent and confused storytelling about him in the books.

Now, I'm perfectly capable of acknowledging all the issues with GreaterGood or Manipulative Dumbledore (especially in practicality, most writers just do a bad job of it), but at least it is an /attempt/ to reconcile the character in a somewhat coherent manner.

The best way to deal with him in my opinion is to go a completely AU route, but since Harry staying with the Dursleys is quite fundamental to the story you'll quickly find yourself in extreme-AU land (personally I have a very hard time seeing anyone who facilitates child abuse as a worthy mentor or pretty much anyone I'd want to hear opinions on morality from - I'd probably prefer to do the oposite of what that guy tells me) .

*** No, I agree with you. In real life, many people with power stay in power through their wealth/connections/biases/etc. For example, just look at <insert political figure of your choice> in recent news, or on a smaller scale, all the domestic abusers that never get caught, or worse, that convince others that their victim is the one who has a problem, Sure, they aren't evil because they're evil, they have reasons and thought processes and stuff, but that's a problem with fleshing out secondary characters in general, not a unique problem with manipulative!Dumbledore fic.

I personally don't like Dumbledore to be particularly sympathetic. A man who intentionally ignored child abuse will never be the good guy to me as a reader, even though it's true in real life that this sort of person often fools others with their front. And of course Harry believes in him, he was groomed to!

Honestly, manipulative!Dumbledore, for all his proclaimed self-awareness in canon, is much more consistent than any other interpretation, especially given that the books are written from Harry's biased perspective. Others were probably better at seeing his flaws.

*** Well, you can actually kind of justify a good AU Dumbledore who still sends Harry to the Dursleys initially without big problems. Let's just look at the information Dumbledore had on that night in Godric's Hallow:

- Petunia is the sister of Lily, who was standing up for victims of bullying, very popular, intelligent, responsible, head girl. So my first assumption for her sister would be the same.
- Petunia has sent him a letter when she was younger, begging for the possibility to go to Hogwarts. Dumbledore might've thought that she would jump at the thought to raise an important magical child, and become a bigger part of the world

That petunia is the complete opposite of Lily in ... everything (small minded world view, hates magic, egoistical, never amounted to really more than secretary and house-wife) is rather unforseen. Lily was very good, and the child would have protections there.

Now, he brings Harry to the Dursleys. He barely finds time to write a letter to them since he is at the ministry the whole day. They drop of Harry, and Dumbledore goes to bed after the most stressful day of his life.

The next week is as stressful, and so the thoughts about Harry slowly begin to slip his mind. A talk with Petunia would be nice, but there are more important things. And if there was any problem, she knew that she could reach him with a simple letter, after all she did that years back.

Now, months later the death-eater trials are mostly over. He thinks about Harry again. It's 10pm in the evening, bad time to just show up... Tomorrow he'll go!

And suddenly, 10 years are over. Dumbledore is 110 when Harry comes to Hogwarts. Time flies for him.

But for his behavior after that, you'll probably need to go an AU route, yes.

**** The bare minimum you need to do to hand off a toddler to adoptive parents is to ensure that the adoptive parents receive the toddler, and Dumbledore didn't even meet that bar. Nor do McGonagall and Hagrid. That's criminal negligence and child endangerment.

The rest falls apart once that initial handoff occurs. It gives Petunia a chance to object. Can Dumbledore reasonably override Petunia's preferences and demand that she act as Harry's mother? That's either unwise (she won't be induced by force or writ to be a good mother to Harry, and Dumbledore doesn't guess at that possibility) or evil (as before, but Dumbledore doesn't care).

You must change both Dumbledore and Petunia to get a reasonable result. Perhaps Petunia hopes that Harry won't be magical. Perhaps she hopes she can eliminate magic from him somehow and save him from the wizarding world. Either way makes it more likely that she treats Harry as family rather than a house-elf.

I actually agreed with everything you wrote up to this point. The initial decision is completely understandable, but no matter how busy you are, if you took the responsibility of placing a child somewhere it is the least you could do to check up on it.

Any social worker who places a child in an abusive household without vetting the new guardians would surely face legal repercussions and Dumbledore has a much larger responsibility here because of his personal involvement in all aspects than some faceless government employee. That a child has to live in a cupboard for 10 years and suffer all kinds of emotional and at least some level of physical abuse just because you are too fucking busy to do something about it is completely unforgivable (I actually have a very visceral reaction every time I think about this, especially when considering that some people find this acceptable).

Yes, but that employee has training and actually an idea of what he was doing. Dumbledore is kind of a jack of all trades, he just wings everything.

A team of professional curse-breakers probably wouldn't get cursed by Voldemort's ring, because they have training to do shit. In my mind, Dumbledore does so many things, he can't be an expert in too many of them.

**** Everyone was acting as if they had the idiot ball glued to their hands in book 6. Hermione and Ron, not suspecting Draco? After all that scumbag had tried in the past? Yeah, right. Then the thing about the notebook, the whole murder plot, the love potion side "plot",... I think that's the worst book of the series.

***** I probably agree that Book 6 ia the worst in the series (quite closely followed by Book 7 though), but I always feel the urge to point out that the basic plot-outline is kinda fantastic. The whole unbreakable-vow setup, making Snape's true loyalties ambiguous, the Vanishing Cabinet, wondering about Dumbeldore's machinations (considering he was already a walking corpse and him using that to his advantage in order to elevate Snape in the eyes of Voldemort - actually that's propably the first time that Snape is being used properly as a spy) and it all coming together in a climax on the Astronomy tower... just on paper this sounds great. I just don't understand why JKR felt it necessary to give everyone the 'idiot ball' in order to make Draco dangerous (it really seems pointless and unnecessary), not to mention all the other ridiculous subplots that you already mentioned witch hold little relevance for the rest of the story.

The general idea of the plot is much more sound than for example Book 4, which doesn't make any sense at all - still a much better book though (Book 4 and 7 seem pretty high at the top in the 'this doesn't make any sense at all' category in terms of plot).

****** The unbreakable vow was a very stupid idea, in my opinion. It doesn't add anything, and it makes everyone ask: "Why don't we use that Vow to prove that we're telling the truth/make enemies swear not to attack us/use it in place of Azkaban/etc.?" The vanishing cabinet is a nice idea - but in the past, Death Eaters had no trouble entering Hogwarts, and students routinely sneaked in and out of the Castle. Sometimes carrying Dragons they then handed over to outsiders on top of the Astronomy Tower.

Why exactly was the cabinet needed? That was, afaik, never explained.

Doesn't the same apply for Veritaserum, which also seems too powerful? I'm sure if you want you can come up with ways around the points you mentioned: Like... laws that forbid usage of unbreakable vows in law enforcement; possible loopholes; personally I like to believe that you can't be forced to enter an unbreakable vow, even if you are forced to say the words... since magic is supposedly based on intent (but that's just my headcannon; the idea that you could coerce someone into a vow seems much too broken even for HP... see below).

I think JKR just tries to add something 'new' to the lore in each book, even if established lore could be used for the same effect. It's just her way too expand her universe and I think the cabinet is neat.

Was the felix felicis really needed? Shouldn't there be a constant demand for that stuff in the world? Considering your apprehension about Unbreakable Vows, what about the Goblet of Fire? It has to be the most broken device in all of Harry Potter. It can coerce people into a magical contract without their consent. Forget about Unbreakable Vows, I'd go wild with the Goblet on Death Eaters and Voldemort.

I guess my point is that I can't even think on that level when considering Harry Potter, because almost any of the magical devices in that world is inherently broken and people are just too lazy or ignorant to (ab-)use them properly (The potential for the Fidelius Charm alone is insane).

******** Veritaserum won't force a course of action. And with memory modification, it can be fooled as well - probably with some potions too. Also, there's a fine line between "we won't force you", and "of course, you don't have to do it... but if you do it, we'll see your testimony in a much better light".

I can see the Goblet of fire as a simple device that curses people who don't follow the edict. No need for a magical contract, or whatever.

Let's not dwell on semantics; it doesn't matter what you call its effect. It is clearly so strong that it can't be easily countered by Dumbledore (one of the most accomplished wizards of his time) and compels him to a very dangerous course of action (unless you think he actually wants Harry in the tournament). The consequences of not competing are so severe that playing right into Voldemort's hands seems to be the preferable course of action for everyone. It forces anyone to fight in some kind of tournament in which the tasks are arbitrarily governed by the organisers of the tournament. It's completely ridiculous. Task 1: Sing twinkle twinkle little star while wearing a tutu on the surface of Pluto. Good luck Voldemort.

** Agreed.

I think you'll like the Dumbledore in Starfox5's fics. He's intelligent, powerful, resourceful but also incredibly flawed. It's a rather refreshing and well written approach!

** Yes, Dumbledore is exceedingly hard to write, but that could be said about almost every character in the series. The problem once again stems from JKR's writing, or lack thereof in this situation. We are in a third-person narrative, but we never see anyone's thoughts, the only times we do are when it's important to the plot.

I would say, cut these guys a break. Dumbledore is hard to get right for everybody, and so is Harry. These aren't multi-national novels we're reading, these are simply fanfictions.

** Agreed. I do feel like these stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of Dumbledore's character, especially since he is complex and people suck at writing complex characters. There are many fics that fail by running with the manipulative angle, but also many positive Dumbledore fics that fail to really explore or display how he represents redemption and goodness. Even in most Good!Dumbledore fics, he's written poorly. In canon, Dumbledore fundamentally understands that he can makes mistakes, doesn't trust himself with power, and really understands how magic in the HPverse is driven by concepts (which really plays into a lot of the people that bash Dumbledore for believing that love can stop the Dark Lord).

I'd recommend reading his characterization in the second to last chapter of linkffn(9498559) (a fic which I just finished and loved) which paints a very convincing picture of Dumbledore that really meshes well with his actions in canon. That chapter is the last before the epilogue, but it's the only one from Dumbledore's point of view (albeit from an alternate reality) and captures his thought process well.
