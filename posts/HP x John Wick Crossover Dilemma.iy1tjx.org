Can someone PLEASE!!!! Give me a good crossover between John Wick and Harry Potter!!!! Possible scenarios being:

1) John Wicks wife and he adopt Harry before she dies, the puppy still gets killed because that was the main reason he went on a rampage, but John ends up raising Harry to have his skills. (You can choose whether or not Hogwarts is a thing)

2) Similar to option 1 except Harry is a girl and John saves her from the first movie mob because the Dursley's sold her to them while in America.

3) Post Battle of Hogwarts Harry (either guy or girl I'm not picky) decides to travel the world to learn more magic and calm his/her nerves from fighting all the time, meets John Wick on one of his rampages and his/her magic reacts in a (KHR Hyper Intuition Type) way to help him.

All three options must encompass all 3 John Wick movies and you can choose whether or not Hogwarts is a thing.

*** Thank you, I'm actually already subscribed to this, but it's the only multi-chaptered crossover I can find, which is sad. ðŸ˜”

  Is he cursed? It seems like no matter what Wick does, he can't seem to shake off the shadow his past casts over his life. Always a fight, always corpses littered around him. And now he has his own little shadow, Harry, a boy with a cursed luck of his own.
