** Lucius Malfoy was in Voldemort's inner circle and avoided Azkaban by ratting out other Death Eaters. In the end he got away with whatever evil deeds he did in his service.

Fudge arguably did more damage with his ineffective handling of the ministry. Nothing really happened to him except a ruined reputation.

** I'm surprised no one has said Dumbledore. I mean he began the series by literally leaving a baby on someone's doorstep, at night in England at the beginning of winter.

In the first book he kept an object that a dangerous criminal was after in a school full of children and hid it behind traps that three 11 year olds could get past. A giant, three headed dog was kept behind a door that was unlocked with a simple locking charm that any 1st year could preform.

One of his professors was an ex death eater, a terrorist, and still let him teach kids. He let him terrorize those kids to the point that by third year Snape was at least one child's worst fear (Neville).

He allowed a 13 year old to have a time turner so that she could go to extra classes and then sent two 13 year olds back in time to save a mans life even though he knew they could encounter serious danger (ie. dementors, a werewolf, an escaped death eater (Peter), and the general dangers of time travel) when he could have just done it himself. And then the end he never even tries to clear Sirius' name , not even in the next few books, even though he very clearly holds a lot of political sway.

He allowed a 14 year old to participate in a deadly tournament with students 3 years older than him and with a lot more training. He allowed a teacher to cast an unforgivable curse on students.

He forced a teenager back into an obviously abusive home yet again and this time cut him off from contact with what was going on in the wizarding world and from his friends. All after he had just witnessed a friend die at the hands of the man who killed his parents and had been trying to kill him for years now. Harry could have just stayed with Sirius. He had never thought of the Dursley's as home so the blood wards should not have even worked and he was being abused in that house physically and emotionally so honestly was he really that much safer there. Then during the school year he lets a teacher abuse his students with a blood quill and never does anything to stop it. He then lets Snape teacher Harry occlumency, a very intimate process that involves Harry's memories being put on display to his teacher, a man who has expressed nothing but hatred and disdain for him. If Harry had to learn occlumency why could he just do it.

Then book six he knows Draco was being sent to kill him, but he just Draco do his thing even when students start getting hurt (Katie and Ron). Draco is very clearly falling apart but he doesn't help him or even try and stop him he just lets it happen. Then he takes Harry on a dangerous trip to retrieve the locket horcrux... why couldn't he have taken one of the order members. For that matter why didn't he tell any of the order other than Snape a SPY about the horcrux's. Bill is a curse breaker who deals with dark magic all the time he could have helped. But no let's leave all the dangerous bits to a couple teenagers. That leads us to book 7.

He literally planes for the horcrux hunt to be the job of 3 teenagers. The readers discover that he had literally been raising Harry like a pig for slaughter for 17 years and was planning for Harry to die to end the war. And no character really sees through his grandfather facade. It's sickening.

I could probably write more but I've already ranted enough... sorry.
