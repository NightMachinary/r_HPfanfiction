  "I'll go further than anyone. Let me serve you, your friends, use me however you want. In the mornings I guess you need to pee, just like anyone else. If you put the head of your cock in my ass, you can pee there, and I will take it to the bathroom for you, so you can stay in bed. I. Am. Yours! Get it? Now, I won't beg for your fantastic cock right now, but tonight, I'll be there.‚Äù

** I remember reading some story where Voldemort had a wife, and Evil!Dumbledore allied with some Vikings who had a tradition of making horcruxes. It was a pretty long story. The light side also used a prison in the Caribbean, which Voldemort found and pretty much nuked.

It sounds like a shitty story, but it's not that bad. Does it sound familiar to anyone?
