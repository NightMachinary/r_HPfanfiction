I'm assuming it's not because of homophobia. but every new fic request I see on this sub requests no slash. Maybe it's just personal taste, but I'm curious if it isn't. Is it the quality of fics, because there are some pretty bad slash fics I have read (and I majorly read slash), but I have read bad het, femslash and gen fics too.

Sorry, if this isn't allowed.

Edit: Thanks for the answer guys, and if I'm getting this right the main reason is this sub is mostly straight males, had no idea, lol.

Edit 2: Also, holy shit, I didn't expect this huge a response to my question, I have been reading replies on and off for three hours, lol.

Edit 3: Hey, guys I don't like drarry, snarry, tomarry and other harry/death eaters, protagonists/antagonists ships. I'm specifying that because I have gotten many comments that are either mentioning their like or dislike of those ships.

Speaking of comments, this has been the biggest number of responses I have ever gotten on reddit, and am feeling really overwhelmed and tired rn, so probably won't read any that come after this edit, (probably will, dunno, I'm a glutton for punishment), but thanks for the responses, truly, this has been a fun few hour of discussing HP, fanfics and slash with you all. :)


** There are two types of readers: those who project themselves onto the protagonist, and those who sympthise with the protagonist but maintain a greater amount of distance from them.

For the type of reader who projects themselves onto the protagonist, they will only like a story if the protagonist does things they would want to do themselves. That's not to say that the protagonist has to reflect the reader, because fiction has an escapism element. But the reader must still aspire to the kind of actions the protagonist is taking, even if in real life the reader would never be that brave, adventurous, etc.

The protagonist doing things that the reader would never want to do turns this type of reader off instantly. So, for example, if the main character does something that the reader considers very stupid, this type of reader will be especially annoyed, often to the point of no longer reading. It breaks the escapist fantasy. Similarly, if the main character is sexually attracted to someone who the reader does not find sexually attractive, they will lose interest/be put off.

For this type of reader, if they are attracted to women and not men, the main character being attracted to a man will put them off for the same reason that they would be put off by the main character being attracted to an unattractive woman: it is not an attraction they share, and it breaks the identification with the main character. However, if the reader is attracted to men and not women, the reverse holds: they want to read about a main character being attracted to men, and will be put off by the main character being attracted to women.

So, the people who are interested in stories where the main character is attracted to men are:

- Readers who identify with the main character and are attracted to men.

- Readers who sympathise with but do not identify with the main character.

It just so happens that this subreddit has a large population of straight men (as is common on reddit and indeed internet discussion boards in general).

From informal discussions with people, it seems that readers who identify vs readers who sympathise with the main character are split pretty evenly.However, I suspect that, depending on who the main character is, a single reader may read a story in a different way. For example, a reader who identifies with Harry as main character may only sympathise with a different main character.

Further, I suspect that men tend to read in the "project themselves onto the main character" way more than women do. Speculating even more, I think this may be because historically, most books have been written by men and have male central characters. So women readers are in a sense trained from birth to read characters who they may not necessarily identify with, whereas men have the advantage of having a wealth of characters who are already like them. That's not to say, of course, that gender is /necessarily/ a barrier to identification. Personally, I have no problem identifying with female protagonists (though perhaps it works in a slightly different way: with male protagonists, I want the protagonist to have characteristics I aspire to; whereas with female protagonists, I want them to have characteristics I admire in a partner). However, I am aware that a large number of male readers do not particularly enjoy reading about, or identify with, female protagonists.

Fanfiction also adds an interesting extra element to the mix, which is that we're all so used to Harry as the main character, from literally hundreds if not thousands of fics we will have read, that at least a fairly substantial portion of the fandom will identify with Harry regardless of who the ostensible main character of a story is.

Speaking personally, I identify strongly with Harry and am only interested in stories where Harry is attracted to people I consider attractive (or fics where romance plays no part at all). However, I have a much weaker connection with other characters and would be perfectly happy to read about, say, a gay Dean Thomas. But it just so happens that the very same weaker connection with other characters generally means I only read Harry centric fics anyway, because I just don't care about the other characters.

*** This is the kind of answer I was hoping for when I posted this question, because it explains so much, thank you.

I had no idea that this sub has a more male heavy population, I assumed it would be the opposite, since I mostly have encountered more women who read and write fanfiction.

As a male, attracted to both men and women (the men slightly more), and having no trouble sympathizing with many characters, I don't mind reading any and all fanfictions, just so long as I don't find characters behaving out of character, and there being no bashing, of characters, or of canon. I have even written from Cho's POV a couple of times, and have really enjoyed it, nothing huge or anything, and as is always with me I prefer romance and characterization than massive plot (not that I mind those), so my fics themselves reflect that, but as a whole I identify the most with Harry (and Cedric, but that's probably just me projecting myself onto the character as much as I can), perhaps because he was the main character.

Again, thank you for the very thought out reply. :)

Here's the thing. If you aren't into slash then slash fics like this can be not-fun to read. However, I have read a lot of fics with slash relationships, even main relationships, where the romance element took a backseat to a great story with a great plot and for me those fics were enjoyable even if I typically don't enjoy slash. If we could sort by percentage of the fic devoted to the romance and relationships then I think we'd get a lot more people not instantly discarding slash stories.

Not MPreg though... never MPreg.

***** Yeah, that's why I really like the new 'exclude' option on ao3, I can just sort out everything I don't want, most of which is tagged thankfully, which really makes my sorted fics even shorter, and even then it will have somethings I don't like, but it helps. But if something like what you suggest exists, it would probably be infinitely better.

****** The first heavily recommended slash fic I read was going really well. I was heavily invested in it and read more than 30 chapters (I think it was like 150k+ words) and thought that I could get used to slash... Then Harry all of a sudden went for Voldemort instead of (I think it was Snape) and within a chapter he became pregnant and had a child in graphic detail. I noped out of Slash fics forever.

**** To springboard off [[/u/Taure]] 's comment, these two mentalities show up in authors too.

In my many years of reading fanfiction, I've gathered the impression that the vast majority of slash is written by straight women with little to no understanding of male biology or how the male mind normally works.

Harry grows his hair long, braids it prettily, starts wearing makeup, is always the bottom, acts super docile and leans into the "girly emotionality" stereotype. Hell, in half the stuff he gets pregnant and carries Snape's child.

It's written by a 14 year old girl projecting her own desires and self onto a male protagonist.

The slash doesn't bother me, the poorly written self-inserts labelled as slash do.

Cause if you think Harry the celebrity jock and war hero is gonna bottom for the preppy blonde rich kid who spends that much time on his hair, you got me all fucked up.

Disclaimer: This comment isn't meant as any sort of dig at trans folks, femme dudes, or crossdressers, or at writing Harry as any of those things. It's chiefly discussing a simple, all else being the same, gay Harry.

That's interesting. I wonder if he ever describes the girls he crushes on in a similar way, or if he just says "Cho was very cute" or something similar. Perhaps it was easier, for Rowling as a straight woman, to give these more evocative descriptions of what makes men attractive.

But I don't have to books in front of me to check for how Harry sees and describes women.

******* Bear in mind the gender of the author, too. Harry Potter was written by a woman- so naturally a woman would pay special attention to attractive male characters, just as male authors like to describe attractive female characters in depth. You can try and downplay that when writing from the perspective of a character who isn't the same gender as the author, but it still can slip through on occasion.

****** These are all solid points. To defend my post slightly, I should clarify that the line about Harry the jock is a hyperbolic exaggeration based on his main contributions in school being sports and fighting class.

Part of it will also come to personal taste. Shitty indy Harry power fantasy can be mildly entertaining. Shitty slash just feels insulting.

****** Yes, that's why I imagine canon Harry as bi, and identify with him and feel represented.

I don't mind that he ended up with Ginny, because not every bi guy is gonna end up with a guy, or even have any sort of romantic and/or sexual relationship, and I'm talking about in Hinny fanfics if his sexuality is ever mentioned.

This is the kind of Harry, the one you explained in the comment, the one who is canon, I struggle to find in fanfics. The fandom generally says "hahaha Harry stupid", and it has gotten irritating to read him as such in fanfics. And as you said he isn't a super genius either, so don't want that, or uber magically powerful Harry.

I want more canon Harry, with all his flaws, with all his perfections, I adore canon Harry, and so far the only author I have found who has written him like that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell][Lullabyknell]], who even though writes canon divergent fics, she/he stays true to the characters, among the fics of theirs I have read anyway.

****** So, I'll start off by apologizing. My intent with my post was to provide an honest perspective based on my years immersed in the HP fanfic community. Based on the responses I've gotten, obviously some of my stuff has come across in a way I didn't intend it.

Now before I address your points, I'll first point out generally that while gender is a social construct, and shouldn't be the rule or standard that people are forced to conform to, it does still exist as that social and cultural construct. The vast majority of people do conform to and expect other people to generally confirm to that binary system.

Have I read how men write sex? Yes. It's the same mix of good to bad. There's just as many men writing shitty physiologically impossible femslash. I don't read that either, but I wrote my original comment from the perspective of a cis dude and assuming "slash" referred to specifically male/male as opposed to femslash. And even for bad straight sex, it tends to err on the unrealistic side of male gratification and fantasy, which a cis male can frequently enjoy even while acknowledging it as unrealistic.

For the male mind, I apologise for the confusion, but I was referring to the set of behaviors, values, and cultural standards that we tend to describe as "masculine" and "male" as opposed to the "feminine" and "female." Again, I'll emphasize that my post is addressing a generalization of cis women writing about cis male characters. You invalidate your own point claiming the male mind doesn't exist, then go on to say it exists as formed and molded by current gender conceptions.

As for long hair, docility and emotionality being terrible stereotypical views of women, absolutely. It's a standard unhealthy toxic femininity that many women in society are encouraged to fit by the unhealthy gender norms of our society, but I'm not arguing the morality of it, only the reality that those behaviors are associated with femininity, and when these behaviors are forced into an OOC version of a character originally written as a 90s cis male, it's a jarring difference of character that tends to pull people out of the story.

More being a tiny niche of slash may just have to be something we agree to disagree with. But it's a common enough tag and subject that immediately puts me off a story, which is the point of the original post.

Finally for the bottom!Harry joke, I admit in hindsight that with the gravitas of the post subject, the sarcastic humor of the last paragraph doesn't really come across well. It is in fact poking fun at the stereotypes of tops and bottoms. Please accept one more humble apology from this tall, jockish, bottom.

There's nothing wrong with being or writing characters that fall outside of gender and sexual norms and defy societal expectations. But a key part of most character based fanfiction is those characters being or at least starting close to their canon selves before the events of the story or the changed situation of an AU alter that character from that baseline state. The traits I mentioned in my previous comment are just a collection of what to me are some common red flags that tend to forward character (typically Harry) who is going to suddenly and inexplicably act in a way contrary to his canon depiction.

TL;DR gender is a social construct but it is one that exists and for better or worse the expectations of behavior that come with that affect most people's level of comfort with and likeability of characters.

***** Okay, since I have read a lot of good slash fics, I'm about to dump many of them on you rn, some are great imo, though most of them are romance focused, and all are Cedric/Harry:

linkao3(6218035)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6218035]] This has such an interesting premise, and the Unspeakables are treated in such a unique way that I have yet to read the like elsewhere.

linkao3(285146)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/285146]] This is the one you will probably enjoy the most, because out of all the four I'm reccing this one has the most plot, which is a mystery. Set post Battle of Hogwarts.

linkao3(3869599)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3869599]] This is Cho/Cedric/Harry and basically a rewrite of GoF and beyond in a world of soulmates. Haven't read the latest chapters, and there are some things that some readers might not like, they're all tagged btw, but within the story I think the author handles it well.

linkao3(275707)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/275707]] This I'm starting to think of as an anti-Cursed Child, better written for one thing, and with a Cedric who has survived the graveyard and the war, similar plot elements to CC, but this precedes it and treats it's characters with respect. (Edit: Okay, I think the bot isn't linking this one probably because the fic or author is marked as locked or private, idk how any of this works, and you need to be logged in to ao3 to read it.

It's called *I'll Just Begin Again*

Summary:

#+begin_example
  When given the chance to try again, to fix what's gone wrong, Cedric takes it.
#+end_example

It has a one shot sequel/epilogue thingy on ao3 and a similar in tone fic on livejournal, which is rec'd in my bookmarks)

I sometimes tend to read some fics with tropes that you don't like, but here are [[https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&include_bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=12343&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&user_id=HarricIsLife][my H/C bookmarks]], and most are well-written, and some do have smut, and even though I think majority of my bookmarks are written by women, they imo don't make their gay/bi characters feminine and are very true to canon in a lot of ways I think.

Most are either rom-com like, or filled with angst given the pairing, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Some, I myself haven't read, so can't assuage of their quality, but I found them interesting, and haven't got the time to read them.

Here is hoping that you enjoy some slash fics. :)

**** The user [[/u/Taure]] provided literally the best possible explanation you could have gotten. However, I do want to add one more little element. I generally put "no main character slash" in my request threads. However, I have no problem with slash itself within the story, as long as it's not the main character.

This is because, for the most part, I fall into the "type of reader who projects themselves onto the protagonist" category, although I do still think I also sympathize at times as well. I have zero attraction to men. As such, reading about slash in the context of the main character doesn't remotely interest me and does turn me off a story.

However I also have no problem with homosexuality and have several real-life friends who are either gay or lesbian. As such, I don't mind if such things are included within a story I read, as long as its not the main character involved. So there CAN be slash, provided the story does not revolve tightly around it. For example, I remember reading a story I loved that had Sirius and Remus in a relationship, but Harry (the protagonist) was still attracted to women, even though he lived with "2 dads" effectively.

But when I write "no main character slash", or even "no slash", there often is at least 1 person who comes in and thinks I am homophobic or HATE slash of all types. So just keep that in mind, that even if someone puts "no slash" it may not be that they are against slash itself as a concept, but simply uninterested in it as it pertains to the "character" they want to read about or identify with.

Your reply and of others have given very reasonable explanation to it, but I think as one of the comments below said, maybe instead of saying 'no slash' the requests should say 'het preferred', which will eliminate the thought of homophobia by those requests from a lot of users mind, possibly not all, but still.

The problem is that "het preferred" implies you are still possibly interested in a variety of possible slash suggestions. Its why I personally started using "No main character slash" instead of the more simple "No slash". Its a clearer picture of what I am looking for, while still allowing the flexibility of slash suggestions provided the slash is outside the main character relationship.

At the end of the day whether homophobic or not, this is not the place to really debate a users preference. The real problem is not people asking for "no slash", but its people jumping to conclusions based upon that, or people using upvotes and downvotes recklessly on threads that should be pure suggestion, and not a place to toss about personal preferences on sexuality.

I think your idea works better because of the reason you have given, I just saw an alternate solution and thought I would put it here as well.

And okay, I'm probably being really defensive with this, but as I said in a previous comment, I saw the 'no slash' in requests every time I came across this sub, and it's easy to jump to conclusions (though I often try not to) when you feel people are trying to exclude you or people like you on purpose, (which is really not the case, and all because of preferences) and that was mostly due to my ignorance about the users here.

I'm sorry if my comment seems offending, I'm really tired and trying to go to sleep, but have been unable to and am addicted to this site, so sorry.

******** Just to clarify, my final paragraph was not directed at you (it feels like you may have thought that).

It's more a general condemnation of this subreddit at times. In part because of responses, as I stated earlier, to folks putting "no slash" in their recommendation threads, and suddenly getting bombarded with either folks trying to convince them to try slash, or being angry at their choice of pairing, or claiming they are homophobic, or whatever else it may be.

And in part because people often upvote or downvote recommendations based upon whether it does or does not have slash (or what relationship it features), which is a really sad state of affairs. The upvote/downvote should be primarily based upon the quality of material, not type of relationship.

For example... I can't stand Harry/Ginny (for the most part), but I don't go around downvoting every request thread or recommendation dealing with the pairing.

I guess I am just saying folks need to look at the quality of the material more, and the type of material less when making judgments of both others, and the material itself.

I think you can see some evidence of this with the prevalence of Draco/Harry, Draco/Hermione, Hermione/Snape, and all of the many pairings that Genderbent!

They are by far the two most popular HP pairings in terms of number of stories. The popular-with-males Harry-centric power fantasy type stories are ones with the most readership, but that's because the male side of the HP fandom is relatively homogeneous in its preferences, compared to absolutely huge and diverse female side of the fandom.

I like romance in a story but I don't usually like it to be the main plot. I like drama and action and world building. Because romance to me is a side-plot that I enjoy, I don't really project myself or my own feelings into it and like to see how characters begin and maintain - and yes, end - relationships! So for me personally, it doesn't matter if it's slash or not providing it's well-written. I do NOT like PWP.

*** Great explanation!

I would add that as a gay man, I've never been a fan of HP slash (unless the fic comes highly praised) despite being attracted to men. The reason I think is that I grew up with Harry as a straight character and it just feels off to read a story where that's been changed.

For me it's likely also tied to preferring canon-adjacent fics (novel length, Harry as the lead character, covering a year at Hogwarts or right after). If I'm reading AU it's gonna be an alt take on book 5/6/7, have some element of time travel, or be a wish/spell/what-if cast to change the past which alters the present -- none of which would change a character's established sexuality.

** Part of it is also that people will often turn to writing fan fiction when they can't find stories they relate to in professionally published media. This means that historically under-represented groups (LGBT as an example) have more of a presence in fan fiction websites. As an example, I do a lot of reading on AO3 and I'm just more likely to find slash fics than m/f or gen fics, especially for certain fandoms like Sherlock. I will read it anyway and skip the x-rated scenes, but every once in a while I ask the reddit community for good quality non-slash fics just because they're harder to find, doubly so when I have other requirements (no harems, etc.). In short, I find slash fics easily so don't really need to ask for recommendations.

Even still, I highly prefer canon to any fanon, but I won't mind neat headcanons that don't contradict canon, and all the most popular slash in the fandom I don't like, so that makes my reading list even shorter (thankfully though I have read some really good HP slash fics with the pairs of my liking, which have also kinda helped me as a person), and I'm not that great of a writer, so it keeps me wanting more. :P

** Being straight is not the only reason people avoid slash fics. I'm gay, and avoid them when possible. Every slash fic I tried reading has been a melodrama that focuses on the relationship to the exclusion of plot progression. It does not help that one the the main characters is usually changed to be more "feminine", regardless of his original personality. I suspect that most of the writers of such fics are female, and therefore approach m/m romance with a lot of preconceptions that can be pretty irritating.

*** Okay, since I have read a lot of good slash fics, I'm about to dump many of them on you rn, some are great imo, though most of them are romance focused, and all are Cedric/Harry:

linkao3(6218035)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6218035]] This has such an interesting premise, and the Unspeakables are treated in such a unique way that I have yet to read the like elsewhere.

linkao3(275707)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/275707]] This I'm starting to think of as an anti-Cursed Child, better written for one thing, and with a Cedric who has survived the graveyard and the war, similar plot elements to CC, but this precedes it and treats it's characters with respect.

linkao3(285146)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/285146]] This is the one you will probably enjoy the most, because out of all the four I'm reccing this one has the most plot, which is a mystery. Set post Battle of Hogwarts.

linkao3(3869599)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3869599]] This is Cho/Cedric/Harry and basically a rewrite of GoF and beyond in a world of soulmates. Haven't read the latest chapters, and there are some things that some readers might not like, they're all tagged btw, but within the story I think the author handles it well.

I sometimes tend to read some fics with tropes that you don't like, but here are [[https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&include_bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=12343&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&user_id=HarricIsLife][my H/C bookmarks]], and most are well-written, and some do have smut, and even though I think majority of my bookmarks are written by women, they imo don't make their gay/bi characters feminine and are very true to canon in a lot of ways I think.

Most are either rom-com like, or filled with angst given the pairing, but very enjoyable nonetheless.

Here is hoping that you enjoy some slash fics. :)

I've never noticed that being the case in the books and fanfics I read. Male and female authors tend to write female characters about the same, and have the same tendency to use gender stereotypes. I think that authors just get used to seeing female characters with certain personality traits, and they fall into the bad habit of imitating the standard.

****** A sub with links of cherry-picked cringe is not a statistically accurate representation of reality. If we similarly trawled the bottom of the barrel for female authors, we'd probably find equally cringe-worthy examples.

There's a preexisting assumption that men can't write female characters well, and that preconception colors the way many people view stories by best selling male vs. female authors of the same genre. Some male authors specifically choose not to identify themselves as male because they want to avoid readers judging their work through that biased lens.

Hypothetical: A blind test is conducted in which the survey subjects read a random selection of best-selling stories without knowing the gender of the author. After reading each story, the participants fill out a questionnaire about how well they think the female characters were written, and what they think the author's gender is.

I'd bet that, like the "[[https://www.theguardian.com/books/quiz/2011/jun/02/naipaul-test-author-s-sex-quiz][Naipaul test]]", the participants wouldn't be able to tell the difference in most cases.

** So, slash is interesting. When people use the term, they're generally writing in a style that is influenced by yaoi manga subculture. Sometimes older fanfictions even use yaoi instead of slash in their summaries.

The issue is that yaoi was explicitly NOT designed for lgbtq individuals. Just check the wiki and read a bit about its history, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi]] . It was a type of fanwork in the 70s/80s that got popular in the 90s, and was eventually being marketed towards women. A lot of the negative stereotypes about slash fanfiction come from here : you have explicit roles that both protagonists come from (seme/uke - literally attacker and receiver, iirc), wherein their sexual preferences also influence their whole personality. This has led to some gay individuals criticizing it for being unrealistic, depicting downright unhealthy relationships, and reinforcing heteronormative gender roles (as the seme is typically hypermasculine and the uke is hyperfeminine). Rape is also super common. (I'm oversimplifying a bit in the relationship between yaoi and ff, but there was a lot of interaction).

When I hear slash, I think of fics that owe a large amount of influence to this. It's essentially an erotica/romance genre designed for straight women. As I'm a straight man, it has little appeal to me. I've enjoyed some fanfiction that has male/male relationships, but generally those are the ones that depict a more realistic relationship. Granted, a lot of the readers who hate it are probably just homophobic, but I don't really mind a m/m relationship (though I'm unlikely to hunt down a m/m focused romance on my own, without a strong recommendation).

*** *Yaoi*

Yaoi (; Japanese: やおい [ja.o.i]), also known as boys' love (ボーイズ ラブ, bōizu rabu) or BL (ビーエル, bīeru), is a genre of fictional media originating in Japan that features homoerotic relationships between male characters. It is typically created by women for women and is distinct from homoerotic media marketed to gay male audiences, such as bara, but it also attracts male readers. It spans a wide range of media, including manga, anime, drama CDs, novels, games, and fan production. Boys love and its abbreviation BL are the generic terms for this kind of media in Japan and have, in recent years, become more commonly used in English as well.

The assorted other studies vary pretty heavily, but the exit polls, for instance, are fairly consistent in showing a 4-5% range. The only real consistency in the article seems to be that how you phrase the question, and how much perceived anonymity is available, seem to be dominant in determining results.

For what it's worth, I tend to think that the higher-end estimates would be the most accurate, since those mostly come from higher-anonymity surveys, but that'd still leave the originally cited numbers as accurate. I also assume that "some flavor of homosexuality" wasn't intending to include bisexuality, but given that the context was specifically slash fics I think it's a fair assumption; if Astramancer meant to include them, then I agree his estimate is too low.

******** Asexuality is an interest of mine, since I am one - the lack of study on the topic is fascinating. The German study you included, for example, used the Kinsey scale and so asexuals are probably answering, "Don't know." There's no malice intended - the worst bigotry I've encountered was a GSA member who asked me, "Who molested you [to make you like that]" which is ignorance, not malice - which is probably why it's fascinating rather than upsetting.

Of interest in that German study is that the growth in not-exclusively-straight is entirely in the two "Mostly heterosexual, but not always" categories - the three homosexual categories total to 5% either way, and bisexual only ticked up by one percent; even the "not know" category remained static. To me, that indicates it's not about anything really changing in how people feel, but about people willing to admit that hey, some other guys/gals are hot, and I wonder how many would still self-identify as hetero.

Also worth noting, the Harry Potter crew are younger Generation X - the stories take place during the 90s. Given that more Victorian attitudes shown by the Wizarding culture, that's a double whammy against anybody actually coming out.

The only reasons for the magical world to also have a disproportionately high rate of homosexuality (or bisexuality, etc.) would be if having magical talent actually makes you gay - which is the negative "XYZ MAKES YOU GAY!!!" stereotype written into the plot, and somehow supposed to be positive - or if being gay means you're more likely to have magic.

The flip side to the latter is that being straight means you're less likely to have magic. How would you react to a story where being gay meant a person was less likely to be magical? How about being black meant a lower chance of being a witch? Being female?

The point is that in a fantasy world - which all fiction is, set in our world, a foreign world, the animal kingdom or far under the sea or in space - the rules of our reality don't apply. Everyone could be gay. Everyone could be female. Everyone could be male. Everyone could have no gender at all. And it shouldn't break suspension of disbelief because, well, it's fantasy. You know, logically, that it isn't real because you're reading it in a book or on a screen and it already doesn't bear exact resemblance to the reality with which you yourself live within and are familiar.

So with that context in mind, how is it more believable for people to be magic or be part of a secret society than it is for them to be gay? It isn't. It just frankly isn't a fantasy that a lot of straight people have previously come across or entertained, and because of that, all kinds of weasel words and descriptions are used to justify why the one is less realistic or believable inherently than the other, despite both taking place within the same free for all fantasy space.

Said setting is "Real world + hidden magical world," and then justifies how it remains hidden - muggle repelling charms, notice-me-nots, etc. Belief in a setting that inherently features magic is not harmed when magic happens - when Gandalf blasts a bunch of uruk-hai with flames, I don't get pulled out of the story, because that's just what Gandalf can do. When Harry Potter teleports around or speaks with snakes, that's just what he can do.

If everyone is female, or male, and that's not justified? Yup, that snaps suspension of disbelief, because it's not baked-into the setting and so I'm not expecting it. The only fic I've read that really unbalances genders is the Firebird Trilogy, and great pains are taken to show why females outnumber males so heavily; it's the single most dominant plot point, even.

If everyone is suddenly gay and no explanation is given, then yes, suspension of disbelief goes up in a puff of logic. It's not an inherent part of the setting, so it either needs in-story justification or it stands out.

Gay people /do/ exist. It might seem improbable for there to be a large amount of them in the same place, but birds of a feather do flock together and when you think about it, the sum total amount of characters any fictional piece will deal with - especially Harry Potter - is quite low. In canon we know about 20 students in Harry's year, maybe 10 other students in the school, Ron's family, and some adults, and Harry's muggle relatives. Plus several background characters that pop in and out that we don't see very often.

I don't think I've ever read a fanfic, for example, where /everyone/ is gay. I've read a few where of the relationships known between characters, it may be the case that five out of five are same-sex. But that doesn't break my suspension of disbelief because as an LGBT person, in my social circle, that's what it's like.

In LGBT spaces, the majority of people /are/ LGBT, so the idea that those spaces exist or that social groups like that do exist isn't really a dealbreaker for me. It just happens imo that most media isn't as representative of real life and that the most you will tend to get is some diversity with a mix of everyone of all kinds in it, which /do/ exist in the real world, but aren't the sum total of how people from minorities exist and interact.

The key point really is that a majority of /characters/ that we see closely in the story being gay or lesbian or bisexual wouldn't necessarily to me suggest that the majority of /people/ in that world also were, we would just be seeing a snapshot into a particular segment or friend/social group where that was the case, and such segments absolutely do exist irl.

But generally, canon compliant vs. "no slash" does different work. For example, I like to read about the Marauder's generation; outside of maybe James, people differ on how straight these characters are and there's not much in canon to go one way or another. To me Canon!Sirius is straight, but to many others gay. That doesn't so much matter to me but what /does/ matter to me is avoiding the tropes of the Remus/Sirius pairing, which is generally a Sirius that falls over his own feet if left unsupervised, vain, obsessed with his hair, and calls everyone "Pup". Pass, thanks. But again, it's so common I read tons of it -- but it's why my requests might single out "no slash."

**** I think it has more to do with:

- The reader doesn't like slash, so Snape and Draco are out from the get go.
- Bellatrix was hot, Snape are Draco are not
- Bellatrix is a relatively minor character who doesn't exist until Book 3 (?) and doesn't have a big role until Book 5. Snape and Draco have been described as shitbags since Book 1. There's less antagonism to overcome depending on where the author starts the story in the timeline. While Bealltrix has been a shitbag since the 70s, Harry is not directly faced with it; Harry directly faces antagonism from Snape and Draco.
- Timetravel/Worldbending can apply to all three characters.

That being said, I still would consider Harry/Bellatrix more of a crack pairing than anything else. It exists mostly in the realm of guilty pleasure reading.

Bellatrix is apparently okay, because she served her 13 years (IN AZKABAN!), so her crimes are absolved.

#+begin_quote
  Call me old fashioned, but IMO criminals have to be punished for their misdeeds. Not just rehabilitated, but actually punished. There can be no redemption without punishment. Therefore, at least in my opinion, Bellatrix is more redeemable than Snape or Malfoy. She didn't enjoy life in a manor or castle, she was tortured in an inhumane prison. She has faced consequences for her actions. Which makes me more inclined to give her a fresh start.

Though now I have this crazy idea of an AU where the ministry actually listens to Dumbledore in OotP and the mass breakout of Azkaban doesn't happen because prison security was taken out of the hands of the dementors.

If it's like a Harry/Daphne or whatever fic and Sirius is gay as a side plot or whatever, that's fine it doesn't bother me but reading it as a main plot feels... odd? Not for me.

** Slash fiction uses certain tropes that you generally don't find in gen or het. They can be extremely off putting for me. One of my favorite fics is C'est La Vie for the excellent characterization of many of the people. However it's also written by a slash author. Despite there not being any romance in the story you can easily tell its a slash fic without the slash.

I also don't read Harry/Hermione stories. It isn't because of the relationship, its because of all the bullshit story telling elements that follow in the wake of it.

I have read a lot of slash, but I try to avoid it now since I noticed it just leads to frustration with the fic for one reason or another. Even slash fics that I really like I tend to dislike parts of. The characters often act OOC and there is lot more focus on romance than in het or gen fics.

F/M romance does have similar issues sometimes, but it's more uncommon for me to dislike the style of writing or the way the characters are portrayed. It's also a lot easier to find slow burn het romances that focus on plot that may as well be gen.

** I'm sure my sentiments have already been expressed, but figure I will add my own just in case.

I love Captain Jack Harkness, I don't mind at all him having homosexual relationships and even some on-screen fluffyness and flirting and making out.

I do not mind the idea that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were in love even though I don't read stories from that era.

Lesbians in general do not bother me, and as above points out, pan/bisexual characters do not bother me (I am at least 95% straight and I'd probably sleep with him).

But Harry and Ron...and Neville... Snape... Draco even... are not depicted in canon as at all bisexual let alone homosexual, and the only acceptable reason I can see Harry being gay is due to mental trauma...which is not the way I want to imagine my main characters sexuality.

I am overwhelmingly straight, I invested in Harry as a straight character...and not a single slash fic I've read does the necessary groundwork to make him anything else...and those that probably do...I don't have an interest in reading. It doesn't apply to me, it doesn't appeal to me.

I have read Harry/Hermione/Ron fics, and in those where he CHOOSES to love Ron the same way he does Hermione, or because of an accidental soul bond between the three... where he is not inherently gay and has no reason other than because it makes them all happy. Those I was okay with... but I was still mildly uncomfortable reading lemons that included male/male sex.

That doesn't make me homophobic, I have no fear and no hatred for homosexuals. I accept them for who they are and live-and-let-live. But I have no real interest in reading about male/male relationships, especially with a main character that was demonstrably straight in canon, and not even hinted at being bi or gay.

My favorite gay characters are those that are awesome, and happen to be gay. Not ones where they are gay and that makes them awesome. Not ones where their homosexuality is the main focus of the story.

The overwhelming default of the natural world (excluding microbes) as well as humanity, is heterosexual; including me. I'm open to experimentation but I know I feel no real /attraction/ towards men. I can't relate, and trying to relate makes me uncomfortable.

People pour themselves into the main character. The main character is the vehicle through which we see the rest of the story. If there is something inherent to the main character that does not fit with the reader, it ruins the enjoyment of the story.

Side characters depicted as M/M homosexual (as opposed to lesbians...which I support...because I'm overwhelmingly straight and enjoy the thought) are perfectly fine. I don't really have a problem with Remus/Sirius, or Dean/Seamus... Draco/Crabb/Goyle is awful for completely non-gay reasons and I hate anyone at all paired with Snape without a LOT of building around his character...which I don't like and therefore have little interest in reading about.

I'd like to think this is what most readers problem is... they see themselves in the main character...and themselves are mostly (even based on population...even with very very charitable estimates) 80% heterosexual with some of those maybe entertaining thoughts of the same sex at some point in their lives.

There is nothing wrong with gay main characters, but the audience for them is vanishingly small compared to overall population not just of potential readers...but society in general.

So authors need to be aware that doing so is at peril of their views and reviews. That it will cater to people who don't get enough representation...but that isn't a huge population of readers.

--------------

Okay and also, the majority of authors are female according to most polls and self-identifications. Many of those are mid-teenagers and find the idea of Harry/Draco hot (just like I do with Hermione/Ginny etc). But they are not the greatest authors in the world, and they do not do the needed background buildup to make it plausible... they just throw a marriage law, soul bond, whatever is needed to suddenly force the characters together OR they have Harry wake up one day and go "wow Draco has a great arse".

...anyways... I know I'm a hypocrite for enjoying lesbian sex scenes and not gay ones.

** Eh, it's a number of reasons for me:

Most f/m and m/m romance fics are poorly-written trash. Most pairings also tend to bog down non-romance fics to the point that the genre labels end up a dirty lie, and turn a perfectly decent story into poorly-written trash.

(f/f tends to be higher quality in a majority of fandoms, but it's usually too idealistic for my tastes. Go figure.)

In this fandom in particular, there are a lot of pairings that I don't care for or find unappealing or flat out disturbing. A lot of these pairings are common for popular characters, like Hermione and Harry.

Also, m/m fics tend to have higher ratings (for exactly the reasons you'd think). That's why it's harder to find non-romance genre stuff with m/m pairings that doesn't devolve into sappy relationship drama. A lot of f/m fics /do/ suffer from the same problem, but you can actually find far more K - PG-13 rated fics for f/m. K - PG-13 fics have a higher chance of containing an actual story, which is what I'm looking for in a, you know, /story/.

Finally, I'm a romance novelist by trade, so it's difficult for me to read romance fics without getting annoyed.

It's just easier for me to not even bother reading anything with pairings unless it's been recc'd to high heaven.

** My answer would be - because FFN has no slash filter and people see this r/ as a way to filter out content they won't read. Usually "no slash" comes as an add to an actual request. Also, this r/ is way more tolerant towards slash than a lot of other places. The fact that we mostly do not read it, doesn't mean that we hate it and people reading it. If that was the case, there'd be bullying in slash request threads, as it is they are just way more rare (but considering the straight male dominance it's surprising there's so much actually)

** Personally, my friends have always kind of found me weird because I like both slash and heterosexual harems. There's a stereotype that guys only like harems and girls only like slash, which does have some merit to it.

However, what I've kind of found is that people tend to not like one or the other, not just because of their gender or sexuality, but also because of the tropes associated with them. Slash in the HP fandom is usually associated with Death Eater leghumping, while heterosexual harems are usually associated with “perfect man” Harry. Both also have character bashing, but in different circles -- slash stories are usually thought of as having bashing of Dumbledore/most of the Weasleys/Hermione, while heterosexual harem stories are thought of as having bashing mostly centered on Ron.

There's also something to be said for how the character is written. In most of the slash stories I've seen, Harry is written as the sub, which is not something I generally like tbh. But in heterosexual harem stories, Harry is written as strong, independent, and not willing to take shit, which is something I do like. I figure the same is for other people and how they interpret the characters.

And let's not forget that some stories, with both slash and heterosexual harems as a plot, do have some other qualities in common that people don't like. Such as student-teacher relationships, heavy smut, etc. One might not like these qualities in either, causing them to choose the one that is least bothersome in their eyes.

I hope this helps! I could be wrong about some things, but this is what I've found from personal experience.

** Well this will no doubt be an unpopular answer but I would point to ignorance.

I've spoken on the sub before about it so to any revisiting my statements who were upset by them before, heads up in advance, but simply it is imo mainly straight fans or readers treating it like ordering a sandwich and giving the exact ingredients and not being aware that phrasing it in that way can actually be perceived as not a simple preference and more as active exclusion or erasure.

With the result that when people who /are/ LGBT come onto the sub and see a bunch of posts saying 'no slash' they don't automatically mentally jump to "those people seem to really prefer canon or Harry/canon female pairings", but instead "why do these people hate the idea of slash/gay people so much?"

I can understand not making that connection if you are a straight person because it's not really a situation you come across in reverse unless you happen to spend a lot of time in queer spaces.

(Also loosely connected to the fact of fanfic historically being a /very/ queer and queer-friendly space, which is another source of confusion when a space seems not to be - esp considering although reddit trends male, it also trends socially liberal at least on lgbt acceptance)

If you request "Harmony or minor pairings", it's intending to encourage responses with those characteristics. If you request, "No Harry/Ginny," it's because you don't want to have to deal with Harry/Ginny in your responses.

If you saw, "No Harry/Ginny," on a large percentage of requests, unless the requests were overloaded with Harry/Ginny responses, you'd assume the sub was highly anti-Harry/Ginny and probably hostile to those who shipped it.

If you saw, "Harmony preferred," on a large percentage of requests, you would just assume Harry/Hermione is particularly popular.

The slash become the plot, and the pairing is a key focus, it's right up there in your face. I'm sure that's not always true, but that's what it seems like to me. The art of subtlety and storytelling is often lost, and the idea that a story like this can exist without actually having romance (or smut) is an alien concept to many.

I primarily like romance fics but generally just can't get into the story as well if the protagonist is attracted to guys because I can't sympathize with it. I have the same problem with stories with a female lead and would prefer fem!Slash in that case to a straight pairing. As a straight man myself, as long as the object of the main character's attraction is female I can relate better. That being said, its not like I'd completely refuse to read slash.

In addition many of these stories trend towards smut, to an astonishing degree. I don't want to read page after page of lovingly crafted and detailed sex scenes. I don't give a fuck if it's Flitwick broadening his horizons beneath Hagrid, or if McGonagall is grinding her way to heaven on a petrified Moaning Myrtle's face, or even Dumbledore down on his knees, head arched back as Petunia yanks his beard from the rear while she pegs him.

Wouldn't say homophobia, but just disinterest. You can find statistics of this from your countries' government in most cases, e.g. here's one for the US [[https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24087/cdc_24087_DS1.pdf?download-document-submit=Download]] showing women are 2.25x more likely to be bisexual compared to men, while men are marginally more likely to be homosexual.

Add this onto the fact that from studies done with available data, 78% of fanfiction members are female and it compounds into something significant despite bisexuality/homosexuality accounting for a minority in statistics.

Don't know if there's basis but the common belief is that most slash is written by women, perhaps as a way of expressing themselves and projecting their sexuality/sexuality struggles onto HP characters.

**** Tend is not the right word. They are more likely than men, but you're implying that the majority of women are bisexual, which I'm pretty sure is not true.

***** There's been studies that say the majority of women get turned on looking at other women being sexy, that's probably what is being referenced. Doesn't mean they want to touch or are bisexual, necessarily.

** For me personally it's just because most slash fic is horribly written. There are good ones out there but they're really hard to find.

** I wouldn't be so quick to rule out homophobia. There's a lot of it in the world, especially in strongly religious countries (like the US).

I'm a straight male, but that's not the reason I dislike most slash. I have read one or two fics with good, believable slash. I can't remember the titles, but there's good slash out there.

The writing is rarely good. Many authors are apparently young girls who have no idea what sex is or how it's done. The writing is painfully embarrassing.

Often it's Harry paired with someone completely unrealistic, like Malfoy or Snape. I don't care how good they look in leather pants, it kills suspension of disbelief. I just can't believe in it. Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny could never have a believable romantic relationship with Snape/Malfoy/Bellatrix/Voldemort, leather pants or not.

Too often slash incorporates other elements that are outside of my interests, like dominant/submissive, or sadism. It's not my cup of tea, and it turns me off.

Don't get me started on the evil twin of slash, MPREG.
