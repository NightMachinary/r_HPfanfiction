With the new christmas rules (UK) I'm now unable to see my family as, despite none of us being in T4, it's too far to travel for just one day. Plus of course I couldn't live with the idea that I'd helped spread this. It feels fucking horrible though.

So does anyone know any well written stories about loneliness that I can get lost in? Not something cuddly post war, but about people struggling. Or just anything. I need escapism :(


** I think of escapism as reading about something better than your own situation, which doesn't match your request to read about people struggling. I don't know if this is the kind of story you're looking for or not. If you want to read about someone who definitely had a worse Christmas than you, here you go. I wrote it.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word ‚Äúmuggle,‚Äù anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

*** That's a good point... I guess I just don't want to be reading anything where everything works out? Like, I want to wallow a little bit!

I'll check this out, thanks.

** I'm so sorry to hear about your Christmas plans! (I'm in the UK too and have had my plans changed as well)

I wrote this short story about Lavender Brown, who is pretty lonely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13704240/1/The-Other-Gryffindor-Girl-Lavender-Brown]]

And this one which is much longer about Narcissa, who has her family but not really any close friends... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13747780/1/Ophiuchus-The-Serpent-Bearer-The-Story-of-Narcissa-Malfoy]]

This one (not by me) is really lovely, about Lily and James finding their friendship [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9677581/1/We-Can-Work-It-Out]]

Hope that helps!

  Hermione has left the magical world, and is studying at Oxford. She makes a new friend. Fluffy one shot.
