:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Came across it maybe around 2 years ago? Started off with Dumbledore attacking Harry's fortress, Harry is in some sort of relationship with Fleur, who remarks how "it won't be the same me". He and Dumbledore duel for a while, where Dumbledore criticises Harry for planning time travel, Harry retorts Dumbledore for hypocricy, Dumbledore argues "it was necessary". Sorry for lack of details, I only read the first chapter, was saving it for later but somehow lost it,


** This seems familiar, but I too do not recall the fic name or author.
