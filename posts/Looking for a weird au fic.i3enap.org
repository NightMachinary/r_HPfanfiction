:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read a fic once where I think someone messed with the time line and caused Dumbledore to be late to Harry's trial in ootp cause harry to be expelled but since they couldnt let him not learn the order and do figured out a plan for harry to continue going while hiding as a ravenclaw girl for the year.

Should also point out that it wasnt a smut fic either as this premise could easily be taken that way.


** I did not think that you were talking about smut until you mentioned it. Although now my curiosity is making want that smut fic.

**** Yes, that's why. The bot automatically marks it NSFW if you say the word smut, even if you're specifically saying "no smut." Bots aren't very smart.
