He has no idea she's actually a woman and has just shifted her form to better suit his preferences after he's already shot female Tonks down by saying he's gay.


** I'm gonna bypass the whole real-world legal question, since the wizarding world is not anything like it.

The situation would be considered a prank. These folk think love potions are quaint and harmless. Making kids test out transfigurative snacks without any warning as to what might happen is considered 'a bit irresponsible, but at least they're paid for it'.

If they had sex and neither was physically injured by it, there's nothing for it. In fact, they'd probably see it as ridiculous if one of them was injured by it but was healed afterwards.

** I would argue that as a metamorph her sex and gender aren't exactly fixtures. Its debatable if she is "actually" a woman or just by choice and at some point probably habit. Obviously that always depends on how you write metamorphs.

As an answer to the question I would say no, it isn't rape. Tonks doesn't drop him love potion or charms him somehow, she only works her body to fit his preference. If he consents then, its not rape - just a shitty thing to do, I'd say.

** I had written a fairly long diatribe about it but I manage to make it disappear somehow (actually no idea how) so I'll sum it up with my final bits:

The law in the real world, especially where it applies to disclosing gender, medical history, and prior relationships, as well as impersonation and their intent, is very complicated and only looked at on a case by case basis. In the real world, the vast majority of cases you hear about where a transgender person was deceiving a partner about their gender is when they've been assaulted or murdered. By vast majority, I mean an hour of looking into it has revealed thousands of "someone I know" from open and violent transphobes and exactly one real legal case and the person involved verbally lied directly to their partner about it.

To me, if you're going out to hook up with someone for the night, you've given up the right to care about their history and accepted the risks of STDs or their other prior medical health.

I imagine that due to the multitude of ways one could hid their identity or coerce another person into sex, as well as the fact that the legal system in the HP world is incredibly fucked up, at most it would be rape only if magic was used on the other person. Similarly, using magic on yourself to bed a non-magical would be muggle-baiting at best.

**** Yes, I read the articles, but still don't think that this hypothetical situation involving Tonks would count as rape by deception.

Even in the most similar case of rape by deception, where a woman prepared to be a man, one of the articles said: "The prosecution said that 'at no time' did the woman consent to sex with the use of a prosthetic and in so doing, 'the defendant sexually assaulted' her."

The key to the rape by deception laws is that the person wouldn't have consented otherwise. I think that if Tonks went to a gay club and attracted her crush by changing her body to be male, no one would consider her crushes delicate sensibilities as invalidated general consent. Things would be murkier if she assumed a persona to deceptively entice the person into a relationship, but a one night stand? Nah, I can't see that being considered rape.

***** I agree that this particular scenario is greatly open to interpretation, and what I immediately leapt to in my head was more dramatic/malicious. I think what I was thinking of was closer to the case of the person pretending to be their brother.

But actually here I was simply clarifying to Quoba that lying to trick someone into having sex with you can be regarded as rape. Particularly his claim that saying you will pay someone and then not - that is absolutely regarded as rape here it just rarely results in a prosecution.

****** Quodba was saying that claiming to be something you're not (like rich or unmarried) is considered expected human behavior and not something that rises to the type of egregious betrayal necessary to be considered rape by deception.

Frankly, I think the Israeli case law in the Wikipedia articles go too far by saying that a man claiming to be a neurosurgeon deception was severe enough to be considered rape by deception. I don't think that simply verbally lying about your identity should be enough; in someone has sex without attempting to verify the information, its not rape by deception. If, however, someone creates false evidence (a fake professional persona online) or has their friends lie, then yes, its a serious enough crime of fraud to invalidate consent.

Like if person A doesn't ask person B if they're clean (disease free) before having unprotected sex, they can't claim that was really a necessary condition to their consent. Person A had to at least try to check that information.

******* Quoba said 'they wold give you a lot of money' which goes beuond simply saying 'I'm rich'; I am well aware that history is littered with women who have been duped by promises of marriage and suggestions that the partner is wealthy. But there have been cases in the UK of sex workers taking people to court who have refused to pay - it does not come under theft but sexual assault, as payment was a condition of consent.

I'm not debating the right or wrong of these cases. I am saying that there are cases where people have been prosecuted. My thinking of the Tonks scenario is not a hook up, but if she knew someone was gay and used her powers to actively deceive him, without his knowledge or consent, into believing that she was someone else.

**** I don't think using a legal definition to decide a moral issue is the right way to go. Aside from being a fictional universe, where there's some rather shitty laws, legality and morality don't necessarily go hand in hand. Being legal doesn't mean that something's moral, nor does being illegal imply that something is immoral.

In any case, I'd say that calling something "rape" needs to be confined to specific cases where someone's consent was seriously violated. Calling someone who changes their appearance to get sex a rapist is treading on some really shaky ground. At which point do you draw that line? Is makeup OK? What about dressing in drag? What about having plastic surgery to look more desirable? Why are those things necessarily different from a magic user morphing into a different form?

** Not really, unless she changed mid-coitus or something.

I mean, the basic requirement of your question's very possibility is for metamorphmagi to be able to actually change their sex rather than just their appearance (because Tonks isn't stupid enough to try if that weren't the case). As such, for Tonks a female form is preferred as this is the form she is usually in, but she would also have an actual male form that is 100% male, thus making into something that body-wise is both a man and a woman, just not both at once.

As such, if the guy actually liked Tonks's personality enough to take her to bed, be it as a man or as a woman, this means he would like Tonks as a person rather than a man or a woman, and if Tonks's body was male at the moment she would count as a genuine man, just one with the ability to turn into a woman.

Supernatural abilities make some nuances of law go weird.

** Metamorphmagus' cannot change their gender, the transformation from male to female is impossible, even through magical means, as it requires several potentially fatal surgeries. Due to the fact that Magic naturally take out any deformities at birth, we can assume that there are no people that want to switch genders, anyways. Although homosexuality was rare in Hogwarts, it still existed

**** Not a deformity, just an unexplored magical ability that routes their magic differently. Squibs are unable to create magic, but they are capable of channelling it, creating what we refer to as Magicians. They can be just as powerful as wizards, but their training is a bit more intensive. Surprisingly, there are more Magicians in history rather than Wizards, it's only recently that the Wizarding populace started out weighing the magician populace. So there are schools specifically for these people (although considerably less than Wizards), and they have prominent communities of their own.
