I read a fan fiction a while back and have been searching for it for ages, I cannot for the life of me find it. It's a Hermione and Snape pairing and I think at the start it was something along the lines of "He had given her his address for this purpose believing something like this might happen". Hermione apparates to his home hoping not to get splinched pregnant and physically hurt, it is Ron bashing. Snape protects and cares for her throughout the pregnancy and they fall in love and he says he wants to be the father and take care if them both. At the end the baby is born a Snape and not a Weasley as Luna explains it was through a 3 step bonding ritual. I would be so grateful to anyone that could help. Thank you.
