I like fic where constant contact with horcruxes cause lasting damage. Like Ginny getting Tom Riddle's memories or impulses, the locket induced trust issues and anger not ending when it's destroyed, the diadem causing madness, things like that. The diary describes an emotional connection with it as pouring your soul into it and I feel like that's something that should leave a mark. The more you emotionally invest in a horcrux, the greater an effect it will have.

This is a story starting with Ginny and the diary in Chamber of Secrets. It does turn into eventual Dark!Ginny/Bellatrix and has multiple character deaths involved. I really enjoyed reading this one but I had to step back from reading fanfic for a few weeks after finishing this.

*** I just finished it. I get what you mean about the break from reading. It was beautifully written and I feel satisfied but my brain is too heavy for me to read something else. Regardless, I will be doing just that.

*** Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay (on Spacebattles). Kreacher's redemption starts with Harry comparing him to Gollum/Smeagol.
