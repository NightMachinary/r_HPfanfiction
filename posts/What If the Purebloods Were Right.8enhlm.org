So the commonly mocked pureblood trope is that they believe that purebloods are naturally stronger in magic, much more so than the muggleborns. In response, Lily Potter and Hermione are held up as proof against it. But what if they're right?

Hermione and Lily are exceptional because they are hard-working and smart, not necessarily powerful in the way Dumbledore or Harry is. So what if having pureblood does make you stronger? Halfbloods are generally average, but having a particularly old line (the Gaunts, the Potters, etc) helps you bump up, which explains Voldemort and Harry.

Then explain Crabbe and Goyle. And while Bellatrix was certainly a powerhouse, her half-blooded niece was the one with the metamorphic abilities.

*** Like most things, it's not 100%. There are obviously exceptions, but my idea was that while non-pureblood crazies were cooler about it, the average pureblood was stronger magically than muggleborns. This is completely separate from work ethic, intelligence, persistence, etc.

In canon, I don't think that it is. People seem to draw power either from their strong emotions, or their strong understanding of the way magic works, or both. You never seem some dumb but emotionally-stable-in-the-moment pureblood pull out any powerful magic.

***** I think that's a very harsh -- and overly curt -- response. Because there /is/ potential in the idea. Inequity is a part of life, and if you embrace the notion that pure blood grants power, then I could see a fantastic dystopian AU where the purebloods rule over all other classes simply by the force of might. Magical society would have distinct blood-based strata, and something close to a feudal system might be developed, where the purebloods were lords, the half-bloods -- merchants and artisans, and the muggleborns akin to peasants.

And then, of course, a brave muggleborn, much like Spartacus, rises up to defy the status quo and leads a rebellion against the upper classes.

Ok, this is very AU, but you get the idea. There's potential.

You find post apocalyptic stories 'interesting'. Some others don't.

Also notice no one said they are 'right', just that like most lies or delusions, what if there was an element of truth to them?

This wasn't intended to dismiss Magical Girl Hermione in any way.

** It's a stupid idea if you even vaguely adopt canon statements and examples. The two most powerful wizards of modern time, Dumbledore and Voldemort, are half-bloods. Hermione is deemed to be powerful, she was mastering spells years ahead of time, that's not simply hard-work, that's talent. I don't think it's even in question that she's behind the trio's success in most of the books. Lily was deemed to have been exceptional at charms by Slughorn. As [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] has pointed out, intelligence and knowledge are known to be particularly relevant factors in assessing magical power, and Hermione has those in spades. It's not a coincidence that all the most powerful wizards are the most knowledgeable ones as well.

And really, most of the weak wizards we see (or even just the average-ish ones like Ron) are also purebloods. Crabbe, Goyle, Neville until OoTP (etc.). There's just no correlation here betweem blood status and magical power (in fact, it goes agains the whole point of JKR purposefully basing the blood supremacy ideology on the ideology of Nazis, who went on about the ills of "Jewish blood" and how it led to the degeneracy of a nation). Magical power in canon appears to parallel intelligence in real life: there's a component you inherit but how smart you end up being ends up having to do with how you choose to better yourself or not.

I've seen in a couple of fics - For Love Of Magic being the only one I can recall off the cuff - where having inherited diseases weakens your magic, as a portion of your magic is devoted to keeping you alive/healthy.

The implication being that squibs are kids who would otherwise have been stillborn, and /all/ of their magic is going to keeping them alive.

** The Canon couldn't be more obvious where 'bloody purity' eventually led to:

1) Voldemort's maternal family was already in terminal mental and magical degeneration, then his squib like mother raped a Muggle, and suddenly the most powerful wizard in generations was born. Nothing could be more ironic.

2) Dumbledore's mother Kendra was a Muggleborn, and he was darn powerful.

3) Snape's father was a Muggle, he was both powerful and talented.

4) Harry's mother was a Muggleborn, he was powerful (Patronus cast at 13 years of age strong enough to repel 100+ dementors), and his mother was intelligent and powerful.

5) Hermione was Muggleborn, she was intelligent and powerful.

6) Weasleys were looked down upon as "blood traitors", meaning they had intermarried with Muggles before. But they were all fertile and powerful. Molly Weasley, supposedly a housewife, killed Voldemort's 2nd in command in single combat.

--------------

Now let's take a look at those who insisted on 'blood purity':

Bulstrodes: magically weak, mentally degenerated, but physically strong

Blacks: magically still strong, but mentally unstable (including Sirius)

Carrows: magically ok, mentally degenerated

Crabbes and Goyles: magically weak, mentally degenerated, but physically strong

Gaunts: magically weak, mentally degenerated

Lestranges: magically still strong, mentally degenerated

Malfoys: magically ok, but limping on single issue for generations

Selwyns: magically weak, physically degenerated (toad like appearance)

** What makes you think Harry is powerful, other than having a particularly good patronus? He seems pretty average overall. Also Dumbledore is a halfblood. I don't know that we've ever seen an example of a known super powerful pureblood at all, in canon.

*** I think you're correct in that. In canon, there really is zero basis for any argument that Purebloods are naturally better at magic. McGonagall--a very powerful witch and Animagus--is half-blood. Lucius, a Pureblood, isn't anything in particular other than a raging asshole.

When you think about it, that's kind of the whole point of the books: anyone, regardless of their background, can achieve great things. So, this argument about "what if the purebloods were right" quite literally misses the point.

Even if pureblood wizards are more powerful, that doesn't justify rounding up muggleborns and accusing them of stealing magic, that doesn't justify terrorism and violence, that doesn't even justify Draco calling Hermione a mudblood. Voldemort and the Death Eaters are still villains, as are those like Umbridge.

** Harry was never shown to be exceptionally powerful in the books, other than a precocious talent at casting Expecto Patronum and solid dueling skills (though in his only real toe to toe attempt on Voldemort he was saved by Deus Ex Machina from Priori Incantatum), he had his rear end handed to him verses Snape in HBP.

Longbottom, Crabb, and Goyle clearly demonstrate that purebloods do not inherently possess exceptional magical talent by virtue of genealogy.

** It's an interesting idea. Perhaps a pureblood would be more naturally gifted, but if they don't work and hone those abilities and are just spoiled rotten, they end up like Crabe and Goyle.

It's also something that make people uncomfortable. The snobs being right?! Pfht- preposterous!!! The idea that blood determines your place in society is not something new, or even specific to the magic world though. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it doesn't have some merit.

I think it'd definitely be an interesting story premise.
