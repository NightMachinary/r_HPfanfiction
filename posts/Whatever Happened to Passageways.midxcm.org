I was feeling nostalgic and looked back at some stories I read a long time ago when I saw that Passageways by Jerryway69 hadn't updated for just about four years. I was wondering what happened? I haven't been able to find anything online about it.


** I assume they just quit writing or at least posting their stuff. Is that their fic about harry and bella in the mauraders era?

** I have a vague memory of the author getting really upset because they were getting a lot of crap about their choices for the story. I *think* they said they were going to take a break and maybe not come back.
