This is more of a rant than anything else. I just want a good Harry/OC fic. I don't know if it's becuase I'm picky or something.

I want one where they talk in the library when no one is in there and hold hands under the table. One where the OC is there for him without anyone realising. She may also be a slytherin

I want one where Harry doesn't want to be Harry Potter anymore (during DH) and he calls her up and she consoles him. (And everyone hears the conversation).

I also want one where no one knows about their relationship except them (until the end of course).

I want an arranged Marriage fic where it shocks everyone. (Ginny especially)

But then again I only ship Harry/Fleur, Harry/Hermione and Harry/Tracey Davis and sometimes Harry/Daphne Greengrass

Maybe I'll write these.


** Grow Young with Me is an amazing HP/OC story. It's a very well written romance. I don't remember whether it is finished or not.

It meets these criteria of yours:

But it doesn't meet any of the other criteria.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Thank you. I was just ranting. I wanted A fic where Harry was with someone at his school rather than the typical Harry x Muggle

** When I saw the title here, I was about to mention "Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss" as a pretty good Harry/OC fic, but then I realised it wasn't what you were looking for since Adele is a Muggle girl (the OC younger sister of Piers Polkiss) and it takes a long time before romance actually happens.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

** Try linkffn(To End in Serenity by MattSilver). It's got a fun Slytherin OC with one of the best Golden Trio dynamics I've read in a fic.

  The war's not over. Voldemort created one last Horcrux and sent it back in time, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have to travel back to destroy it and prevent that timeline's Voldemort from rising once and for all, all while doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HP/OFC, RW/HG, RL/NT.
