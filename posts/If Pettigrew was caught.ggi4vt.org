I know there's plenty of fanfics that include this sort of thing, I get why. Sirius was never given a true chance at life after prison, his was probably the saddest story in the franchise for me.

For my story, I want to catch Pettigrew but I don't want to leave any plot holes behind, and then when I realise it later, be forced to write a half-assed plug to fix the hole. I want to get ahead for my story to be airtight, so what are ways that Sirius being free could affect the main story?

I have the main ones such as;

1. Need a new servant for the Goblet of Fire to raise Voldemort with Barty Crouch Jr.

2. Sirius is Harry's godfather so he could become his parental guardian.

3. Harry would have access to Sirius during the Goblet of Fire (though I don't really see this affecting the story too much).

4. Harry could easily find out if Sirius was taken in the Order of the Phoenix instead of asking Kreacher.

Are there any other things I'm missing?

Edit: So, the comments are great. There was even one that gave me a great idea for a one-shot, shout out to the person who wondered if a muggle could break an imperious curse. Though my original post was more about ways Sirius being free could affect the story, like something he did from GoF onwards that would no longer happen because he was free. Just making that clear, because I don't think I did and that's on me - I think the new servant thing threw off the post, but that was just me thinking out loud.


** Magic works by intent a lot. Pettigrew wasn't truly loyal, more like desperate. Like the other commenter said, there's no need for Barty to stay once the other champions are out of commission, at which time he could simply slip away undetected and apparate out to the graveyard.

Harry arrives, and Barty, still in disguise, pretends to be moody until he stuns him from behind and retrieves a random imperiused muggle who was looking after the homunculus.

Barty is truly loyal, devoted even, so his intention with the hand and the blood would be much purer. The ritual would then of course be much more potent in return, changing Voldemort in untold ways.

Barty, having charmed the cup, will have collected it to prevent escape - so Harry and Voldemort duel, but this time there is no convenient out.

I don't think Harry could truly escape. Voldemort cruciates him for a bit, then shoots the killing curse and ends it. Harry enters Limbo and the Horcrux is destroyed.

Due to Dumbledore not being dead, and his parents having moved on, Harry will likely take a bit longer to get out of Limbo again. Voldemort leaves his "corpse" behind as a sign for the Aurors and Dumbledore searching for Harry, and they find him in the Graveyard when every DE is gone.

He of course tells Dumbledore, who lets out a breath of relief, and finally begins the real assault on Voldemort. He origanizes a Horcrux hunt with people he trusts - snape, moody, etc - and they get all of them except for the cup and the snake. The cup is extracted through Dumbledore's influence, and destroyed, and the Snake is killed in a stealth mission when Snape reports it having gone to hunt.

Then, The Order corners and destroys Voldemort once and for all.

They'd know Pettigrew is a turncoat, and want the power of Voldemort to protect him in case Peter snitches. That's how I would justify it, anyway.

** I don't know about #1. It was /helpful/ for Lord Voldemort to have two servants that night, but if the scheme is changed just a little bit, there was nothing stopping Barty from slipping away at the end of the Third Task, going to the graveyard, and sacrificing his /own/ hand for his Lord.

Obviously, depending on the way in which Pettigrew is put out of commission and at what point, there is also the added information about the Death Eaters and their operation. Unlike most of the other caught Death Eaters, Pettigre would be very easy to terrify into spilling everything he knows about the Death Eaters. Depending on what view you take of his character, he could even volunteer that information partially out of lingering guilt. It is even feasible for Dumbledore to browbeat Pettigrew into becoming a spy again, Snape-style (it worked for Voldemort, didn't it?), if you want to go that route.

Blimey, I always thought so but I'd forgotten the extent to which Rowling's /Goblet of Fire/ plot is needlessly convoluted. Well... is it unimaginable to suppose that after learning (or perhaps witnessing) the casting of the Dark Mark, Lord Voldemort would be able to deduce Barty's survival and find him? Perhaps he is even able to recognise the Mark as having been cast by Barty through the same method which allows Dumbledore to recognise the curses in the cave as being Tom Riddle's work.

It's not as though a loyal follower is his only option --- famously, Quirrell came in with the intention of finishing the wraith off but was overpowered. One imagines that by this point Voldemort has shaken off his ten-year torpor and is quite desperate to get back to Britain to kill Harry, having learned in 1991 that the kid had /survived/ Halloween 1981.

*** I thought the same way, but then I realised I'd need a second servant to look after 'baby' Voldie while Barty is in Hogwarrs. I plan to keep Pettigrew alive as well.

If I were to have Pettigrew as a spy, it would be under an unbreakable vow and he'd still go to Azkaban but I think Dumbledore would know that Azkaban would be the first place Voldemort would go to get his followers. Still not sure if that's a route I'm heading but I'd like to have that option there.

**** There are lots of bigoted purebloods out there who never ended up in Azkaban. You don't necessarily have to use Pettigrew. You can even create an OC if you like. Or use any of the lesser known Death Eaters like the Carrows, Selwyn, etc. Little is known about them, so you're free to do almost whatever you want with them. I read a fanfic once where the author made Barty Crouch Jr. team up with 2 former Death Eaters to start looking for Voldemort prior to year 4.

Remember, Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts doesn't necessarily have to start (or even go) the same way. Heck, you can even use Karkaroff if you want.

** Book 4 happens the same minus the graveyard. Crouch jr just wants Harry to die in the tournament. He's trying to use the tournament to try and discredit Dumbledore also. With it being just a random death eater year 4 maybe that's the last straw and Dumbledore is fired. Maybe since McGonagall is overworked she loses her position as deputy headmistress. Maybe a puppet headmaster is put in place with Umbridge as deputy. With Dumbledore fired maybe gives him time to get the Horcrouxs. Year 6 is trying to get the Diadem and the cup. Year 6 is also when Harry finds out he's a Horcroux for drama's sake. Year 7 is trying to find out what would happen to a spirt Voldemort if Harry is killed or the horcroux removed.

**** Maybe by framing Karkarof. In the books Crounch as Moody already mentioned it could be a death eater. As Moody he could try to investigate him and by the end of the school year kill the original Moody and slip outside. They could find the original Moody dead and assume Karkarof killed him.(people have been arrested for less in Harry Potter) would any death eater actually try to help him get free? I highly doubt it. With Krum under the imperius during the third task then maybe make Harry the target. If you have Harry hit by the killing curse to destroy the Horocrux then maybe have Harry hit head before he knows he was struck by the curse. Basically Crouch thinks it's failed and Dumbledore thinking it's still there or worried that it took Harry over.

****** Crouch Jr only needs to escape the original time he did. Maybe something happened to Crouch Sr at the world cup to allow Crouch Jr to escape. Unlike the original books Crounch Ur only needs to stay at the very least put Harry's name in the Goblet. Anything else like killing Moody and framing Karkaroff is extra. With Crouch Sr proven wrong with Black would be even bring up freeing his son? Should Crouch Jr be found (if something goes wrong) you have a viable excuse to release the death eaters by claiming that the trials weren't fair.

In my mind with both Dumbledore and Crouch Sr fall from grace who is left with enough clout for everyone to rally around? Maybe Amelia Bones would be a fannon answer but could be killable in cannon. Do they need Harry to bring back Voldemort? The whole reason to get him m was to get around the protection. The argument could be the ministry may fall sooner by giving more influence to Malfoy.
