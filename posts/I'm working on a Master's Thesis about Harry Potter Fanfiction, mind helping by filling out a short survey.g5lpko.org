*** I've always loved that we have concrete fanon interpretations of characters within our own fandoms and wanted to examine the phenomona in greater detail. It's hopefully leading into further research on Fanfiction including studies into how tropes evolve and cross from one fandom to another, how fanfiction of fanfiction arrises, and then also categorising fanfiction genres and subgenres with academically backed definitions.

Then there was also an ongoing interest in what does and does not class as fanfiction, as the medium has been looked down on for a significant period of time and derived as not being 'real literature' which I would look to debunk by postulating that a large number of 'Great Works' are in fact fanfiction, such as the Aenied, Dante's Inferno, and Paradise Lost

** Done. Seems to be a lot of redundant synonyms in the characteristics e.g. mean/nasty, neat/tidy, clever/smart, etc. Also felt like "principled" was missing as it's an important trait of several characters.

Also the Daphne/Susan/Tracey options are kinda flawed. There's no option for "I am familiar with who this character is but I believe them to be a blank slate with no characteristics." So I just selected "not familiar".

***** Perhaps the more common form of that type question in surveys:

"On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is mostly X trait and 5 is mostly Y trait, is the character X or Y?"

However, part of the problem I had when choosing traits for each character is that none of them are so black and white. The characters change significantly over the course of the books, and they exhibit one set of traits towards their allies while behaving with the opposite traits towards their enemies.

** I kind of wish you had more dynamic personality options. Kind of like snooty, suspicious, paranoid, anxious, conformist, opportunist etc. There are some options that I looked for for some characters and were a little sad they weren't there, as it made the options I did pick seem shallow for a character. Also I think adding in a length of time the person has been reading HP Fanfic may have helped your data.

*** You're right, though. The design of the survey prevents people responding along the lines that they do not believe there is a concrete characterisation of Daphne/Susan/Tracey but rather authors can write them however they like.

It's assuming its own conclusion and preventing people from giving responses which would disprove that there is a "fanon characterisation".

** There seems to be an error in your survey. The instructions say something like 'if you are not familiar with a character, don't put anything' but all characters are counted as a 'required question', making it so that choosing nothing is impossible. This is especially odd for the questions about Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis, since those two are basically non-entities in canon. Did you intend for people to give their impressions from fanon rather than canon?
