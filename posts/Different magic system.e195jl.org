I'm looking for fics in which the magic works differently, not just for Harry but for the wizarding world as a whole. And not just certain spells but the system itself.


** The way magic works in Harry Potter is never really spelled out (hah!), can you give an example of what you mean by a different system of magic?

*** They mean instead of waving a wand and saying spells you would instead summon contracted creatures, level up like a game by killing monsters, require magic circles for using magic, etc. A whole different way of possessing power, getting stronger, and using magic.

**** Harry Potter/Merlin cross over in the semse that magic is a lot more limited in the sense that spells are wandless and very few are short encantations but actual chants and rituals to some extent. Potions require more than just mixing ingredients in a pot and using magic takes a lot more focus but is in the end, more powerful once mastered.

** Linkffn(8616362) fits though it's a crossover that replaces magic with Avatar bending

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

The Death Eaters use a ritual and accidentally summon Milo, a wizard from Myra (City of Light! City of Magic!) whose magic works completely differently. In some aspect he's completely overpowered (Imperius? Eh, just cast Protection from Evil) and in some aspects the HP wizards are way more powerful than him (what do you mean, unlimited spells per day?).

**** Hm, that's the only one with a completely different magic system I know of. But turning the whole "traveler stuck in another dimension" theme around, there's another great fic I'm currently reading: Linkffn(13312738), where almost canon Hermione is stuck in a universe with no magic at all, except for what she got in her bag.

** Depends on your perspective I think. For one thing, the majority of fics that delve into magic beyond the surface introduce a lot of canon-contradictory information clearly sourced from other fandoms. A good example of such a series is linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), where magic is both implicitly and explicitly (see A/N in beginning) modeled more after the Naruto fandom (hell even the main character is a mashup of Naruto and Sakura character-wise). Lots of fics pull the magic=energy thing in fics because its an easy way to make Harry more powerful than everyone without giving reasonable explanations why.

Some more unique divergences though can be found in:

- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): and its sequels, where the entire world and way magic works has been redesigned (this is a dark fic, so be prepared).
- linkffn(0800-Rent-a-Hero): where Divination is made a LOT more useful than it is in canon.
- linkffn(Sixteen Years): magic often manifests itself as superpowers of sorts in certain wizards (ex. Kingsley throws around lightning, Sirius can manipulate shadows and darkness, Tonks metamorphmagus abilities are more like Metamorpho from DC Comics, etc.).
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): there is higher class of spells called Arcane magic, one not utilized often for a variety of different reasons.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light): partly because much of the fic delves into the eldritch and 'old magic,' with wand magic taking, if not a backseat, a sideseat to other styles.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
