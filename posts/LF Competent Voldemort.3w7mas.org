Sometimes, I read some of these fanfictions, with strong harry especially, and I think to myself that I could probably kill Voldy if he was real with the abilities he showed. And then we fics like linkffn(11446957) which makes Voldemort a force of nature...Its on going, and its marvelous. There are other fics like that. The fics by Joe are notorious for OP shinanigans, but if he makes Harry OP, he also makes Voldy OP, so balance. Basically what do you guys think? Are there any other fics that make Voldemort into the unstoppable villain he really should be? Make him into the man who Dumbledore is the only real check to, since Dumbledore has never actually beaten Voldemort in a duel (that is proven to have happened. He has forced him to retreat which is not the same thing.)


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black)

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

I guess MOR if you just want an equally hyper-competent villain.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** He's quite the power in my story "Patron" - only Dumbledore can check him, and vice versa. Both are also not using plans that rely on a lot of coincidences and the other side being stupid. For example, the whole "Harry was forced into the Tournament" is one big diversion to keep Dumbledore busy protecting Harry while Voldemort and his minion prepare the resurrection ritual. Should Harry actually die then that's simply a bonus. Dumbledore on the other hand is quite ruthless when it comes to protecting the innocent - especially his students, like Harry - and his plans do not rely on coincidences either.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
