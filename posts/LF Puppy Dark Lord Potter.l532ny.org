You may or may not have seen stories like that before, it is what I call when Harry for some reason decides to go “dark” but is still a golden-hearted child with all the (I)maturity and utter lack of a mean bone this entails and is comically oblivious, resulting in situations like he infiltrating Azkaban to recruit dementors by offering hot-chocolate, he having to cut short his meeting of the “Super Duper Like Very Evil Evil Order of Evilness For Evilning our Great Evilness” because it is his bedtime, or he executing his great world-domination plan by the way of stealing the minister's cat until he passes control of the country to him and then when Fudge shows up nonplussed to ask WTF the ransom note was about -since as far as he is concerned he doesn't even /own/ a cat- Harry is playing with the cat he found at a random part of the ministry (and so logically deduced it was Fudge's) and decides to keep it because he is just too heartbroken at the very idea of giving it “back”.

Basically a Dark Harry where instead of edgy or dark it turns out fluffy, cute and hilarious. The “The Devil Came Down To Hogwarts” serie on AO3 would be a great example.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
