Hey, i'm looking for any groundhog day style fics. MC should preferably be Harry, but i'm not really picky.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820671/1/][All Our Yesterdays]] Is what you're looking for I think.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]] Slightly less like groundhog day in that the loops:

1. last longer than a day

2. have a variable start and end

#+begin_quote
  Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN /silently weeps/"

  This story was written as a gift for Olivie Blake, in the grand tradition of giving her murder for her birthday, and since I know that she enjoys the particular flavour of Harmony. It was partly inspired by Groundhog Day, but with the darker twist of Edge of Tomorrow. EWE.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.

  Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand.

** Only one I know of off hand is HP and the Temporal Beacon

linkffn(6517567)

It's incomplete and likely abandoned but still worth a read if you haven't tried it before.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** These are both a groundhog day style and MC Harry.

Sisyphus is a one shot. Very well written, concise.

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time is also a pretty good read. Harry is super OP in this one, but so is Voldemort, so it evens it out.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

*** It refers to the movie Groundhog day, starring Bill Murray. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat. Go watch it now, and be prepared to feel as though you've done a thousand situps tomorrow morning.
