:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I can recall is that there was a lake by the name of big blue or something that either never ran out of water or was so deep that it appeared to never run out of water, and that Harry got his name in a book for defeating a chupacabra or some other monster and got it owled to him and Hermione couldn't understand.


** I dont know how to use the bot but the story is harry potter and the lightning scar, harry goes to America in it and take a trip to a forest that has the blue hole lake and kills a creature in the forest
