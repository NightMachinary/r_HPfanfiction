After more or less accidentally stumbling over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] I was really curious about Dark!Hermione fanfictions, but besides [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][The Green Girl]] I have yet to find anything to my tastes in that department... So wondered if anyone here could recommend something good?

I would really like to read stories in which Hermione goes dark (or at least dark grey), preferably paired with Tom Riddle or Viktor Krum or without pairings at all, but everything else would be fine too.

Edit: Fixed link formatting fail...


** linkffn(Blessed by Erised Burning) has a morally decadent Hermione paired with an incarnation of Tom Riddle.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by Timeloopedpowergamer) has a dark Hermione paired with a soulless Ginny.

My story linkffn(Hallows and Pathos by Perspicacity) has a Hermione who becomes obsessed with the Hallows; this obsession drives her to commit some pretty horrific acts.

#+begin_quote
  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** Almost forgot: there's linkao3(And She Shall Reign... by BeastOfTheSea), a one-shot narration about Hermione taking over the world a la the Antichrist. YMMV, but it does have the following brilliant passage:

[[/spoiler][It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed. /Clearly./]]

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

** I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7159111/1/Blood-is-Thicker][Blood is Thicker]], and I liked it a lot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades][Of Elusive Realities and Convincing Facades]] is a fic I read a whole while back, so I'm not quite sure anymore what it was about but I recall her becoming dark. I'm a fan of dark Hermione fics but most are either unfinished or have her turn back to the light in the end.

In case you don't mind her turning back to the light in one way or another, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3743322/1/The-Bittersweet-Taste-of-Victory][The Bittsweet Taste of Victory]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6940202/1/Vengeance][Vengeance]] among many others (but these I favourited despite that).

There's plenty of fics in a dark atmosphere, where Hermione achieves her (mostly light) goals through less scrupulous means, but I don't think that's what you meant. In case it is, you might want to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dark-Hermione/8347/99/4/1/0/0/2/0/][this community]].

  Victory always comes at a price. In Voldemort's mind the cost was the loss of his immortality. Hermione disagreed. 'Without any challenges left one is better of dead,' she said. The words still rang in his ears as he strives to conquer death once more.

** Other than what's been listed so far, there's

- [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]] where Harry returns to wizarding Britain a decade later to discover that Hermione is the new Dark Lady.
- linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser) has Hermione end up attending Durmstrang under false pretenses and becoming rather well versed in Dark Arts.

These two are basically humor/crack:

- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina) has Hermione as a daughter of recurring Bond villains, and a mad scientist.
- linkffn(Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You by SmallBurnyThing) is a crackish fic that does feature Hermione trying to take over the world.

Here are some that have issues that prevent me from recommending them without reservation:

linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) fits the bill; it's a bit emo, and almost certainly abandoned, though. No pairings, either way.

linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen) has a Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione coming to Hogwarts, with harry in tow.

linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai) is a three-shot (a slightly overgrown one-shot) where Hermione takes a rather ruthless approach to helping Harry during OotP. (It is a Harry/Hermione 'ship.)
