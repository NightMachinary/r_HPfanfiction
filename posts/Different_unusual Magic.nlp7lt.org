Im just looking for fics where harry uses different magic from other or where is magic is different from others, no harems.


** I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for. Harry starts out with normal magic and then learns Japanese magic which is slightly different.

*** "... new life in a new country, WITH A NEW MATE." Seriously? Any fic that has the word "mate" in the description, particularly when referring to a 14-year-old, tends toward the awful.

**** To each his own in terms of mate fics. However, Harry's would be 16 not 14, I'm not sure where you got 14 from.

***** My bad. Forgot it was after 5th year, not 4th. So he's technically 15, going on 16.

Either way, most stories talking about "mates" tend to be awful soul-bond, Veela-bond, underage harem, or similar stories written by incels who think that using the word "females" rather than "girls" or "women" is classy.

****** I have come across some of those poorly written ones. But I have also read some well written ones. Like with any anything in FanFiction.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

** Here is one of the few good examples of that idea: linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)

Harry is largely self taught, so his magic is different. But crucially, it isn't better (or even as good) as the magic that comes from centuries of development by an entire society.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
