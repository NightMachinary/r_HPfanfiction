I remember reading part of one some time ago that was a post graduation where Draco is Potions Professor and Harry comes in as DADA (huge surprise) and they get their thing on. The potions and DADA rooms were connected by a tunnel...I remember something about Harry was very well dressed and there was somthing about boots... Yeah, I know, not a lot to go on...

Is that supposed to be a metaphor or something?
