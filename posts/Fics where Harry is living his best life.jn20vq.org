Just Harry (and maybe friends) living life as well off teens in magic school. Thanks!

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** Seven Normal Years of Harry the Hufflepuff: linkffn(12085137)

AU story where Voldemort's Horcruxes didn't work because making more than one is a Bad Ideaâ„¢, and the Dursleys don't treat Harry like he's something they found at the bottom of their shoe. Harry's just kinda vibing all throughout his Hogwarts years. Harry/Tonks pairing.

Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Exactly what it says on the tin, really. Between Harry being a dragon (and that being okay) and adults being competent, most of the canon plot is a non-issue.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** The author choosing to force italics for the entire thing is a really dumb and irritating choice. Hope someone else cares enough to read it.
