I'm reading one where Filch is some kind of priest that performed an exorcism on Harry and removed the Horcrux from his head when he was just a baby. I mean... whatttt?????!

The fic is this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5056386/1/The-Secret-Stone?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=4b3e10a2450ed45603b3d56e46817b6eed094807-1610672714-0-AfR9IB4QORsSkqh5dmylUzP2t_oXSyuSpt3PpMp1X2uAVERHIMdzf8HKVLfqUK1OkM5Lo8WUw2kU9UIBiAuZ5jQgnej9O-4nlnpY1Y08f78Mfqpb-cfPUxvOVx_5EaO51ii5JqGD631qlir9tT5V3HNaMsRwqlbqjrjSBWCyIcZ9jDrB-nenR8a3UTNSCYGDRJomQ66QGpnYwMNFnnsMQUtOp9M3HeCY9aZnl4eYjskbhgR9YweGA0m9w0J0stXbWABhF8Nf6muZVzNpk14Qc86iENw7MihwKI9959Plckm4Ca5CF9cBjuchWMgH8gxN6toZ4sNAhYvTzz1o-oKugvZA83RHaHOX6Jmoq03AzpTIucUVgDm5w7Ol3SJeEn42FCsCyFx_KV2fUGgvdeRHkxA]]

** I haven't read this one, but I can understand the motivation of the author. He doesn't like the cheap idea of forcing Harry to sacrifice with the Horcrux in his head, so he want to get rid of it. Priest Filch is probably worse idea than (for example) Bill Weasley, who turns to know from Egypt what Horcruxes are all about, and he can get rid of it (Albus missing that he has in Order trained curse-breaker with experience with the darkest Egyptian magic always fascinated me), or any other means authors decided to resolve this situation.

** I don't remember the name, but I remember a fic where Molly was actually Voldemort incarnation and it was exorcised when Harry(13) had sex with Luna(12) and the feedback from the good feelings he experienced reached Voldemort through the Horcrux and killed all Voldemort incarnations, which apparently were all Weasleys, except Arthur, who recovered from selective amnesia after the deed.

** One fic I'm still reading (for some reason) decided to make Fleur an international super spy at the age of 17. I'm honestly convinced that the author is just using every idea they have, no matter how incongruous or ineffectual, because they know they're never gonna write an HP fic on this scale again.

** i think an LF of the fic was trending a few days ago but it had a really good plot---canon harry replaced an au harry who was a piece of garbage and really just a manipulative opportunistic sociopath, but it turned into a harry x lily,, you read that right, /harry x lily/. made me click off immediately, such a waste of a good plot but god those words scarred me
