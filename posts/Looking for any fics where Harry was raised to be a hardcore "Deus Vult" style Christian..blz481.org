**** So like Spanish inquisition (I'll torture you Heathen till you confess your sins) to a more extreme Holy Hand Grenade (Feel the wrath of the Abrahamic God. Sodom and Gamorra style.).

Old Testament-y like this line

Isaiah 65;5 "which say, stand by thyself, come not near me; For I am Holier Than Thou: These are smoke in my nose, a fire burneth all day"

And less "he died for our sins" curing the sick and pretty much being a Literal Wizard Jesus.

New testament-y like

1 Corinthian 15 "for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death" (this refers to Jesus defeating the great evil)

** It's not /exactly/ that, but IIRC Harry becomes Significantly Christian over the course of linkffn(Brutal Harry by LordsFire) and its sequel linkffn(Hero Harry by LordsFire). It's not LARPy paladinic Christianity, though. The author believes that Christianity is Actually True, and therefore it's part of canon in the same way as the Spanish-American war (that is, identical to real life unless otherwise specified).

Assuming I'm remembering what fic it was correctly, however, it's got plenty of good guys, bad guys, and explosions.

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

#+begin_quote
  As Magical England grinds itself through civil war and Magical Europe at large collapses in upon itself, Harry hunts through it all. Dumbledore has disappeared, Lucius Malfoy has publically fallen out with Fudge, and most the population of Hogwarts has fled to America, bringing many families of Muggleborns with them. Sequel to Brutal Harry. Rated for violence/messiness.
