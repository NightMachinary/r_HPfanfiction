So this is a rant. You guys are way too good. You have no business of being this damn good, seriously.\\
I watched avengers 2 a few days back for the first time. It was disappointing to me while others have seemed to really enjoy it. Do you know why? Because I kept comparing it to the HPxAvengers crossovers Ive read and it absolutely failed in comparison to the plot, action, everything really.

You people have ruined my movie experience for a long time to come :/ I am NOT looking forward to the harry potter book that's going to be released soon. There is no way in hell it can top some of the fanfictions I have read, specially in terms of gritty gritty realism that fics can portray. I will probably read so that I can read fics related to it later.


** This happened to me with SW:TFA. I kept thinking how egregious it would be if somebody wrote an 8th Harry Potter book with a triwizard tournament or something equally unoriginal.

I was like, they copied the fucking plot of A New Hope, how is everybody ok with this.

*** Oh my god, fucking thank you. Everyone I know likes TFA and I feel like I'm missing something important, because it seems to me to be a well-made, but an otherwise fanservicey, unoriginal shite-heap of a film.

**** To me, it seems that they're setting up that the Star Wars universe is almost cyclical, in a way. The Phantom Menace parallels A New Hope parallels The Force Awakens. Attack of the Clones mirrors The Empire Strikes Back, and then of course Revenge of the Sith is the dark reflection of Return of the Jedi. Like Maz Kanata said, it's all one war, just in different guises. Sith, Empire, First Order. Republic, Rebellion, Resistance.

Let's examine the main character of each trilogy (assuming Rey is the main of the new trilogy). Anakin knows his parent. Luke knows of one of his parents. Rey knows not of her parents. Anakin was a slave. Luke was a moisture farmer for his uncle. Rey was an independent scavenger. Let's look at the major threats in the first film of each trilogy: Droid army, Death Star, Starkiller Base. Each a technological threat that the villains believe to be overwhelming, but increasing in stakes as time goes on. Hell, let's take a look at how people (Outer Rim people) thought of the Jedi at the start of each trilogy. A Phantom Menace: Known to currently exist. A New Hope: Known to have once existed. The Force Awakens: People thought Luke Skywalker was a myth.

Hell, I just thought of this. Examine the beginning and ending of TPM, ANH and TFA. Diplomatic mission gone wrong. Spy mission posing as diplomatic mission gone wrong. Spy mission gone wrong. Major ceremony, minor ceremony, no ceremony.

Clear arcs and progressions of events and themes exist when you look at the first movies of each trilogy, and I'm also guessing it is going to be the same when looking at the second of each and the final of each.

The Force Awakens being similar to A New Hope isn't a sign of hack writers, but *is part of the point* and was a conscious decision.

I spend a lot of time thinking about Star Wars.

***** Yes, each trilogy can have similarities in that Nietzschean eternal recurrence sort of way, but there's a point where the audience won't accept it because you're shoving the same thematic drivel without analysing context. The SW writers can't keep trying to convince me these people will succeed. I know that sounds weird, but let me explain:

Luke, Leia, and Han succeeded where Anakin, Obi Wan, and Padme failed; they saved Anakin's soul, brought balance to the force in doing so, and destroyed the Empire. They're all bona fide heroes.Twenty to thirty years later, and suddenly The Empire is back even stronger under the guise of First Order? Leia and Han have split up? No one has seen Luke in years, to the point where people aren't even sure if he ever existed?

In other words, the original protagonists failed miserably after Return of the Jedi. Leaving aside that the fate of Luke disrespects the hero's journey Lucas set up for him in the original trilogy, the problem in the new movie is that message is still by-and-large the same as the previous ones: friendship and believing in yourself can help defeat the Sith. Except it can't, as we've seen the actual heroes from the previous two trilogies abandon that and let the galaxy collapse. So both now both Anakin and Luke failed, and now they're trying to convince me that Rey will do what they couldn't? By approaching things exactly the same when faced with similar obstacles?

This is what I mean by no analysis of context: nothing the characters do actually changes anything, but the films don't reflect that theme. The new trilogy (at the moment) isn't some existential series of films centred around the Sisyphean struggle of trying to extinguish evil; it's a romp about friends defeating an Evil Empire, like the original trilogy, and in doing so, it shows the writers don't fully understand the universe they've set up. The similarities to A New Hope may be a conscious decision, but I also think it was a lazy one, especially when there's no nuance to it ("The Death Star destroyed two planets? Fuck it, we'll destroy five, at the same time!").

****** Well, here's how I see it. The prequel trilogy was not very good. They were very widely hated. So much so that in comparison to the widespread opptimisim for the Phantom Menace, it was very cautious opptimisim for the Force Awakens. In order to make up for the sins of the past trilogy, they had to show that they could pull off the same tone and style of the original.

Here's a good metaphor I heard "sure it's not a classic, but it doesn't need to be. This is an old friend who got beat up a little and is just showing you that they're okay before moving on to do better things."

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
