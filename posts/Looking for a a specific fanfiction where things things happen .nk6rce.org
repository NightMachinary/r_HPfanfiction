In Harry's first year in Slytherin. He became friends with the Draco Malfoy and some also Slytherin . He was abused by Dursleys . He hates then people touch him. He is naturally talented in magic. He's visits the Greengrasses for Christmas or on his Christmas break . He also saves Daphne from being molested. He competes with Daphne and potions. He gets a mysterious book by Tom Riddle for Christmas. Daphne compares his personality to Grindelwald because in the he describes magic. He dance with her for a ball. Daphne and he go out there Voldemort. She kisses him on the cheek. He still plays Quidditch. I think there's might be Ron and Hermione bashing.
