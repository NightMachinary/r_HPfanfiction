Okay, so, pretty much every fic only delves into learning new spells. However, I haven't seen any that go into the more technical aspect. Why does magic recognize a specific word to activate the spell? How is arthimancy involved in the creation of the spell? How is the effect of the spell decided? How do they work?

Over 70k+ words please!


** Spellcaster by SGCBearcub has some of the most interesting magical theory that I've seen. I think it's been taken down but if you can find a copy you should read it.

** I'd really recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer)

It's Hermione centric, and really very good if you want to get in to the details of spellcrafting. It doesn't quite get in to the nitty gritty specifics of magic, but it does get much closer than a lot of fics. It has a sequel that is in progress, but updated regularly.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Please see anything by Taure. Some of his stuff he removed from his profile, but has left available via a dropbox link findable in [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=34397][this here thread over at DLP]]. And before anyone gives me any shit about rule 6 and circumventing the will of authors, I shall quote the man myself

#+begin_quote
  So I decided to clean up my FF.Net profile, removing the fics that I'm not happy with or am (at least in theory) planning on re-writing. But I know some people might still want access to the fics I'm removing, so I made a DropBox folder with all my fics as of 21 August 2016.

Of course [[/u/Taure]], if you want me to annihilate this comment, let me know.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
