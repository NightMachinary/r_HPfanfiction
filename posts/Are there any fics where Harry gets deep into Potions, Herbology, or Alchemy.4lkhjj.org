It doesn't really need to be Harry.

I just want them to fucking use these branches of magic that no one ever uses. It's so lame, because potions especially would be so useful. No one ever uses potions, for like, anything other than staying awake, healing, and coming back to life. Surely, with magic, there could be a method for using them in combat, or boosting yourself, or learning, or something.

And herbology! No one even mentions why they learn it! What does it do? Is it seriously just farming? Why do they teach it at school without any applications barring a few niche ones surrounding potions?

Alchemy is less of a big deal, as it makes some sense for Harry to have never learned it in canon, as it's supposed to be difficult. But still, I can't believe thousands of fics are out there, and none of them are good on this topic, surely I just can't find them.

Heck they don't even need to be long, just address any of these topics...

Thanks in advance!


** Potions: linkffn(7613196)

The "Harry" (AU genderswap) in this one is obsessed with Potions, and does some pretty fun stuff with it later on down the line.

** Linkffn(7724057) Family Bonds, very good WBWL story where Snape essentially raises Harry while his family is off training his brother. One of my personal favourites, but unfortunately it is (probably) abandoned. Still worth the read.

** In addition to seconding The Pureblood Pretense (and its wonderful sequels), I'm going to recommend linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) which is a LOTR crossover where Harry, wandless, needs to reinvent potioneering if he wants to use magic at all. Still in progress, but updates ~once a month.

Also, if you can palate abandoned fics, read Out of the Night by Raining Ink, which is canon through four, actually does the inheritance trope well, does potions well, and is overall quite excellent. Not on ffn or ao3, but you should be able to find it by searching in this subreddit.

Got nothing as far as herbology is concerned, but dang am I interested now. Let me know if you find any!

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I always liked the use of a very strong (and fast-acting) sleeping potion inside paintball rounds in linkffn(Three to Backstep). Also, tons of love and loyalty potions, other mind-altering stuff... but the sleep one is the only one where you see the development for a specific purpose.

linkffn(7337825)

Azoth deals with potions and alchemy in some serious depth. I was very impressed and it is one of my all time favorite fics. Parsimony has parts that deal with potions (I remember a ghost Snape mentoring Harry).

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
