Because what else could it be in a family of 7 children?


** Oh wow absolutely love it!

As years pass they need to come up with a more realistic "ghoul", because they've got a bunch of Gryffindor explorers, and they keep trying to sneak a peek in the attic. They start using simple transfigurations, illusions, everything necessary to convince the kids... At some point Fred and George are too old to be stopped, and Arthur and Molly know they'll uncover the truth. So, confess? Or get a real ghoul to cover it up?

They obviously go with the second. And good thing too, because they can use it to cover for Ron's Horcrux hunting in the end! Arthur congratulates himself on his fantastic idea :)

This could make for one hilarious one-shot.

****** Here you go. I don't have the time to search for it now, but you'll find it here somewhere. The one that comes to mind for me is Muffliato, this makes others around you hear a buzzing instead of what you are saying/doing. What specifically do you need the spell for? Because depending on what your doing(sneaking around would warrant a silencing charm as opposed to Muffliato, which is good for keeping conversations secret) would depend on what you need it for.

******** It was, and it was also recorded, and placed in the library. So as long as the story takes place after 1978, you should still be able to use it, and be following canon. Just remember that writing fanfiction means that you can change the story. It's why it's called fanfiction, so go nuts. Create your own silencing spell, have Tom be Dumbledore's long lost son. Jave Ron be an Auburn haired kid in a family of red-heads. Just have fun with it, that's all anyone can ask of you.

******* Also, the Muffliato probably wouldn't work due to the feedback you'd hear. The twins are far too curious and the first time that the Mr&Mrs use it, I can almost guarantee that they - when old enough - (and honestly, probably all of them besides maybe, Percy) would have done some snooping. Kind of like a tradition of "I've been tormented and scarred, it's your turn". Bill was first, then Charlie passed it on to the twins and now it's Ron and Ginny's turn to walk in on their parents. üòÖüòÖ

Of course one could argue for a disillusion charm, but honestly, I think that'd be too much thought and effort put into it when most times sex is spontaneous (especially with a house as full as theirs is).

****** Yeah but everyone has their personal preferences. We don't all have to agree with everyone else's head canon personally I prefer to stay as close to the books as possible because I find once it drifts too far, the writing tends to become worse. It's a fulfilment thing for the author and that's okay, but I find it hard to engage. If I read a fanfic were an author just wrote out part of the book for no reason other than their own fantasy or smut I'd probably stop reading.

I disagree that JKR can't decide what's canon and what's not, in my opinion she's pretty clear, but that's a separate thing.
