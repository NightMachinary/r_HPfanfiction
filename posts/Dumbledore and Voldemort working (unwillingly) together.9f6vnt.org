The idea of Dumbledore and Tom Sexy Riddle working together against a common evil. Not a "I trust you with my life" as much as a "You get within ten steps of me and you'll be dead on the ninth".

Any stories like this? Preferably no shipping or the two ever really trusting each other. It doesn't have to be from either of their PoVs. Thanks!


** Linkffn(12331839)

Tom, as a student before he even discovers the chamber, becomes a target of assassination by Harry who has travelled through time to kill him. So he has no choice but to stick with Dumbledore even if he doesn't trust the professor.

I really liked that the story was from Tom's POV, I can't say more without spoiling the fun but it was interesting to read a young and inexperienced Tom Riddle that actually does make him seem like he's a student that's stuck in a situation that's out of his league. Not to mention how Tom's and Dumbledore's portrayal was some of the best I've read.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

*** I actually loved a fanfiction called Riddle's School Days or similar. It was also from his perspective. I'll check this story out!

** This one's a three-parter, parts 1 and 2 are Harry and Voldemort stuck working together, but part 3 is a the same Voldemort from parts 1 and 2 working with a Dumbledore during the first war.

**** I read some of the first book and it really seemed not my style. I'm always a fan of political fics, but this one didn't have any hints towards any action. The prowess mentioned seemed to indicate a reason to have little conflict. I'm sure it could easily have good action later, but I prefer the learning magic and Hogwarts setting. A great story, but it's not my style.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
