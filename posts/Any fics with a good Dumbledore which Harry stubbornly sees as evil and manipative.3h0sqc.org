** I Google searched: harry potter + "alex jones", in an attempt to find a conspiracy nut Harry that fits your request. I found something with a unique flavor of madness:

#+begin_quote
  Returning to Hogwarts with the knowledge he had acquired over the summer was going to be a stressful matter. Now that he had read all of Mark Dice's works and watched Alex Jones entire catalogue, he couldn't view anything the same.

  He had to prepare this year. The New World Order could happen anytime and Harry would be caught unawares. Not anymore. When they came for him... well let's just say harry had bought a gun or five. He would go down in a blaze of glory before surrendering to those Satanist, socialist scum.
#+end_quote

And this

#+begin_quote
  "No! Don't be fooled by the lies!" Harry yelled through closed door while frantically clawing at his own face. "They fluoridated the water, Hermione! Fluoride is bad!" He could feel his eyes twisting in his skull. "9/11 was an inside job!" Urine started running down his legs.

** Okay guys, I don't have the promised story up. The problem is that it sort of went and ran away from me and now includes a side order of senile!Merlin among other things. Also I'm not even sure if it should be just crack anymore, and Dumbledore is now the main character. Basically I'm confused as hell right now and loving it - if this story wants to be a hundred-chapter epic by God I'm going to write a hundred-chapter epic.

So [[/u/Pfcbales]], [[/u/paperhurts]], [[/u/Chienkaiba]], [[/u/btr154]], [[/u/partisan98]], [[/u/tusing]], [[/u/howtopleaseme]], [[/u/Imborednow]] and [[/u/schumi23]], I'm sorry I didn't deliver on the three-day promise and I swear I'll make up for it with an extra-extra-OOC Harry :(

This. I thought of doing a ptomoting post for this story because in my opinion anyone who reads manipalutive Dumbledore stories should read it.

There is a one shot which is in my understanding prequel to the story, happens chronologically about on the middle it something.
