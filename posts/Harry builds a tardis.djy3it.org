I read a fic a long while where Harry builds a tardis. I believe he used portkey 'technology', undetectable extension charm and a few other things. Just wanted to know if anyone knew its name? Oh and it was on ff.net


** Based on a quick google search it could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/25/][Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10591146/1/][260 Going on 16]]. I think Harry builds a tardis in both of them.
