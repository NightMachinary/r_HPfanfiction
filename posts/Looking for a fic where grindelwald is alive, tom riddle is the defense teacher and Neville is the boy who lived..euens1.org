I think it was a fem Harry story. Edit-I also remember dumbledore took control of her with an illegal ring using her blood after she's injured in the Hall


** Found it! I'm 90% sure its this one: linkffn(7868754) Hasn't been updated in 4Â½ years. It's has a lot of Silver Aegis elements.

  After the final battle, our hero takes time to mourn the lost; for all his tribulations Magic itself gives him the opportunity to regain his loved ones and perhaps make a few more. For that opportunity, no price is too high. Rated M, FemHarry/TMR and more

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]
