Its a short story about a curse breaker dealing with a bewitched mail box. I'm still super new to writing so I would love any feedback.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16383119]]


** Nitpicky notes:

- In the first paragraph you end the last two sentences with the same word, and again with "box" further down. Try to avoid repeating words too close together
- There's no need for the indentations on the next paragraphs when you've got a line of space between them
- "flu network -/> Floo network"
- "stuck out a firm handshake" awkward wording needs a tweak
- a couple minor spelling errors, though far less than normal for fanfic
- a few misused words, nothing major

General and subjective advice from one utterly unqualified: Try to make a conscious effort to vary your sentence lengths (I struggle with this too). Overall the prose is very readable and pleasant, but some bits feel a little droning.

You don't get bogged down in heavy description, which is a big plus for me, personally (it's good to allow the reader's imagination some freedom), although I think the beginning would benefit from a couple sentences of scene-setting (use as many senses as you can).

The characters and dialogue were believable, and the narration/Tom's inner voice is charming, well-suited to HP; I enjoyed how he treated the box as if it were sentient (and I guess it was; again, you captured a good whimsical JKR tone here), and the solution to the curse was pleasantly more creative than simply finding a countercurse. A few bits made me laugh, like "He failed completely and had nothing new to go on." The part where he thinks about his children tending to themselves had a sad undertone that I liked, and it made me curious about their family.

Overall, this is a great start. Keep going!

*** Thank you very much for the feedback. It is very helpful and appreciated. Most of the things you point out are things that I know that I am doing already and have tried to address already. I know I have more I need to mature on.

The repeating words is a big one. During my first editing read through I ended up finding that I used the word "Box" 35 times. It was atrocious. I am not surprised that I didn't fully get that error corrected.

I didn't know that about the text, but it makes sense.

Ty for the correct spelling of Floo network. I should have researched that. An easy fix.

The sentence length is also something that I have tried to address. I end up having to go back and split up so many different ideas that I initially tried to cram into one sentence. Short sentences can be very powerful and I don't use them enough. Thank you for reinforcing that concept.

I had about a page initially setting the stage and detailing everything from the perspective of a muggle observing Tom walk to the Mullpepper's house, but I ended up cutting it because it did little to advance the story. In retrospect, that introduction had most of my stage setting and I see now that I needed a little more.

Thank you very much for the feedback and thank you for reading.

**** On the note of paragraph indention, it's fine to do it even with the space (though not that common on fanfic sites). The problem here is that its inconsistent. Pick a style and stick with it, or you might throw your reader off.

** I really enjoyed it. It almost feels like it was written by JKR, and Ithink it captures very well the comical and unpredictable nature of magic of the first couple of HP books.

I can't really comment much on the grammar and language, as English is not my first language, but I felt it was understandable and simple English (again, much like the style of the first HP books).

Keep it up!
