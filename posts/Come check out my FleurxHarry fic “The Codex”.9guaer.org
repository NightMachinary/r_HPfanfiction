Just a self promotion and recommendation of my own fic Summery/Stats:

Harry is left with a lasting legacy. He is given a most curious object in the form of a dragon egg, the last of its kind in the hopes that it will hatch for him. Two will become one, bonded for eternity. Matched only by the bond of love. The power of that bond will give him strength to stand against his enemies. Good Dumbledore, no bashing. FleurxHarry romance, slow burn. Harry Potter - Rated: T - English - Adventure/Romance - Chapters: 13 - Words: 60,907 - Reviews: 117 - Updated: 9/15/2018 - Published: 5/9/2018 - [Harry P., Fleur D.]

Thanks!!


** Tell us something about it. Because so far, we have a cheesy description which suggests a lot of bad tropes (like teenagers deeply in love, love bonds and some kind of inheritance).

**** Definitely. The description reads like one of those trope fests where the only thing missing is a writing quality.

*** Well there aren't any love bonds really. And there isn't any relationships in the fic at this time and there won't be for quite some time. As far as inheritance goes it isn't one of those fics where Harry runs around insanely rich and buying a boatload of crap. He does have money but I have avoided some stupid Gringotts scene where he inherits millions of dollars and buys all this and that. The story is mainly about Harry growing as a character and him developing skills for the long term (right now) down the line when Harry gets older there will be romance and a lot of things I haven't seen in a HP Fanfic. But right now it's light hearted and and if you're looking for a serious fic then come back later because it's following the theme of the books where it went from light to dark. If you have any specific questions let me know.

**** Personally, if I just read your summary, I'm not sure I would read the fic. As someone else said, it sounds really like a teen romance, "eternity" "bond of love" in particular. Even if you wrote that it's a slow burn. I might give it a try though, when it gets more serious later :)

***** Ok, thanks for the consideration. Yeah I thought that was a line that put people off. That refers to the bond between Harry and his Dragon. Not any character in particular. But I think I will revise my summery.

** Chapter 13: In the first paragraph, I found "Leakey Cauldron." That was not a good sign.

As a general rule, I never rule out any fic based on pairing stuff (unless its just truly abhorent such as incest or worse). But the problem I have, and I say this not at all to be inflamatory, there are two ways I can see this fic going, based on past experience:

1. You spend a lot of time focusing on the H/F romance, but it runs out of steam once they end up together and the fic gets boring and/or dropped.
2. Most authors writing a long fic (barring time-skip stuff or skipping huge sections of the years) tend to grind to a halt somewhere between 2nd and 4th year, usually because of lost interest or too many AU plot divergences they now have to consider.

Its possible it could go another way, but these make up somewhere between 95-99% of long form fics. And the fact that you have a bunch of tropes like love/soul bonds, undiscovered inheritance, and children falling for each other is going to make the story hard to put up with. I have more, but I don't think its necessary for you to start seeing some of the issues here.

*** No soul bonds, but I can see where you're coming from and some of the concerns but I do have things to keep it interesting and I do intend to venture AU or somewhere in between. I know what you mean about being abandoned further in but I'm so excited to get there I don't think it'll happen. Think what you want about me quitting, that's okay and I understand I only hope to change your mind as I venture further. And yeah the romance will be toned down as they meet new people and focus on school. Sorry for the experience.
