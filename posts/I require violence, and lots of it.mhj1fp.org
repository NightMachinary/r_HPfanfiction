I have no control of my own life so I like to escape by reading fanfic that has a torrent of righteous ass kicking. Dont care who the MC is, dont care if they get isekai'd, I just want fics I can listen to the DOOM soundtrack while reading and it doesnt feel out of place, while Harry hands everyone their collective asses. I dont want to have to think too hard about what I'm reading. Rot my brain.


** Ass kicking... The one that pops straight into my head is joe6991, and his linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) duology, plus his not as good imo Hero trilogy starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) Both of these are very OP Harry

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

** Starfox50's Divided and Entwined. Or Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution, even though it's not as good and really shortchanges you on the actual revolution.

Oh, and the one with The Herminator. I forget what it's called, but it's promising some more good violence on top of what it already has...

The Herminator was apparently a joke in one of the comments and became one of its tags on AO3.

  NaNoWriMo 2019. After Harry Potter is thrown into hell, Britain falls to the dark. The lights only hope is to bring Harry back. But ten years have had their effect on him. Will he be the savior the light had hoped? Or have they merely traded one devil for another.
