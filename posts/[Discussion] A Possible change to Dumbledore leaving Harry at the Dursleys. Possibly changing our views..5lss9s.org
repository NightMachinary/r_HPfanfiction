So this has been something i have been mulling over the past few days. And i thought i would make a post about it.

I was thinking about how harry's drop off could have been done different. What if instead of Dumbledore and McGonagall talking at private drive, they instead were talking at Hogwarts. McGonagall wouldn't have spied on the Dursleys and warned Dumbledore against them. Dumbledore could have told McGonagall that, after having Pomfrey was done checking Harry, he just send Hagrid to the Dursleys with Harry and a letter.

McGonagall would question about sending Harry to live with Muggles. Dumbledore would respond with that they are Harrys familie and that he was confident that they would take him in and take care of him (Implying they would get a choice), as wel as his in book words. Though Dumbledore was preparing other options incase they refused.

Unbeknownst to Dumbledore Hagrid drop Harry of at the front door along with the letter, instead of talking to the Dursleys and asking if they wanted to take care of Harry. After all he asked Hagrid to "Drop him off at the Dursleys" and Dumbledore cast a warming charm on Harry's blanket (for the journey) so no harm there, Right?

Later Miss Figg would report to Dumbledore about some things she saw, but since most of the abuse was emotional and inside the house she missed a lot. Dumbledore would wonder, but since the Dursleys took Harry in voluntarily (as far as he knows) he would't think too much of it.

This all would take place a couple of Days after Halloween (timing and wording of things might need to be slightly altered). This would give time for Sirius to be arrested and the Longbottoms to be attacked. Before that he would have been looked after at Hogwarts where he was safe, but hardly a permanent solution. This all would further cement Dumbledore's need to place Harry somewhere away and safe.

So what do you think? I am not a writer so sorry if things aren't written to clear. It's a small change at the beginning that would have given us a different view of Dumbledore than what a lot of people have right now.


** Readers and writers who like to bash characters will always find something to hate. If they can't, then they'll literally just fabricate ludicrous scenes in order to justify it and/or exaggerate the worst aspects of a character a hundredfold to justify it.

Dumbledore left Harry at the Dursley household because that is where he felt he would be the safest. And for what it's worth, he was right. For 11 years, Harry was safe from any form of attack from Death Eaters and such. He knew Harry wasn't going to be treated well. That was simply secondary to ensuring Harry's safety. There is a scene in which he tells Harry this and asks for his forgiveness, I believe, but I can't remember which book it was in.

*** The point isn't so much about the story as it is about the view of the readers. A lot of people bashing of Dumbledore is primarily supported by him placing Harry at the Dursleys. I was thinking if it was written differently, then maybe people wouldn't be as anti-Dumbledore.

***** Why should Dumbledore check up on Harry? I cannot fathom how people can even bring this up logically because it's not Dumbledore's job.

Dumbledore is the headmaster of a school, he has like ten other titles as well. I just cannot imagine him having the time to pop by the Dursley's, knowing that Petunia didn't really like him for denying her access to Hogwarts, and having a cup of tea.

******* It is, but it's almost in every fic depending on the situation. 'Bashing' has a lot of different meanings and Googling 'character bashing' has a rather obscure result.

Maybe it's different for Harry Potter? I dunno.

When I first got into fanfiction, I was all for Harry telling Dumbledore where to shove it, but now it's just unpleasant. There's a very fine line between bashing and character qualities.
