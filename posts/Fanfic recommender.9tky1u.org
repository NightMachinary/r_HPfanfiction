I haven't been writing about my rec engine for a while and since then it's got a bunch of new cool features.  

[[https://github.com/Zeks/flipper/releases/download/client_0.9.5.1/flipper_client_0.9.5.1.7z]]

 

What it can do now:

 

Find fics for you to read based on your FFN profile for HP only or for all fandoms on FFN in the same list.

Exclude fics/fandoms from recommendations to quench the usual noise inherent in such engines

Find fics similar to others

Show/hide slash fics. (And it's somewhat intelligent about what to consider slash)

Automatically detect and display the detected genres for more popular fics and search on those

Do comlplex searches on recommendation lists to further narrow down the recommendations

Show fics from the authors that you've liked previously

Or it can just be used as a better layer over FFN search

  The database has ~4.8m fics and ~250k users to draw upon. It's not whole of FFN, but it's a pretty solid chunk.

 

The recommender will work both on Windows (natively) and Linux/Mac (via WINE)

 

You will need MSVC 2015 redistributable for this to work and you can get it there [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145]]

but if you are gaming on your PC it's highly likely you already have it.

 

The manual that explains most use cases can be found here:

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEXQBQnDbFljBTAea_Ljbq731OGUDjHoew2s9jmj2tk/edit#]]

I highly recommend even old users read it as it contains a lot of useful non obvious stuff

 

Support is available through Discord: [[https://discord.gg/nWwh5Fx]] Direct all your questions, problems and suggestions to that server.

I'm assuming the second part of the statement was supposed to be another OS (MacOS maybe?)
