I remember reading a oneshot on Fanfiction.net set in the real world where the main character was a Tara Gilesbie exp writing a My Immortal expy. It showed her life in contrast with the OC main character in her fic, how she had a meh life in the real world and a great "life" in her fanfiction world. I think she started writing less of it when she got some friends and a boyfriend, but when her boyfriend cheated on her, she wrote an angry chapter about the OC finding Harry cheating on her with Hermione and subsequently goes on a rampage. I think the last lines might be something along the lines of:

She hit submit.

And realised what she had done.


** what does “expy” mean?

*** A copy, parody or stand-in. The protagonist of this fanfic was meant to resemble authors of Mary Sue fics, like Tara Gilesbie, author of My Immortal. The fic this character writes is very similar to My Immortal too - a fic where an overpowered Mary-Sue OC makes friends with major characters and dates one of them.
