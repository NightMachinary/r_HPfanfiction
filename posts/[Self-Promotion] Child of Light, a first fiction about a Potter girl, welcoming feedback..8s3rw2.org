I'm writing a story about a female version of Potter (Aurora Jane Potter) starting from year 1991, usually posting a new chapter every other weeks on ffn. While the events regarding the first year have been written already, and the story stayed quite close to the Canon, the writing of the second year is progress and will see more divergence.

Among the subject I plan to progressively explore is a reinterpretation of classical Slytherin/Ravenclaw/Gryffindor/Hufflepuff stereotype (for example, exploring Slytherins values as not evil, but without making pureblood ideology somehow acceptable; or showing how certains Gryffindors traits could be belligerents ), as well as the cultural differences between Muggles and Magical people, especially from the point of view of muggle raised children. And to answer the question: what is a society where every member can like a god at age eleven when that person is given a wand?

Allow me to quote the introduction of a chapter (17) , second year I published recently, as a teaser. I think it's a good example of the tone I try to set for the story.

  The Great Hall of Hogwarts on Saturday morning was the scenery of a very peculiar phenomenon that had become over the years known as the Little Morning, though not everyone was aware of it. It usually took place between 4 and 6 a.m. Breakfast was not expected during the Little Morning, nor did any candles lighten the Great Hall, rather than that, students would be crossing the room swiftly, carefully ignoring each other, and would quickly sneak through the shadows to finish the night back in their own dormitories.

  Then, a few hours later, around 9 a.m, everyone would wake up for the 'official morning', or more simply the 'morning', since no one had bother to give it a special name. And the early birds, hidden among others, could pretend they had been in their dormitory all night. They would insist that they had not left their House dormitories. They would tell to everyone that didn't ask, because no one ever did, that they had spent the night in their own bed and that they definitely didn't sneak out, and 'what are you even implying?' Of course, theses students were old enough to cast notice-me-not spells, and as such, could have done exactly that and would not need to make excuses, but then, if they'd shut up, as everyone else wished they do, they wouldn't be asked about what they did at night and, more importantly, whom did they did it with.

  Between the Little Morning and the normal morning, was something, or rather someone, called Oliver Wood. He firmly believed that to keep ahead of the other Quidditch teams, he had to be literally ahead of them, and thus would summon the Gryffindors players at 6:30 a.m, the exact moment breakfast started to be served, because he had booked the Quidditch pitch at 7 a.m; and you can't start the day with a three hour Quidditch session on an empty stomach. And when his sleepy teammates lacked devotion to the team, he would personally remind the boys what accepting the job entailed to. He did not wake up the girls though, because he couldn't enter the girls dormitories without raising a loud alarm and waking everyone else. In Oliver's opinion, it was an acceptable solution until Professor McGonagall had to put her foot down, ultimately saving him from being hexed to death by a flock of angry Gryffindors. It was decided that Angelina Johnson would handle that part of the dormitory.

I'm currently wondering about the pacing: I want it to be slow, in order to build a mystery around the Chamber of Secret (despite everyone knowing two key elements already: Tom Riddle's diary and The Basilisk) but I am afraid if the plot advance too slowly, the story will become boring. I am therefore particularly interest of any feedback on the rhythm of the story, but any other kind of criticism is welcomed.

** What we need more are authors who can develop original plots, female Harry or not.

We already know what happened in canon. I don't need to have them rehashed ad nauseam. I would rather read JKR's original in that case.

*** Do you think I should trim out the firsts chapters and start the story straight to the point where new elements are developed? Back then I felt I had to make the characters live through the first year to build the background for what's to come later.

**** That's an option, you can still use what already happened in flashbacks, especially those that are different than in canon.

I highly recommend making things different in CoS:

- Someone else gets the Diary
- Actual students get killed
- Don't wait until the end of the Year to resolve the plot

Canon CoS plot is awful IMHO:

- A 13 years solved the plot in an entry level creature book whereas the entire staff was basically useless. It's really a worst manifestation of the “useless adults” trope in children's literature.
- Petrifications in Basilisk attacks are actually the exception. You need tons and tons of luck to have 6 petrifications instead of someone getting killed.
- Dumbledore knew Hagrid was innocent, and he should know where Myrtle was. Why didn't he ask her a few questions during the 50 years in between? The CoS plot would be instantly solved if Myrtle just answered how she died. I personally think it's another case of “useless adults” or “stupid characters” tropes.
- JKR had a habit of dragging the plot until the end of the school year. You are under no obligation to do that.
- Basilisks were extremely dangerous creatures. Just imagine how many would have died if that thing had gotten into the Great Hall during a Feast! Since Hogwarts was Magical Britain's ONLY school, the damage of that attack to its future could be worse compared to London hit by a megaton range nuke. If Dumbledore really cared about his students and was not a dumbed down plot device, he would identify Myrtle's killer as a Basilisk long time ago and take drastic steps immediately after the first attack.
- Basilisks had one huge Achilles heels: roosters. I expect Dumbledore to seed the entire Castle with roosters after the first attack.
- Entering the CoS itself required a Parselmouth, and that is where Harry was needed.

**** I think that one could do quite a lot with that story if they felt like it.

Indeed I played with concept once. Between the evil family relatives the creatures and dungeons involved you could create a unique crossover of that was how you wanted to spin it. It wouldn't be easy to blend but that would make it worth it I think.

*** The name is a direct inspiration, though I haven't really played the game and am mostly unaware of the game's plot; but when I started to write I had in mind the the picture of Aurora with her crown and sword, facing a castle. Listened to the soundrack a lot too.

  No knees to bend. No hands to beg. No voice to scream. No bones to crush. No mind to break. No heart to stop. No soul to die. Aurora Potter, surviving daughter of Lily and James is accepted at Hogwarts for seven years, while Voldemort is plotting is return.
