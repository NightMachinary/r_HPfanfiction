He seems to just vanish. Especially in Hogwards era FFs. I find this honestly strange. An author can dedicate an entire chapter to Hermione's homework but Harry visiting Hagrid even once is too much to ask? Do people just forget he exists?

Chillin' in his hut with Fang, too cool to be involved in your adolescent power and persecution fantasies and your overwrought romances. If you want to take a break from those as well, he might be willing to share some of the very special mushrooms from a patch in the Forbidden Forest that only he knows about; but do watch your dose, 'cause stuff that can get a half-giant high is some /very/ potent stuff.

** Hagrid, while a total bro, isn't very interesting in large doses outside of rare occasions.

A one-shot I once read of Hagrid adventuring with Harry and killing people with a brick comes to mind as an example where he was pretty great, but it /was/ a one-shot/short story.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** As others have said: it's the Chepstow accent.

Here's a [[http://rephrase.net/box/hagridizer/][Hagridizer]] in case you have need of one while writing a story.

***** With foreign accents, just pick one or two things about the accent that stand out the most and stick with them. Readers might not think it realistic, but they won't make a fuss if you're consistent.

Regional accents, on the other hand, are pure linguistic hell. Unless you speak it yourself or hear it on a daily basis, don't try it. Just don't.

** I usually try to fit him in, but I'm not really a fan of including a character just for the sake of including him, as I don't like pointless filler.

*** This. If a scene doesn't advance the plot, there's no reason to include it. I love Hagrid, but unless you're waiting for him to inadvertently drop important information, there's no real reason to have him in a scene.

** Hagrid in canon isn't really much of a character is he? He's usually just a glorified plot device, that throws the protagonists back on the right track so that they don't miss the story-train.
