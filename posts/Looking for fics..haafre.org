Massive AUs. Like The Skitterleap ,in which Grindelwald won the duel with Voldemort. And no Voldemort/Harry please.


** Have you read Pureblood Pretense? Alexandra Quick? Wastelands of Time?

*** I've read the first and the last. Was kinda looking for a Harry or his associates centric fic though. Will try Alexandra Quick though.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is a fic I'm currently writing. Basically Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't go all dark and become Lord Voldemort. He chose a slightly different path to achieve his goals. When he applied for the post of the DADA professor, Dumbledore thus happily chose him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, with McGonagall as Headmistress and Tom as Deputy Headmaster. Harry is beginning his first year. I think this should be a sufficiently /massive/ AU for your taste ;)

Do let me know how you find it!

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  Harry Potter is finally 17. Free to leave the Dursleys behind and start a new life as an independent wizard (if staying at Ron´s until he gets that apartment in London can be called independence, anyway), he does what any young man in possession of a good fortune would: he third-wheels and goes to a museum. It´s not really a bad plan. The Malfoys had announced they had made a big donation to the newly opened "Myths and Prophecies: Lord Voldemort´s secret collection": The Boy With The Green Eyes collection. All of it.
