The school can be canonical or original. No super Hadrian Jameson Slytherin or any of that please, and I would prefer a fic where Harry is unaware that he is the Boy-Who-Lived or a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fic, but just give me whatever you've got I guess- thanks :)


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]])

Doesn't match your criteria for Harry doesn't know who he is but definitely matches different school. The world building in this is outstanding.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author.

**** Irish Choice and It's My Life are essentially the same fic, I can't distinguish the two of them. Manipulative Dumbledore is my most guilty pleasure.

I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) is in the same vein. IIRC there are some offputting moments but it's overall pretty satisfying in the same way those two were.
