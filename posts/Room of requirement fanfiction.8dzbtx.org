Hi, I read a fanfic ages ago where Harry empties the Room of requirement and restores/sells all the stuff. He buys a warehouse to store it all in and hires a goblin to help, and a muggleborn woman I think. Any ideas what fanfic it is? It just popped back into my head and I can't find it anywhere! Thanks :)
