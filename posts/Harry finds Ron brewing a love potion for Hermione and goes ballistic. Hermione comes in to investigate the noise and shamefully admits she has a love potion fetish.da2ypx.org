** ''No! Harry stop, stop! I, I.. just have a love potion fetish..''

Harry immediately stops assaulting Ron, and completely dumbfounded asks ''What? A, a, a love potion fetish?! Hermione are you serious?!''

*** Hermione sighed, "Yes I'm serious, I get almost no pleasure without them..."

Harry, blushing, stuttered out, "H-how, W-why?"

Starting to get flustered herself, "I'm just never in the mood, Ron's idea of foreplay is a giant row, and that just doesn't do it for me. The potion helps me get in the mood, and helps me forget my tru-" She quickly cut herself off, her face turning redder than Ron's hair.

After a awkward moment, Harry got up the gumption to ask "Your true what?"

'M-my true... uh. True form..."

Harry fixed her with a piercing gaze, "really?"

"Uh... True fetish?"

At this point the sightly battered form of Ron interjected, "Then why did you tell me it was to dull your-" At this point he was silenced by a look from both Harry and Hermione that perfectly got across the point of "Please be silent sweetie, the parents are talking."

"Okay, fine, I am just not attracted to Ron in any romantic matter, I was hoping that the potions would allow me to transfer my sisterly and motherly love for him into a viable relationship..."

"But why are you doing this, Hermione?" asked Harry with not a small amount of concern.

"I am in love with someone who won't love me back."

It was with great conviction that Harry stated, "Anyone would be lucky to have you, If whoever it is doesn't notice you, he doesn't deserve you! Who is this idiot!"

As Hermione was struggling to make up a satisfactory answer, Ron reflected on how well his plan was working... A anonymous note sent to Harry, a small amount of a mild truth potion slipped into Hermione's morning coffee (How does she stand that stuff!) and maybe, finally, his friends might stop dancing around what they truly felt.

**** The fact that there is no "Greater good, gimme yo gold" or "momma's gonna have one big happy Weasley Family" reasons behind the love potions, and that Ron actually makes use of his strategic thinking outside of chess and quidditch, makes this much better! Would have loved to see what Hermione would have come up with for how/why she got a "love potion fetish" if she wasn't on some truth serum though.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-

"Yes, well, as you know, I... have a lot on my mind... a lot of the time,"

"Most if not all of the time." Both boys chimed in, correcting her.

"Quiet, both of you. But alright, I'll admit, it is /most/ of the time. But, well, Harry, the love potions... make me more focused. It's quite exillerating to have all of my focus on one thing, one person, and not have any stray thoughts about unrelated things..."

Ron decided to chime in again. "By unrelated, she means if it doesn't involve the target of the love potion, erm me, you know? Like last time she went onto a little rant about the pros and cons of adding a muggle condiment to the fun, for either, erm, side."

Hermione almost matched a tomato at that reminder. "I'll admit, it had its merit until I considered his eating habits."

"Oi!"

"So let me get this straight," Harr said as he looked between the two, "Hermione is doping on love potions because it lets her use all of her amazing brain power for one subject and train of thought?"

"Yes."

"Pretty much. Certainly better than having her suddenly remember she had an extra credit assignment to work on right in the middle of things, and next thing I know Mione is half way out the door mumbling about research and notes."

"Ron! I thought you said you'd stop bringing that up!"

"I did, with you. I figured Harry could use some extra context for why you got a love potion fetish."

Edit: if, not of. Also added linebeeak between comment and scene.

***** Some time in the future of Hogwarts-

---

''John? John, what is this? My dad never said about there being, a love potion reserve at Hogwarts?''

''Mary, sorry, got no idea'' he replied unfocused.

Mary had always that her boyfriend was always thinking about something else, so maybe this could help..

''John, take a sip, it's supposed to improve focus'' Of course he did as he was told, and probably thought it was focus for studies, not intercourse.

--Couple of nights after that--

''John, you- you were amazing this time! How did you become so good?''

''Oh, you see, this love potion it makes me concentrate on the important things..''
