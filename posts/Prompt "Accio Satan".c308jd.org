Umm, that's the wrong kind of summoning.... Wait, it worked?


** Note : Forgot to read the line about the kind of summoning . Hope you enjoy regardless

Not for the first time,the Fourth Year Ravenclaw's dormitory was in chaos. One of the occupants was currently on his bed sniffling as two of the others tried their hand to make him stop so they could all go to sleep. " N-n-now I'm sure she's not gone far " stammered Anthony Goldstein as Oliver Rivers nodded his head at such a pace he resembled a five year old trying to appease a hated great aunt in order to reap a fresh twenty pound note.

" No " sobbed Stephen Cornfoot " Something must have happened to her,I've not seen her in three days " The fact that Stephen was sobbing over his beloved pet stood in sharp contrast to his multiple ear piercings and blond hair that looked as though his barber was Edward Scissorhands high on acid. " Weeelllll.... " Oliver began before the words died in his throat before they were born.

There was a familiar sound of stampeding up the spiral staircase before the other three boys who slept there burst into the room with red faces " Davies is working the team like mules " moaned Terry Boot. " You're not on the bloody team " growled Kevin Entwhistle " I feel a sense of empathy towards ye,Quiditch isn't even on this year and he insists on bi-monthly intense practices so you don't fall out of practice "

" Count yourself lucky you're aren't on the team " Michael Corner huffed " Roger spent the entirety of changing talking about how he's going with the Veela girl to the Ball and asking us who we're going with. On that note we gotta find out a way to hook Kevin and Susan Bones " he gave his fellow Chaser a glare. " It just slipped out " said Kevin defensively,he noticed his friend " Why are you crying Stephen "

" Satan's missing " wailed the Weird Sisters loving boy. " Probably having a whirlwind romance with Granger's abomination " said Terry with a laugh before he wilted under the force of five glares " What measures have you taken to find her " asked Anthony in an attempt at tenderness " Well,I asked every teacher,everyone in our house,I tried to ask Hermione but I forgot about the stairs to the girls dorms. I printed out posters and stuck them all over the castle,on the Beauxbatons carriages,the Durmstang ship and one on Crabbe' s back and he still hasn't noticed "

Michael took a deep breathe and exhaled " Have you tried to Summon her " His roommates looked at him as though he had announced he was heir to the four founders and was marrying Daphne Greengrass . Michael smirked " And you all say I don't belong in this house " he laughed with a faint trace of bitterness . " Alright lads,wands out and repeat after me ; Accio Satan ! "

Everyone made awkward scenes of grabbing their wands before lining up at the foot of the stairs " Accio Satan " they chorused . Nothing happened for a short while and a low sob escaped Stephen's lips. Suddenly the sounds of commotion could be heard in the Common Room below as girls and boys shrieked and ducked to avoid a furry projectile rocketing through the air. The boy's quarry then came shooting up the stairs and struck her owner in the face knocking him onto his backside " Satan,oh girl I've missed.... " he gaped at the sight of his precious cat .

The normally tatty black feline had been washed and groomed so much she looked severely traumatised . She had been forced into a tiny blue dress that looked as though it cost hundreds of galleons . Oliver took a sniff " She definitely smells French " Kevin fell over clutching his sides" The Frenchie girls had her all along " Five of the boys were in stitches as Stephen turned red.

Michael recovered enough to smirk again " Now,do my Ancient Runes essays until the New Year and I won't tell my cousin Megan about you being a big sappy crybaby "

Stephen nodded fearfully
