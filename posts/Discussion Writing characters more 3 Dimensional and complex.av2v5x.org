Hello everyone! So back; again, I posted a thread where I stated that people should write Sirius in a more believable way, I got some mixed views on that thread, and I think that it was mostly the way that I worded my statement.

It is true that it's fanfiction, and people can write however they want to write the characters, but I thought this thread could be a way to help people write more complex characters (If they wanted too).

One of the first things I feel, is that they should write down three to four, maybe even five or six, personality traits that a canon person has.

If we see how a person acts as a kid, and then as an adult; we should try and incorporate that as best as we could. We are no JKRowling, and fanfiction is suppose to be more fun and free; but if you're someone like me, who wants more complexity with the characters when we read about them, this is just an idea.

How would a character act in one situation, compared to a completely other situation? Is your story AU? If your story is AU, your characters are bound to be out of character, but how out of character should they be? These are questions that I feel we should ask ourselves, if we want to write more complex characters.

If anyone else has any ideas of how to write more complex characters. (If they want too), feel free to post down below!


** I'm a big advocate of showing rather than telling and making sure your main characters actually change/react/evolve in your story. And don't bury these changes in walls of expository internal thoughts. Actually show them changing through their actions and conversations.

People are formed by how they were raised but they change/evolve as they experience new things. Characters that are fully explained/formed in the first chapter with no change in attitudes/behavior or that do a complete 180 based on one story beat/revelation aren't realistic. Humans don't work that way.

** I think one of the things that tends to foster 1-dimensional fan fiction characters is the very love that writers have for them. New writers love Harry or Hermione or whoever and don't want to give them flaws, but by making them perfect, they doom their story. Good characters need flaws and things to overcome and learn from, but some writers just don't want to be "mean" to the characters they know so well and love.

** Write characters as /people./ People have goals. They work towards those goals the best they know how. In other words, they are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][intelligent.]] They do not hold Idiot Balls; they do not work in service of the plot. Plot arises from conflicts between characters, their goals, and the actions they take to get to those goals.

*** Do you? You don't have to look at them if you don't like them. Most of the posts in this sub are about Harry. Every single day. I'll agree with you that there are too many of /them/, but that's what the hide button is for isn't it? Sometimes I can hardly click it fast enough.

In any case I can't see how your comment is relevant to the OP.
