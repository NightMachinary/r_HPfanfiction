  The death of Sirius Black has a much more profound effect on Harry, resulting in him taking his training seriously in preparation for the war to come. Who knew that a single summer was all it would take to turn Harry into one of the most dangerous contenders in the war. Grey not Dark HarryxHarem. Post OOTP. Major AU and Character Death eventually.

  What if Usagi had finally decided enough was enough? Between the jabs and the lame excuses on problems going on involving not only Mamoru but Chibi Usa as well, Usagi has had enough and hits her breaking point. Now the girls must realize their own individual faults in the conflict and rise together to show Usagi that she is the glue that holds them together.
