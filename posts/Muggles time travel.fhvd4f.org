Harry finds instructions on the marauders map to find the time room. Upon further investigation he discovers that the marauders left a time capsual over their seven years at hogwarts. The story would have Harry reading and looking through all the stuff they left and everything he learns of his parents, good and bad. At the end Harry decides to record his own life so far and add it to the capsual with a note for anybody who finds it to discover and leave something more behind. The marauders map is left in strange places all over Hogwarts for people to find, reveal and discover the time room. It eventually holds centuries of history detailing thi gs about ordinary peoples lives.
