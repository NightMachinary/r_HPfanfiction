*** I am trying to gauge what it is I need to say here to actually get a positive response. To get myself out of being stalked and downvoted on every post. So, I am trying a variety of topics and titles, most of which come from what other posts I've seen around here getting upvoted. I figured why not try them for myself? See if they work.

**** A lot of being upvoted or downvoted also had a lot to do with the time of day you post. Posting at night, when the majority of people won't see your comment till the morning, if at all isn't gonna get you any comments or views. The question also has to be somewhat unique and can't have come up recently. You recycling past questions and topics isn't gaining you any favours. Ask for what you actually want, someone else is bound to want the same thing.

**** Ask what you're genuinely interested in. If I see requests I have good fics for, I answer. It's that simple. It doesn't matter how it's worded.

It's harsh that someone's harassing you, and if you feel it's genuinely something personal, just make an alt. It's reddit, so it's not like you're actually losing anything.
