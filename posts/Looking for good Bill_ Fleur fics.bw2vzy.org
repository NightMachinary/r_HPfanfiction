I'm hoping to find some good reads with the two of them as the main characters and hopefully about how they got together. Preferably canon compliant, but I'm not picky.

*** Actually, I recently did some canon research on Fleur and Bill, and I gotta say Fleur is not rude enough in this fic. I'm adding on to request Fleur/Bill fics where the author spent some time on her canon characterization.

From this comment: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/alg9nd/what_do_you_want_to_see_from_fleur_in_fanfics/efdspve/]]

"The word Veela should appear a maximum of one (1) time.

She should be a bit of a bitch but capable of surprising kindness.

She should be glamorous yet surprisingly down to earth."
