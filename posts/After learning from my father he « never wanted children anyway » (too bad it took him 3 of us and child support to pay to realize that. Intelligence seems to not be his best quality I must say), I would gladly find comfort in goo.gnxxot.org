Preferably ones where he gets his due. I like longer fic but short ones are welcome too.

My restrictions are : - correctly written - no mention of rape or if there is, it must be correctly executed (not a tool to make us pity a female character to be saved by someone else later/ show ultimate evil of someone ; but something mattering to the fiction in itself) - female characters must be correctly written (like you would write a male one, no “her boobs were boobily boobing when doing xxx, and Harry realized she was in fact a true women” (- he could begin to objectify like the pig he appeared to be - I am in fact, a bit angry as you can see)).

I do not care about : sexual orientation, sex, race, gender, transness, disability, as long as characters are not reduced to a stereotype of their characteristic. Ah and also I don't care about snape in one way or another, so severitus or snape bashing are fine. And I'm also okay with incomplete fics.

I think that's all. Thanking you all in advance !

*** Thanks ! I'm already reading it, and I truly love it. I'll try to let a review, I really enjoy the author way to flirt with a Gary Sue without doing one (IMO) and how he/she does the cliffhanger/turn around the plot.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** First one that springs to mind is linkffn(A Well Groomed Mind), although it's incomplete, and a very small part of the overall story.

*** Ah yes, my favorite FanFiction ever. I so hope it could be finished one day. I go back to read it from time to time, maybe I could seek it out. Although, personally, I tend to read it when I need a “push” in being studious. I'm not sure it could quite correctly satisfy my need for bashing. Thanks anyway, it's always sweet to know other people do see what I see in this fic.

***** Well, yes, but I feel like the main plot revolve around resolving his mind issue and the manipulation he's going through (I hope the spoiler worked) There isn't a lot of Bad/stupid bashed character getting owned in the end, and that's what I seek at the moment.
