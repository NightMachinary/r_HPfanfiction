*** Fwiw that didn't sound good to me either, sorry. Sadly, I was not naturally born with the tongue of a sailor. Also, for whatever reason, my rants always lean a bit too close towards pathetic mess, when I'd like them to seem more like whimsy. When I rant, I try to do so without much of a filter or editing process. I like the authenticity that comes with that, but am still struggling to minimize the accompanying downsides. Advice from expert swearers highly welcome, here. How do I keep the first draft nature of a good rant while not seeming amateurish? So far, the only thing I can think to do about it is practice. Unfortunately, I still seem to need a lot more of it.

** Fanfiction is free. Fanfiction is usually written by young teens. Fanfiction is usually a hobby rather than a serious endeavour.

You cannot expect the majority to be quality. You just can't. If you want something high quality you have to pay for it. Offering constructive criticism can be helpful and welcomed, but raging because the huge amount of free content available to you is not to your taste is childish. It is downright rude to come to this community and say that the content recommended here is garbage.

** Well, "an appropriately scathing review" and "specific constructive criticism" do not go together. At all. If you want to offer constructive criticism, aka help the author, insulting him or her is just about the worst thing you can do since that will ensure that your criticism will not be taken seriously or discarded outright.

Want to improve the quality of fics? Stop insulting authors.

Also, you might consider that authors improve over time. Insulting them means you might drive them to stop writing instead of improving.

Of course most of them are going to be terrible writers, and have terrible taste in reading material, too. However, insulting them isn't a productive way of trying to improve their skills or taste. Just hit the back button if you find a terrible fic, and work on improving your own threshing skills.

******* While I enjoy both offering and receiving some, shall I say "flavor" in reviews, I largely agree with that sentiment. That FFN is not really the place to look for that kind of critique is another matter.

And to answer the OP's question, what it says about the fandom is that it's not immune to Sturgeon's Law. Actually, FFN is a pretty good representation of the fandom in my opinion: most fics are just blergh, but there are some decent ones. And, once in a while, you'll find a real gem.

****** Exactly. It's a hobby to many, and a hobby that they may not approach in the way I do. There are also many different types of reviews. I don't mind a one-word review, nor am I asking for a beta after publication. I, myself, don't fall into the camp of feeling it is necessary to point out errors. If I see something glaring, say a typo that adds an embarrassing meaning, I might PM that, understanding that I don't find my skills superior. I am not anyone's Good Samaritan here. Some do believe criticism is essential, for I have read reviews in which the reviewer apologizes for finding no real fault. I confess I don't "get it." Sending a review you would, as the reviewer, consider scathing isn't useful, for many writers cringe at those that point out errors even when it's done kindly. I would consider it akin to telling someone they look fat in hopes that it would make them get skinny---regardless if thinness were a goal of theirs.

** I don't think you're going to find the support for your action here. Hitting the back button, if you don't like the story, is easy and doesn't hurt anybody.\\
Leaving a "scathing review" is an easy thing for you to do, but can hurt the author. You should treat others the way you want to be treated. There is no need to be mean. If there were positive reviews...then that means that there are people out there who enjoyed the story. Just because you didn't like the story, doesn't mean that everybody else should hate the story too.\\
I just do not appreciate your attitude. We don't all have the same taste and you need to understand that. Please be aware that the person you're reviewing also has feelings and try to be more considerate next time.

*** If I say something dumb, or believe something offensive, I would want that brought to my attention. If I leave a negative review, that /is/ me treating others the way I'd like to be treated. I beat myself up all the time, and on the whole I think I'm a better person for it. There are times when a slap in the face can wake people up. I'm not looking to make anyone feel terrible about themselves, it's more like I'm hoping to make people strengthen the good aspects of themselves and weaken the bad ones. In addition, I think expressing frustration in this way might be healthier than always ignoring a persistently mounting feeling of discontent. Being mean shouldn't become a habit, but I think it happens for a reason and trying to eliminate it from my behaviors entirely would be a bad idea. It offers a way for me to affirm my sense of self and values and worldview and opinions, I think. Boosting those seems healthy, as long as I don't become dependent on disdain and grow to express it even in situations where it is unwarranted.

As I mentioned earlier, a "scathing review" does not point toward constructive criticism. It sounds more like you tore that author a new hole. (excuse my crudeness)

I believe you're getting a backlash on this post because of your word choices. I'm sure people don't mind constructive criticism, but from the way you worded your original post it doesn't sound friendly.

** FF.net has been like that from the beginning. When it first emerged it was considered as trash by fanfiction communities. It was a place to host fics after you stopped caring about editing them. It was a place for yes men and the almost universally bad writers who lapped it up. It was never considered a good source of critical feedback.

Email mailing lists, forums, irc, and sharing stories with trusted fellow writers and betas were the main methods of sourcing constructive criticism. I don't know of any fanfiction mailing lists that are still around, but everything else is.

When it comes to finding quality fics and discussion I'd recommend checking out DLP's Library subforum (disclaimer: I'm a DLP mod). Don't bother with anything pre-2009 though. Tastes and standards have changed since then.

** It perpetuates itself. Like someone will recommend HP & the Summer of Change (in 2016) and pass it off as a good story, and someone who hasn't been around fanfiction that long will get suckered in. And then someone writes a story with friendly!goblins, a custom double-core wand, a magical animagus form, and elemental powers, and then they get reviews saying how good the story is, perpetuating the problem. It's like they haven't been exposed to actual good stories, like By the Divining Light, The Unforgiving Minute, or Ectomancer.

Some people just don't know better, and some people don't care. There's people who will read every single Harry/Daphne story and somehow derive enjoyment from them despite there actually only being three different storylines in a thousand identical fics.

There's also the people who pretend to have standards, yet still read shit stories under the pretense of "guilty pleasure". It's like knowing smoking is bad, but still doing it anyways because you need your fix, but it's still perpetuating the problem.

I also think some people see a highly rated fic, and automatically assume it's good regardless of actual content (I'm looking at you, Poison Pen). It's pretty much just the "mainstream" effect in fanfiction, and you see this a lot when it comes to certain pairings, with whole forums dedicated to just Harry/Ginny, and that bleeds over into other places and perpetuates the problem.

And then there's all the people who legit can't tell a good story from a bad, like people who think Twilight is better than Lord of the Rings. There's not much you can do about that, sadly.

Not sure if my review is visible yet, or didn't go through, or what. I'm on mobile right now, and nothing ever seems to work properly for me when so. The review was a rant as well, but hopefully it is up and can add a bit more context to this complaint for you.

Premise is fine, but the characters are self victimizing Sue's. As someone who struggles with anxiety issues, and various other difficulties, I can promise you the author's pandering, indulgent attitude on them is extremely unhealthy. They've romanticized the shittiness, and gleefully wallow in sorrow and marginalization when they should be trying to overcome it. It's about attention for people like that, and they make me ashamed to share a diagnosis with them.

In addition to the above, it's also torturously paced (slower than molasses in the Arctic), and my interest in it waned after the romantic tension of Yule Ball Panic petered out. What replaced it was... meh. A fairly standard HHr plot with melodrama and lesbians. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love Femslash, but... goddamn, this fic bored me stiff by being so predictable.
