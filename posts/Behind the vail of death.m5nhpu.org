:END:
Hello! I'm looking for a fic I've read many years ago.

In which while in the department of mystery's battle I think harry remembers what happened in the future or I think after he dies from the killing curse in the forbidden forest he wakes up in the middle of the battle in the department.

He fights tooth and nail to not let sirius die and in the process he himself fall through the vail, he meets lily and james there and they talk for a bit then they help him go back to the world of living.

He then wears the invisibility clock and pretended to be dead for the year.

He then go to chase the horucoxs and pretending to be another person and send hints to his friends and remus and sirius -who is now innocent- that he is alive

He even asks sirius for help to get to bellatrixs vult

A lot of things happen and I remember bit of them and I really want to read it again..

If you know of it.. even just the name, please let me know

** Off-topic but I read your sentence as "He even asks sirius for help to get to bellatrix vulva"
