*** Maybe they meant "AU where Padma dies at the beginning of book two."

Seems like an odd choice though.

** Wrong sub, but let me abuse this reply to suggest the story I like, but feels like very undervalues (and yes it is unfinished, but it is for better I think) “Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers” linkffn(11858501).

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.
