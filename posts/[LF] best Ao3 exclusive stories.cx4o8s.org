#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** It's not complete (so only 72k words so far), but I really feel like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/chapters/36865599][The Fire that Swallowed the World]] deserves a spot on any list of amazing ao3 fics. It's fem!harry with no pairing this far (at least as of my last reading), and the writing is absolutely superb and mind bending. Essentially, this story involves Harry dying and being possessed by a fire elemental, so the whole story is written from a rather non-human perspective that's very interesting.

** While there are a lot of ao3 fics that I've enjoyed, most have been on the shorter side. Three fit your qualifications, though.

!linkao3(Child of Azkaban)

Lily and James put protective magic on Harry to help keep him safe lest he be taken. If he was put with someone who hurt him, then he would be automatically taken to the next guardian on the list. So, when the Dursleys are less than kind to Harry, he winds up in the care of Sirius Black... In Azkaban.

!linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus)

A post-canon fic where Tonks was never interested in Lupin and survived the Battle of Hogwarts. Pretty smut-heavy, but doesn't suffer for it.

!linkao3(Runic War Warding)

The pairing on this one is something most people find offputting, though I consider the fic to be a huge guilty pleasure. fem!Harry is reasonably developed into her own character separate from canon Harry, and thus fic has one of the best-written Snapes I have ever read.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
