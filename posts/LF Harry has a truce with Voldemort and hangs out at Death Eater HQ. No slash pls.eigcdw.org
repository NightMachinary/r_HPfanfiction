** Recommendation is when you want to recommend a fic. Your flair should be Request, I believe.

I'm reading a relatively interesting one called A Bitter Hug of Mortality atm. Harry does a lot of dead things and is kind of less scared of Voldemort than most people would be. They're not friendly though, just on a truce.

** linkao3(We'll Play in Shadows by SelectiveSilence) is short (I assume on some sort of hiatus), but the second chapter has Harry making a truce with Voldemort. This one might be edging on breaking your no slash rule (there's a relationship between Charlie Weasley and Harry Potter, though nothing in detail -- it's mainly to set a reason to go to Voldemort). The author planned to eventually set up a relationship between HP and Voldemort, but it hasn't happened yet.

This one is the only one I can think of right not, so I'm sorry if it's not what you wanted. I'll try to find some others because I know I've read them, I just can't remember what they're called.
