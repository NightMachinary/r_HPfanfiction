I love the pairing and have a hard time finding any that are more than just a one shot. So, suggest your favorites if you would! Can be post war, pre war, Hogwarts era (tonks can even be aged down or Harry up). Teddy would be great but not necessary.


** linkffn(Barefoot)... more or less.

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
