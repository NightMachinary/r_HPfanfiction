Based on a comment from the pet peeve thread, from something [[/u/Mel966]] said about how he's usually portrayed as a loser on unequal footing to the rest, but I want to see a fix where they all mesh together and it's not just Moody, Prongs and Padfoot. I haven't read anything new in this fandom since maybe 2009, so there's a lot I don't know about.


** If you're okay with some Sirius/Remus (in the later chapters), [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] portrays Peter pretty sympathetically. He's written as that one kid in a group of friends that everyone's friends with, but nobody's /best/ friends with.

Edit to address the "unequal footing" thing. I get that the pet peeve is based on fics where Peter has no virtues or talents whatsoever, but there is precedent that he was neither as talented nor as popular as Sirius and James (McGonagall, book 3: "[Peter] hero-worshipped Black and Potter. Never quite in their league, talent-wise."), so to some extent there is always going to be some sort of imbalance.

*** Thanks! I think my wording wasn't exactly correct. I was thinking more along the lines of how Peter is disdained and bullied constantly, or how he's a complete moron with no redeemable qualities, or sometimes completely ignored by writers because they don't want to write him! I think everyone has supplied great recommendations and I'm going to be busy reading them all!

** I commented on that pet peeve thread as well, but I feel I should throw it out there again: MarauderLover7's stuff ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/]]) is good for Peter, I think. All of his/her stories mention Peter in some way/shape/form, but he features most prominently in these:

Furry Little Problem is when Lupins secret is uncovered, and it's how the Marauders react/confront him. Peter's not as accepting of it as Sirius and James, but he's still Lupin's friend, so he's willing to try.

Defining Moments is set around the whole Sirius-sends-Snape-after-Lupin thing from fifth? sixth? year, and Peter gets a whole chapter to himself, and cameos in other chapters. It sets up him wanting to stand out from his friends, but it's cool to see his POV.

White Flags is set in the Marauders' seventh year and has Peter featuring quite regularly. He's already dabbling in Death Eater things, which is interesting, but the author doesn't (seem to) hate him, and doesn't turn him into a complete villain or ignore him, which is a nice change.

Dark Days is set during the war (near Harry's first birthday I think?) and Peter has a whole chapter in that as well. That chapter has literally become my Peter Pettigrew headcanon because it really captures the reasons behind his decision to join the death eaters, and it made me understand him, and even feel sorry for him... and this is Wormtail we're talking about, who, aside from Umbridge, is probably the hardest character to sympathise with. It also has chapters from James and Sirius' POVs and their thoughts on Peter show him on a more equal footing with them. I distinctly remember a part about Sirius thinking Peter was brave.

Innocent isn't a Marauder era fic, but it's definitely worth a read if you don't mind AU and rather slow pace (it's at 400k words, and Harry's not even at Hogwarts) but Peter crops up as a minor character every now and then. He's definitely a bit more of a bad-guy in this, but he's not demonised, and there was this really chilling scene in there, where he's at Lily and James' graves, but I can't remember what chapter, sorry.

Also, Abide The Sleeper, by Furiosity and Imadra Blue ([[http://www.bigbang.inkubation.net/sleeper.html]]) is a good one that looks at Peter's character, set during the second wizarding war. It's a Harry/Draco fic (slash might not be your thing) but it's definitely worth a read, if only for the Peter parts. This is the best interpretation I've seen of him in the 'later' years.

** I can remember a fic (it was probably a Lily/James fic) that I read where James and Lupin and Sirius had a huge row over Sirius' leading Snape to see Lupin as a werewolf (I remember James yelling at Sirius because he hadn't even thought about what it would do to Lupin and his sanity if Snape had been killed) and in the aftermath of the fight, Peter acted as a tentative peacemaker, like the go-to between the parties that wouldn't speak to each other. I'm trying really hard to find this story, but I can't remember its title.
