** Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort

Probably Ron & Hermione, but I think it's possible for people to know Harry has 2 friends, a boy and a girl, without remembering their names.

Maybe: Voldemort, Dumbledore, Hedwig (only by appearance, not name)

Just maybe: Hagrid, Hermione, Snape, Dobby, Ron

**** Actually only how they looked like xD

Sometimes the movies were on TV so I saw them then for a few moments.

And I guess someone spoiled me in some unrelated YouTube video how much they loved Snape. So I thought he's all good - was a bit dissapointed then. Same thing with Draco.

In retrospect I probably also 'knew' Dumbledore too, as Hedwig.

** Severus Snape, Voldemort and Draco Malfoy.

They left a greater impact than the main character in my opinion.

To be fair, I firmly believe Harry is a little shit who really is only alive because of dues ex machina. He's a quite embarrassing protagonist. It's like he's meant to be OP but doesn't know it.
