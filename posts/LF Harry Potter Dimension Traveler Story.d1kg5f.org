James and Sirius are policemen, and they are trying to bring down Voldemort who is either a terrorist or a drug lord. Also in the story harry lives in a hotel and is an alcoholic. Thank You in advance, if you need any more info let me know


** Hello. Unfortunately I do not know that fic.

However, I wanted to advise you, as you seem to have used the wrong flair.

The correct flair for this request is: "What's that fic?"

Thank you for understanding and I hope you will find what you are looking for.

  Part of the Wanderer!verse. Prequel to Wanderer. The fifteenth jump lands him in a place so much like the home he has always wanted that he just can't stay away, even though he knows it'll hurt all the more in the end.
