I think this can happen easily. Actually, scratch that. I think that is what happens mostly. Seeing that most fanfic writers are amateurs at best.

linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)

This supposed /realistic/ portrayal of Soul Bond just made both of the bonded huge pricks. [minor spoilers] Especially Ginny. Like, Ginny feels almost no sympathy for the terrible home life Harry has, and is a complete hypocrite. I couldn't even get past two chapters. Give me a cliche "starts having sex the very next minute after bonding" fanfic any day of the week instead of this "realistic" crap.

Have you ever had an experience like this?


** To begin with, if the premise of your fiction is that I need to be familiar with bad stories and/or stories devices to appreciate the work then it have none intrinsic value. Being contrarian is not good writing (nor is it original).

*** Hard disagree. There is immense value in well-executed contrarianism.

I also really appreciate authors who understand that their audience is mostly people who have read many (often /very/ many) HP fanfics already. That allows for little in-jokes and nods to other popular stories or bits of fanon, and it allows authors to save time by not rehashing stuff we all know already.

**** Precisely. It's like slipping in a joke in a powerful!Harry fanfiction, however original, that you've got to have at least one obligatory Gringotts visit. You just have to. If you acknowledge that trope and either call it out, lampshade it, or subtly reference it, it makes for a nice in-joke for the well-versed reader while not spoiling it for others.

I agree though in a way with the OP, it requires a lot of skill to actually be original when there are (checks) 777,000+ fan works on fanfiction.net alone, so everything has /probably/ already been done. And the brutal truth is that many fanfiction writers are amateurs, and many of them wouldn't know subtlety if it hit them over the head with a sledgehammer.

My favorite version of this that I read recently was a fic in which Daphne Greengrass was portrayed as this socially-awkward weirdo who had an unusual fascination with turtles. Since there's no canon characterization of Daphne, there's no reason she couldn't be... that.

Taken on its own, it's a funny little thing showing that even in the magical world, there's always that one weird kid at school. It just so happens that this weird kid is a Slytherin named Daphne.

But it's obviously also a joke written in reaction to the whole "Ice Princess" trope.

The thing that was great about it was that it didn't beat the reader over the head with anything. It could stand on its own without taking you out of the story. It didn't have any of that cringey turn-to-the-camera-and-wink shit that so many fanfic authors do.

** I figured that was the point.

If you could hear all of my thoughts, at all times. You would 100% think I was a judgemental prick.

No one is perfect in the depths of their own minds. To that end, it was an entirely believable story.

**** For you. Personally I enjoy realism, at least how it's done in this story, which I had not heard of before. It's refreshing. I am puzzled about why you are attempting to make absolutist claims about creative work, which always has an element of personal subjective taste to it. And especially in fanfic, where a big part of the point is having room to create and explore without any pressures to make something that is "sellable" /mass marketable.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
