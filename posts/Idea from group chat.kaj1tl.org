Petunia finds one of Harry's Homework text's over the summer between 5th->6th year and points out to Harry that he can't even write proper Latin.

She corrects them.

She learned it because she thought it would allow her to do magic like her sister who she heard through the walls.

Harry dismisses her initially but when he sees the modification in the Half-blood-Prince's potion book he starts to experiment with what her aunt told her about starting to pronounce spells in correct Latin etc


** Ooh, I like this. I've read something where Petunia wanted to be a Muggle Teacher after she couldn't be a witch, but Dudley and Vernon happened and then Lily died and her life got wrecked. She found an essay out in the open about "Why 4 out of 5 DADA Professor's recommend killing HP" or something. She didn't know anything that was going on, and nothing about magic. But she corrected a ton of his grammar and stuff. HP became an Assistant Prof or something for his sixth year.... I can't remember the name.

#+begin_quote
  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.
