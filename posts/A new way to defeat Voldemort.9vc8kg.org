Why not ignore the Horcruxes and blast him with an obliviate a la Lockhart? Get a harmless dark lord you can lock up in a mental ward for eternity?


** There'd probably wind up being some generic "Oh he has strong Occlumency so he protected his memories" excuse like Fanfiction sometimes uses. Though I swear I've seen this before. In that fic where Gilderoy Lockhart raies Harry, Voldemort gets obliviated and is basically rendered harmless.

** I was always curious about that myself.

Obliviate is a 1 hit kill spell that doesn't kill. I have no idea why the light side doesn't make extensive use of it against people who throw killing curses around.

Because killing is more humane than erasing someone's entire personality, turning them into a drooling husk and then locking them up for a few decades.

****** Fair point, but I'm sure there are some people that wouldn't. Would DH Neville feel bad if he did that to Bellatrix? It'd feel like Justice for his Parents, wouldn't it? It's circumstancial, I suppose. If someone had killed my loved ones, I'd want them to die or suffer and think Prison wasn't nearly enough, so I could probably rationalise it on them, but would feel inhumane if i did it to Generic Death Eater #12. It'd only be for the Worst of the Worst (Umbridge for the Concentration Camps, Bellatrix for the Longbottoms and everything since, Voldemort for being behind it all) As they got rid of the Dementors, it'd at least guarantee they didn't escape Azkaban.

******* That's the problem with the series. It's too black and white.

Most of the villains are evil for no real reason. JKR stops one step short of saying Umbridge was born evil. Voldemort was apparently irredeemable before he even became a teenager. Bellatrix fulfilled the insane blood purist Black stereotype for her generation.

According to whom, the guys that use dementor radiation/kisses as default (and almost the only) forms of punishment?

Also, I don't agree with your statement even without the canon setting's context. Lockhart became a vegetable because the spell misfired, so I don't see why the “lights” couldn't erase specific things (e.g. magic-related knowledge, personality traits, etc) and then brainwash/re-educate the target into a new person.

A better argument would've been that it takes too much time and concentration for an Obliviate to be a practical choice in the middle of a fight. Or that the Death Eaters could be storing encrypted memory backups with people they trusted.

*** Who says you can't restore the mind (or that potential for evil isn't still there? - Yes: Nature versus nurture...sorry, we don't know because we have never made a truly evil person a blank slate, we don't know how yet!) - dark rituals (something no normal healer would try, but the DEs would, they kind of need Voldemort because they themselves can't fight Dumbledore), sacrifices (again: No healer would do that, unless threatened ("I'll kill your family if you don't perform this sacrificial healing ritual!") or under the imperius!) etc.

​

Still you can try and lock the guy up (heavy guard, a fidelius etc.) while you have decades to look for the horcruxes and for hunting the DEs down :D

** Not in canon, since canon Horcruxes keep independent memories. At least the diary had the memories of 16 year old Tom Riddle, not of Voldemort later on. That said, there's honestly no reason not to Obliviate or kill Voldy while he still has Horcruxes, and then destroy them afterwards.

Resulting in a Quirrel-Mort like situation, where it's Lockhart instead of Quirrel, and neither of them know anything. Lockhart may have renamed Voldemort Bob.

******* It depends on how Horcruxes work, and if the Diary is a weird exception. Are Horcruxes more like backups, that preserve the mind-state of the creator at the time of creation? Or are they anchors, that keep the "main" soul/mind from moving on?

The diary /seems/ to be the former, but if that were true you would expect one of the Horcruxes to be "used up" after Halloween 1981, as the soul bit inside it instead /becomes/ the wraith, who then goes to Albania, possesses Quirrel, etc. It doesn't fit with the rest of the facts. The latter option ultimately has more explanatory power.
