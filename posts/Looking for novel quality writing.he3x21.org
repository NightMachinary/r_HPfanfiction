I just finished binge reading the Alexandra Quick series and now every time I try starting a new fanfic I struggle to get into it. I don't know if I've just read all the good stuff or I'm crap at finding new fics with high quality writing. So, Reddit, please send me all of your most well written fics. I don't care what the story is about as long as it's in the Harry Potter world and it feels like it's been run through critical editors. I do like series that are broken into books but I'll take what I can get in these quarantined times. Thanks!


** May I recommend the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/James_Potter_(series][James Potter Series]])? It's a next-gen saga, featuring James, Albus, Rose, Ted, Scorpius, and new OC friends. It spans 5 books (well, technically 6, if you include the spinoff). The author does a good job in emulating Rowling's narrative, so the books feel natural, like part of the actual canon. Kinda the same feeling Inverarity's writing gives.

The books are the following:

1. [[http://thebritishchef.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/1/9/37191983/james_potter_and_the_hall_of_elders_crossing.pdf][The Hall of Elders' Crossing]]

   1. [[http://thebritishchef.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/1/9/37191983/james_pottere_and_the_curse_of_the_gatekeeper.pdf][The Curse of the Gatekeeper]]
   2. [[http://thebritishchef.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/1/9/37191983/james_potter_and_the_vault_of_destinies.pdf][The Vault of Destinies]]
   3. [[http://thebritishchef.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/1/9/37191983/james_potter_and_the_morrigan_web.pdf][The Morrigan Web]]
   4. [[http://docplayer.net/140100066-James-potter-and-the-crimson-thread.html][The Crimson Thread]]

2.5 [[https://b-ok.lat/book/1782560/14a5cb][The Girl on the Dock]] is a short story that does a little bit of character development for one of the main character of the books, and servers as a preamble for book 3. I guess it's not really necessary to understand the rest of the story, but I recommend you read it anyway. You'll have to download this one in Epub, since the site doesn't allow PDF visualization unless you log in.

All the books used to be hosted on the author's website and could be read in PDF or Epub, but it seems like the website with all its contents has been taken down, hence the different links for each one. Sorry about that.

** The Changeling has already been mentioned, so I'd like to recomment Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian. He wrote loads of good post Hogwarts stories and all of them work together to build a consistent post Hogwarts world, which is Headcanon for me. I also enjoy his excellent writing of minor characters, such as his Lavender Brown and Hannah Abbot.

linkao3(1623053)

Tales of The battle is also a good one to start, it is a collection of oneshots set during the battle from different perspectives.

Anything by the Divine Comedian is wonderful as well. I would recommend starting with Blackpool. linkao3(14760663)

I also liked Blood Crest linkao3(22022296) and before the door of hell lamps burned ao3(22220911) in terms of quality writing.

When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

** [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

Scroll down to "Harry/Hermione, Draco/Luna, Neville/Ginny, others"

You'll find two stories: Sunrise Over Britain and Sunset Over Britain. They are listed in the correct alphabetical order but you will need to read Sunset first.

This pair of stories, together, may be the finest novel+ length HP work out there.

*** Claw of the Raven wasn't great.

The writing technique was okay, but the story was incredibly flat. It rehashed Book1 but cuts literally all the exciting scenes, and it favors Lord Hadrian noble-speak exposition.

I'm not sure if Knees of the Mauraders is better, but I'd start there anyway.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
