The boggart scene in PoA is honestly one of my least favourite scenes in the series. The fact that only Harry and Neville have more ‘serious' fears is ridiculous (lol). Also, lupin making the students show their fears in front of their whole class is completely irresponsible and massively undermines his character.

Anyway, the actual reason I am making this post is the amount of AUs and crossovers where the scene is used to show a characters (usually the MC) traumatic past to other characters (usually the golden trio). It's unoriginal, ham-fisted, and lazy. It also normally requires the character in question to hold a massive idiot ball, because let's face it, most people would probably be aware their greatest fear was to do with their horrible trauma and wouldn't want to show their schoolmates it.


** I am really split with these scene in Canon.

From one hand, I will admit that forcing a bunch of children to show their worst fear in front of all their classmates in a terrible idea, and I am a little surprised that nobody tried to use the knowledge gained in this class to "prank" each others" (though I guess Malfoy and his goons tried to when they disguised themselves as Dementors to distract during his match against Ravenclaw).

One the other hand, these scene had very good reasons to exist both inside and outside the story:

- From inside the story (or the Watsonian explanation): Boggarts are considered as a kind of pest in the Magical World, something that can randomly appear under the bed of someone or in his closet. For this reason, it makes sense for the students to learn how to deal with it. And as Lupin explained during his class, the fact that they are together means that the Boggart won't be able to decide into which fear he would transform, making him weaker and, strangely enough, more adapted for a class.
- From outside the story (or the Doylish explanation): the Boggart scene is mainly used for 2 reasons. First, it shows the readers that Harry's worst fear in now the dementor, which both partialy explain his need to learn how to defend against them, and shows the reader how his boggart can be used to learn the Patronus Charm. The lesson also introduce Lupin's worst fear, which is a bit of foreshadowing about the fact that he is a werewolf.

​

Even if I'm not the greatest fan of this scene, it has a great justification outside the story and truly help the plot, so I don't think it should be removed. And concerning your problem with how this scene is used in fanfics : that's just bad writing.\\
Yes it's annoying to always see this scene used to introduce a character worst fear, but it's not that different from all these fics with a completely different Harry (Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or even Blood Purist Slytherin) that always has a "good" reason to be in from of the girl's bathroom when both Hermione and the troll are inside in PS.

Draco actually used the knowledge of Harry fainting on the train to pull off the Dementor prank.

In the book, Remus never gave Harry (and Hermione) a shot at the Boggart, and it's sort of implied that the Gryffindors don't share their Defence classes with the other houses.

** The scene in no way undermines Lupin's character. Being massively irresponsible is one of the character flaws he undergoes an arc to overcome, and crucial in regards to his characterization. Also, Neville's fear of Snape isn't considered a serious fear by the text, it's grouped into the same category as all the others. The serious fear is Harry's. It's the whole point of the scene, how Harry's life experiences have made him different from other children, and how his fears are more serious, more “adult”. Agree on the scene being a cheap tool that's overused in fanfics too often though.

**** Sirius escaping has no relation to what their fears should be. Fears aren't logical. Ron's little sister was possessed and almost murdered the year before, and yet his “biggest fear” is... a spider. Same with Hermione, who was petrified directly, and yet she fears failing a test more. Similarly, Neville fears his bully teacher even though Sirius Black is on the loose. As for why no adult cared to intervene, the reason is that Snape's behavior is not outside the norm for Hogwarts teachers, and the wizarding world in general. So long as you don't literally kill someone (or are framed for it like Hagrid), then you can get away with seemingly anything at Hogwarts.

***** No-ome intervened regarding Snape being /part of/ Neville's greatest fear for the same reason no-one would have intervened regarding McGonagall being /part of/ Hermione's greatest fear.

The fact that the bogart takes that person's shape doesn't mean that person specifically is the victim's greatest fear. It is what that person is well-placed to /represent/ that makes the bogart take that shape. The victim fears what that shape is best able to represent.

In Hermione's case, that's her fear of failure. In Neville's, it's up for grabs as he's afraid of /many/ things - his fear of authority? Fear of being expelled and sent back to his grandmother? Fear of inadequacy? Fear of being defenceless when faced with a powerful wizard?

I think people who interpret Neville's bogart as evidence that his greatest fear is literally just Snape are deliberately taking a very shallow reading of the scene.

** My personal headcanon is that boggarts are roughly as intelligent as an above-average dog. They can puppet fears by using mind magic, and can be taught to be discerning about what they emulate. The boggart Lupin used was particularly trained to only go after banal fears, but Neville's fear of Snape was too tempting and it went for it anyways. Lupin used the mind magic equivalent of a clicker to remind it of the rules, but wasn't confident enough to let Harry go, fearing that it would be too drawn by Voldemort.

The whole process is somewhat of a setup - the students are given some preparation time to focus on a particular fear in a "don't think of pink elephants" manner, then the spell is a blend of an iota of Occlumency and a fuckton of placebo to fool the boggart into being stuck.

*** I like this interpretation.

I've seen a couple of fics recently that have the viewpoint character go on about how irresponsible!!!! Lupin was to do that lesson, and I don't really like it.

Like, if it's as common a pest as it seemed to be, getting blindsided by the form it takes could be dangerous. As could insisting on facing it alone because you're afraid of your mates seeing it's form.

If everyone sees everyone else's boggarts at thirteen, it would innoculate them against being precious about it, somewhat.

** Yeah but most kids that were born right before Voldemort's fall were too young to remember the atrocities of the war and were privileged enough to live rather worriless life so their fears would be childish fears. I would have probably had a very childish fear at 12-13. The fear of Snape was also quite ridiculous because realistically other than detention and taking house points, he was a toothless hound. I can understand though why someone that was out to kill you or a - to use a favorite word of this sub - 'eldritch' monster that could eat your soul was a fear of someone and could easily turn into fears of others.

With that being said, boggarts were a real thing in the WW, and your fears would be exposed to the people around you should you ever encounter one. Better teach children how to defend against it while they had silly childish fears rather then have to figure out on the spot how to cast a Riddikulus after they'd actually suffered a traumatic event that would render them unable to do it properly (see Molly's case in OotP). Should have Remus done it on a one-by-one basis? Maybe... but confronting your own fear in front of a crowd of people also gave the students a sense of confidence. So this new theory that the boggart lesson shouldn't have been part of the curriculum is quite stupid and holds no water.

** I feel the best spin you can put on it is that Lupin doesn't really have a choice. As there is a standardised test for DADA, then there must be a curriculum that he is meant to go through. Practical experience going up against a boggart might be on there, especially if it can come up in the practical. He explicitly states that facing as a group weakens it, and it is quite possible that setting it on a student one on one is actively dangerous, or at least strong enough that they won't be able to produce the charm so it is educationally worthless.

You have my attention.

This is a matter of opinion.

Ron's terrified of spiders, specifically acromantula. Which are a perfectly reasonable fear.

Seamus is terrified of banshees--demon-women from Irish folklore. Seamus is perfectly within his rights to be afraid of a creature of nightmares from his own homeland. Especially considering the legends surrounding banshees--their cries foretell death.

Just because the story doesn't linger on these fears does not mean the fears themselves are treated as illegitimate.

Only one Boggart encounter--Hermione sobbing that McGonagall said she failed everything--is played for laughs at the expense of the afraid person, and this is not nearly so funny on latter rereads.

#+begin_quote
  Also, lupin making the students show their fears in front of their whole class is completely irresponsible and massively undermines his character.
#+end_quote

On the contrary, this is the best way to do it.

Lupin wants them to face the thing they're most afraid of, because you /need/ courage. You need to be able to stand firm /even/ when you're afraid.

And sometimes, you can get a little help from your friends. And sometimes, you can laugh at the thing you're afraid of, if you're quick and clever enough.

There's also the very real reason that boggarts are a Wizarding pest, that while not particularly common, are going to have to be faced.

And boggarts are a perfect introduction to some of the nastier beasts Lupin shows them--grindylows, hinkypunks, kappas, all of these are far worse than a boggart, but nowhere near as bad as what the fears are.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Remus Lupin certainly knew what he should do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine and understandable. Have her write “I will not skip Defence Against the Dark Arts” five hundred times and then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: Through avoidance and denial.Except he knew where that path lead.And if he ever wanted to help the Boy Who Lived With Terrible Memories, he should probably start heading down a different one.

** If you're interested in tropes from different eras, in every second gen fic I've read with a boggart lesson (which isn't many but more than one), it's common to have the children be given an option to do the lesson privately with the teacher if they don't feel comfortable in front of the class. I've seen one where the boggart lesson is scrapped (Harry is prof, and there's a line about how parents complained that too many kids had Voldemort for their boggart, and some joke about how the irony of parents complaining to Harry Potter that Voldemort is upsetting their time at Hogwarts apparently being wasted on them). I just think it's interesting how tropes vary across eras because I totally imagine this is true, but I've never much been a fan of fics set during Harry's time at Hogwarts.

In terms of ‘serious fears', phobias are dead serious to the possessor of the phobia. I was thinking about boggarts recently in a different thread, and I think they're the fear equivalent of a monster movie. They have to take a shape, so that already limits most of the abstract fears, so they're left with mostly monster movie style options, things that appear campy to some but still frighten people, even if jump scares are considered to be a cheaper form of fear in movies.

A Very Potter Sequel's Lupin is really irresponsible, like most of his jokes are derived from that, and it's hilarious. You should check it out. I actually didn't consider Lupin to be irresponsible when I was younger (unlike Hagrid and other DADA profs who just shouldn't have taught), but I see it more now.

** Honestly, the Boggart as shown in Lupins lesson is the best and most consistent application of the creature and works fairly well. It's the later uses that undermine it as a creature. In that lesson it's literally a bogeyman, it doesn't want to kill anyone, or embarrass them, or paralyze them with fear or anything like that. It wants them to be afraid, and to not open up its hiding place. That's its ideal situation.

It's why it takes more base and primal fears. Ron gets a spider instead of some representation of his inferiority complex because a spider is more likely to provoke a gut reaction of getting the fuck away from the boggart so it can go back into hiding.

No one should have "serious" fears shown ideally, they should just have things like creatures shown. Neville shouldn't have seen Snape in my opinion as it doesn't fit well with a coherent view of the Boggart as a creature.
