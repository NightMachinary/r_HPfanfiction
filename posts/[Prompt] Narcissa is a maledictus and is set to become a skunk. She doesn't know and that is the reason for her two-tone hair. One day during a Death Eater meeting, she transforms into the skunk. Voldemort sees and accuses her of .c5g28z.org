  In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

** I just realised this doesn't add up. I mentioned death eater meetings and totally forgot about the final battle, in which she lies, easily her most iconic moment. So she basically transforms before the battle, not allowing her to save Harry and flounce away from the battle iconically with Draco. Excuse me for canonical inconsistency. Just make it so Lucius takes her to the battle despite how extremely unsafe that would be for her. I guess in this AU someone else lies to Voldemort.

*** I don't think canonical consistency is that important in a prompt as most prompts are just divergence points anyway. Either way, its your prompt so your choice
