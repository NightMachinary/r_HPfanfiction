Dumbledore borrows the cloak because, not wanting to rely on a prophecy, or believing the prophecy will only come about if Voldemort attacks one of the children, he uses the cloak, hiding in the room, unknown to James (though James HAD given him the Secret paper) unknown to Lily, and unknown to Voldemort.

As Voldemort moves to kill James, Dumbledore takes Voldemort out from the cover of stealth. The Horcruxes may still be a thing, but this Dumbledore, the man who beat Grindelwald 1v1, isn't going to rely on a child to do everything. He's going to ensure Voldemort's defeat... Personally.


** There were two sudden bright flashes in the front garden. James ran to grab his wand and threw open the front door, yelling to Lily to take Harry and run as he did so and-

Voldemort was on the ground, as was Pettigrew.

Well at least he now knew who the traitorous rat wa- he really should have seen that coming.

There was a swirl and Dumbledore appeared from underneath an invisibility cloak.

His invisibility cloak.

Huh. So that's why he wanted to borrow it.

Dumbledore, looking somewhat smug, stroked his beard. "It appears, James, that like most dark lords he was vulnerable to being cursed in the back."

James stared at Dumbledore. "What."

"I must thank you for the lend of this invisibility cloak. It was a lot easier to sneak up on this one than the last."

But the last one would be...

"You defeated Grindelwald by sneaking up on him and cursing him in the back, didn't you."

"That is a distinct possibility"

"But everybody knows about the duel you had with him"

Dumbledore sat down on what turned out to be a disillusioned comfy chair.

"Ah yes. You see... If I had cursed him in the back, I'm just some bloke who got lucky, and his lieutenants take over from him and probably try to break him out. However, if I was to best him in a duel, then I am obviously stronger than him and they must surrender to me due to their whole 'might makes right' philosophy."

"Oh"

Dumbledore took a sip from an invisible glass and put it back down on an invisible table. His glasses twinkled in the light from the still open door. "Now, how do you want to spin this?"

"I... I think we'll take the Grindelwald approach."

"Very wise. Lemon drop?"

Dumbledore held out an invisible dish, presumably filled with lemon drops.

*** Some saw Dumbledore as the kindly if eccentric old headmaster of Hogwarts. Others saw him as a senile old fool. Still others saw him as the scheming manipulator, plotting to destroy the wizarding world from within. The truth, of course, was all of those and none of them. But one thing that Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore had learned very early on was that when the stakes were high, there was nothing wrong with a little cheating.

He'd written a very brief treatise on practical defense once. Those seeking a scholarly dissertation on obscure and potent battle magics had been sorely disappointed- but those who were seeking practical advice for defeating dangerous dark wizards found it rather more illuminating. It read, in its entirety, as follows:

A Practical Guide to Vanquishing the Dark Arts, by Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore

1. They can't curse you if they can't see you coming.
2. There is nothing wrong with shooting first (although my friend Mr. Lucas begs to differ).
3. It is difficult to defend against being hexed in the back.
4. If your wand is broken, throw it away and kick them in the bollocks.
5. Never, ever put your trust in prophecies.
6. If people credit you with extraordinary ability, there is no need to disillusion them.

**** Dumbledore rule number 1, sometimes a household cleaning charm can be more affective then hundreds of other curses. afterall they can hardly fight you when slipping about on soap.

Dumbledore rule number 2. there is nothing stopping from accioing your opponents feet or clothing.

Dumbledore rule number 3. most wizards fail to look behind them in battle, so look for objects behind them and summon them to you

** Voldemort went there specifically to kill Harry - Harry is still the Boy Who Lived

The Power He Knows Not - Gwanpa Dumbles!

Horcruxes are still in play. Harry is raised by mom and dad with the knowledge Voldemort may return. Plenty of time to train the kid.

** A few days ago, there was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iy7tp5/lord_voldemort_comes_to_the_potter_on_october_31/][a prompt about all Marauders being present]]. Most commenters think Voldemort was still going to walk over them. But I think it would take quite some time for Voldemort to do that, and Dumbledore could arrive in an instant with Fawkes and under the Invisibility Cloak.

Then your scenario can be kick in easily.

** You know, you gave me an interesting idea. If the Cloak can 'hide you from Death', can it hide you from other concepts too? Could you 'hide' from Fate or Destiny with it?
