Okay so that was the shorter version of it

A fic with a powerful harry and that has cool and powerful feeling battles like battles where Harry doesn't just go expelliarmus! expelliarmus! expelliarmus! expelliarmus!expelliarmus! For the whole battle and then be like oh look 28 wands oops. That's just stupid in my opinion but I need a fic which goes more like: Harry turned the cauldron voldemort was supposed to be resurrected in into a pillar of fire or something similar.

So it has Harry using things to his Advantage

If it has a pairing the Haphne or Harmony but I'd prefer Haphne

Thanks!
