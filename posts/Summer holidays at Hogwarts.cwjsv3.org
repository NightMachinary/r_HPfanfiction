Hey there! I'm currently looking for fics in which Harry manages to stay at Hogwarts for the summer holidays. He should, preferably, stay hidden from the Professors. So if you've got any well-written fic recommendations for me that would be greatly appreciated. The length of the story doesn't matter to me :)


** I vaguely remember a fic where the trio spends year 7 at Hogwarts without the teachers knowing, while the Death Eaters search for them across the country they just live in the room of requirement and research possible Horcrux locations. Can't remember the name though.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
