And wondering what are some of your favorite tropes?


** Time Travel with very little angst and absolutely no ‚Äúpreserving the timeline.‚Äù

** - The bad guys getting utterly annihilated without constantly emphasising how awesome the other side is (that just feels like bragging)

- Lust to love (eg friends with benefits growing into something deeper)

- Capable women (which sadly is still just a trope and not more common)

** I have a few ideas:

1) How about a story in which Ginny keeps ALL of Diary Riddle's memories and powers? She takes the lead in fighting Voldemort and makes Harry awesome at same time. She, not some Deus Ex Machina, is the ‚Äúpower he knows not‚Äù. The good guys should obviously suffer far fewer losses under such scenario.

2) Still postwar, but Harry and Ginny are forced on a big dimensional travel by accident. They encounter all kinds of alternative realities and have to use all their wits and powers to survive. You can even use worlds created in other fanfics.

3) This idea is inspired by Esama's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]]. Basically, they are marooned on a remote Pacific island and have to find their way back. With magic, they have of course a lot easier than Muggles in similar situations, but I still think the challenges are formidable.

4) Inspired by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), but instead of Harry/Hermione and Ron as the main cast, it will be Harry/Ginny with Bill/Fleur.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** Wow, I didn't even know you were still writing! I've loved your fics, you were the first good Harry/Ginny I found when I started Harry Potter fanfiction.

As for my favorite tropes?

Lust to Love is a good one.

Battle Couple

and Seduction Proof Marriage are my favorite Love tropes.

*** I only recently came back after a long hiatus. I wrote an 8th year fic, a really inappropriate fic (that I loved so much I am turning into an original), and now I am working on a different one. I would love to see your comments.

** Also, since you seem to be active in [[/r/HarryandGinny]], why not write something set after the war where the Weasleys are not coping well with the loss of Fred and Ginny can't take the atmosphere at the Burrow anymore. She runs off to Grimmauld as soon as Harry and Hermione are back from Australia (R/Hr had one kiss but that's it, Molly made Ron swear an oath not to leave or maybe he was too deep in his own grief to care about Hermione).

Hermione decides to wing-girl for Harry and organises them a nice evening out in London, maybe add some culture shock for Ginny at the cinema or some ridiculous date idea the pair ditches because only Hermione thinks people would enjoy it. Perhaps they have a few shots and tell each other about their wartime experiences or Ginny finally gets to grief on her own and Harry comforts her.

You could throw Andromeda and Teddy into the mix (just keep in mind that Andromeda would be between 42 and 47, so not the frail grandmother fanfics often turn her into). Or they somehow run into Lavender who has trouble coping with her injuries.

Overall just something which shows that not "everything was well", but there is some ray of hope even if you are neck-deep in the shit life has thrown at you. That having someone who shoulders the burden with you can be a huge help.

Maybe things get hot and heavy when Hermione walks in. Harry is obviously mortified but Hermione just looks at them before turning around and gives some advice as she walks out ("use another finger/your tongue"/"gently bite it"/"try nibbling on her throat").

Or you could turn that idea into a Harry/Ginny/Hermione story by having Ginny join into an established but casual relationship between Harry and Hermione which has been born out of a need for comfort, closeness and any kind of positive human emotion during the hunt. And the war/Hermione's parents only further fueled that need and Ginny is in a similar situation, feeling as if all her family had died during the battle because no one is their former self.

*** I am exhausted from writing post-DH, I think I tend to go toward AU. And while I think it would be fun to write a threesome, I'm not sure I could see Harry and Ginny having a third. Or Ginny BEING a third in a relationship. Or Harry being attracted to Hermione. üòÇ

** Ginny is a healer. Harry is an Autor. They never met at school. He's always coming for life threatening accidents from his job, Ginny always patches him right back up.

Not sure what the plot would be, but I think that dynamic would be kind of fun. You could have the added drama of forbidden love because Healers might not be able to date their patients, especially if they see them regularly.
