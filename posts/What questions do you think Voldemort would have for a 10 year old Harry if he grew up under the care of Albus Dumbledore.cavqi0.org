I wasn't really sure what flare to put on this, but anyway. . . help?

In a story I am writing, a 10 year old Harry gets captured by Voldemort. Up until that point, Harry lived at Hogwarts with Dumbledore and McGonagall. Voldemort knows Harry is a horcrux, and does not wish to kill him. I'd like to have some scenes in which Voldemort interrogates Harry, but what sort of questions would he ask? I can't seem to think of anything, and would love some help. Thanks in advance.


** I think subtle questions about Dumbledore's daily life and routine rather than anything direct. He would be strategic. He wouldn't want to give too much information away with his questioning.

But I also think he would try to manipulate Harry with questions to try to lead him away from Dumbledore. Like "Dumbledore never tells you his plans, does he? Does he not trust you? Why have you put your faith in a man who lies to you?"

*** Thanks! Harry IS 10, though. It's not like Dumbledore's gonna be telling him all these secrets. But I like the manipulating-to-lead-him-away-from-Dumbledore part!

*** Well. . . not really. I've published a similar one, but the one I am working on has a slightly different plot and is a bit more extreme than the published one.

** I think that depends on the circumstances: for instance, how does Voldemort know that Harry is a horcrux, does he know/suspect that Dumbledore knows as well, is he concerned about his other have horcruxes, and how did he kidnap Harry/how long does he expect to be able to keep him prisoner? Depending on the answers to those questions, Voldemort's priorities could shift a lot.

*** Voldemort deduced that Harry is a horcrux after hearing him accidentally speak to Nagini in pareseltongue (also backed up by their strange connection through Harry's scar). Voldemort believes himself to be smarter than everyone else, so he doesn't really think that Dumbledore suspects anything. Dumbledore has heard Harry speak parseltongue and knows Harry's scar has hurt before, so he is aware that there's something more going on with Harry and Voldemort, but he doesn't know what. He kidnapped Harry with the aid of the Death Eaters, who snatched him right from the grounds of Hogwarts (they grabbed him, broke the wards enough to get through (yes, I know this part is quite flimsy) and then disapparated). Voldemort expects to keep Harry forever, as he does not want to kill him, and so far I haven't worked out how it is all going to end. But Harry is going to be with Voldemort for at least three months.
