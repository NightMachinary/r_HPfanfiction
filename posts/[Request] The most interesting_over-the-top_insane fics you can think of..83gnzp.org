** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]) Quite possibly the most over the top fic I've ever read has a harry that reincarnates over and over again trying to defeat Voldemort and a race for ancient magic and power that i haven't read elsewhere

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** I'm rather surprised no one's linked 30 Hs yet, considering it's certainly over the top and a bit insane. If /My Immortal/ is a 14-year-old girl's fanfiction on steroids, this one is a 13-year-old boy's. Much like /My Immortal,/ the only real reading value is in going, "What?"

It is at least short.

The first five words: "Dobby relished his groinsaw's roar"

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
