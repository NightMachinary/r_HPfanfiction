What I mean by this is, that I'm looking for a fic in which Harry...well, dies. Preferably early on. He can't come back AT ANY POINT, and he must be the main character. This must also not be a time travel fic, nor contain slash.

The death can happen at any time, be it deviating massively from canon or having him die from something from canon that he would normally avoid, examples: Maybe Fawkes doesn't make it to him in time and he dies from Basilisk poisoning, perhaps he fails to fight off the dementors and is Kissed, perhaps he commits suicide for some reason. Any of these are possibilities, but the fic MUST DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT AND REACTIONS TO THE DEATH, as in focusing on the wizarding world at large reacting to their "savior" falling to some horrible end.

Preferably complete and no slash, if possible.

*** Thanks for the reply, but I've already read "Harry Potter Without Harry Potter" linkffn(7781192)

And that other fic mentioned in that post...The summary raises a bunch of alarms for me, such as the title not being capitalized, and the reuse of the word "decade" far too regularly. Is that story actually good?

(Disclaimer: For all I know the bot could be what is causing the summary not to be capitalized and the overly long summary could just be something to do with the bot, IDK)

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

***** That story is at the same time better and also worse than its title and description imply. I could never really decide. Some weird religious themes that were hard for me to sit through, but also some really unique ideas (which is rare in fanfiction considering all the same shit all the time).

#+end_quote

I'm all in favour of strong moral objections, but that is a very particular interpretation of events (I decided to re-read the relevant parts). I can see no torture to speak of and I wouldn't call a loyalty oath - while quite severe and questionable - slavery.

It's all relatively ruthless, but she was involved in a serious international incident (terrorism / assassination attempts).
