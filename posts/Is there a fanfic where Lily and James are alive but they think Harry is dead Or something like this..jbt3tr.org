I've read some like this and I really liked it, I don't mind having to travel to some alternative universe, or WBWL, I just want a fanfic that James and Lily are alive, but think Harry is dead or missing, I've read "Light up to the sky "" The darkness within "and" Love and love again."

​

Or else they end up forgetting that Harry exists, something that shakes their relationship, but in time they start to reconnect again!

** linkffn(6892925) and linkffn(3401052) are two that qualify. Both are alternate universe/dimension travel fics with very different tones.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

** *Harry Potter's most excellent adventure* - linkffn(11619134)\\
Harry Potter/Stargate Franchise\\
Harry ends up stealing a mirror that connects to a random reality. He finds a different reality for his "backup plan". This is a crack fic, so he needs a backup plan with how he acts. And this mirror only allows one person per identity to exist. Any extras that appear gradually get sick until they die. So him being dead in this reality is a requirement.

ANYWHO~ there are obvious differences in the reality: Voldemort is still alive (this is a post Voldemort fic), yet hiding in the shadows. Sirius was expelled from Hogwarts for the Snape Womping Willow event (I think Snape was turned). AND he has a brother and sister.

  Harry Potter simply wanted to take a break from being everyone's hero. Who'd have thought that being kidnapped by Jaffa out of some lousy Diner would do the trick? Poor SG1. They have no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover, eventual AU (COMPLETE, if you can believe it!)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Linkao3(Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death) - think this may be abandoned, but it was a very interesting look at how Lily and James might have changed if they survived and (as far as they knew) Harry did not.

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. Killed lots and lots of people? Done it. Been killed herself? Done it. But meeting Death himself and being introduced to a universe where it isn't alien invasions but baby's who stop dark lords? Now that's a new one. And who is she to refuse when Death hands her an orphan whose being hunted by terrorists? Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her.
