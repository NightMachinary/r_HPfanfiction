Hi guys does anyone know why harrypotterfanfiction.com is not working right now? All was grand yesterday with it.


** I'm afraid it's still down, I couldn't access it via cable or either of my two phones' 4G connection. Various sites checking whether a website is actually down came to the same conclusion. üòî

**** I just hope it will be back soon and not gone forever. I recently went onto the site again after about ten years and found some great fics on there. It was so nostalgic and now its gone :(
