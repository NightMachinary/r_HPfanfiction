One thing that has irked many, me included, and spawned many a bashing fic is this trend:

#+begin_quote
  The bad people walk. The good people die.
#+end_quote

First with the Imperius Curse excuse and money, then with redemption... Order of Phoenix and DA using stunners where Killing Curses fly... Allowing one's enemies second chances with full knowledge one will not get any in turn...

From the viewpoint of Game Theory this is not viable, or rather, being Evil becomes the win condition unless the reward table is seriously skewed. So I'd like some recommendations of fics where characters refuse to make great sacrifices for strangers or nebulous concepts. Helping is great, so long as one does not sacrifice everything to do so.

Examples of what I'm looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/][A father first, damn it!]] - Harry's parents do not take any chances.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7833937/chapters/17883658][Rise Above]] - A runaway Harry is perfectly willing to assist in evacuation/resistance of Britain, arranging safehouses, supplies and research. He is not willing to go into a war zone, being a teenager with spotty education as he is.


** The trouble with most fics of this sort is that it's Gray!Independent!Powerful!Harry condescendingly lecturing the rest of the Order of the Phoenix about Doing What Must Be Done and Being a Hard Man Making Hard Decisions (while Hard). Fics with a ruthless ensemble cast are far more rare.

Going off the top of my head, [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics tend to feature this element, as do those by BolshevikMuppet99. I'm going to link two of their fics so that you could find their FF.net profiles and go from there:

- linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5)
- linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99)

More generally, "The bad people walk. The good people die." is largely a misconception with respect to canon. In canon, the only ones who actually live this way are Dumbledore and Harry. Dumbledore, because he is powerful enough to defeat virtually any number of lesser opponents nonlethally. Therefore, any killing he does in combat is inherently gratuitous and unnecessary, making it murder, damaging his soul, and tempting him towards becoming the tyrant he had almost become earlier in his life. Harry, because he's the Christ Figure, and he needed all the karma he could get to pull of what he did at the end.

Other characters are quite a bit more sanguinary. Just off the top of my head, aurors were allowed to use the Unforgivables during the first wizarding war; Remus criticises Harry for using a Disarming Charm against a probable Imperius victim; Molly doesn't hesitate to kill Bellatrix; and Hufflepuffs led by Sprout drop mandrakes on Death Eaters.

*** Canon evokes the "Good people die, bad people walk" trope because that is what it shows, over and over again. With the exception of Voldemort, Bellatrix and, arguably, Crabbe, we don't see the bad people getting killed. Sirius dies, but none of the Death Eaters in the Ministry. Moody dies in the shitty Seven Potter op, but any Death Eaters? No. Remus, Tonks, Fred, Colin die at Hogwarts, but the Death Eaters? Voldemort and Bellatrix, no one else. Snatchers? Nope.

If JKR had actually shown the Order killing Death Eaters, if she had shown a stacked row of Death Eaters corpses at Hogwarts, this trope wouldn't crop up so often.

That's just a function of Harry's point of view: he is going to know about every single person whose name he knew on his side who had died, and he isn't going to research what happened to which Death Eater---at least not in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts.

So, we don't actually know which of the Death Eaters were killed at the Battle of Hogwarts and which were knocked out. Technically, we don't even know that about Bellatrix: we just know that she was cursed in the chest and toppled over, and that Voldemort was very mad about it.

We also don't actually know how many Death Eaters (and how many Imperius victims) were killed at the Seven Potters battle, because Harry wasn't interested.

What we do see is the Order advocating for and using lethal magic when the situation called for it. It's not their fault that Harry didn't follow up on their hit rate.

#+begin_quote

That would have been gratuitous and out of place narratively, particularly if they were listed by name, which is what you seem to be asking for.

***** Harry doesn't have to research - he should have gotten a briefing "We killed two Death Eaters, though we couldn't identify them yet". And he shouldn't have to know every name after BoH, but seeing the enemy casualties, not just the dead of his own side would have gone a long way to battle the "the good die, the bad walk" trope.

And, of course, that the trio let two Death Eaters they had captured walk away is unforgivable. They should have been killed or at least memory wiped into babies, not released so they could kill more people. That was a totally unneeded scene - especially since it didn't have a purpose at all; they weren't staying in the area, it was known they were fleeing, and they would apparate and couldn't be tracked. It was bullshit from start to finish.

****** Why would anybody brief Harry on useless information like that? He wasn't coordinating the defence of Hogwarts.

As we learn from Remus later, at the time when the trio were considering what to do with the two Death Eaters, other Weasleys were being held by the Ministry---and were subsequently released unhurt. They didn't have to be.

Again, it's a bad idea to escalate against Death Eaters unless you are able and willing to out-escalate them.

******* As I said, that the Weasleys were released was stupid. That didn't make any sense at all. Not with them, and especially Ron, being known as close allies of Harry. Even if they thought the Weasleys were no threat, they would have been hostages.

Handing the DE's the idiot balls is not a good thing. Not that it had a purpose, anyway - since the POV was centred on Harry, the Weasleys could've gone into hiding without changing the plot in any significant way.

And Harry and Co. should have been debriefed and told the results. "We lost Moody, but we killed three of them" is good for morale, much better than "We lost Moody." Again, a sign that JKR has no idea about war. And knowing about the enemy's casualties isn't top secret information, either - the enemy would already know about that, so there's no risk telling that to your troops.

******** - The Nazis didn't start the Final Solution immediately either, and they were weirdly legalistic even towards the end. Indeed, by that standard, Death Eaters moved /fast/.
- Now that I think about it, why /would/ the Death Eaters be any good at counterinsurgency? Muggle governments that invest massive amount of resources studying and developing counterinsurgency doctrines are still pretty bad at it; Death Eaters would have no idea what to do and what not to do, and they would be facing enemies practically designed for guerilla warfare. They would make rookie mistakes because they are, in fact, rookies.
- If understandable incompetence won't do, consider cowardice. One downside of recruiting primarily from Slytherin is that you don't get many people eager to martyr themselves to the cause, especially if Voldemort isn't looking over their particular shoulder. This means that the individual Death Eaters also have reasons to worry about escalation, and doubly so for Ministry officials trying to wait out the war. You execute the wrong pureblooded blood-traitor, and the next day, your office mate who you forgot was your victim's third cousin once removed hexes you in the back, or worse, your child. Now, the regime will live on and perhaps even avenge you, but you or your loved ones are still dead.
- More broadly speaking, Death Eaters wanted to capture the wizarding society as intact as possible. If they made too many people mad at them, there wouldn't be a society to rule when the dust settled.
- With respect to the specific Seven Potters thing, the Order was retreating, in the dark. How would they even know how many they'd killed as opposed to knocked off the broom or just lost in the chase? There is basically one spell that actually guarantees a kill no matter where it hits, and it's not clear how many in the Order could cast it. How many could they actually identify? Even if they could, how would they know how many of them were Imperius victims? For that matter, I don't think they'd be that cheered up by enemy casualty figures, since it doesn't really bring them closer to victory. I mean, maybe it could have come up on Potterwatch.

********* Yes, the DEs were quick with the genocide - which means that any attempt to "Not escalate" is stupid since the other side already escalated to genocide. And we know how well placating Nazis worked.

You don't need to be good at counterinsurgency to interrogate suspects such as the Weasleys with Veritaserum. Especially since you know that Arthur is an Order member since he was working for the order when he was bit in book 5 by Nagini, who then escaped. Also, DEs have had a decade of experience in waging a guerilla war in the first war - they know what can be done and know how the Ministry fought them. You have squads of DEs led by veterans, and you won't see many rookie mistakes.

The Snatchers didn't struck me as "ineffective due to cowardice". And, again - if the DEs are already genociding muggleborns, which they were, all bets are off.

If Harry saw people die, and even saw SNape cast a curse, why the fuck wouldn't the others have seen anything? And if you think "They got Moody, but we got two of them" won't raise morale more than "We lost Moody", then I think you need to study war a little more. It's not about enemy casualty figures as a baseline, but about knowing you gave as good as you got, or better. Knowing that you can win. That you have a chance. If all you do is losing people, morale will drop fast.

Yeah, this is not what I'm looking for :D

I'm not interested in 'sides', just characters with self-preservation instincts. And if I came across as uncharitable towards the more 'moral' characters... In my defense I've read Gandhi's letters to the British during WW2 recently, and that might have tinted my perception of HP. It does not help that I am firmly opposed to any kind of Messiah figures, as they encourage dependency.

  "But you, Miss Granger, had the misfortune to remember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search your excellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have proved efficacious. *And you pinned all your army's hopes on your own person, so they lost spirit when you fell.* Afterward they continued to cast their futile Sleep Hexes, governed by the habits of fighting that had been trained into them, unable to break the pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what goes through people's minds when they repeat the same failed strategy over and over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare realization that you can try something else. And so the Sunshine Regiment was wiped out by two soldiers." The Defense Professor grinned mirthlessly. "One perceives certain similarities to how fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our much-loved Ministry continues in its rule."

**** On the other hand, "dozens of spells that might have proved efficacious" is hyperbole - and often the result of someone writing who never trained for combat. As a soldier, you drill, drill and drill so in combat, when you are prone to panic and don't have time to think about the best course of action, you can do what you need to do without thinking much. If you have dozens of options, you tend to freeze when faced with the choice of what to pick, and if you learn dozens of spells, you tend to be worse at casting them than if you learn one or two perfectly.

If you are writing about duels, then exotic spells might have their place, and complicated tactics, often relying on luck and combinations of several spells, might not be useless, but on the battlefield, where you gang up on enemies, a few simple spells cast competently, and by people who trained to fight together and use cover and movement, tend to win out.

***** Of course. But reading back, they had drills in a few spells that worked: Flippendo, the 'Prismatic Barrier', the Stunning spell...

Even shifting aim to unprotected faces of their opponents.

It's similar to training how to use grenades, when not to use them, and to switch to knife/sidearm if your opponent enters melee range and your rifle is long and heavy.

So, some variability is necessarily part of such training, and those in officer positions are required to be able to think up solutions and direct their troops as well.

Anyway, it's the bolded section that is important in that quote. If one puts all eggs into one basket, no matter how intricately weaved...

**** The way I see it, during DH, the Order had the problem that they'd lost their only uberwizard while the other side still had theirs. However, the Death Eater regime was overconfident, downright lethargic in its pursuit of its enemies, lackadaisical in its security, and obsessed with procedure and appearance of legitimacy. Voldemort himself was away most of the time, searching for the Elder Wand. That could change very quickly if they escalated.

To counter Voldemort, they needed either another Dumbledore or a miracle. They didn't have another Dumbledore, so they bet on a miracle. Fortunately, they lived in a moral, rather than indifferent, universe, and a miracle was delivered. Actually, even if no miracle happened and Harry died and Voldemort survived the Battle of Hogwarts, he would be in no position to rule: there would be a fair number of people protected by Harry's sacrifice from him and his agents, and Hermione and Ron would make it known that all his horcruxes were gone, at which point Voldemort's pathological fear of death would probably cause him to retreat to avoid death by accident or betrayal.)

--------------

HPMOR is one of those stories whose characterisation is heavily influenced by fanon and which throws even what little characterisation out when it gets in the way of the message it wants to convey. I find that it's best enjoyed if you can force yourself to stop thinking of the characters as representations of hypothetical people, as opposed to walking archetypes of the sort that you have in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte][commedia dell'arte]]. (People have accused JKR of similar things, but that's a separate discussion.)

One of the most consistent threads in HPMOR---especially after the first few chapters---is that only Voldemort (in both of his incarnations) gets to actually be clever and creative when it matters. Hermione, in particular, is made to be /nice/ (which she isn't in canon) and unable to come up with unexpected magic (which she did in canon), and her only achievement in the grand scheme of things is her being too moral to be seduced by Quirrel with promises of power---something that is ultimately of no consequence to the plot.

Take the scene you've quoted. Hermione's hallmark---which, IIRC, gives her her only actual win against Harry that wasn't engineered by him---is getting everyone to work together to develop strategies, in contrast to Draco's authoritarian style and Harry's "chaotic" leadership (which only works because of author fiat). But, that goes out of the window the moment Harry needs be shown being amazingly clever, so somehow, Hermione's whole brain trust comes up with a harebrained strategy and loses all its creativity and ability to adjust to changing circumstances, so that Harry's impractical strategy could work.

In practice, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-wizard-of-woah-and-irrational-methods-of-irrationality.337233/post-31485899][this snippet]] is far more plausible in its consequences of HPJEV acting as he did.

Burt with regard to DH, I can't really make excuses for JKR; she simply doesn't know much about war, much less civil war. She probably took the Troubles as an example, but forget that magic, the Death Eater ideology and the sheer stakes of the Second Wizarding War would drastically change how it was fought. There wouldn't be as much restraint as was shown; not by the Death Eaters and the other bigots let loose on the population. She should have studied Nazi Germany to see how it would have been fought.
