Pretty please: no crossovers with Anne Rice here... Taltos and táltos are different type of beings with completely different systems of magic.

Im not even sure this fic was in English, but apparently there was a fanfiction where Dumbledore hired a táltos (Hungarian shaman-ish) to take the post of Defense against the Dark Arts professor. Because of this, Harry learns táltos magic or something. I don't know, the mixture of those magicks sounded interesting and I wanted to read it. If it does still exist but isn't in English, then just let me know as well, though unfortunately reading it wouldn't happen
