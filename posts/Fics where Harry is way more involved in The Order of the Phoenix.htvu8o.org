** The six book was a bit weird. Voldemort is finally out in the open, the second war starts properly and what plot do we get? Teenage love drama. I would really like to se something like this.

*** 'Teenage love drama' = JKR needing to get her canon ships going no matter what. Guess she saw it as a necessary evil then.

**** Just imagine how good that book would have been if Umberidge was cut out and replaced with an actual participation in the book's title.
