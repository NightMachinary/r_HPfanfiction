About a year ago I read a fic that was like this and I liked it but didn't add it to my favorites or follow it. I think it was one fic were Harry transfer to slytherin for some reason or another and found a secret room behind a wall or fireplace that was slytherin's study or living quarters. If anyone finds this that would be great.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** That really fits only partially. PoS is not Harry/Tracey or Harry/Daphne.
