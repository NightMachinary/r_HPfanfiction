:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a Snarry fic years ago, ive been trying to find it with no luck. What i can remember is the Trio are in the great hall and the paper comes and Snape leaves and they hear him scream. I think its a time travel fic and in the paper is an announcement about Harry and Severus' wedding anniversary and Severus has naturally curly hair.

I hope that someone can help me find it.

  When Harry is tossed backwards in time through a magical accident, he has no choice but to return the hard way. One day at a time.
