This is definitely the most charming SI story I've ever read and it is very well written.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Alexandra Quick is pretty much the gold standard of OC fics. It's not a traditional OC or SI fic but a story set in the Wizarding World without using any canon characters. linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

336k words if you're up for that kind of size. Kind of tore and shuffled canon around to do some world building and elaborate in some themes in this.
