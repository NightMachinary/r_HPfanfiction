I'm looking for any recommendations on fics where Harry is a vampire or is involved with one. (I dig fleshed out relationships and characters but won't turn my nose up at crack fics)


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185]]

Has been like 12 years since I read it, but I enjoyed it back then. But having recently tried re-reading fics that I enjoyed 15 years ago, I don't make any promises that it is actually a good fic :D

Summary: War, werewolves, wizards, death, the undead... Harry has his work cut out for him. And then there's Hermione, who's a different set of vamp-angst altogether. Though war and death has changed so much, Harry knows he could beat the odds of a bitter fate. Now he just has to make her believe it. WARNINGS: Probably too much sex and extreme violence. EXCERPT: It was a night like this one long before when Hermione Granger became the center of his life. He didn't know back then that was what happened. All he knew was that she had appeared at the Dursley doorstep and quite possibly shifted his understanding of life.

  If there was one thing that Vernon Dursley of number four Privet drive disliked more than his good for nothing, scrawny, freak of a nephew, it was NOISE. Like the whine of a moving van, for instance...

  After a rather painful revelation and deciding to try to leave the Wizarding World behind, Harry accepts an invitation. One that may very well put him at odds with the Hellsing Organization.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!
