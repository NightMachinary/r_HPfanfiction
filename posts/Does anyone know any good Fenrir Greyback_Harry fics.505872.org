  Sequel to Basic Needs, which starts where that left off: in Azkaban. But the world is changing rapidly, Voldemort is ready to make his final move, the Ministry and the Order are desperate, Harry had about enough & Fenrir really doesn't like that attitude.

  Eventually, the constant denial of the essentials, such as sleep, water, food and human contact, got to everyone in Azkaban, even the infamous Fenrir Greyback. However, one full moon and an unexpected visitor might just change everything... HPFG, SLASH

** I think that it makes sense in a way if Harry is turned. You don't have a lot of Fenrir in canon so he is easy to make up a personality for. And as there is no pack-life in canon you can also write and think that yourself.

But the on who made up the giant squid/Hogwarts castle ship is a fucking genius.
