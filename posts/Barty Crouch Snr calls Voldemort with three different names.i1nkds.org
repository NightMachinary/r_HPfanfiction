  “Don't...leave...me!” he whispered, his eyes bulging again. “I...escaped...must warn...must tell...see Dumbledore...my fault...all my fault...Bertha...dead...all my fault...my son...my fault...tell Dumbledore ...Harry Potter...the *Dark Lord*...stronger...Harry Potter...”

He calls him Dark Lord during his madness.

  “Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to *Lord Voldemort*'s supporters,” said Mr. Crouch. “For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than -”

Now, he calls him Lord Voldemort during Bagman's trial.

#+begin_quote
  “We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named* -”

  “You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore *He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named* to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury -”
#+end_quote

And he goes to calling him like most of the Wizarding World does.

I find it a very peculiar detail that he calls him differently each time. Personally, I would've loved if he also used called him Lord Voldemort openly, and always. He was Ministry's poster boy against Voldemort, much like Dumbledore, and someone who doesn't fear him. I mean he already fought Voldemort with fire, it wouldn't be out of character for such a man to show more bravely and just call him by his actual name. As Ron said in DH, only people who were serious with standing up against Voldemort called him by his name, and Crouch definately fits the bill.


** Crouch Snr has always been one of my favourite minor characters, he's not nice but he's a complicated figure and an interesting bloke. His son also grips the imagination, as does the love for his wife. I have always been of the opinion that Mrs Crouch is one of the most underrated characters in the series, but that family is messed up from the get go, and I love them for it. He's not a bad person but he's also not likeable in real life, he's just one of those people, you know? Even when he was delirious all he could talk about was how Barty got 12 O.W.Ls, talk about a father who loves his diabolical son. A few seconds later he's killed by said son and transfigured into a bone. I've always wondered whether Barty the Younger was always this fanatical or the time under the Imperius drove him mad as such that the only thing he was devoted to was Voldemort. I also love the parallel between him and Regulus Black (both have good relationships with the family house-elves), among yet other parallels.

As for the different uses of names, isn't Crouch a politician? Maybe he's trying to cater to different people by presenting different images of himself; the man brave enough to call Voldemort by his name, the man who respects others by not frightening them with saying it, and the man who uses the formal title of the Dark Lord. He must have encountered all of these during his work, so it's not far-fetched to assume he doesn't even /have/ a default. It's also interesting if we go back and see which situations exactly did he use the names he spoke. Dark Lord means he must respect him a bit, maybe? Or he's truly afraid, in Bagman's trial people don't really want to let Bagman go to Azkaban and he's trying to assert his power, and during his son's trial, well, it was a big one supposedly (Alice and Frank being beloved members of the community) and he resorted to calling him by the most used formal name. Just a thought.

*** Love this comment, very succinctly put!

And about the different names too. I suppose it was like this:

During the trial of death eaters including his son: he's reading the official document where it was govt policy to say 'he who must not be named'.

During Bagman's trial: he's talking to Bagman and the Wizengamot and sees no need to mince his words

After the escape: he's been under a death eater's imperious for months, and we know all DEs call him the dark lord (See Snape calling him the same).

You've pretty much written what I was trying to convey, but you don't ramble like I do XD

*** The world needs more Barty Crouch Sr fanfics.

I want to read about Moody and Sr working together to catch Death Eaters (with Charlus Potter as a fellow Auror because it would be PERFECT) and Jr wanting to be exactly like his father's best friend.

(Until he doesn't --- but by then he knows exactly what Moody would do in every situation. Enough to act exactly like him. Well enough to fool even Dumbledore.)

*** i love this passage by sirius

#+begin_quote
  “D'you know Crouch, then?” said Harry. Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “No, I'm not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. “Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads. “He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. “He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical --- and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry's face. “No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . . you're too young. . . .

  All right, I'll try you. . . .” He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, “Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to be. “Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning --- I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters. The Aurors were given new powers --- powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial.

  Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you --- plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. . . .” Sirius smiled grimly. “Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.”

  “Crouch's son was caught?” gasped Hermione.

  Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. “Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.” He began to wolf down large pieces of bread. “Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry. “No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters --- but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.” “Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered. Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. “Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again --- doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.”

  “So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,” he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”

** I don't believe Crouch would be the type to be afraid of using Voldemort's name, at least during the First War and he uses it when the moment is opportune. However his son's trial was a very sensitive one, not only because his reputation was tarnished but because the crimes of which BCJ was accused were really atrocious and against two highly appreciated members of the community, so it would only make sense that he would be respectful towards those that did not feel comfortable with Voldemort's name.

When Crouch shows up mad in the Forbidden Forest, he's been under the Imperius Curse for a while, likely placed by either his son or Wormtail, who were servants of Voldemort, and as his servants usually refer to him as "the Dark Lord", I would assume that he picked it up from them.
