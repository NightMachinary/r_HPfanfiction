in order to kill Voldemort, everyone who has the mark must die. Including the spy for the Order (Snape), and children (Draco...). Moral dilemmas ahead.

amputation of limbs proved to be unsuccessful. ... for some reason or other.


** At that point I feel like you just turn him into a shoe or something. He might still be technically alive but he's not going to be doing much, and it's better than killing all the reformed death eaters... How many were there? Oh really? Just Snape? Okay never mind, not much of a moral dilemma unless he starts marking innocent people tbh.

Of course, at the point of half blood Prince where draco's been marked, knock him out and turn him into sumo underwear works.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Damn that's a great idea.

It's like a version of the trolley problem. Especially if you throw in factors like, maybe, no one can take the Dark Mark unwillingly but of course you can always regret it after. Or what if the Dark Mark has a corruptive influence and anyone marked eventually goes evil, but it turns out that many Death Eaters had had it put on unwillingly.

** /If Looks Could Kill/ linkffn(11572455) had a pretty good take on the moral dilemma.

#+begin_quote
  Scrimgeour gasped. "You don't mean to say---"

  "...That the reason each Death Eater had to earn the Dark Mark with a murder was so that Voldemort could tie the magic they used to his soul with a modified form of the horcrux ritual, thus keeping his soul on the mortal plane as long as even one Death Eater remained alive?" Harry interrupted, somehow managing to get that all out in one breath. "Short answer: yeah, pretty much."

  Dumbledore slumped into one of the chairs that sat opposite of the Minister's desk. "So Severus always had to die," he murmured.

  "Yeah, a bit ironic, isn't it?" Harry sneered. "Considering how you were probably planning to sacrifice me, thinking that I was a horcrux."
#+end_quote

I'll grant you there's an ethical difference between a voluntary sacrifice and an unwilling execution... But I don't think it's nearly as important as the ethical difference between an innocent child and a murdering terrorist.

Of course, if the Dark Mark /doesn't/ require murder, /then/ there might be a moral dilemma. IIRC there's nothing in canon about the process, either the actual magic or Voldemort's willingness to bestow it. So if there's 100 Death Eaters, and 99 of them have committed crimes worthy of the death penalty... Is it ethical to sacrifice someone who is technically innocent?

** It only pretends to be a moral dilemma. Otherwise: I have an army of 100 soldiers, all children aged 15-17. I hold a stadium of 10,000 people hostage and execute a hostage on a random basis. If left alone, hundreds, maybe a thousand will die. Do you do nothing?

Nope. 100 dead vs a thousand? Every police/military organization, including most churches, will say you have the moral obligation to attack and kill all of my soldiers, regardless of their ages.
