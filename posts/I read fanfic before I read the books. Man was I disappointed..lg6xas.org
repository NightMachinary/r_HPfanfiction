When HP came out my mom read the first book said it was poorly written and handed me Lord of the Rings to read instead. I shrugged and worked my through other novels. Later on I discovered FanFiction.Net and my favorite author at the time had some HP fics that I enjoyed. So I started reading in that fandom and really enjoyed most of the works I found. Then when I was a Jr. in college I had to debate YA books that were turned into films and my partner picked HP so I read the books for the first time. Y'all should give yourselves a pat on the back. Because Mama was not wrong.


** Man, I really want to know what fics you're reading that are as good as the canon series. Don't get me wrong there are some extremely talented writers on here but I don't think I've ever read a story that I thought was /so/ much better than the entire canon series that I would be /actively disappointed/ with JKR's work.

*** No full length fanfic captures the same feeling I get from canon of school mystery and magic mixed together. There are several that come close and there are oneshots that do provide snippets of that feeling, but nothing to the extent of canon. Fanfic is a wonderful thing, but it really doesn't and cannot replace the books.

  Yeah, there's a definite divide between JKR and Tolkien (especially when using PS as a comparison) at times, though you could argue that the target audiences were different between the two franchises. I don't think it's fair to compare what started off as mainly a children's book to a heavy series with complex narrative and all that.
#+end_quote

If you want to compare Rowling and Tolkien, you should be looking at The Hobbit, not LotR. All your criticisms about PS being shallow and whatnot apply just as much to The Hobbit. And that's fine, because they're children's books.

***** HP has shit world building and is a vastly different read when you are older than 15 than it is when one is a kid. The reason there is such a massive amt of fanfiction for HP is because it's a skeleton of a world, which is why there are so many fanon concepts and so many plot holes that get pointed out in fanfics. On the other hand Tolkien's legendarium (because honestly the Silmarillion is better than Lotr in many aspects) is considered the pinnacle of a fantasy world. We'll take one example- the story of Turin Turambar from the silmarillion. It's a couple chapters total, but that tale evokes more emotion than any of the HP books post-Prisoner of Azkaban. The characters, the way they play their parts in this cohesive grand tale being played out and the depths of all these stories... it's an intangible quality that hp just doesn't have. I'm not hating on Hp, far from it; I love the series and it's what got me into reading as a whole. But it's value is in reading it while you are a child, and then maybe again as a teen. But overall, it's very much a simple story, which makes it more accessible to the younger audience.

Then my friend gave me the boxed set of the five books that were out (because she wanted me to read them and I told her I would if they were in front of me) and after that the movies disappointed me.

Might be better now with distance. Chronicles of Narnia were like that for me, too. Everybody hyped them up and I was disappointed when I read the books, so when the first movie came out, I made a point of avoiding chatter and not re-reading the books. Loved that one.

** As many people have stated, Harry Potter started out as a children's series (and maybe went a bit YA with the last 3 or 4). It got so many children interested in reading which probably got a whole generation to start thinking more in general. Despite being written for children, we were still exposed to important mature themes (grief, politics, discrimination, etc.). Having a main character I loved go through so much loss certainly made my losses seem a little less lonely.

When I was seven and we had to read one-on-one to the teacher, I hated it so much I'd pretend to read the whole thing but in reality I'd skip several paragraphs ahead every page (and she somehow never noticed lol.) When I was eight my teacher read us Harry Potter... and I spent the rest of school obsessed with reading to the point I'd sneak books into class to read under the desk, haha. I can't imagine how narrow-minded and (probably) unintelligent I'd be if J. K. Rowling hadn't given us HP!

*** There are some really exceptional HP fanfictions though...

And quite a lot of them that have very high quality overall, either technically or in regards to storytelling. And with the vast number of fanfics, and the great variability even between the quality ones, you can always find fics that you like better than the original as long as you try to look for them.

And if your standard is set based on the quality fanfics you like? Of course you're likely to get disappointed from the original.

I know that, but proportionally, comparing to how many fanfiction the OP must have stumbled into overall out there, this is like a very small fraction. For them to form this idea... And this "standard" is kind of a cheat, because most of those fics aren't actually /improving/ the books themselves, they are expanding the universe or story, specific concepts or characters they wish JKR had explored more (or better), usually in detriment of others that they don't mind so much. So when you get to the canon and the fics you liked prioritized, well, what you like, maybe it's not so much that the fics were actually better than the source material.

Doesn't matter, you remember the GOOD ones. Even more importantly, if you have someone good recommending, or stumble on the right favorite list, you can easily end up with mostly quality fics.

Bullshit and rubbish. The rough outline of the books may be a decent story if you don't look too closely, but the potential far surpasses the actual quality. And there are LOTS of people who write quality fanfiction.

And there are lots of people who do not manage to write as well, but still manages to come up with excellent creative variations on the original.

And of course personal preference matters, that was part of my point.

** I'm neck deep in a fic I'm writing and have never read beyond the 1st book. Not sure I even finished it, TBH. I could see why people liked it but it wasn't my cup of tea. My dad got further, but kept wondering somewhere during POA why, if this kid was so dang important, why they weren't 1) paying better attention to his whereabouts, and 2) why they weren't at least listening to him.

I picked up some bits and pieces here and there as you do with a popular franchise and that was it until a few years ago when my husband started reading HP fics--and insisting on reading the funny bits out loud to me. He interrupted me so often, I finally demanded he tell me the name of the story and let me read it. (It was Clell65619's original Marriage Contracts fic, if you're interested). It amused me so much that I read more of the author's works, and then moved on to Bobmin356 and kept on going.

So here I am, having only read little excerpts, watched a few scenes from the movies, read tons of fanfic, done a lot of research, and working on my own stories--all without reading the series.

My opinion is that Rowling has some fantastic worldbuilding and a compelling story, but said worldbuilding has some large flaws in it as well and her writing style is a little plebeian at times. She did something right, though, considering the popularity. And almost anything to encourage reading is all right by me.

**** Harry, Hermione, and Ron?

I think she does a pretty good job of their strengths and weaknesses, something fanfic writers are eager to exploit. I do think Ron is the weakest link, and based on the number of Ron-bashing fics, a lot of people would agree; but he also has the potential to come around and pull his weight as an equal member. And while Hermione is usually Harry's most steadfast companion, she has her moments of weakness. Harry himself is shown with his own flaws, something authors sometimes have a problem giving their MCs. For the most part, they're a good blend: intelligence, recklessness, bravery, and good intentions. (I don't care for Ron/Hermione romance, though, despite reading some good stories. I think their personalities as I understand them are better suited as friends. I like Harmony, but I don't insist on it.)

Neville might have been an interesting choice, but I think he might be too diffident, too meek, to have their adventures--especially in the beginning. Seamus seems faster than Ron to shoot his mouth off, and I just don't know enough about Dean to say. Lavender and Parvati likewise, although they don't carry the intellectual weight Hermione does. And it doesn't seem out of the other Houses that you would get this kind of combo.

For better or worse, she just flat out failed at writing a good, believable narrative in a remotely realistic way. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying to themselves, or viewing the series through rose-tinted goggles of their youth.

My biggest problem with the sixth book was that Ron and Hermione acted so out of character not believing Harry and the memories of Tom Riddle which (while pretty cool) felt forced just for the sake of providing his backstory... Dumbledore could have summarized the whole thing in a chapter and I'm pretty sure he didn't need a boy to force a vital memory out of Slughorn (Voldemort had previously broken through powerful memory charms). Also I wished book 7 had more adventures and less drama while camping.

**** You're right about HBP. It's like JKR suddenly remembered 'puberty' was a thing, and decided to make up for the fact that none of the Trio had experienced it to that point in the story. I mean, they had fought an actual battle against terrorists like, 4 months before, but in HBP they suddenly forgot Voldemort existed and could only focus on their hormones? Ugh.

As for being better than most fics, I assume you mean other fantasy books? I'm not sure I would agree. There were and are a lot of good - if not *quite* as popular - fantasy novels on the market, and I'm not talking about small-fry gems that are self-pubbed on Amazon.

If you meant fanfics, though, well... of course haha. JKR had editors and publishers and production companies all helping her finish the story. That they couldn't do a better job of it really doesn't speak very highly of her process. I have no doubt that if you or I had the resources that she did towards the end of the series, we'd be able to make a more coherent concluding plotline.

Frankly, I don't believe that JKR 'had the whole series pre-written' before it got big. I think what is more likely is that she had 3-4 books written, it blew up, and when Book 6 ended she realized she'd written herself into a corner. See, up til the end of Book 5, she was following a fairly standard 'hero's journey', but she abandoned that completely in HBP, leaving no realistic method for the hero to defeat the villain. So she jammed her thumb up her butt and pried loose the deus ex machina that is the Deathly Hallows, then leaned hard on the limited third person-POV to skip the supposed 'war' and focus instead on more teenage angst, culminating in her virginal boy hero not even needing to fight the bad guy to win (non-lethal spell against the guy that slaughtered your entire family. Sigh.).

Truthfully, the scenario I just laid out actually makes JKR a much better writer than saying "oh she followed the plan she had all along". If she actually were stuck and just needed any ol' shit to finish the story, I respect her a lot more than if the garbage we got in HBP/DH were the original plot. Hell, by the time she was writing HBP she was already richer than the Pope. I doubt she was as focused on putting out a good product as she was on finally enjoying success.

***** Good analysis! And by fics, I meant fanfiction. I know that the activity is something that some people do in their spare time for fun but there are people who are really good out there and actually can produce quality or creative work without an army of editors behind them. However to say that fanfiction puts the original series to shame is a bit of a stretch.

I agree with you that JK might have not thought the whole plot through from the beginning but I would imagine she would at least have a skeleton plot for it. It's really important when you embark on this journey to know where you're starting from and where you need to get and at least set some milestones along the way. Otherwise you end up like George R. R. Martin whom I believe is quite burned out by his story and he's struggling with writer's block or something, otherwise I can't imagine why it would take him so much to write a book (no matter how perfectionist you are). Anyways the point of my blabber is that I think JK had an idea of the plot and the direction she wanted to take it in but probably didn't think all things through. Especially since she often claimed that when she started writing the books she thought she was writing a children's story and did not expect to have millions of people pick apart her every single word.

As for the final confrontation I genuinely enjoy it that way. If I wanted to see a confrontation of brute force and raw power, I'd read an action novel or something. The idea of good triumphing over evil based not on raw power but on superior moral values is quite common in folk tales as well. We also see this trope in Tolkien's works where both Smaug and Sauron are forces of nature that the protagonists don't stand a chance against (I haven't read the Silmarillion so I don't know about that one), yet with some trickery and some favorable circumstances they win. So I thought that JK drove a really good point when every time love was used against Voldemort, it would represent a point of his undoing. Snape's love made Lily an unnecessary casualty, her love for Harry enabled the sacrificial protection, Harry's love for his friends allowed him to willingly allow himself to be killed and thus making Voldemort impotent against the people that were fighting him. After all it's pointed that Dumbledore's failure was the fact that it allowed the elder wand to continue having masters and I think he didn't intend for Voldemort to end up killing himself with it. He says in OotP that there are worse things you can do to someone than kill them and forcing him to see that all his magical knowledge and power was useless against people, while awaiting death would have been a far more suiting punishment.

Edit: also forgot to mention that the theory that Harry would have to pull off a sacrifice similar to his mother for the sake of the world was speculated even before OotP and there were quite a few people who thought that Harry would die.

** HP uses the rule of cool to the point where it almost destroys the story. And not just once, but a ridiculous number of times.

Convenient plotdevices appears ALL THE DAMN TIME and then disappear never to be heard of again.

Worldbuilding is outright stupid beyond belief.

Characters act according to plot requirements, not based on realism.

There's good reason why so many fanfics play around with Dumbledore being the ACTUAL dark lord to be vanquished from the prophecy. He's either evil or an idiot. Not to mention being the primary cause of magical nazis being the major power in magical England.

The degree of persistent WTF!?!? is just staggering.

It's one of the main reasons there's so much HP fanfiction, lots and lots of potential in story, setting and characters, but so terribly executed that you can barely begin reading the books or watching the movies before you get an irresistible urge to write a BETTER(or simply just SANE) version.

** I mean, i absolutey love the Harry Potter books. But reading the first 2 nowadays is kinda painful (I'm a senior at uni). But I read it for the first time when I was 8 and I was 100% bewitched by it. It's fantastic how it captures the attention of kids /because/ it's simply written.

As the books went on, it got more complex and, honestly, despite the continuity errors and whatnot, it's a really good read if you want something not that heavy, that you can understand easily but that don't sound childish.

If i had read it for the first time by the time I was already at uni, I'd probably not like it as well, hell. There are some fics out there (Innocent series, Draco Malfoy and the Mirror of Ericydue series, A Marauder's Plan) that I now rather read, compared to the books, because honestly it's more complex, darker at times, more detailed. It just fits my taste better than what she wrote, mainly when talking about secondary characters like Ginny, the twins, Draco and even, in some of them, characters we only know the name: Theo Nott, Blaise Zabine, Daphne and/or Astoria Greengrass... While Rowling gave them names, we give them life. I think it's fantastic. I'm down to say that now, I much rather read fanfiction than the canon.

To prefer Tolkien over Harry Potter is to prefer blood purity based society over one that fights a blood purity based society.

Tolkien is basically a bible for casteism and blood purity.

There are many HP fanfics that showcase Slytherin POV and the importance of tradition and BLOOD rituals. In them, magic only exists because of blood sacrifices. I always wondered who liked such fics.

***** I dunno. Specially since lotr is a classical example of good beating evil, showing us that even if we are far from being perfect as a whole, there still is a lot of good, and hope, and happiness to be found in humanity. Dunno what this dude is smoking, lmao
