I remember I started reading Linkao3(A Brother to Basilisks) when it was like 300K but then decided to wait till it was done to continue. Well I just noticed it is finished at 155 chapters and 613,877 words! I know what I'll be reading for the rest of the Summer!

****** That way when someone asks what you're reading you can rightly say "Harry Potter" without going into details.

** I have mixed feelings about Lomonaaeren. Only actually like one of their stories. My issues with A Brother to Basilisks started when teenage boys are told there are /more/ deadly creatures just waiting to hatch and not one of them freaks out - they go straight to “let's smash them!”
