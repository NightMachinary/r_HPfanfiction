Hi!

I've kept an eye out, but never found any fanfic descriptions of a scandinavian wizarding world? I'm swedish and I've never really found the JKR descriptions of the wizarding world outside th UK believable. Any suggestions of fanfics which describe the european wizarding world, or in particular the scandinavian countries? I have a draft of an idea myself that I might share in time but I want to know what else is out there.


** I'm in the process of writing down my thought on a Swedish diagion alley - type place, would love some input.

** Thanks to everyone who's responded! I will read through your excellent suggestions :) I have a plan for a short guide to a swedish magical community, I will be writing it up and posting it when I get a chance. There wont be much of a story in there, just an idea of how a Swedish/nordic community might work so that others have something to build on if they want to :)

** [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/]]

A part of this story takes place in Iceland and features its specific magic. (I know some don't consider Iceland to be a part of Scandinavia, but I like this fic too much not to share.)

** In Midnight Sun by Vanir, Harry moves to some Scandinavian country, becomes known as Harald, and bangs some mythical creatures I don't remember the name of. Supposedly written by a guy with a degree in Norse mythology. Fair warning though, it's pretty üëâüëåüí¶

** This 8th year, time-travel fic has Hermione and Theodore Nott eventually going to Finland (and France) to meet Theo's mother's family. The magical theory and cultural aspects are interesting, the Varinens family are bonded to an old god, and for most of the fic, Hermione and Theo pretend to be siblings to survive in the past while trying to prevent changes to the future.

**** That's actually really neat. Years ago a friend and I were thinking about a Scandinavian/Nordic Magical world, but inside of the mountain chain that goes between Norway and Sweden, kind of like your average dwarven kingdom, or at least that's where the school was going to be.
