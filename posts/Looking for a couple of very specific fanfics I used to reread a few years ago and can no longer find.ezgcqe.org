:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so this is embarrassing but I'm going crazy looking for these. It's my favorite pair of smutty fanfictions. It was a James x Lily fanfic. One was written from James pov and had him dreaming about lily giving him a blowjob in a broom cupboard I think. The other was Lily's pov and had her dreaming about what her ideal first time with him would be. There might have been a third fanfic with them actually doing it and I remember it being in the astronomy tower maybe but that's even more hazey than the rest. All written by the same author on fanfiction.net and supposed to be read as a set. The whole point was for them to be a sort of character study through the differences in their dream sexual experience with each other. I haven't been able to find them for years. I even asked a tumblr blog who's moderators specialize in finding obscure Jily fanfics for people without any luck (jilyarchive). Anyone know what I'm talking about that can send me a link or copy? Dm me if you're less weird than me and don't want to post it publicly

Hope I'm not breaking any rules, I only just found you guys...


** You might want to change the tag to â€˜What's that fic?' since you're looking for specific Fics. Sorry I don't know which ones you're referring too tho.
