sorry about this being too specific, I know people don't like that. if you have a list you can post it and I will go through it myself.

- Snape mentor fic to Harry

- it has to be in childhood, age 4-10. most of the fics are after fifth year, or before or after first. or baby. I want Harry to still be a kid, but remember the Dursleys.

- no severitus (Snape being his biological father) - I don't get the need for this

- no AU (so no girlHarry or noVoldy or muggleAU or Lily lives, ///no horcruxes are fine or Voldy doesn't go back since that happened after first book)

- the fic is about Harry getting used to live with Snape and/or vice versa, so no time skips to his hogwarts years. so just... an abused child being housed with a mean Snape.

- I really prefer Snape not being mushy, but that is subjective so not a requirement.

- Harry needs to live with Snape. either in his house or at hogwarts. so no blood ward is too important so Snape only visits him.

/////

I feel like the only fic that fits is 8 yo Harry in Snape's promise and that is not being updated.


** There are a lot of great stories on potions and snitches. You can choose Harry's age range, or what kind of Snape you prefer.

** Okay, I have several Snape-raises-young-Harry stories, but you specified that Snape should still be "mean" and not mushy, which eliminated most of them. It does, however, leave this one:

#+begin_quote
  Eight year old Harry was cursed with rotten guardians. Snape is a wizard with an unusually cold disposition, which he has for a reason. Can Severus give the childhood he was never privileged enough to have to the little one?
