I dont even know if this fix is real or made up in my dreams.

I only remember one scene. harry and Tony are dating or married. Basically, in the scene in iron man where stane paralyzes Tony with the device stane also uses it on harry but it does something and harry is dying. So Tony is paralyzed and watching harry die.

That's all I remember that's why I dont think it's real, but if it is I would greatly appreciate if you could link it.
