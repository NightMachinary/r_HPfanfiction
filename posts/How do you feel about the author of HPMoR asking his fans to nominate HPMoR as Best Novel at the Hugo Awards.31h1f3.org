** It seems a little over-the-top, to me. People /have/ pointed out a lot of flaws in the book (e.g., [[http://np.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][here,]] by another accomplished writer of fanfiction). I'm not the biggest science-fiction buff--but, even though I like /HPMoR,/ I don't really think it's /quite/ up to the level of /Ancillary Justice/ (2014 winner), /Anathem/ (2009 nominee), or /Blindsight/ (2007 nominee).

It seems they accept works published online, but I somehow doubt they'd accept an unauthorized derivative work.

** I feel like its not going to happen because

1. Its on the level of begging for reviews before publishing the next chapter.

2. Its an unauthorized derivative of an already popular work.

3. Its not actually that good. The main thing going for it is length and controversy.

Maybe after several years of editing and redrafting he should give it a shot, but not in it's current state. And it's also a dick move to /ask/ for nominations, too, now that I think about it.

** I've read Hugo Award winners since The Demolished Man, which can be considered the great-grandfather of cyberpunk.

He certainly has the legion of followers to make a nomination happen, but I don't think it will get that far. HPMoR simply cannot match the quality or originality of non-derivative works. I strongly suspect that he is doing this for one reason: money. According to this [[http://hpmor.com/notes/119/][blog post]] he wants to publish HPMoR in book form. I'm sure it would sell a lot better if he could stamp a Hugo Award Nominee on the cover.

Edit: picked the wrong Bester novel.

**** I'm ambivalent either way if it ever does. The scary part is the /ego/ that was able to convince him that he belongs on the same list as Starship Troopers, Dune, ...And Call Me Conrad, and a host of other /genre-defining/ works.

I noticed that he stated that all profits will go towards a UK charity, but there is a lot of room for him to still make money in the endeavour. Given that:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses

he could easily say that his 'Expenses' for writing HPMoR were 90% of the selling cost of the novel and still keep his word about all 'profits' going towards a charitable cause.

Also morality aside, there's no way JK sanctions another HP book being released because of the precedent it will set and there's no way this one gets published as it is incredibly insulting of the source material.

Assuming fanfiction can get nominated, of course.

** Is something like this allowed? Absolutely! Fan fiction is explicitly included.

From [[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-faq/][the FAQ]]:

#+begin_quote
  *Does “fan writing” mean “fan fiction”?*

  */Fan fiction is fan writing/*, but fan writing covers much, much more. Fan writing includes writing about SF and fantasy, writing about fandom and the fannish life, as well as pretty much any writing about anything that is written to appeal to fans. Fan writing is just about any writing fans do for other fans that they don't get paid for --- including writing this FAQ!
#+end_quote

There is nothing saying a fanfiction of novel length /can't/ be nominated or win.

However...that's not the right category in my opinion. Here's a better [[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/][category]]:

#+begin_quote
  *Best Fan Writer:* This is another person category. Note that it does not just apply to writing done in fanzines. Work published in semiprozines, and even on mailing lists, blogs, BBSs, and similar electronic fora, can be including when judging people for this Award. */Only work in professional publications should not be considered./*
#+end_quote

That way, it is the author being voted on, not the work itself. Might avoid stepping on some toes and bringing up questions not best answered by challenges being brought against this specific work.

Too much self-pimping is usually frowned on, too, so don't expect a good reaction from the majority of long-time voters.

It's allowed in "fan writing" categories, there's nothing about Best Novel.

**** It is a proscriptive rule set, not a prescriptive one. Anything not explicitly disallowed is, it seems, allowed until rules are updated. I couldn't find any rules against novel-length fan writing in "Best Novel," or any other professional or media format requirement other than by date released or modified.

If such an explicit rule exists it would be great if someone could point it out.

But yes, that's clearly not the right category logically speaking, as I suggested. I was attempting to stay positive about the whole thing and make suggestions about how interested parties could proceed, but if it wasn't clear I think it is a bad idea that won't work as currently formulated.

** I am indifferent as to the "morality" of it. All works are derivative of what came before them to varying extents. In that sense, at least fanfic writers are honest enough to acknowledge whom they are stealing from.

Should its fanfic status automatically disqualify it? Well, would you automatically disqualify a Sherlock Holmes story, using characters' names and personalities, but set in a cyberpunk setting and having an original plot? The only relevant difference between that and HPMOR is time, and a decision by some politicians that copyright should last Author's Death + 75 years, as opposed to Publication + 5 years.

However, I think that HPMOR is, as a literary work, not very good. The author's goals --- like those of Ayn Rand in /Atlas Shrugged/ --- were primarily didactic, and everything else, particularly characterization and plot, was subservient to that. Nor was the quality of writing very consistent throughout the book. So, I don't think it deserves a Hugo nomination.

I think I see what you're saying. "There's nothing new under the sun?"

Frankly I do see several shades of the Mabinogi in Harry Potter and several parts of ASOIAF are just Y Mab Darogan.

I wouldn't go this far.

I think the I may have mixed the legal and the colloquial meanings of "derivative [work]" in my original post. Colloquially, we use the adjective "derivative" to mean "unoriginal". The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work][legal term]] refers to a work that uses parts from another work or is based on it in some meaningful way: a film adaptation of a book, a fanfic, a audio sample in a mix, an encyclopedia entry using an illustration, and so on. I was unconsciously using its legal meaning.

What I contend is that practically every work --- and literally every mass-market work --- borrows elements from those that came before it. I don't know Mabinogi, but most of the Potterverse setting /is/ a recombination of elements from mythology, folklore, and fantasy; and I do not think less of fanfic for being more explicit about its sources.
