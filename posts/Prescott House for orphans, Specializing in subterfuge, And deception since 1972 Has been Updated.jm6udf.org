** I am assuming this is a self-promotion? If so, a link to the original prompt would have been nice and provided this with a link to Reddit, since unconnected shill is usually downvoted to Hell around these parts. Sometimes even deservedly.

  Please note the story was inspired by a prompt on reddit. All credit for the original prompt goes to the original poster. My story is just inspired by their original idea.
