Any fics focused or involving pirates, can be magical or non-magical. All ships and lengths welcome.


** linkffn(Rocking the Boat by DerLaCroix) involves magical pirates. The Black family riches are attributed to piracy. A lot of action happens on a hidden island where descendants of pirates live.

There's not much in the way of actual piracy, though, if that's what you are looking for.

When the crew stumble across Captain Sirius' ex-lover, Remus, Hermione starts to doubt her place on board and at Sirius' side. That is, unless they can work something out. Written for Firefly.

We talking vessels or cuddling?

As a side note in those fics where Harry starts accumulating last names I always wanted him to be Black-Bones-Potter. Perfect pirating name.

**** Pretty good name for a hook hand kinda pirate. Although that is another thing I've always wanted, Griphook to have a shitton of various hooks he uses. Like a murder hook, a paper sorting hook (I imagine something like a paper spike), etc. I don't care if it is the same hook all the time, so long as it is referred to as thus.

Yes I know that's something weird to want. But dammit, I do want it.
