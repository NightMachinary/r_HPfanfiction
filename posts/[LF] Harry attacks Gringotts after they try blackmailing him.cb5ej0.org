It was a one-shot in a series of one-shots that had a goblin try to blackmail Harry. It mentioned Merlin attacking the goblins and decimating them, a chief warlock doing the same, and their gradually weakening battalions.

It ends with Harry attacking Gringotts

  COMPLETE. When Harry is called to Gringotts Bank to meet with the goblin Boneclaw regarding financial matters, things go unexpectedly. Harry is furious. Will Boneclaw come to regret his actions? Goblin bashing. AU after OotP. Oneshot.

**** It's a favorite of mine, but I knew of another that I just linked.

Seriously, Goblins being treated as kind and benevolent is far from canon, so fics that depict them in a negative light get favorited by me.
