** Arguably every single Naruto/HP story where Harry is somehow Naruto that takes place in the elemental nations. Considering that section is basically all Harry is either Naruto, a blood relative of Naruto, or a blood relative of Sasuke it won't be hard to find one.

Mind you the prophecy in Naruto is just slightly less predictable than the one in Harry Potter, I mean who would have guessed that Harry must kill Voldemort /s. Although in Naruto the prophecy is a lot less important to the plot than the one in HP and a lot more forgettable imo.

[[/spoiler]["He [The Great Toad Sage] foretold that the Child of the Prophecy would be a student of Jiraiya that would bring a great revolution to the world of the ninja. Jiraiya's actions would determine if this revolution would be for the world's salvation or the world's destruction."]]

  [Thing you need hidden](/spoiler)

Edit: Forgot to say /spoiler isn't universal, some subs use /sp instead of /spoiler. Most subs where spoilers are an issue will tell you how to deal with them on the sidebar. Here it's under rule 5.

** Linkffn(6964817)

Appropriately titled "Chosen Ones". It's a well written and still active Dune/GO crossover.
