Tom Riddle's past isn't supposedly that bad, especially with fanfic Harry abuse. I love the idea that Harry would go down a darker path, given that abuse by the Dursleys and his social ostracization would do that to someone. Harry is ridiculously smart and powerful even in canon, he just doesn't show it as much. In fact, I doubt a realistic Harry would have been so headstrong and foolish as in the books, certainly not as naive or passive towards the things happening around him. While I do enjoy the overpowered Harry fic, having guitily indulged and written a few myself, I think having Harry be far more cruel and evil, a Lord Voldemort but worse, would be a really cool concept. For him to be more powerful than the other students, but not so much he could walk up an AK Dumbledore without breaking a sweat. I think this is even possible if James and Lily were alive and the WBWL trope is used. I don't like stories with romance in the traditional sense, especially where he basically becomes a weak partner for some OP perfect OOC girl, or where he is Voldemort or Snape for some reason (Eww! The age gap and their horrid personalities, just no. One looks like a corpse, and the other has greasy hair, treats Harry like garbage because of a decade old school grudge, and sucks in general) More cookies for you if Harry pretends to fall in love to manipulate. If you have any stories like this HMU!


** While it's a (short) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/19/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][one-shot]], Harry declares to Umbridge and McGonogall during the careers interview that the recent actions of the Ministry have forced him to decide on becoming a Dark Lord.

This single action leads to Voldie's defeat, much to Madam Bones' amusement.

** I haven't read it yet, so I don't know how well it meets your request, but linkffn(Dark Repercussions by Jessicaa15) has an evil Harry.

linkffn(The Birth of Evil by DisobedienceWriter) may also suit your tastes.

And it's crack, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rise of the Evil Overlord by Maestro Hazard) is fun and has a Dark Lord Harry.

  Revised! Harry has found out that the light has been keeping many of secrets from him that push him over the edge. He returns to Hogwarts after the death of his godfather seemingly unaware of the light's manipulations, but in the shadows the notorious assassin Sang Lys has arose. Dark!Evil!Harry. Major OOC!

Marked By Death[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23711119/chapters/56933935][Marked by Death]]

Death's touch was an accident. He had just wanted to see his master. He was bending over the crib, the baby wiggled and Death noted that his diaper was coming undone. Unthinkingly, he pressed one cold finger against the strip, pasting it back together, and Hadrian James Potter's entire destiny became undone.
