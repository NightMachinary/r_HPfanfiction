When I read the first few chapters of the first book again and compared it to the later books, I realised that there was an almost instant switch from magic have a fantastical and quirky nature to gritty storytelling. Can someone recommend any fics that have magic being interesting and it being something that makes people wonder and not just an everyday use or 'wartime tool'.

EDIT:

Also, it could also be fics that have unique and interesting USES for magic.

EDIT EDIT:

WOW! Wasn't expecting any responses at all, seeing that this is my first post and any posts on my other account on other subreddits never got any traction. Will read through these! Some of the recs I have in my list for other reasons, but ig that shows that they are good fics! Thanks for the award!


** does anyone else feel like we've over analysed magic? for me the appeal of magic is that it isn't scientific, you can't analyse it or completely predict it. One of my greatest problems with JKRs system is that magic has a set of strict rules that you CANT break, having all those limitations sucks all the fun out of it.

*** I think Rowling's magical system is one of the reasons her Fandom is one of the biggest (or the biggest).

You aren't hampered by rules. You can let your mind go wild.

I've noticed most hard magic systems don't have nearly as much fanfiction as soft magic systems. Look at Sanderson books as an example.

*** What are those strict rules? We only hear about not being able to conjure up good food out of thin air. Rowling's magic system is honestly one of the most broken in terms of power. Wizards casually conjure matter. They manipulate fate, time, abstract ideas like love and secrets and job positions. It's absurdly powerful.

**** i think i haven't explained myself well, it's less about it having strict rules and more about the rules being there? i agree that the power levels are ridiculous, there isn't even a canonical limit to how much you can cast. What bothers me is the whole magic can be taught by standardised ways and all you need to do is wave your wand and know the words. I understand that to make a magic system you need to set down rules, and there needs to be a school for the story to happen, but magic is only incorporated in the most superficial ways. Harry Potter is, at its most core level, a boarding school story. That's why the books end when they stop going to boarding school (or when they are supposed to, anyway). I really like fics where they give magical explanations to things that don't make sense in canon, and i feel like it really makes a difference, because then wizards aren't just people with wands, they have different thought processes that come to be by being raised in a magical world. Like how some people explain why the Ministry thought Sirius was after Harry in POA, that it would be kind of a symbolic act to kill the killer of his master (it's far better explained in some posts, trust me, it makes you believe in ‘wizard logic'). I could go on a long ramble about how this would make the whole muggle raised/magic raised debacle much more significant, but i'm going to stop now and need my rambling thoughts to myself

EDIT: sorry for the epic rant without paragraphs, these aren't ruminated thoughts, they are straight out of the idea-oven, so they may be a little non sensical.

That's not true, though. You need to learn the theory of magic as well. Harry reads three books just to learn the Summoning Charm, for example. One of the first things you learn about magic in the first book is this:

/There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words./

This kind of symbolic magic is present in the books. There's Lily's sacrifice. Ron retrieving the Sword of Gryffindor from the frozen pond makes him a better candidate for destroying the Locket. There are magically significant numbers.

/He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts./

Deathly Hallows.

I do wish Rowling had provided more, but it certainly is present.

***** You do have an interesting point, which is that the magic systems in the book has a fundamental conflict with itself:

- It is supposed to be mystical and whimsical, because that is the setting that the books strive for
- It's to be taught in a boring, 7 year long high school, that's comparable to a normal school experience (graded theory tests, homework, ...)

These two facts do result in a severe conflict, because they're incompatible.

In the books it's resolved mostly by alluding to the existence of rules and laws, without specifying them.

There are 5 exceptions to Gwamps law of transfiguration, so there is a law -- but it's not stated, it's alluded. It's alluded that spells can be created, but not how. It's alluded that you can invent potions and make them more efficent, that there are rules -- but these rules are never explained. Goblins do have some magic, so do house-elfs, but they're different. How? Oh, well, let's go to the next chapter.

In other words: there's more magic, there are explanations. But they are always just around the corner, behind that door that's slightly ajar, but you can't quite open.

This fandom, however, isn't satisfied with just allusion, so they tend to analyze it quite a bit, and then fill the gaps. And, as expected, the fandom tends to overflill. They replace some canon magic, but they also add much more magical theory than needed for the story -- and because the authors are a bit amateurish, you end up with magical cores.

The inherently conflicted magical system of Harry Potter is really interesting, imo -- and you can keep it quite mysterious and whimsical, and still analyze it. But that's something an author needs to want.

If you want an author that walks this balance, stories by Taure get the nuance right, and I'd also say AutumnSouls does it (although I do beta for her, so I'm biased there)

****** I agree that this seems to be the point, more than that JKR's magic has “rules.” It's that in many ways, her wizards are just muggles with wands. Why do they have plumbing pipes in Hogwarts, for example? Wizards aren't... /wizardly/ enough. I hate when an author has someone like Ron or Draco say, in response to Harry or Hermione doing something the “hard” way, something like, “did you forget you have magic?” Witches and wizards raised wholly in the Wizarding world shouldn't think that way, as if there's anything other than the magical way of doing things.

Two stories that come to mind in this regard are Transfigurations by Resonant, a very old story, from way before DH (2003 I think?) - Draco has temporarily lost his magic, and there's a scene where he has to get out of his robes, which have many tiny buttons, and he says:

/”It's not enough to unmage me. They have to deprive me of all taste and style as well," Malfoy grumbled, pushing Harry's robe off his shoulders. "At least I've got some useful Muggle experience," he added, starting on the shirt. "My mother would have been quite unable to undo a button with her hands, even to get at a nineteen-year-old gamekeeper."/

I always loved that, the idea that wizards and witches would have millions of wildly impractical tiny buttons that they didn't even know how to do by hand, because they used spells. Why, after all, would you use your hands if you could use a wand? That's the sense of magic being...magical, and wizards being /different/ and doing things differently because they have magic, that is missing from JKR (and most fanfic, unsurprisingly), and I think it's what OP is getting at.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/59676]])

There's also a story called... ugh, what is it. Oh! Saving Draco Malfoy, by Dayspring, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/228288/chapters/346381]]). It is also an older story, probably pre-DH. I don't remember all the details, but in that story, the fact that muggle-raised wizards and witches lack “faith in magic” and continue to be slightly skeptical of new things that seem impossible is something Harry feels to be a weakness, as compared with the students who are magical-world raised, as they all train together for the upcoming fight with Voldemort.

Anyway, it's hard to blame fanfic authors, who are just following JKR's lead. But I too would love to see more stories that take make the magical world...more magical. More /different/ from the non-magical world. Like, not using wands to turn on the oven, or wash the dishes in the sink - but not having ovens or sinks at all.

Edited: I just read the comment below saying it sounds like you're looking for older (pre-OOTP) fics, and looking at my own links in this comment, I have to agree. Saving Draco Malfoy is maybe not pre-OOTP, though maybe, but definitely pre-HBP, and also involves elf magic and bond magic, etc. And there are old stories like Tissue of Silver by fearlessdiva, which has interesting and creative uses of magic. Canon really did shut a lot of that down.

******* It makes sense, though. Wizards don't use magic from birth. They only begin learning it at 11, and even then they wouldn't be good at it. So they /are/ like muggles growing up.

It'd also be smart to not rely on magic for everything. You never know when you can find yourself without a wand. Pretty sure canon mentions this too.

And many wizards just aren't good at all magic. Tonks has trouble with basic household charms.

** It sounds like what you're looking for are fanfictions written before Order of the Phoenix was published. That's around the time the world went from fantasy and magic and wonder to McGuffin hunts and torture-porn and teenage melodrama.

There are some amazing fics that were at least started before that, which don't have Horcruxes or Hallows or Prophecy Spheres, but instead have epic-scale magic. Wastelands of Time is a great example of that, despite being a wartime story. Stories involving fey magic tend to have that kind of thing, too, but depending on when they were written they can also edge too far toward McGuffin hunts to stick to canon.

If you find any great ones, I'd love to hear about them because I'm always looking for more of this type of story, too.

Linkao3(Certain Dark Things)

Certain Dark Things is one of my favorite fics right now and I love the magical feel of it. It's a fem Harry (Harriet) and she's fascinated by all things magic. I love how the author describes things and the tone of most of the story is light. It's currently up to third year and it's updated once, sometimes twice, a week.

On fanfiction.net I love DisobedienceWriter's fics. Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt) is a pretty magical one.

Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) does away with most of the grit and preserves a lot of quirks and whimsy. Dumbledore is great fun, brilliant and crazy and never letting you know which of those two traits is leading. Voldemort is a minor detail. Most of the story is about spending seven years learning magic and having fun with it.

The author has quite a bit of experience with other work, and it shows in the writing quality.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.

Edit to add a bit more about the fic: Also, Hogwarts has more cool magical secrets. One set of those - the other Founders having their own hidden rooms - was setting up to be a major plot point, though it hasn't been completed and the fic hasn't updated since 2015

** This is a big trend in a lot of fandoms. I'm not a literature student so I don't know the real name, but my headcannon is the "calcification of magic": soft magic systems get harder the more "successful" the franchise becomes.

[Sory for long post]

0) ex machinas are seen as amateurish or childish, so writers avoid them at all costs. Avoiding ex machina has 2 options: a) foreshadow and set up thematic/character/plot motifs to build up to it (soft magic) or b) reader satisfaction is based on the readers understanding of the world and how magic works (hard magic). The hard option is easier

1) big fandoms get multimedia spinoffs, especially games. Most RPG games use a magic system similar to DnD, which is incredibly "hard" magic (dice rolls, magica stats, skill trees). Very few games use a very soft magic system (Senhua?, Witcher cut scenes?) because not only is it hard to code, it's difficult to get players to use

1b) in film, hard magic is easier to choreograph for fx, especially fight scenes. Ghibli has very soft magic, but it's animated (and early ones have not speaking characters as unmoving backdrop)

*** 3) manipulative!Dumbledore and bashing. Older fics that wanted Drarry or Dramione needed "Die for our ship" or "Ron the death eater" tropes. As time went on, Dumbledore bashing couldn't be ignored. If you stop thinking like a story (themes, arcs, symbols), and act like a concerned real person, a lot of "good" characters do horrible or horribly neglectful things.

The Dursleys' abuse in cannon is never violently dangerous, but to a contemporary audience it's beyond the pale, and those who knowingly leave Harry there (Dumbles, McGonagall, Weasleys) are uncomfortably close to enabling abusers.

But for English children's literature, the trope is so obvious that no one noticed at first. The fish doesn't notice the water. Of course the chosen one has Cinderella step-parents! It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

This is why Hermione or Ron can't be the hero(ine). They come from loving families, so they are inappropriate thematically to gain a secret power. Even Narnia or Blighton, the heroes are evacuees or boarders (psychoanalysis of distant families in English upper class is another rabbit hole!)

But Harry's neglectful childhood is thematic soft magic, more powerful than auror training until your wand is an ak47.

Fans and writers do not want to write something that feels like condoning child abuse. But writing a very soft magic system requires thinking in stories, where the Grangers adopting Harry would weaken his thematic arc so Voldemort would win.

Harry chosing to die, and seeing dead Sirius resolves the conflict between Voldemort's fear of death and the power of love. [More recently, since HPMoR and the Dragon Tyrant, readers might disagree that death is to be accepted and the search for immortality leads to evil, but in storytelling terms choosing family over immortality is primordial, rooted in Chivalry, folklore and Gilgamesh]

Ursula leGuin, Dianna Wynn Jones, Ghibli and Gandalf are modern examples of soft magic done well. Earthsea and Chrestomanci are good for exploring worlds where magic is used everyday, affects lives, careers, housework etc, not just abstract grand thematic struggles (though actual plot points are resolved by such intangible arcs)
