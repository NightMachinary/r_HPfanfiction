Whenever I happen across a story that has Harry playing the piano like in Hauntingly and Broken Mind, Fractured Soul or dancing like in Blurred Reality, I am /glee personified/. Creative self-expression is thrilling, and through the progatonist's dance or paintbrush or hands, I get to live vicariously. Pls rec me some of your favorites. I'm not picky about pairings or the focus character. Thank you in advance, friends. â™¡


** A fairly large aspect of this story is Harry's carpentry and painting [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Muggle-Raised-Champion]]

  Harry has had a hard life, harder than anyone knows, even himself. What happens when Snape finds out that Harry's mind couldn't take the strain and fractured, leaving the BWL with MPD? PreHBP COMPLETE!

**** Oh shit, I somehow forgot about linkffn(Ganymede Rising). Harry isn't the musician, but the other main character is.

  A slightly different take on indy!Harry. A summer vacation leads Harry to do some exploring someplace not so far afield. Sixteen, bored, and faced with the newest threat to his sanity - the cute waitress. Music and a little mayhem. Post 5th, slight AU.
