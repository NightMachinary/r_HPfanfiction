I looking to write a evil female Harry fanfic. I wanted to show her decent to darkness slowly. I don't want her to be immediately evil. How would I go about this, and how does dark arts affect a person and what constitutes as a dark arts.


** With any character, start with what he or she wants and how he or she intends to get it. Saying a person is "evil" doesn't mean anything to anyone; it's their actions in pursuit of a goal that defines the character. Unless you're writing a sadist or something similar, even the bad guys have a goal that the pain/suffering they're inflicting is advancing them toward.

Furthermore, until your character wants something you don't really have a plot to your story.

** The easiest solution for your problem would of course be to make her choose the path of dark magic to defeat Voldemort. Fire with fire and all that.

Evil is effective because it lacks morals. Lets look at the example of Malfoy. A good Harry defends himself with words and maybe a bit of a prank here and there. Your evil version could think that letting malfoy have a little accident from the Astronomy tower could be the ideal solution to your problem. If you don't want to go to the extreme of murder too soon, then maybe the payback pranks could be of a sadistic nature.

My personal take on an evil Harry (also fem!Harry) was to make her emulate what she knows - the Dursleys, with the added magic. She longs for control and wants to establish dominance wherever she goes, by violence, abuse and humiliation.

My fic started after the ministry battle, and the main twist there was that she was Bellatrix and Sirius Blacks daughter and that she used the Crucio on Malfoy instead of Bellatrix. The curse worked and she got a taste for it at that point. Malfoy swallows his tongue due to the spell and dies. The fact that she has killed a man doesn't sit well with her Gryffindor peers and she is alienated from them. She begins to write letters to her mother, who has defected from Voldemort after the revelation of having a daughter. This is basically where the main story starts. Ivy has crossed certain thresholds and uses her new found ruthlessness to establish her own powerbase. Some follow her willingly, like Daphne Greengrass who is smitten by Ivy, others find themselves broken and imperio'd like Pansy Parkinson and Hermione, and others find themselves the victims of accidents, like Susan Bones. Ivy's end goal is to usurp Voldemort and rule Britain herself.

I never published this because, frankly, it was a massive braindump. But maybe you find something in my rambling that you could use.

**** My take on dark magic is that the most prominent of its spells represent a very basic level of human instincts. Domination, survival and the destruction of enemies is what it revolves around. Using it resonates with these intincts. Just like these instincts are regulated by law in our real society, the wizarding society has made laws to control these primal spells.

Just like with any sort of violence, people can become addicted to the momentary simplicity of solving their problems with it. Somebody doesn't do what you want them to do? Imperio them. Someone needs to be punished? Crucio them. Someone needs to die? Avada Kedavra them. Something needs to be destroyed? Use Fiendfyre.

However, in the end it is about intent. Applied in the right way, a "Tickling Charm" can easily become unbearable torture. Transfigure a french fry into a stick of arsenic and watch the eater die. Hell, we read in the last book that several stunners can be deadly.

Magic is a tool. Its as dark or light as the wielder.

Then again, I get that this may be boring, depending on what type of story you want to write. I always liked the idea that illegal spells have some sort of rebound onto the caster. I had an idea once that the Crucio is the go-to torture spell because the caster get the exact opposite effect on themselves. Instead of unbearable pain, they feel like walking on clouds for the duration of the spell. I explained Bellatrix' preference of the spell by that. She lived so long in Azkaban that the short relief of the "trip" the Crucio sends her on is extremely addictive to her.

Anyway, on a different note:

This leaves me completely baffled. My brain cannot compute that people react like that to me. Thank you for the compliment.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** First, she has to care about something. Then that thing has to be threatened or destroyed. Following this, she would conclude that she cannot trust others to protect what she cares about, and therefore decides to take matters into her own hands.

The Dark Magic is usually the kind that brings power into the witch's hands quickly, and therefore becomes the most expedient method of surviving/winning.

Situations would arise that make choosing expediency the 'necessary' option, and further compromise what she is willing to do to enemies. Eventually 'enemies' as a category will grow larger to include anyone in her way, not to mention all those friends and relatives of those she defeated using 'expedient' methods.

** One possible definition of "dark arts" is magic with a negative psychological impact. Addiction or worse.

Expose her to dark arts. Have her learn something not knowing what it is. The addiction starts slowly. She notices it -- but dark arts are a shortcut to power, and she repeatedly encounters situations where she needs that power (to survive, to protect others).

The psychological impact is harder to notice at first than the addiction.

Not quite as satisfying an option, admittedly.
