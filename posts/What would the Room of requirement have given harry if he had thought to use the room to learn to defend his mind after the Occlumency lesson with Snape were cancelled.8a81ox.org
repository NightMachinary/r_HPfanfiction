IF harry asked the Room of requirement for help in learning to defened his mind what do you think the room would have given him?


** I could see it presenting a sequence of items and objects that would try to break into his mind. A mirror that shows you how you see yourself, a dagger that makes you angry and fixated on revenge, etc.

As he beats each one - able to control the image at will, able to ignore the daggers fake anger for his real anger- the next would appear.

Until eventually he'd get the hardest challenge the room could throw at him... Ravenclaw's Diadem.

** A brick.

The most versatile and useful object for any adventurer.

Avada kedavra defense? throw a brick in front of it.

Interrogation? Let's play truth or brick

Legillemency attack? brick 'em right in the face. It's hard to retain concentration after getting bricked.

Kharne the betrayer survived the building collapse? Put your faith in the god-emperor and in the glorious brick!

In all seriousness, I think Ravenclaw's creation might scoff at the idea that you would need objects to help defend your mind. I also like the idea of sapient magical objects and locales being kinda sassy

** If it's a crackfic, a firearm. Everyone knows that offence is the best defense.

If it's realistic, either books or written instructions (think Voldemort's floating letters from CoS), maybe even a simulated intrusion into Harry's mind as a spar.

*** It would also depend on what Exactly harry asked for when he created the Room.

Like if he ask for a Room to learn Occlumency in it would give him help with that but if he was more general in just asking for help in learning to defend his mind, that leaves more room for the RoR to interpret what harry wants.

and if he were to ask for help specifically on defending against the attacks from Voldemort. The Room if it has it could give harry Books on how to break the Connection between him and Voldemort after all there has to been some books that could help with that have passed threw Hogwarts hall over the years that the room could give harry to help with that.

It all comes back to how harry Words what he Requires from the room

*** Does he want the visions? I doubt it, but I agree that Harry the lazy dumbass (that's how I see Rowling's Harry, a person who's been dealt a shitty hand but throws a tantrum about not wanting to "play" anyway because making an effort is just too damn hard - except when someone points a gun at his head!) didn't want to control his emotions (as stunted as they are...I mean he defends everybody and their dog to death, but doesn't stand up for himself against Snape, Dumbledore (he even names a kid after those two manipulative and abusive assholes!), McGonagall, his peers ("Potter stinks! Support Cedric, the true Hogwart's champion!", "Harry is the heir of Slytherin!", "Potter is a deranged liar!"), Umbridge etc.)...note: I am not saying that fighting back would have worked all the time, but simply giving up and doing as you are told is not good for your selfesteem!)

**** OotP /explicitly/ says that Harry wants to know what is behind the door in his dreams/visions from Voldemort, after the lessons have ended. He absolutely wants them to continue until he learns the cost of it (Department of Mysteries, Sirius dying).

** I mean, I'd die of laughter if it was a RoR-simulated Snape sitting there. But I feel like the point of occlumency is controlling yourself and your emotions - and Snape is probably the best person to do that for Harry because he's so antagonistic and Harry needs to learn /to ignore that./

Either that or a really good helmet.

I vehemently disagree. Snape would be an excellent /test/ to see if Harry had mastered Occlumency for the precise reasons you mention. But having Snape /teach/ him is like tossing an alcoholic in a room full of whiskey with only the instruction 'hey, don't drink anything' and expecting them to be cured.

** If anything, maybe some textbooks about how it's done. It doesn't seem like a skill that can be learned in a vacuum, so I don't know how books could help. It seems notable that Hermione, for all of her time spent in the library and her love of being smarter than everyone else, wasn't able to offer Harry any help in learning it.
