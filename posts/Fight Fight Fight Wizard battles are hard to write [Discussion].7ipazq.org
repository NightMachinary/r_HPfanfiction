I feel this is a struggle this sub has definitely encountered: WIZARD BATTLES.

As a point of personal preference, I absolutely prefer the kind of fight that transpired between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end of OotP. I like variation to the attacks, inventive spellwork, imagination. I think these battles tend to be the most creative, the most fun, the most vivid, and the most deeply magical. I vastly prefer them to fights where people just fling around the Killing Curse or, worse, beam-battles with some kind of complicated story logic behind them.

But that more inventive type of fight is incredibly difficult to write!

So: How do you write your wizard battles? What are some examples of really stellar magical duels? What do you draw on? What do you steer away from?

*** I have to partially agree. Sure, not every fight can (or even should) be epic, but a low level fight won't necessarily be stale. I mean, the characters aren't /defined/ by their magic, and I'm sure a creative writer (which I am...not) could make use of things beyond that, like the environment or plot items, plot devices, and stuff. I mean, muggle action scenes aren't boring because they don't have magic, right?

...

Sorry, tbh I have 0 idea of what makes a good (written) action scene :|

*** You're a bad writer.

The character is all the magic you need.

**** Based on your (as of now) two comments in this thread, have you come here to be an arse to people by providing unasked for negative critique of no worth, or do you plan on actually contributing constructively?

Because while yes, characters do matter, they are not the only thing that matters and the person you were replying to is absolutely right in saying that the duel between Albus and Tom is one that most people would not be capable of and as such average duels would not be similar to it. You can disagree with their ideas of how to handle it, but calling them a bad writer for it without offering anything worth the unwarranted and thus rude interruption ... well, you aren't giving people much of a reason to agree with you at all about anything, let me tell you that.

** Every decent writer will make the environment, transfiguration etc part of a fight (though bad writers still write magical combat as spell tennis). What the best writers do is use the plot and environment in conjunction to give the battle narrative structure as well as dynamic movement. That is to say: the characters should have strategic goals they want to achieve which are determined by the plot. The characters are not there for the purpose of fighting - fighting is the thing standing between them and their goals. A fight with this in mind has a completely different feel to it, one that I think is more interesting.

The OotP DoM battle is a good example of this - not the Dumbledore vs Voldemort fight (which is good for different reasons), but the fight between the Death Eaters and the DA members. Both sides have objectives: the Death Eaters to get the prophecy, the kids to escape. Where and when and how they fight, and where they choose not to fight, or to abandon a fight which has already begun, is dictated by the differing priorities these objectives contain.

*** I prefer to have individual styles for each character. People like Dumbledore, McGonagall or Tonks will heavily rely on transfiguration while the Black sisters prefer attack as their defense, with Bella heavily relying on Dark magic and most notably the Cruciatus while Andromeda goes for precision and speed over raw power. Narcissa is the creative one, throwing in odd charms for unexpected results. Snape uses obscure, dark magic and Voldemort rapid fires killing curses unless up against opponents like Dumbledore. Hermione is hesitant at first, trying to get a feeling for the enemy before exploiting any found weaknesses.

As for Harry I prefer to go with him practicing a small arsenal of spells to perfection, relying on the counterattack and dodging. Better to properly learn five spells than half ass 50.

*** I'm not a writer but overall I agree however let me ask you a question how would you write Bellatrix -an exceptionnal duellist- in a fight considering she never showed once any transfiguration skills throughout the book ? I'm not implying she isn't skilled, far from it, I just find it unsettling that in all the numerous fight she had, there were never any use of the environnement to take the upper hand of the fight.

*** Foreground. Background. Character history.

Thats where their skill set is.

I always include environmental factors into the fights - and usually some kind of catastrophic event that leads to the fight .... influence the way the magic will work.

** I wrote a wizard fight and it didn't turn out so well, so I changed it to a sword fight. Likely a lack of creativity on my part, but I think one mistake was to make it a fight to the death and one Avada Kedavra and it's s all over. I just couldn't find a way to make it exciting. Swords I feel I did a bit better with.
