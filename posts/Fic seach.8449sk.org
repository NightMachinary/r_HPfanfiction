I am trying to find a story I saw in passing. From the description it was post Hogwarts and featured Lucius as the new rising main bad guy. From what I remember the main character was either Harry or Draco.

Does anyone know which fic this is?

*** I thought it was a Draco / Hermione or a Draco / Ginny but have not been able to find it again.
