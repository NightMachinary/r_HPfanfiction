Kinda kidding, but kinda not. The inner Slytherin and HP dork in me flared up again the other day, and I read my old favorite fanfic, Isolation, by Bex-chan, in three nights. The need for feels has not gone away though, and that leaves me at a dead end. I'm a Dramione shipper all the way and am searching for anything. I hope you guys can recommend something.

I'm not strict here. It can be a hyper smutty one shot, something during or long after Hogwarts, or something that rivals Isolation itself, the only thing I care about is if, regardless of whatever style of Dramione fic it is, it's actually enjoyable to read.


** If you enjoyed Isolation, then odds are you'll like Reverse. Linkffn(4025300) It's a great story, albeit sadly unfinished.

Also, check out these dramione authors, they're all great:

1) Colubrina 2) Rizzle 3) galfoy 4) riptey 5) Kittenshift17

**** Umm, not really familiar with any personally, but I've seen similar questions popped up on the sub -- alternate dimension travel is quite popular, I'd say, so I imagine people would have some suggestions if you made a thread for it.

** Read the rest of Bex-Chan's fics too, I think Hunted was written before Isolation linkffn(5853767)

I also agree with all those authors, especially Lena Phoria, lengthy fics with great Dramione, The Deadline is in my top five favs linkffn(9831689)

If you're looking for angst, Revert by SUPRNTRL LUVR was completed a few months ago and will seriously give you feels (12125463)

Hot for Teacher and it's sequel are my favorite humor Dramiones, which is saying something because I absolutely hate humor fics but MotherOfBulls is fantastic with humor linkffn(12488476)

  It takes the unexpected engagement of their children to get Draco and Hermione in a room together, but only the selfish acts of their estranged spouses and a 300 Galleon bottle of firewhiskey will get them in a bedroom. What starts out as a one time mistake soon becomes a full-blown affair with a deadline; the day their children say 'I do'. But things rarely go according to plan.

** So I don't read much dramoine... One of the best though is the author Lena phoria on fanfiction.net , if you haven't read all of their stories I highly recommend them

And it's hard to find a copy since the author adapted the story into an actual book.... But "Cruel and beautiful world" by Lena phoria is absolutely amazing (a little on the dark side but absolutely amazing) [you should be able to find a link if you search for it]
