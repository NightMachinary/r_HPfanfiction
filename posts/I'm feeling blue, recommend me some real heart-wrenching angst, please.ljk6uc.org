I've been feeling really shitty this past week and I'm in the mood to just immerse myself in a character's pain for a while instead of my own. I started out with Supernatural and Marvel (mainly Skip Westcott ðŸ˜¡) and now I'm here.

I'm mainly looking for stuff that deals with Harry's childhood abuse (whether or not it's canon or emphasized, I do not care) and the problems (read: depression, anxiety, self-harm, etc) caused by it. Pretty much all I care about is that it's complete, decent in terms of grammar and stuff, and is between 1,000-20,000 words. And that there's no ridiculous Weasley bashing. Dumbledore bashing is okay, but I don't want it to be a focus or anything. I'd also prefer the fics to be gen, as well, and maybe featuring Sirius or Remus, but familial stuff with the Weasleys is fine.

Thanks!


** Have you read Digging for Bones? It has some Remus and Sirius, though Harry's main interactions are with Snape and it does become Severitus. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019/chapters/1078847]]

** I'm a Severitus person, and I feel like my faves aren't what everyone else's faves are on Reddit (I love Snape mentor fics, and I like more gen fics than most people), but I just want to say that I'm sorry that this has been such a shit week for you. I stick mostly to Snape so I'm not down on Remus/Sirius fics as much but I'm sure there are people here who can recommend that.

I hope you find some good fics and that it helps make whatever horrible shit that's going on right now better. Hopefully, whatever is going on, it will pass.

*** Thank you for the comment. It makes me feel just a little bit better that you took the time to write it when you didn't have to. Also, I'd be down to read some Severitus fics if they're angsty and go over Harry's childhood.
