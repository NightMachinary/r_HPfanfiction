*** Snape's changes were innovations, however. By passing those innovations off as his own, Harry created an unfounded and misleading impression that he was a genius capable of producing such innovations himself. He did nothing to correct that impression and indeed he encouraged it.

That is dishonest, I think.

It all would have come crashing down had he continued with his 7th year and taken the exam. Suddenly he would be working on the basis of his own skills and knowledge, which would likely have atrophied after 2 years of relying on someone else's answers rather than doing the work himself. The gulf between his actual skill and the impression of genius he had built up would have become obvious.

No, because no one who is following the textbook is claiming to have written the textbook. Harry is claiming to have come up with Snape's Potion's innovations himself, taking credit for them to boost his grade. Sure, he's honest about them to Ron and Hermione, but he doesn't come clean to the person who matters - the person assigning his grade.

He's not only cheating (using another student's work as his own); he's also a plagiarist.

** Well, it depends, doesn't it?

Let's say I need a handbook for a class and I buy a second-hand one from someone who's had the class last year and made notes in it. Nothing wrong with that, right?

Now, the issue comes from the fact that Harry uses it in class assignments, for which they get graded. Now, I'm assuming that if I made notes myself, I could use those in those classes. Would having someone else's notes be cheating? Probably yes? I suppose it wouldn't matter if those assignments didn't actually count towards your actual grade and were more of an indicator for how you are doing in class . We don't know what the case is in Hogwarts, so it's a bit ambiguous.

I'm leaning towards no, it's not officially cheating. However, I don't think it's a good idea for Harry to rely on it - making your own notes is a way better idea than just blindly following someone else's. Also, if the grades indicate how you're doing, they will be skewed and you won't notice you're actually falling behind.

** The way Potions brewing in Hogwarts is taught, a successful potion is based on following the directions + recipe as closely as possible. Stirs in the right direction, the amount of time on the burner, the right amount of the right ingredients. The way Snape went about teaching was through shoving the instructions down everyone's throat until they got it right. So Harry having extra textbook help isn't cheating, imo. Not unless he snuck the book into the written exam and copied answers off it there.

However, in the books, Snape takes points from Hermione for helping Neville with his potion. Though whether it's because Snape counted it as "cheating", or he was just being mean to the Gryffindors, or trying to tough-love teach Neville into brewing a working potion without someone spoonfeeding him instructions, is hard to tell.

Though if Harry actually did point out all of Hermione's hypocrisies, an in-character Hermione would run away crying, because she has a bad track record with confrontations under stress. (The troll and Devil's Snare in year 1, various arguments with Ron, walking into Ron and Lavender making out.) Under stress, Harry snarks back and makes impulsive decisions, while Hermione freezes and panics.

In the books, Hermione's crying and running away has the strange effect of making her sympathetic to the readers, even though she's the one who has made mistakes and, since she runs away, never actually acknowledges these mistakes and apologizes for them. So a Harry who tries to call Hermione out would look like the bad guy in the situation.

** If the purpose of potions class was to supply the school with potions then use of the book would be fine. You'd just be brewing potions using different instructions.

But the purpose of potions class is not to brew potions. The potions they practice are thrown away. The purpose of potions class is to /learn/, so that you can brew any potion. You're supposed to be developing your skills.

Harry didn't learn anything, yet made it appear that he had. That is fundamentally dishonest so yes I would say cheating. If he had actually used the book to learn e.g. by investigating the changes and understanding why they were made, that would have been different. But he just used it to appear better than he actually was.

They never learn the correlation/causation of different ingredients on the potion. The class has always been how best you can follow the recipe. You can't honestly say that any subject in the real world could be connected to potions without your points falling apart.

Memorizing better recipes would have the same moral connotations as have notes in the margins according to your view. If the ability to make any potion was to be tested then making a potion while looking at instructions would not be the way to do that.

Edit: I didn't say this before but yes the hw and theory lectures if present would account for understand the effect of ingredients on potions; however, that point is moot considering we are talking about the lab and he was using better instructions for a lab.

  "Shall we do Snape's stuff first?" said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink. "'The properties... of moonstone... and its uses... in potion-making...”‘ he muttered, writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them.

We never find out what moonstone actually does.

Potions is a mix of steady hands and technical knowledge in canon. Harry had one, and the book provided the other. No one had recipes memorized, and they each used their own copies.

All the book did was improve his brewing ability. Likening it to an annotated lab manual with tips on how to perform a procedure more effectively. You don't need to understand the procedure to perform it.

Except it didn't. That's my point: Harry gained no skills from the book. So long as he brewed the potions in that specific book he would excel, but if you asked him to brew /any other potion/ he would flounder.

If anything, the book likely harmed his potions ability, because he relied on it entirely rather than engaging with the material. If he had progressed to take his NEWT exam he probably would have failed it - no book to help him there, and suddenly he'd be having to use his own skills and knowledge.

Ask yourself: what would have happened if Harry had told Slughorn that he was getting his modifications from a book rather than thinking of them himself? Would Slughorn still rate Harry's work so highly?

Clearly he wouldn't. Slughorn is rating Harry highly because he thinks that the Potions Harry brews are the product of his own skill. If he knew that Harry was copying someone else's ideas, Harry would not get the credit for them.

Harry is keenly aware of this, which is why he conceals the book from Slughorn. Even when Ron is under the influence of a love potion, Harry perpetuates the lie rather than admit that he doesn't know how to brew an antidote.

So Harry is using dishonest means, in full knowledge that it is dishonest, to pass another person's work off as his own in order to achieve better academic results than he would have been capable of achieving on his own. That, surely, is the definition of cheating.

I don't think that is a good analogy. Remember, we know that advanced Hogwarts students can and do add to their fields - Dumbledore, for example, was publishing articles in academic journals during his Hogwarts years. There is no tertiary education in the wizarding world... Hogwarts is a school analogue, yes, but it is also the equivalent of a university, a place where new magic is created by talented students.

By all accounts Snape was a Potions genius, and the innovations recorded in the HBP book are advances that others do not know about.

The analogy is therefore not so much an annotated chemistry lab manual giving tips on how to ace routine assignments. It's more like you're a postgraduate chemistry student and you've found someone's notes on a new way to improve the Haber Process. You don't publish them, but you do use them to impress your professor, taking credit for the ideas. Your teacher, impressed, announces you a genius and gives you a high grade.

** Depends on how the class was done in previous years and the 6th year.\\
Some fics have it that while they have the books with recipes, Snape gives them instructions on the board anyway. Now why would that happen? Most common explanation is that there is a discrepancy between the book and the board - either the books are wonky or simply the board instructions are improved versions of he potion that give you a bit more leeway in terms of how precise you need to be.

Now, if that's the case, then it's obvious that one should have his own book, and add notes based on what's shown on the board. 5 years of that, and when you don't get the board of instructions in the 6th year, but get the book, and then screw up the brewing, it should give you some indication what you're supposed to do - either ask the professor for help, or figure it out on your own based on 5 years of experience in brewing and learning about properties of potions. If that's the case, then Harry was cheating - he didn't put up the required work and simply mooched off of someone elses anwsers/preparation.

IMO we could compare Potions in NEWT level to advanced chemistry classes - you get some instructions about what you need to get, but at this point you really should have enough knowledge to figure out that the textbook is wrong (either deliberately or not) or know how to do some things by yourself simply from knowing the general rules of how this stuff works on a basic level.

** No.

But I always thought that Hermione's biggest problem with using the book was that Harry was just blindly following the instructions without understanding how this alternative way works.

That being said this part of the series showed some of the most irrational behaviour by Hermione that I cant explain at all. Her entire attitude in book 6 was very OOC to me. I always point to her behaviour in this book as a great hook for anyone that wants to write a love/loyalty potion Hermione story since it requires basically no alterations to canon till that point

** I mean no that would be like getting a used text book with notes in it to help you study considered cheating . Its not like hes bringing it into an exam. Its not much different than a friend being like hey this might help in chem lab or just getting any information to help you outside of assigned class materials.

But it is kinda bullshit that 2 decades ago a student came up with a better way but the books written by supposedly more educated people hadnt done anything to update the material. Hell not even the actual potions master was like hey lemme write a letter to the editor or something cuz shit I came up with in highschool is more competent in this book .

** No. It's just as if he's using a better Potions textbook. I find Hermione's reaction to the ordeal rather weird -- wouldn't she be all over that book wanting to learn better brewing methods? I get her reluctance with unknown spells, but her disdain for a book that gives better brewing methods never made much sense to me.

*** You are making the assumption that nobody else can get access to the same notes. I doubt that there a fifth/sixth year Snape is smart enough to change potion instructions in crucial ways that have not already been discovered in other areas. Also they are using aleast 20 year old books which doesn't really do anything to support the point that others could not get access to better material.

Also it would be like saying studying from a better textbook or medium is cheating. Or that giving your notes to someone in the class below yours your notes.

** Not at all. Those potion books were distributed among his classmates just like used textbooks in elementary, middle, and high school. When using used textbooks its not unusual to find old scribbles from some past student. As long as the book is still usable and not too beat up then the teachers don't care and won't replace them with new books. It's not Harry's fault that the teacher and by extension the school couldn't be bothered to spend money on new textbooks that are clean or put some spell on the book so that it at least looks new with no notes. Is it unfair that the other students didn't have a book with great and helpful notes from a past potion prodigy? Yes. Absolutely. I'd certainly be jealous. But its not Harry's fault that he got that certain book. He never intended to get a basic cheat sheet book, but that's how things turned out.
