** PotDK is obviously the best. There are a few others :\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] : Grindelwald wins the duel against Dumbledore. Not a personal favorite (I thought the worldbuilding was too rushed and confusing on the first read), but a lot of people like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6004275/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Greater_Good][Harry Potter and the Greater Good]] : Dumbledore and Grindelwald remain a team, and carve a new empire. Great characterization of Dumbledore, not-so-great characterization of Grindelwald. Good Worldbuilding. I will recommend this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] : Not a full scale, or even fully logical AU like the others mentioned here, but this is well worth a read. The writing isn't the smoothest, but this is one of the very few cases where the plot and characters are interesting enough that it isn't a dealbreaker. Definitely recommended.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph19]]: AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
