I'm starting to think I've read most of the big players in the ship. I've read everything Colubrina and ibuzoo, as well as most things tagged with the pairing on FF. I'm at a loss for what to read. Help?

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
