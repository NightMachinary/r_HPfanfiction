What app do you guys prefer if you're reading on a phone or tablet. The one I mainly used was removed so idk anymore.


** I mostly just use Chrome to read stuff that's online on FFN, AO3, etc.

I use Aldiko (Android) for anything I've downloaded as pdf/epub.

*** Same, I'll pin fics I want to read to Chrome then when my phone syncs I can just open it in a new tab on my phone. Easy peasy.

**** It's awesome until Chrome decides screw you it doesn't feel like syncing tabs anymore on one of your devices. It's done that to me a few times.

***** Special 'to read' bookmark folder? I had to start that for a little bit when the sync bug would hit.

****** I do have a bookmark folder full of fics, but I use the tab sync to keep my place in a current story when I'm going back and forth between reading on my tablet and my desktop.

*** You should post it when it's ready. I'm using Aldiko at the moment for ebooks and it's okay, parts of the interface are unintuitive.

** FBReader. I convert everything to an ebook before reading. Or at least, everything over 80k words.

** The one I used before was removed too, bummer. So I switched to Codex Reader which is mostly the same, except it can retrieve stories from 3 sites (FanFiction.net, AO3 and fiction press I think) instead of just FFnet.

However, it has a advert banner at the bottom which can be annoying sometimes when you're reading (but hey, it's free...)

** I used */FBReader/* for some time but it was missig some feature or the other (I dont quite remember) so I grabbed */Moon+Reader/* when it was free in amazons appstore. It is absolute overkill for just reading but it allows you to do pretty much everything (like opening and searching in my /calibre/ library, finding and opening files in my dropbox when my laptop isn't running, TTS when I'm on the go and bored etc).

In conjunction with using calibre (and the FFDL plugin) and syncing my library to my dropbox I literally never have to go without every fic I ever liked at my fingertips. And when I find a new fic or get a update email I just chuck it into my */Pocket/*, that way I can easily add it to my library later and can read it immediately outside of the crappy mobile websites if I so choose.

** I convert my stuff to pdfs - used to do it via flagfic which is shut down now. I have more fics saved than I can probably ever read. But if I want to read something new, I download it via Calibre with the FanFiction plugin. Then I save my stuff in GoogleDrive (though you can use Dropbox as well). The actual reading is done in the GoodReader app on my iPad Air. it can even sync folders, it is wonderful.

** I have Fanfiction Reader for both my phone and tablet. You can search for fics from FF.net and save them to your library and log in to your FF profile to sync the stories to your apps.

For those who like copy/pasting each individual chapter and saving it in Word or Wordpad I use Cool Reader. It works for .rtf files as far as I tried but sometimes when you're reading, the screen for Day Mode suddenly goes dark and you have to resort to Night Mode, or the screen is unreadable for both modes until you exit the app. It's an okay app but I enjoy it.
