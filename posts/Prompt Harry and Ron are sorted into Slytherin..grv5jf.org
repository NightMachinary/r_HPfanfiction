Harry because of ambition to prove himself worthy of his parents, and a bit of a vicious streak (CRUCIO!). Ron because of his ambition and, though he'd deny it to his dying day, cunning and sneakiness (HELLO? Chess master anyone?! For Merlin's sake, he beat McGonagall's set in 1st year!).


** Don't know if chess is sneaky more so than just being able to plan and see patterns easily, but I like the idea of Harry and Ron in Slytherin.

*** Most Slytherin! Harry fics separate them, usually by Ron being a douche. It'd be nice to see them together in Slytherin.

** I'd say that Ron would fit the wanting to prove himself, but he doesn't overly have the ambition to do so. (Note not knocking on Ron, I absolutely LOVE him, and find him to be the most relatable character, personally). I also hate Weasley bashing.

Though mhm... I could see the ambition he doesn't necessarily have, be introduced to him, if he were sorted into Slytherin.

Now I'm not calling him stupid of course, there are different kinds of smart, however, he never tried too hard, in certain aspects, unless his family and/or friends were involved. Which is a great quality to have, of course.

Though that'd be a nice change up, instead of having only Harry, or Harry and Hermione be sorted in Slytherin, it'd be Harry and Ron.

Except for Dumbledore, apparently. I lasted until Chapter 2, when the Potters' Suppressed Will came out. It's too bad, because I was enjoying the fic, even if I had been hoping for a bit more adversity from Hermione's roommates.

Also, I can buy that Hermione knows BSL, because Hermione, but that Draco randomly does?

  Slytherin Trio. Deaf Harry. No ridiculous modification of beloved character behavior to turn them into evil monsters. Because fuck that shit.Ron is a Slytherin and he is perfect. Because for some reason Slytherin Harry fics tend to demonise Ron and I am not about that shit.

** Harry looked around his dorm and sighed in relief. No one was in sight, which meant that he might have a quiet evening for once. It was bearable in class. Lily made sure that he always had a witness with him so his /housemates/ left him alone. But that only meant that they tried to find other opportunities.

Dropping his head back on his pillow, Harry decided to call it a day and catch up with the sleep which had eluded him all week.

It hadn't always been like this. At first, everyone had just observed him, trying to see through a mascarade which wasn't there. He was no evil mastermind, no dark lord just biding his time. Back then, they had focused their anger at Ron, who had not been quiet with his disdain for anything Slytherin. He had been smart enough to cause an incident which had him resorted to Gryffindor after he got out of the infirmary.

He should have followed Ron's example. Hufflepuff sounded nice. The house which everyone forgot. He wouldn't get to spend as much time with Lily, but maybe he could just fade into the background, as he had done back in Surrey. And he could still meet with Lily outside of their common rooms.

AN: Lily Moon was the "original 40" version of Luna which got scrapped in favour of canon Luna.
