So Frank and Alice are sitting ducks at St. Mungo's during DH. What do you think happened, especially after Voldemort started ruling Wizarding Britain. I find it interesting that they were never used as hostages for Augusta and Neville.


** As dark as this may sound, in my view in the magical world Alice and Frank would be less valuable as hostages then active individuals who are close to Frank or Augusta. While Neville and Augusta love them dearly, I can not see them caving into anything to save people who are effectively vegetables or late-stage Alzheimer's patients.

** I think it's likely that St Mungo's went on lockdown during that period. While affiliated with the ministry, they probably have something similar to the hyppocratic oath. They could easily lock down entire floors while keeping others open because death eaters need medical aid too.

Remember the age old saying: Don't f*** with the white mage.

** Often people with extreme views assume others hold extreme views. The Longbottoms might be seen as worthless cripples that aren't even wizards any more, only their old name is worth anything. If you're convinced of their worthlessness then why would they be worth anything to anyone else. They're sacks of meat not hostages.

Alternatively none of the Death Eaters involved in Hogwarts wanted to admit they couldn't control a teenager and thus no action was taken. Dawlish was sent after Neville's gran but we don't know if that was for Neville's actions or her vocal support of Dumbledore and Harry.

*** Fair points. I see them as hostages because crippled or not, Neville and Augusta care a great deal for them. At their core, humans are emotional more than logical. Logically, you should disregard them, but Augusta and Neville wouldn't be able to because of how much they love them.

Really good point about the controlling Neville part. I think it's hilarious that Augusta made Dawlish look like a schoolboy
