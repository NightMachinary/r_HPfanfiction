I've been reading a few fics recently that have the MC in Slytherin, but I've been wondering where this whole favour or trade system came from?

MC requires information or help and asks a fellow Slytherin, said Slytherin only will offer help or information if either MC can offer something back of equal value, or will owe them a favour. Or perhaps later on, the MC is like scary, or the unnamed leader of the house or some other commanding role.

I've seen this multiple times now and as a Slytherin myself, it just never sits right with me. I've always seen Slytherin as a house that sticks together, they'll help each other out because no one else will. The sorting hat even says you'll find your true friends there, and yet every fic sows a tale of complete distrust and selfishness.

You can be ambitious and cunning without demanding a favour in exchange for helping your friend with their charms homework.

Is it just me that feels this way, or has even noticed this?


** Yeah. Most people don't see the house the same way you do. That self-serving favour-trading thing you mentioned seems the most common view of the house - den of snakes and all that.

It's the Little Politicians trope meets TV Small Town Dynamics, basically. Imagine a small town where everyone knows each other and all the old men in authority trade in favours to get things done, then add in rich preppy twelve year-olds who read Ayn Rand and Machiavelli and think they're going to take over the world someday. That's how you get the 'cliche Slytherin House'.

Canonically, we don't really seem to ever get any information about Slytherin beyond it being a 'rich kid breeding ground for the magical KKK', so people mostly do replicate the 'Small Town-Little Politicians' thing because it's a vibe that fits that minimal information that we've seen before (and is a vibe that writers generally either enjoy and want to replicate or don't feel confident enough to move beyond and experiment with alternatives).

The way that 'Nobody else will help Slytherin' sentiment mostly manifests itself in fiction tends to be the 'Slytherin Rules' of 'all disputes are behind closed doors', 'don't make friends with other houses', 'always move in groups because the other houses will attack you' and so on that always seem to pop up in Slytherin fics. It's more a tool of indoctrination into the bigotry than any positive 'sticking together' message.

Technically the two visions of the house don't exclude each other though - you can still be willing to help out fellow Slytherins, you just turn the situation to your advantage with a trade. "I'll help you, no problem, but you help me too.". Opportunistic Charity, basically, in order to cunningly gain allies to serve your ambitions. :D

There are some people like you that see the house in more positive terms, but they often end up falling into the 'racist bigots like Malfoy and the other magical nazis are actually good people protecting their traditions' cliche and losing the 'positive reflections of Slytherin' aspects of their story within that larger sin-washing of the bigots within the house.

I won't offer an opinion on it, because I don't have one - either the fic makes it work within its own verisimilitude or it doesn't, is as far as my opinion goes - but that's generally the common answers to the 'why and how' parts of your questions. :)

*** I mean, the most reasonable approach appears to me to extrapolate the atmosphere in the house based on the characters we see.

On that account, we have racists, bullies, cheaters, selfish people, cowards, bootlickers, and networkers. That's about the sum total. If you now were to find a common denominator between all of them, that is to say, between Goyle and Slughorn, I think "selfishness" is a reasonable attempt (it's obviously not ambition or cunning).

We also don't have to take Malfoy as an example of a Slytherin. Pansy selling out Harry to save /her/ hide, Snape regretting telling the prophecy once he feared it might harm someone /he/ loved, Slughorn holding onto the memory to preserve /his/ image, Tom closing down the Chamber because a closed Hogwarts meant for /him/ the orphanage -- there's a common theme.

So, assuming that this is a core trait of all Slytherins (and thematically, it does fit, as the antipode to Harry, the epitome of Gryffindor selflessness), the question is what life in such a house would be like. And the best guess I have is indeed that wanting to get help requires equal payment or leverage. An action is performed with the understanding of a subsequent or ongoing benefit or it's not performed at all. And formalising this to "trading favours" is just the ultimate conclusion to everyone asking /why should I/ at the same time; the dynamics appear to leave room for little else.

.

The /interesting/ part, however, begins once you wonder whether such an atmosphere, and such traits as we see, might be considered good and desirable within Slytherin, whereas (Gryffindor) selflessness and bravery might be looked down upon. The point of a Slytherin story then, the way I see it, is to explore this different set of values from the inside. Writing it as just another house, just a bit more edgy, is, if nothing else, kinda boring.

**** Heh. Yeah, as you say, interesting and reasonable aren't necessarily the same.

And like I said, I'm not saying the opinion is bad or good - I've read fics that take a 'Slytherin is just full of magic nazis' approach that are good, and I've read fics that take the 'Slytherin is secretly the nice Grey Party group' (both with and without Draco) approach that are good too. Equally, I've read fics of both kinds that are utterly dull. It's not about the cliche/trope, it's all about how you use it. :)

I do agree a 'Mote in Gods Eye'/'Stranger in a Strange Land' exploration of the differing value system and thought process would likely be quite interesting though. :)

** Omg yes i absolutely agree with your whole post! I thought I was the only one who felt like this lmao.

I mean it's tiring to read slytherin centric fics and they show the slytherin house to be some sort of battleground where you have to play politics and posturing to become the leader and whatnot. Just because slytherins are cunning and ambitious doesn't mean they are /all/ politicians which is what I feel most authors end up portraying slytherins as.

Actually I feel like The Changeling actually showed a pretty balanced view of slytherin where teenagers were teenagers and not budding politicians. And they showed all the different girls with different ambitions with each their own distinct personalities but they all come together to help and appreciate one another. And I loved that.

That's what I wanna see, I want to see slytherins supporting one another in their ambitions, defending against anyone who attacks them. And someone who's ambitious is not inherently selfish, someone who's cunning is not evil. I want to see different types of slytherins, who said slytherins can't be helpful or kind or nice? And their cunning nature suggests that they can find unexplored ways to solve a problem and may not be someone who follows the norm.

I mean there can be a wide variety of slytherins ya know and I feel you OP I get what you mean

** I think they're similar to other houses in terms of what they are doing in their free time. We could probably see the same hobbies and games as we see in Gryffindor. But I don't agree that they stick together and help each other. Considering that most of Sacred Twenty-Eight land in Slytherin, I think there's a hierarchy in this house - some are treated better than others because they're richer or come from a better family. Those who don't have a good family name or money to show off probably have to try harder to find their place there, e.g. Snape who I think was so passionate about Dark Arts partly because he wanted to prove himself to other Slytherins.

*** I still think they'd stick together and help each other. I can't recall a single instance in the books of Slytherins fighting with Slytherins. Not like Gryffindor snubbing Harry multiple times. Not like Luna being bullied by other Ravenclaws.

Yes, Harry isn't the most observant, but I think it's just fanon for people to say that unless you're from a good, pure blooded family than you're going to struggle in Slytherin.

We don't hear about Snape ever having a problem in Slytherin, even though he was a poor, abused half blood. Snape has a lot of ambition and cunning, Slytherin traits, traits that I'm sure even the richest pure blood in Slytherin would see and appreciate considering those are the traits they value most. I see no reason why anyone would have a hard time from Slytherins if they've been sorted there.

The negatives of Slytherin come about when you consider Voldemort's influences on the house, but that's completely unrelated to the house itself, or it's students within the house. If that makes sense.

**** Yeah, I get what you mean, and maybe after the war, when things calm down I can see Slytherin being exactly like the rest, but during canon, I still think it's unlikely.\\
We don't see Slytherin snubbing anyone because we don't get much detail about Slytherin except that they're evil. The only examples of interactions between Slytherins that we got from canon are Malfoy with Crabbe and Goyle (he definitely treats them as if they were beneath him) and conversation between Slytherins in 6th book (Zabini disregarding way of explaining why Malfoy wasn't invited to the Slug Club). It's not much, but it doesn't really look like house solidarity to me.

***** I don't think we can really judge a whole House because of the behavior of one character (Malfoy). Especially when Crabbe and Goyle where "beneath" him before he even went to Hogwarts. Harry is not the most observant person, and I can't remember any scene in canon where he interacts with a Slytherin outside of "Fighting against Malfoy and his goons" and "Fighting with the Slytherin Quidditch team" (sometimes it's both).

I doubt Malfoy is a unique case, and that there is a whole part of Slytherin that is composed of Junior Death Eater that vary their treatment of each other depending of their Blood Status and wealth. But I'm sure there is also another part of Slytherin full of "normal" students.\\
I mean, despite all of his qualities, Harry is not really a behavioral standard of Gryffindor (unless they all almost die fighting Dark Wizards at the end of the year?), so I don't see why Draco would be a standard of Slytherin.

** So as a Slytherin, I don't understand why they are so explicit about everything. Of course there's going to be done form of a social structure (there always is), but it would be a fluid vague thing. And the favors are odd. If I do you a favor, you'll feel indebted to me and consider me a nice person. If I ask for repayment, I might get what I want but it won't endear you to me. I want to come across as helpful rather than stingy. For me, as long as it doesn't require much effort I don't mind helping out because it'll improve people's opinions of me and I might need a favor at some point. Being nice and polite is always a good idea because it doesn't really cost anything and it might gain you something. So yeah I find the whole thing funny. I could definetely see networking and remembering to pay back favors as important, but yeah... most fics take it to a weird extreme.

** I will say that for once, the Sorting Hat made a mistake, then.

As a Slytherin /myself/, selfishness is the #1 requirement to exist in Slytherin. And I very much like that it is.

*** Complete selfishness isn't a good thing and I find it would hinder ambition than help it. Generally you need help to achieve bigger goals, and being a selfish person isn't going to endear you to anyone who could help you, that's for sure.

There's a difference between not being walked all over, and being selfish.

The #1 requirement for Slytherin is ambition, it doesn't matter what your ambitions are, but ambition is not a synonym for selfishness.

**** What you need, in order not to find selfishness a hindrance, is 1) hide it enough so that you can get away with it, 2) find an environment where it is acceptable or, indeed, expected. I find Slytherin provides for me both of these.

As Machiavelli noted, it is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. So while you should strive to project a benevolent appearance -- in as far people appreciate such a one, anyway --, of the two aspects, exploiting people gets you further than merely asking for help. This is quite obvious, too, because your ambition will come at the expense of others', and no one is inclined to help you to his own detriment.

However, this is relevant mostly for the world outside the common room. Growing up in Slytherin, I found people appreciating the /virtue of selfishness/. You are not expected to look out for anyone but yourself, so there is no need to hide who you are; everyone around you is just like you, and thus, whether you rise or fall, it is done on your own merits, precisely /because/ no one was there to help you of his own volition. It's refreshing, in a sense, a place where no judgement is cast, and no moralising performed--, not least, because in the first place this would require a concern for any other action than your own ones.

And so, to return to the original question, does it come about that we trade homework and favours: Because the only thing we can count on /is/ being selfish, and I would not dare insult anybody by expecting he give up his precious time or invest a lot of effort in /my/ life, without demanding something in return for his.

*** I only disagree a bit with this statement. Ambition is the number one requirement. In order to be ambitious we have to do selfish things to get where we are going. So ambition and selfishness go hand in hand in certain aspects. FOR EXAMPLE: I will break that pumpkin spice latte drinking, yoga pants wearing mom's little girls right ankle in order for my son to get a spot on the hiphop dance team but I will bat my eyelashes and help get that little disgusting brat into their shiny new car to make me look apologetic and sincere so my son doesn't hurt for it.
