** Tears of laughter at how ridiculous Harry sounds, sure.

Always remember, the classic: "I do not forgive, I do not forget."

** Eh, it started off strong, and then summer happened, and the characters all got secretly replaced with pod people or something.

** A fairly well written fanfic that peters out towards the last third. Compared to other FanFiction its fairly Well written, about the standard of most 'good' fanfics however it's characterisation and the plot itself are fairly lacking. It had a pretty big following here back when it was being written because it was updated so frequently, interesting to see it presented as some masterwork to a group of people who largely followed it while it was current and largely agree that it's more or less a mediocre piece of reasonably well written fiction

** Does it stand against the rest of the fandom as a masterpiece? No.

Is it most likely the best Huer fic out there? Probably. There isnt anything that comes close to its length with the same pairing, is a well written, and complete (NOT ABANDONED).

Its still a solid 4/5 star work. Max

** It honestly is a good read if you like HFleur. It has its issues, and that's coming from someone that has and will continue to defend it.

The last third, as others have pointed out, really loses steam quickly. But the first 2/3 are really damn good.

Definitely Top 3 H/Fleur stories out there.
