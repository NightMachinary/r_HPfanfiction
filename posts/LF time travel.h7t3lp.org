that's not on ao3 under the three main time travel tags. I either read them all, started but didn't like it, or didn't start for a reason. and I'm currently into time travels so much, I don't want to read other fics, so it's either other sites or rereading, but I don't know any other site where this can be searched for as comfortably as on ao3.

please no Tom/Harry (the majority of time travel fics are this, but I don't see the appeal of it), or other death eater with anyone. so no Bellatrix/Hermione either. but like Snarry is ok, or someone with Regulus is fine too since they changed sides.

preferably slash or no romance, if het or fem slash, then only if it's not very important and the story is more about the time travel or other stuff.

prefer fics that change the future, but I've read some good ones where it wasn't the case and liked them still. however, it needs to be reasonable and including the paradox. I've read a fic where Harry let Regulus die, even though he could save him since he was changing stuff anyway. stopped reading right there.

no next generation character time traveling, like Cursed child.

either Marauder's era or HP era is good, also either waking up in own younger body or going back in adult body is fine. potentially waking up in someone else's body would work. though too sad for that person, like... did their soul just die?


** I don't know if you've already seen this one on ao3 but linkao3(The Second String)

It's different then most time travel ones I've seen. It's not completed yet but there's only a few chapters left. The paring is Harry/Gideon Prewett. It has a lot of interesting side characters too.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Ok, I went through my favourites on ff.net and I chose all the ones that follow your parameters:

All of these are Harry-centric (he's the one time traveling) and, apart from You're my Density and Harry Potter and the Last Chance, they barely have any romance.

linkffn(12511998) Wind Shear

Back to the start of Voldemort's rise (70's) - changes to the timeline - Bellatrix/Harry but it's not the focus of the story (Harry doesn't accept her advances because of her mentality. Bella grows as a person and redeems herself. She isn't a Death Eater) - complete

linkffn(12388283) The many Deaths of Harry Potter

This is not the typical time travel story. Every time Harry dies he wakes up days/weeks/months before he died and has to survive what killed him. It is one of my favourite stories, and it has elements of time travel, so I included it.

linkffn(11913447) Amalgum Lockhart's Folly

Back to second year - changes to the timeline - complete

linkffn(11922615) Harry Potter and the Last Chance

Also on ao3 but not under tags - back to fourth year - Harry/Hermione - changes to the timeline - complete

linkffn(11033616) You're my Density

Back to first year - changes to the timeline - Harry/Hermione - complete

linkffn(5511855) Delenda Est

Back to the start of Voldemort's rise - changes to the timeline - Bellatrix/Harry but she isn't a Death Eater and she gets better as a person - complete

linkffn(9622538) Travel Secrets First

Back to first year - changes to the timeline - complete - has two sequels

linkffn(6256154) The Unforgiving Minute

Back to the Triwizard Tournament - changes to the timeline - complete

linkffn(6763981) The Dark Lord's Equal

Back to fifth year - changes to the timeline - complete

linkffn(4198643) Timely Errors

Marauder's Era - no changes to the timeline - complete

linkffn(8175132) Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool

Back to first year - changes in the timeline - complete

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
