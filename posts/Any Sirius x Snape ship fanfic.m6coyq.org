I don't ship that but my girlfriend ships Sirius and Snape for some reason. Can you recommend any fanfic of Sirius x Snape. (least possible ship ever)


** Oh! It's a fun ship, the fics tend to be very angsty and both Severus and Sirius are guaranteed to be difficult people. The pairing does that enemies to lovers dynamic super well because these two aren't just enemies in the abstract---they're very specifically, personally, each other's enemy. And they're on the same side of the war! Just a really different dynamic than the Dark/Light enemies to lovers you'll see in other pairings.

Anyway, here's a post-second-war one I enjoy: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22314115]])

** I haven't read it myself since I don't care for the ship but linkao3(Sleepless) sounded kinda interesting when I saw it stuck in my fic search filters.

  Severus Snape can't sleep. Neither can Sirius Black. When Dumbledore orders them to share a bed for two weeks, revelations come to light.

** Everything by nwhiker is excellent. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/nwhiker/pseuds/nwhiker]] and everyone who /bookmarks/ them has good taste ;) so nwhiker's fics are a great place to start a bookmarks trawl.

** The author FabulaRasa wrote a number of these in the early days (before GoF even I think) that I remember loving. I believe many if not all of them are now on AO3. They are probably all worth looking at; one in particular that I remember is linkao3(Stone Cold Sober by fabularasa).

  This is the sequel to a much shorter story also on this archive, Under the Influence. While it might be helpful to read that brief story first, it's not strictly necessary. This is really the story of how one deals with the aftermath of casual intimacy -- what happens when you want someone you hadn't expected to want, and then when what you want turns out to be. . . rather more.
