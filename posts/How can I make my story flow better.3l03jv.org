** I looked through your first few paragraphs. Not every thought or action has to be explained. The bulk of the writing should contribute to the story, like adding suspense, developing a character, foreshadowing, etc. There is too much on what's happening and not enough on why I should care.

I think the best way to learn how to write in an "interesting" way is to study how different authors lay out a scene. Settings and actions often aren't straightforward but implied and they're always /relevant/. Minerva roaming down the hallway midday then sitting at her desk is a lot of words for not a lot of info. It doesn't give me any mood or anything from your plot.

Punctuation and paragraphs also help regulate pacing, and you should read up on how to properly space out dialogue; any google'd guide will do.

Be mindful that your characters are not you, nor outlets for your beliefs, nor exist to infodump and move the plot forward. That's how they turn out all the same, bland, and/or OOC. Minerva in the beginning is very much an infodump of things I don't know why I should care about.

Hope that gets you somewhere :) If I'm vague, I can try to clarify.

** u/inimically:
#+begin_quote
  Hagrid was never sent to fetch Harry which resulted in Harry being alone for his birthday. He gets fetched a few days later which leads to objective reality taking on a new tone and a new choice made every microsecond. Like a seed being enriched in soil, roots expanding so too does the universal wavefunction. It expands and adapts. Rating will go up. A/U
#+end_quote

Commas are your friend. Your summary is a bit disjointed and has awkward phrasing. Many words are repeated in close proximity. I like the metaphors, but don't think you need both.

You have a tendency to write your sentences in the format "She did/had/was/etc ..." While this is fine, too many in a paragraph/story is unnecessary.

#+begin_quote
  She had a way to organize her the task ahead of her. She strategized the best way to approach her work. Her plan was to start with the final exams; she would start grading them and planed to get those final marks done first. Even though she had a reputation for being strict, she did bump up people to the next grade level if they were shy of a few points. It wasn't much but enough to increase the grades by two percent. "exams" she thought. It was her first priority.
#+end_quote

- Most of the sentences in this paragraph start with she/her. Try rewording so the sentences are statements.

- The first three sentences are a bit redundant -- organize/strategize/plan. Length is great, but repeated ideas take away from the plot.

- Write thoughts like: ="Exams," she thought.= Also consider using italics to easily differentiate from spoken dialogue.

- Ideas in this paragraph need more segues -- the point bump was abrupt

Good luck on the rest of your story :)

** I didn't go too far, just a cursory look, but the sentences seemed kinda stop and go for me. Like someone driving a car stomping break randomly. I don't know how to explain, or even if its what you're looking for.

Also a in that first paragraph, you might want to look at "She had left Homework."
