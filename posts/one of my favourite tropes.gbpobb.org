i love the trope that for some reason some slytherins end up in the DA and end up fighting in the ministry against their parents. I'm not sure why, but the defying their parents thing is really cool and i think quite relatable. Anyone agree? What are some other slytherin related trope you enjoy?


** Not all slytherins are evil and most hate malfoy but defer to him because they're scared of his father's political power
