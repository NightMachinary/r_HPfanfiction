Everyone knows Harry Potter wears glasses, and because everyone knows it, Harry, who got a pair of Muggle Contact Lenses, creates an alter ego that doesn't wear glasses. One simple change, and not one, even Professor Dumbledore, Ron, Sirus, Lupin, none of them recognise him.

Harry decides to exploit this, and any time he needs to do something against the School Rules, or even the Law, he decides to do it as his Alter Ego. The Goblins have no issue with Harry Potter, because Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Wears-Glasses didn't break into Gringotts. Someone with clearly perfect vision did.

Coincidentally, he accidentally turns his alter ego into a wanted criminal and suspected Dark Lord, but Harry Potter? Everyone loves him.


** This reminds of that one prompt I saw on Tumblr, but Sirius Black got changed to Gerald White and it was just him with glasses. Buckbeak was Witherwings also.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth and arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this. ON HIATUS

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
