Where Harry at the beginning of Hogwarts refuses to use wand movements and words


** The one story that immediately comes to mind is The Fires of Magic by Raolin where Harry escapes from the Dursleys and gets trained in a monastery in a different form of magic. He then goes to Hogwarts and is Ravenclaw and is friends with Daphne, Tracey, and fem!Blaise (later Hermione).

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant monsters, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more.

** The Price is Right by High Pot in Noose linkffn(9894129) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2337458][or on AO3]].

#+begin_quote
  He poured his belief in magic's lawlessness and stabbed his wand angrily at the inert feather.

  “Lift, damn you!”

  Granger made to rebuke him again, probably about his lack of proper incantation, but choked on her words when ― against her carefully formed logic ― Harry's feather shot up off the table as if it had been shot out a cannon.

  /... [Bunch of stuff left out to make a shorter post.]/

  “As I told you, Granger, it's /magic/; It's not supposed to make sense.”

Edited because all the paragraphs in the quote went away. Hopefully this time they'll stay.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU
