:END:
So it's Harry/Susan and Harry goes to the hospital wing after the ministry and hears Ron Hermione and Ginny shit talking him, while Neville and I think Luna do nothing. And he goes to Gringotts for siriuses will and finds out he's engaged to Susan bones and how the weasleys will use Muggleborn friends and they made Hermione their slave. Neville ends up crying to Hannah and Harry writes Augusta and breaks the alliance, and in the end Hermione goes back to the care of her parents and to get rid of the Horcruxe Susan and him have sex and she gets pregnant? I cannot remember the name of it and it's really dark but I can't get it out of my head.
