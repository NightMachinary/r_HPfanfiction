What do we have in books? Tonks is using her metamorph abilities for fun and in professional setting all the time, doesn't seem to be very much concerned about her identity. Fleur is confident in her skills and beauty, takes charmed partner to the ball, isn't ostracized.

And what do we usually have in romance themed fanfiction involving them?

With Tonks it becomes "I want to see the /real/ you", and she immediately melts, maybe even remembers some of her past boyfriends who only dated her because she could turn into other people.

With Fleur it's always "Every girl hates me because I'm so beautiful, every boy only lusts after me because of good looks, my allure is a burden, but you are immune and don't care about beauty, the only one in the entire world".

Is there stories with a different take on those characters? With Tonks thinking that every version of her is the /real/ her and shifting around just for fun, with Fleur being extremely popular and who enjoys the attention her allure brings from the opposite(or even the same) gender? Where their relationship aren't always "pure", with their partner (Harry or whoever) being attracted to them /only/ because of their deep personalities or beautiful souls?

I think in a realistic portrayal they should feel insulted.

Tonks: "What do you mean 'the real me'? Do you think this is not the real me, do you think I'm some kind of fake? I *am* a Metamorph you prick!"

Fleur: "Do you think me to be little girl, 'arry? Do you think I 'ave not mastered control over my powers? I'm very comfortable with who I am, thank you very much."

*** The question about a metamorph base form on its own shouldn't be insulting. I mean, given how rare they are they would undoubtedly be the subject of a lot of urban legends (baseform, base gender, the ability to grow one (or five) cocks, gag reflex, improved healing and so on) and clarification would probably be something that Tonks would provide for her own sake. But I agree that the wording "The real you" won't fly.

***** Tbh that's a common thing in Harry/Tonks stories. I always figure if the author really must use that element a bit of subtlety would go a long way. Perhaps instead of just asking "Whatcha really look like? (I'm so good)" maybe just have Harry (or Bill, Lupin, whoever) show they don't place so much emphasis on what they look like by focusing on other personal issues they're dealing with.

** Self promotion time:

For Fleur I've written "Drool" where she is annoyed by how people at Hogwarts react (eg Roger Davis) but is also comfortable with her abilities and teases Hermione with it (who is wingmanning for Harry).

For Tonks I have two stories, one where she comes across Hermione and, after a rather academic discussion about Metamorphmagi they end up on a spontaneous date. The other is a longer, ongoing story where she and Harry end up in an international murder mystery. I'm rewriting the first chapter since it has way too much exposition and throws a little too much shade at Lupin and Dumbledore.

Tonks is fairly sex positive in both of them and confident in her abilities.

** I don't know why people always suggest Tonks doesn't have a base form. I suppose we know know for certain that it's her "default," but she does have a "normal" form--the mousy-haired form we see in Book 6 when she's depressed.

That said, I do see Tonks being insulted or at least rolling her eyes at anyone asking to see her base form because it's more fun for her to use her ability creatively.

For Fleur, I lean more toward fanon toned down: people who can resist the veela allure are more common than in most fanon, and it's a sliding scale. She's has decent control over it, and she's not afraid to use it to get a date (she did on Cedric and Roger, after all), but remember, she's also one of the most gifted students in her school. For a serious romantic relationship, I think she would be looking for someone who can keep their wits around her.

Or that's her "depressed" form, which seems more logical to me.

But yeah, she definitely has a "base" form, I just don't think she would put much meaning into it - since she had her abilities since birth I believe for her changing appearance is akin to regular humans changing their clothes. Yeah, that's not her "base" face she's wearing right now, so?

Impersonating specific people can be more trickier matter for sure, but I honestly don't think she'll have some serious reservations against it.

Agreed on you with Fleur.

Actually, is there a canon description about her allure, specifically about her ability to dial it up and down. Because if we apply the same thing I said about Tonks, with her power being completely natural thing for her since birth, she might not think of it as if it was a separate thing needed to be "activated". So a person who's completely "immune" to her can be seen as someone not attracted to her at all. Which can be seen as unflattering(he thinks I'm not pretty enough!)... Or she can decide that since that person isn't interested she might as well go for someone else... Or she can take that as a challenge and attempt to seduce him.

That's a really interesting topic that I wish was explored more in fanon. Both Fleur and Tonks usually depicted as "regular young woman with unusual gift", and not "unusual young women". That's understandable, since the whole magic world is more of a "regular world with magic in it" than "magical world", but still...

I read it as her base form because we know that depression can suppress magical abilities. It's in the same book that we see Merope failing at magic due to depression and abuse, so Tonks's state serves as foreshadowing. (I think Harry might have even made the comparison, but I could be imagining that.) That's why I think in that scene, she simply isn't able to morph very well as opposed to being in a mousy-brown mood.

** Finally the perfect place to post my new favorite story! Linkffn(12729845) is an awesome example of both Tonks and Fleur in a romantic sense (Fleur enjoys her allure and has no problem abusing it if necessary, she and Harry even train with it so she can get better at directing it in combat). Tonks is pretty damn clear about how much she loves being a metamorph and Is incredibly sex positive throughout. The only thing that might put people off (aside from a bit of clunky writing in the first half that improves dramatically) is that it's a Harry/Fleur/Tonks story. Which I get completely, but give it a shot. It's not a Harem or Harry just picking up two girlfriends who happen to be hot it's a genuine three way relationship where the author goes out of his way to make sure it's clear Fleur and Tonks are as much in love with each other as Harry.

The one thing which completely ruined the story for me was the part when Harry burst into Grimmauld because one of the witches got hurt and there was this ridiculously over-dramatic scene where Snape saves her life, Harry has a complete breakdown and then praises Snape to hell and back. That just felt like an obvious author opinion-insert to me and came out of nowhere.

Also, while entertaining to a certain degree, none of the characters feels like their Harry Potter equivalent.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
