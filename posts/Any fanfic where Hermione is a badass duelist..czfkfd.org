Badass warrior Hermione, although less typical duelist and more "let's block escape routes, blow up the wall, rush in with guns blazing until they react and put up shield charms, then switch to wands and curses"

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Not canon. That's for sure.

Edit : Yeah, downvote. Why not. It's not like Hermione gets panicked hard in a tense situation and actually used a freaking Silencing charm against a Death Eater.

And don't take it seriously, I was joking. For the most part.

*** Who is a good duelist then? Harry is definetly not a dueling prodigy considering all of his hardest fights he gets out by virtue of Deux Ex Machina or through surprise advantage. We never read Ron as being better nor worse than Hermione. The rest of DA seemed rather even with each other.\\
Honestly very few fights are settled in a protracted test of skill and/or power.\\
A few outliers are Molly and Percy during the final battle, and Snape actually managing to just barely maim Fred during the broom chase.

**** Hermione isn't in canon.

She hesitates quite a bit, and she herself acknowledges Harry as the best at DADA in their year if not the school by the spread of students in the DA.

Although, it does veer on inappropriate for a request thread.

***** Sigh... why is Hermione a bad duelist? Because she is not the best duelist? Because she thinks Harry as better than her? She also thinks Harry is a better speech performer so does that make her bad at speeches? She thinks Ron is better than her at Chess so does that make her bad a chess?

Of course it doesn't because it's a faulty argument.

While Harry was figuring out how to get out of Gringots she held off the Goblins. When escaping the ministry, at Godrics Hollow and at the Lovegood tower her fast actions saved the entire group.

At Luchino Caffe Dolohov singlehanded bound Ron, evaded Harrys stuning attempt while Harry was invisible only to get body-bound by Hermione.

******* Ah, original comment implied strong that she was bad and when you agreed without clarification I assumed your opinion on the matter to be the same. Personally I would still define her at exceptional, but that is because personally I think the only way to judge her is in comparison with her peers and opposition where she most often comes ahead.

******** She's definitely more magically skilled than her peers. But dueling isn't just about the number of spells, but rather using them in a fashion. Hermione and Ron are about the same level per Order of the Phoenix when it comes to actual fights.

I don't like calling her exceptional though. She's smart, smarter than her peers, whenever the book doesn't have her drop the idiot ball. Rowling calls her a borderline genius, and for the most part, I like this as her characterization. She works hard though. She's an /excellent/ researcher. Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape are exceptional. Even the Marauders are as well, at least magically.

Definitely should have clarified though.

***** (I've only read the original 7 so I don't know about their skills after the 7th year, so can't comment on that.)

Battle of the Potters? Is that cursed child?

How can you be good if you regularly gets taken out quickly often enough that you need to mention it?

We never once have a duel where fatigue was a determining factor so athleticism isn't a determining factor, especially considering most fights are done with within seconds. Also, athleticism doesn't not grant you speed, it depends on the activity that gave you said athleticism. And honestly, Ron isn't the greatest Quidditch player, he couldn't even get the position fair and square.

The troll charm was a lucky break in a tense situation and not representative of Ron several years later when most of the actual magical fights happen. And if you really want to include the use of 'an unorthodox spell cast in the last second in a perilous situation' as proof of skill then I would point you to when the snatchers caught the entire trio and Hermione was the only one to react in time and Hex Harry.

When Hermione silenced Dolohov she did it at the end of Fifth year, and at the time she had not been taught Non-verbal magic. So pardon her for not predicting her opponent being perfectly capable of silent cursing when she hadn't even been taught of its existence. (Officially, she likely knew it was possible, but predicting and compensating for something you've never been taught does not make you terrible.)

Ron tricked his way away from the snatchers, he didn't duel or run from them.

Neville, Luna or Ginny are never described as being better than their peers in DA yet those three could hold their ground in the Ministry.

PS: The Snape comment was a compliment to his skill, the same as Percy and Molly. That's why they are outliers, because they are shown to being way more capable than expected for a potions teacher, house-wife and a pencil pusher.

Edit: Replid to another comment and found a few more arguements; While Harry was figuring out how to get out of Gringots she held off the Goblins. When escaping the ministry, at Godrics Hollow and at the Lovegood tower her fast actions saved the entire group.

At Luchino Caffe Dolohov singlehanded bound Ron, evaded Harrys stuning attempt while Harry was invisible only to get body-bound by Hermione after Hermione had dragged a stunned Ron into cover.
