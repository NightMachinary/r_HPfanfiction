Please can you recommend fics in which Ron isn't bashed. I'm sick to the back teeth of Ron being an incompetent moron who only exists to insult Hermione, making others look good by comparison. In canon Ron's a good guy, yes he made Hermione cry in PS but he didn't mean for her to hear, he was just venting frustrations to his friend. He then went on to save her from a troll and sacrifice himself to stop someone getting the PS. Chamber of secrets he faced his biggest fear, spiders, to save the school and then went after the basilisk to save his sister. The list goes on, this guy is a big damn hero and I'm sick of seeing him portrayed as a whimpering coward.


** ChipmonkOnSpeed's, Gryffindors Never Die and the newer, in-progress, Boys 'Round Here both have a pretty awesome Ron. Both have a fairly similar vibe: adult Harry and Ron travel back in time and don't bother trying to act like teenagers.

Quite a lot of fun, in fact I may go ahead and re-read GND now that I mention it.

  With Sirius Black on the loose, Harry and Ron arrive for their 3rd year as rambunctious, loud, obnoxious teenagers. Sounds normal. Why, then, is Albus Dumbledore so worried? Is it going to be just a normal year at Hogwarts? Is it ever when a Potter is involved?

** I hear you. Ron is treated badly in much of fanfiction. I think part of this is ragehate on the part of the H/Hr shippers, part of it is disappointment in Harry's systemic underachievement throughout canon, with Ron being a convenient scapegoat.

Some stories with sympathetic/heroic Ron:

linkffn(Number Games by jbern) is very good, one of my favorite fanfiction stories that Jim's written.

Everything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]] (Ella) refrains from Weasley bashing and Ron is one of her favorite characters.

My one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]] has him in a heroic role.

#+end_quote

I ship H/Hr but I don't hate on Ron and in fact it's something that constantly gets on my nerves when I read it in practically any fic, regardless of who's shipped with who. It's all over the top bashing of his flaws that he displays early on, the things that he eventually gets over.

But yeah, it's literally at the point now that the only bashing of Ron I'll accept is when Harry is sorted into Slytherin. Because that is acceptable bashing. It's canon effectively, given that Ron has a natural bias against all Slytherins regardless of who they are and what they do. So it's natural that his target would respond in kind. Honestly that bias is probably just a problem with his upbringing, but it's something that's tolerable if not understandable if we put ourselves in his shoes.

Any other bashing of him or outside of that context will literally make me put down the fic and read something else. H/Hr fics are nice usually, but the level of Ron bashing in some of them is ridiculous. Not to mention it usually downgrades into "let's bash the whole Weasley family, the only people who treat Harry like true family and say Harry and Hermione's love lives were actually manipulated by Molly Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Albus Dumbledore for whatever reason we choose to invent by use of love potions." Honestly, that gets dull and repetitive real fast.

Tbh I agree in part with the user howtopleaseme on this. It would be easier if the trio didn't date each other, perhaps it would even be preferable. Which is why I guess in non BWL stories like Kwan Li's the Other Boy Who Lived, Harry is not even in the trio and is therefore "eligible" to date Hermione without competition or hatred from Ron.

*** Lots of H/Hr shippers /do/ seem to dislike him, but I think there's more to it:

[[http://www.tor.com/2014/01/15/erased-by-time-and-blockbusters-the-cautionary-tale-of-ron-weasley/]]

And then sure enough we have all these H/Hr stories that favor the movies over the books. It doesn't help that they're all more or less the /same/ story of Dumbledore's manipulation, secret vaults, Ron's bad influence, love potions, etc. etc.

Needless to say, a good portrayal of H and Hr without any of those things is something of a rare treat for me.

You know, for me its just that I hate, hate hate hate hate hate, Ron/Hermione. I think it completely degraded both characters in HP. I like H/Hr fine, but I think the trio not dating each other probably would have been best. Add to this that Ron suddenly speaks parselmouth in DH and you have my two least favorite things about cannon, and they both feature Ron Weasley.

I think my views on this are pretty common, which is where a lot of the hate comes from I think.

Seconding this. Her [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4871753/1/Through-a-Dark-Mirror][Through a Dark Mirror]] is Ron Centric. Abandoned though. /Sigh/. If only I could pay Ella to finish her stories (This one, but specifically Yellow Submarine and Socks), I would do it in a heartbeat.

Also, Harry/Ginny stories in general rarely bash the rest of the Weasleys and Ron is generally an important character, though almost all of them pair Ron with Hermione, so YMMV. Try linkffn(After the End), which has the best Ron characterization ever, linkffn(The Black Library) and Linkffn(Phantom Limb) for other good Ron characterizations.

Also, Syn's [[http://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/?skip=100][Wake the Dead]] has a very heroic Ron. Plus, the whole story is basically an zombie invasion of Hogwarts, which is awesome.

Not very fond of Jbern's Number Games. Ron doesn't feel very Ron-ish (All of Jbern's protagonists are pretty much the same regardless of which story), and I don't have much reason to read a Ron story if Ron isn't characterized right.

** linkffn(The Price of Love by RogueSugah)

I'll make this recommendation with a few caveats, which I'll get out of the way right quick.

Firstly, the simple AGE of this fanfic (2004-2006) means you're likely to encounter multiple tropes that have simply fallen out of fashion in the years since. This also means, of course, that the fic is post-OotP at the most.

Secondly, you have to be able to live with the author's form of dialogue, which can be a bit shouty even when it's just internal dialogue. For me, it works though, because it seems consistent with Ron's character and age to be a bit internally confused and constantly changing his mind/arguing with himself.

If you can get past that, plus other issues I'm sure I don't remember thanks to my rose tinted glasses of remembrance, this is one of the few longer stories I've read where Ron's good intentions are honored and recognized, despite his faults.

  A magical infection has Ron critically ill, but after the devastation of the war he decides his family and friends don't need to know. How long can he hide it though? TRIO CENTRIC and George with Ron as protagonist. Unknown updates. Sorry.

** I get where you're coming from I really do, but I still feel that Ron is a whiny bitch, "Boo hoo my brothers get all the glory." gets pretty old, and don't forget what a bastard he was to Harry during GoF, some friend. Also during the Horcrux hunt. He's not really a friend, he thinks he is, but in reality he's just leeching off of Harry's popularity and Hermione's knowledge, without them I doubt he would have passed his OWL's. He's what I call a reluctant hero, he was just at the right place at the right time.

*** I always think about when his leg was broken and yet he stood up and moved in between a crazed Sirius Black and Harry and said "You'll have to kill me first!".

Reluctant hero <-- fuck that.

*** I like how OP asked for something, and you just gave him more of the opposite.

"Anyone have anything positive about Ron."... "RON SUCKS!" Oh thanks bro.
