It's said in the first book that someone who drinks unicorn blood would live a cursed life but it is never explained. Perhaps the curse is severe bad luck and that's why Voldemort can never kil Harry and its not Harry's good luck. What other curses could be given to those that drink the blood. Is there even a curse or is it just a deterrent designed to dissuade others from drinking it.


** I feel like it's a curse in the truest sense, in that it utterly gainsays the reason you drank it. You want to recover from near death? Ok, it doesn't kill you, but it gives you a necrotizing skin condition and weeping sores. Bones become extremely brittle, the sense of pain is intensified while other senses mute or are done away with entirely, muscles become prone to tearing, etc. You drink the unicorn blood and you “survive”.

*** Well, it is said in the book that it's the */killing of the unicorn/* that curses you, not the drinking of the blood itself.

And tbh, I am using that in one of my (unpublished) fics, playing at the wording and wondering: "What if the unicorn gave his blood willingly?"

**** Maybe I'm wrong, but I remember that drinking unicorn blood curses you, because to drink it you have to kill a unicorn...

I'm going to re-read that passage

***** Unless my memory's playing tricks on me (always possible), Firenze says you'll be cursed from the moment the blood passes your lips, which I would take to mean that it's the drinking of the blood that does it.

****** Well, yes, but then he says that it's because you killed the creature /and/ drank its blood.

******* According to that sentence, you could slaughter unicorns by the thousands and you'd be fine so long as no blood passed your lips.

It's the drinking, not the killing.

******** I have to disagree, it's the act of both.

It means that you'll be fine as long as you don't drink */OR/* as long as you didn't kill a unicorn and only drank.

** [my headcanon] - Strictly speaking, it's Quirrel who kills the unicorn and drinks its blood, in order to sustain his body while hosting Voldemort. His life was fairly wretched by that point, and Harry's touch basically ended him because of that curse.

** The "half-life" description in the book makes me think that every time you drink Unicorn blood from then on, it is half as effective. So if you want to survive for any length of time you have to drink exponential amounts of unicorn blood.
