I am not sure if people have already written HP fanfics for this, but I wondered how it would be if Harry literally said what he thought.

For example if Harry thought Ron ate like a pig with no manners at the table.

"You eat like a pig, Ron. My cousin eats like a pig too, and I don't like my cousin."


** “Bugger off. ‘m hungry” replied an irked Ron.

Summary: Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell.
