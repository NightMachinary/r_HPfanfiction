So, I wrote HP fanfic 10-15 years ago, and now after returning recently, I've noticed a new trend in some of the fanfic communities I'm in, which puzzles me. I should preface this by saying I am truly curious to hear everyone's opinions on it, and am sharing my own opinion from a place of wanting to understand.

Essentially, I've noticed that readers will kind of bandwagon together to blame authors for not tagging or having a warning for something that makes them uncomfortable. Not obvious things that make many people uncomfortable, like rape or incest, but things that are up for interpretation - for example, not tagging violence because somebody was slapped, or not tagging abusive relationship because an argument between two characters hits the wrong tone for them, or not tagging a character as dark/OOC because the author's interpretation is perhaps a bit darker or morally grey than their own.

Of course, it's a reader's right not to like a story or characterization. But I'm inclined to feel like it is also their responsibility to exit out of a story if they feel uncomfortable. It seems like too much responsibility to put on an author otherwise.

How do you guys, as readers and authors, handle this issue? Interested to hear discussion!


** It's in part due to how over Sensitive we are becoming as a culture. But i feel that the fact your reading a Rating based on ages ( K, T , M) you need to accept certain things will happen in these within reason. I would not expect strong violence in K/T but language maybe.

Unless its a very taboo subject I don't think there should be a warning unless the scene goes very graphic, there is a difference between graphic violence or sex to say, implied violence and faded scenes.

If a story contains taboos, graphic sex or violence, or actual abusive relationships such, Hell yes label them.

But if its a slap to the cheek is violence? or they think arguments are abusive? they need to look in the mirror thats not the authors fault,

** I refuse to add any warnings in my fic. It's rated 'M' for mature. That should be sufficient for people to understand there may be some unpleasant things within. If people cannot understand what the ratings are, that's on them, and not the author.

** I think the overall rating you give your fic should cover you for most things (so slapping, angst, relationships that sort of things). If your reading a M story then yeah, expect heavy themes, that's why it's rated M.

After that's it's your discretion. If your fic is advertised or tagged to contain a theme (an abusive relationship) then you shouldn't have to state it every chapter. People should know.

But if there's something that happens that might take people by surprise (like a gruesome death in a smutty fic) then I would maybe give a specific warning on the chapter because I came here for smut not gore so I might not want to see that.

I appreciate chapter warnings just because sometimes I'm not in the right headspace to read certain things. But it doesn't need to be anything more specific than "Chapter warning - homophobic slur". And I usually know what I'm getting into when I click into the fic anyway so it doesn't turn me off it.

** Thanks for the responses! It makes sense to me that ratings and the established warnings are a good "rule of thumb" and everything beyond that is open within reason. I suppose, as an author, you really can't cover everything or please everyone (which goes for everything, not just warnings!) and everyone has a different constitution/tolerance level. I just wanted some perspective from others, because I do NOT have a delicate constitution, haha. I actually sometimes like to read Dead Dove: Do Not Eat content :)

** I think it's hard to pin down because what might be triggering to one person might not bother someone else so as a writer you can only tag certain things and can't account for little or obscure things that may cause upset

â€‹

i think just tag what you can.....obvously tag things like violence and gore,rape but i Don't think it's a writers responsibility to tag things like slamming doors or peoples tone of voice
