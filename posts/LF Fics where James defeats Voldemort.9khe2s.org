Title. I'm open to any Non-slash pairing fic that has James defeating Voldemort and either staying alive and Voldemort ends up in the same condition as canon or where he dies and Voldemort ends up in the same condition as canon.


** Mmm, you know how much snape hates harry for being famous.... Imagine the hate directed towards James being crowned the savior of the wizarding world. Especially if it was a defeat, similar to Harry's, where it wasn't a show of power or anything, but an accident. Like he tripped or something. Snapes POV one-shot could be quite hilarious.

** Hmm, Harry's power isn't his mother's love but his father's. Or maybe both his parents' love.
