Hello

Is there a story that Harry loses his hocruxs in the second year because of the basilisk poison. But they still uses the portkey like in the tournament but Peter misses Cedric and hit Harry and no do over fic because i want to see the aftermath and whom Dumbledore gonna use now.


** First of all, Dumbledore isn't going to "use" anyone. Harry was BWL because of Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's choices, and Lily's sacrifice. Rather, it'll be up to the good people of Wizarding world---including Dumbledore---to fight and defeat Voldemort and his followers.

Off the top of my head,

- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels explore Harry dying in his infancy and its consequences.
- linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) has a reincarnated!Harry who isn't BWL.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)Year 1: Ron Weasley is not as alone as you might expect.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

** It's not quite the same setup as you're asking, but the idea of Harry dying and Dumbledore having to look elsewhere is a central element of the crossover linkffn(4521407).

  The Boy Who Lived didn't. Now 13 years after Harry Potter was murdered by the Dursleys, magical England is on the verge of collapse. So Luna Lovegood wishes for someone to come and make it all better.
