:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic, think it was a oneshot where Harry had stopped to talk to Cho and gave her a hug and when he got back to the Gryffindor common room Ginny slapped him and accused him of cheating on her, and Harry dumped her on the spot for hitting him.

Any help or similar stories would be great so long as they don't end Harry/Ginny

Perchance, were you on TvTropes, reading about Double Standard: Female on Male Abuse, Fanfic examples?\\
That's where I encountered a link to it.

*** Dammit. I was trying to figure out if this was someone being sarcastic about where to find it, or some sort of 'FFN has lots of Ginny-bashing" reference.

.. then I realized you were OP clarifying your request.

  In where Ron decides his dignity is more important than a date with Hermione. AU, ONE-SHOT. Based on a Reddit comment by Bleepbloopbotz2, and a post by jakky567.
