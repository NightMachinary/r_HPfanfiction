I am in the mood for some Harry goes back in time, but what I am really after is older Harry living at the same time as younger Harry. maybe he assumes another identity or the order knows who he is but I'm thinking of him being at least at hogwarts for young Harry's first year. bonus points if he is paired with Fleur or Tonks!


** linkffn(The Long Vacation by n1ght3lf). Living at the same time - check. At Hogwarts - no.

linkffn(A Good Teacher by Nia River). Don't remember much about this one except that it reads more like the setup to a larger story.

linkffn(A Jaunt Through Time by Nia River). Unspeakable Harry helps Tournament Harry. Crack.

linkffn(Greater Than, Lesser Be by Kneazle). Harry discovers his life has been manipulated. He interferes with the spell to send his soul back for a redo, and ends up physically in the (a) past.

linkffn(How Harry Turned Hogwarts Around by White Angel of Auralon). Harry goes back in time, gets hired at Hogwarts.

linkffn(A Brand New Start by fairywm). Harry goes back to raise himself.

There are a couple of others I seem to remember, but I can't find them right now.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
