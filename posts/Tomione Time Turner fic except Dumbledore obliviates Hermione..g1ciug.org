Hermione is a mysterious new student.

She has amnesia and the rumour is that it had something to do with Gindelwald.

She remembers every spell, charm and potion, she has great DADA reflexes and is an accomplished occlumens but has no idea who she is and where she's from.

Tom gets interested in her because of her magical skills and mysterious story. They start spending time together --- and Hermione is unafraid since she doesn't know who he is.

Then one night, she starts having strange dreams, remnants of memories. At one point, she realizes Dumbledore obliviated her. She teams up with Tom to find out the truth.
