So the armor that adorns Hogwarts serves Harry, I believe it's a crack fic,

I believe Dumbledore gets demoted to the janitors closet and umbridge doesn't even get to spout her nonsense, she just gets the boot

Guys help, I can't find it anywhere, another hint to same/ other fic...

Psychopathic Arthur Weasly tortures Pettigrew


** First fic is almost certainly linkffn(Ah, screw it!). And the second I'm pretty sure is linkffn(Core Threads by theaceoffire)

*** ~looked at the first chapter of Ah, Screw It!~

...That...I don't think I liked that very much. I was looking forward to a slightly loony Harry, instead I saw 'Right of Conquest' and 'Lord Slytherin' played without irony, Snape-bashing, casual character assassination of Ron, and Harry being a loudmouthed entitled hmmph. I got halfway through the first chapter before flipping to the bottom of the page to see if it gets better and I found that Snape had apparently been forced into magically-binding slavery to Harry somehow. I don't want to know how that came about.

***** Mm, you're welcome. I stopped reading Core Threads after the 'psychopathic Arthur Weasley tortures Pettigrew' mentioned above happened, too, but it was decent-enough before that.

Still, I wonder if Ah, Screw It might be worth anything after the first chapter? Surely it can't get any worse than it starts off?

****** It's pretty entertaining. Just don't take it seriously. But if you didn't like anything in the first chapter, I highly doubt you'll enjoy the rest tbh. We just all have different tastes in this community, lol. If you're looking for an OP curb stomp!Harry, this fic definitely fulfills it. I am slightly biased though, as I've read most of the author's other works and always have been entertained.

I've probably reread most of his stories at least three times, haha

******* Actually, the writing improves dramatically after the first couple of chapters. It has some excellent plotting and individual scenes and is quite comical.
