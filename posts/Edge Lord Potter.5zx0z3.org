** linkffn(Runic Animagi) has Harry getting some sick tatts then lighting up with Dobby in the first chapter. I think he does a sex as well, but I've mostly blotted this from my memory...

*** Oh man, is this one rough.

I have a softness for HP/DG fics, but I don't think I've ever made it all the way to Hogwarts in this one. I've honestly tried more than once as well.

Definitely does a sex. I checked quick, and one instance was with a married mother of two! 10/10 edge, perfect for this request.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
