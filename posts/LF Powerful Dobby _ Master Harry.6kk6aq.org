I read a HP crossover on Star Wars where Dobby is a mechanic for Harry and I really enjoyed how both Dobby and Harry were bad asses. Wondering if there's anymore out there where Harry accepts Dobby as his elf.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous) and its sequel feature this. Mostly the sequel. Edit: This isn't the right one, but it's worth a read.

There's also a fic where Harry builds a house elf army and defeats Voldemort with it. Can't remember the name though.

Edit: This totally isn't the one I was thinking of. One second need to search.

Edit2: linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced)

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*** I don't want to sound mean, but I find it hilarious that someone confused those two fics. It was a great laugh, really, and it made my day better.

And yes, I've read them both and like them both.

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
