It could be in the perspective of a kid who didn't receive their Hogwarts letter or maybe an adult who finally decided to venture into the Muggle world. Or just any squib-centric stories. Thank you.


** Filch got himself a brand new name, a large house and a growing family. All was going well. That is, of course, until Robb Stark nodded on his door asking for an alliance.

** There was this fanfiction where Lily Luna was a squib and Harry took her and left to live in the muggle world because her family didn't accept her. (Which would make sense since they had an accountant cousin that no one talked about) but I don't remember the title of the fic. If anyone could link it I would be thankful.

  How does one deal with a child who is different? Some do, some can't bring themselves to.

Summary (copied from the wrok): Roxanne Weasley, daughter of George Weasley, thought that all she had to worry about once she turned eleven was avoiding her brother Fred's pranks, working up the courage to occasionally talk to someone outside the family, and learning magic. But when she doesn't receive her Hogwarts letter, Roxanne has a lot more to deal with. Squib law states, she has to go to Muggle school!

** To build off [[/u/jdaev][u/jdaev]] recommendation, Exile is really good. Draco is not a squib in this story, but he might as well be after the war. It's also fairly realistic in terms of redemption --- he doesn't become a good person overnight, nor does he get to forgive himself for what he's done.

I really wish we've got a sequel to it. Especially one detailing his eventual return to the magical world.
