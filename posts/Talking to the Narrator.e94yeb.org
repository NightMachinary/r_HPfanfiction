So, there are games like Bard's Tale (the inXile one, not the originals) and The Stanley Parable where the protagonist and narrator interact. Are there any fics covering that concept?

Milo is a character from DnD there's a scene where he literally tells the writer that there wasn't really enough foreshadowing to justify this plot twist. He also determines that anyone you can describe with more than three adjectives is going to be relevant to the plot later on.
