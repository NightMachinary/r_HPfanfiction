Most, if not all Harry/Hermione stories have some sort of love declaration and pining before they get together. But are there any stories where they get together without much thought about it? Eg they sit on the couch in the common room, Hermione looks over at Harry, has the sudden urge to kiss him and acts on it. Or the Harry/Ginny gettogether but without the prelude and with Hermione instead?


** Ahah I would find it funny,

Both are sitting in the common room reading a book and then Hermione lifts her head and asks the Harry

"Hey, interested in getting together?"

"You mean as a couple?"

"Yeah"

"Ok"

and then they return to their respective reading

  A heartfelt conversation with Hermione leaves Harry with some serious questions which can only be answered by experience. But the real question is: Is Hermione ready to give them a shot?

  Harry and Hermione are sick of Ginny and Ron shoving their relationships in their faces. So, when Hermione gets the idea for them to pretend to date, Harry agrees. Because, it's only pretend, right? H/Hr. HBP.

** Honestly only time I see this fitting in would be right before yule ball or perhaps maybe slug club.

Most h/hr has the secretly pining for each other, and once that one obstacle is removed they get true wuv. The rest tend to be with one side interested and resigned with the other oblivious. Sadily even situations that seem apt at throwing people unexpectantly into a romantic situation (the dreaded marriage law fics), usually fall into one of those two catagory so.

I do recall one fic that was McGonagall going 'harry you have a date yet? No? Hermione, you are drafted' with a predictable follow up from there...

*** Do you mean "Yuletide Blessing in Disguise"? linkffn(12773140)

I liked the idea. I'd like it even better if Hermione was asked directly by Harry, but there are barely any fics. Wasn't too fond of the execution of this one. They start dating right away and immidiatly confess their undying love, when minutes before Harry didn't even realise Hermione is in fact a girl. They are my favourite pairing. Unfortunatly I rarely find a fic where the plot doesn't go from 10 to 1000. From them being friends to them being married after a week or soulmates or the like.

**** Yep. I didn't recall Yuletide fitting this request very well, just that its concept was one I could see fitting the request very well.

Once you get to year 5+ both of them seem to have enough romantic baggage that this seems unlikely without at least one of them working toward it. End of year three would fit well (particularly a 'sirius mistakes them for dating and it snowballs'), but they are a bit young and you have to deal with cannons 'summer resetting Harry to a shitty situation'.

So 4th year seems like the best candidate for this. The ages fit, not a lot of other romantic baggage, there was a period in the book of 'Harry & Hermione vs everyone', and Harry was busy trying to survive the year. And the best chance for a 'just stumble into dating' in forth year would be the Ball.

(Now that I think of it, I could also see Sirius/Hermione doing a summer rescue either before or after forth year kinda fitting this, since you don't have to play up any existing romantic feelings for that, but the Ball still feels like the best way for a 'it just kinda happened' situation in this timeframe...)

***** I agree. Book four gives so many possibilities for it to turn into Harry&Hermione. Despite that there's barely any fic for that written. Either that or they turn OOC really quickly.

"Hermione rescuing Harry" usually turns into Harry at the Grangers which then births either before mentioned OOC H&H or the story drifts into some kind of other fantasy world which could be a completely different universe of its own.

"Sirius mistakes them for dating" would also be interesting if it wouldn't lead to an immideat relationship(which again, rarely happens). It could just be the pre-ball wake up call for Harry that Hermione is actually a girl. (Wasn't year 3 where Cho was first mentioned? So there is some tiny bit of awareness towards girls already.) But since he's young and naive he just pushes it aside until the yule ball comes and there we go.
