This request may be seen as unusual one, but let's be honest: during all 7 books Harry made quite a lot of stupid decisions and actions even for a teenager.

Can you recommend a story that exposes his such decisions and resolves the Riddle problem in a smarter way?

Thanks!


** Wouldn't you consider all those fics that make Harry smarter or more powerful than he is in canon as a form of bashing? The authors hated canon Harry so they gave him a new personality.

*** Godlike Harry stories is a separate genre.

Ideally I'd like to read something where some 3rd person break all Harry's stupid actions and may be does his "work" for him.

There're a lot of Ron and Hermione bashing stories. But they are not the only ones who behaved stupidly. For a change I'd like to read something similar about Harry too.

*** Certainly HPMOR... considering the writer considers canon Harry to be irrational.

**** HPMOR is a gem :-)

Still it can be placed in a separate genre of Godlike Harry.

** I enjoyed this chapter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/13/Force-Interrupt]]

I love it when authors use Snape to Harry-bash because it's always funny when it's well-done and it's so perfectly in-character.

** I second this (if Harry changes after the bashing, because canon Harry is truly worthy of bashing...damned slacker who should have died with his constant "woe is me" while at the same time never standing up for himself or trying to change anything!)

*** I believe you're mixing up Harry with *Ron*, now Ron is truly lazy. Harry is indifferent to studying due to his life growing more and dangerous thanks to the rising threat from Voldemort.

And he never actually whined, despite making it clear he was dissatisfied with his being forced to take care of Tom constantly. yes, even OOTP he's still justified in "whining" due to the fact he watched Cedric be murdered. was ostracized all of Fourth year, has PTSD. his friends didn't even send him one letter all of the pre-Year 5 summer, protects Dudley and almost gets expelled from Hogwarts with his wand snapped for it. and he still has to go to a Hearing, not to mention Dumbledore unreasonably being a dick suddenly.

**** We all have different tastes. There're a lot of Ron bashing stories that cover all his flaws. Harry has his flaws too. It's only fare to have a share a bashing stories about him too. It doesn't mean we don't like him. It just means we want something different for a change.

** Would a twin fic that bashes the twin that acts more like canon Harry but has a different name count, if so Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes comes to mind.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** This does not completely answer what you're looking for. This is a fic I read along time ago (DH hadn't even come out yet) that I recall contains a Snape who is derisive of Harry. There might have even been Snape literally bashing Harry's head onto a table.

  Post OOP: Harry, still haunted by the events at the DOM, escapes Privet Drive and Snape becomes his unwilling accomplice. Complete.
