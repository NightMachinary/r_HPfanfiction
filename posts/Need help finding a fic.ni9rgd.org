:END:
I remember that it was after 5th year and Harry saw Sirius in his dreams where he wasn't really dead yet but he helped Harry cope and train. That's about all remember but I really want to read it again lol. Thanks in advance!


** “Taking Control” by fake a smile [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11709][on SIYE]] linksiye(11709). It has a really good start, but then it turns into yet another boring super!Harry story.
