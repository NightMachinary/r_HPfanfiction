This fic is where Harry and Ginny are in a relationship and I think Ron and Hermione are in one but they get in a big fight and break up and Hermione then joins Harry and Ginny. It is rated M and there is sex. Anyone know?


** Sounds like Searching for the Power. Do they practice occulmency by meditating in the nude and Harry ends up with a harem?

**** Can you remember anything more about the plot? What school year did it take place? Post Hogwarts? Was there any time travel or alternate universe shenanigans? Any OCs in the story?

**** He has a story titled Alternate Sleeping Arrangements which has Harry with Ginny and Hermione joining in for a night or so. But I think it was because Ron was in the Hospital wing and not because of a fight.
