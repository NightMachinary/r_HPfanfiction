I am posting because I don't know how one would write a story set in California. When I try to worldbuild I realise that the wizarding culture of California is likely to be very different from the greater United States. The reason is the California Gold Rush. I doubt the gold rush would affect wizards that heavilly. But it would lead to the muggle borns of the area developing a culture distinct from the American one. It would derive from the muggle culture, since the Gold Rush balloons the population so much that any established californio wizarding population could probably be outnumbered, or would be concentrated in the south. This means that the wizarding world of northern california would be distinct. How do I build this? How do I figure out how waves of imigration impact it, which ones would impact wizards, and everything else? Does the cold war affect? What are the politics like? If it grows out of muggle born populations, how does it respond to laws banning the marriage to muggles? Please, I want to write a story of conflict between California and MACUSA, but I don't know how to portray California, with their muggle values.

The only thing I am sure of is greater tolerance to muggle borns in NorCal. But what about Racism? What about the relation between the Californios and the new generation of muggle borns?
