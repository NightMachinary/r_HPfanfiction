Like Hermione,the Weasly Twins (and other D.A members) telling her false ways to lift the curse that Marietta triggered when she told Umbridge.

Mainly looking for stories were the Focus is Marietta apologising to and trying to get forgiveness from the rest of the D.A.

and people like Hermione,the Weasly Twins being vindictive to Marietta.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  She hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister, *Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me.* She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, some­times known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out some­thing to my advantage.

If the story is AU the author could just have Umbridge use a ministry pensieve to veiw the memory even if the Spy couldn't see you could still have Marietta's mother be one of the people to watch the memory and recognize her voice she was already the one helping Umbridge with the floo network when she almost caught Sirius.

Depending on how sympathetic the story wants Marietta to be it could even have have Marietta's mother Sign a relase form giveing Umbridge carte blanche to do what she wants to get Information from Marietta.(and then not have it rescinded after the D.A. was almost caught so Umbridge could take all her anger and sadism at the D.A. out on Marietta with impunity).

I was also thinking of The Weasly Twins (and other D.A members) more actively seeking revenge against Marietta.To the point were She Goes to the D.A. to apologize and get them to stop targeting her.

I wonder if Cho thought Hermione was behinde Kingsley's Memoery charm, after all Permanetly Scaring some and then Taking away the memory of what they did would be a pretty nasty thing to do.

********** I don't sympathize with betrayers. There were muggleborn among the DA whose lives would've been in danger had they been expelled or sent to Azkaban. At best, the rest would've had the future careers compromised and might've had to repeat the year. She deserved the hex, and the memory modification was expedient.

The consequences of her betrayal, had it succeeded in its entire scope, were very great; the retaliation against her was tame in comparison. Not to mention, she also betrayed Cho, /her best friend/.

Why would Umbridge punish Marietta? Her information got Dumbledore out of Hogwarts and made her headmistress. That Harry and the rest got off was because Dumbledore took the blame; it had nothing to do with Marietta. It would've been pointless and counterproductive to punish her.

In canon, the Weasley twins retaliated against Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad, not Marietta.

Hermione's hex should've been preventive rather than just punitive; it should've made it impossible for anyone to betray them, but maybe that was beyond her abilities then.

IMO, I would like a story where she genuinely feels sorry for the betrayal and makes an honest apology to the DA, rather than just one to get them to stop attacking her, and Hermione's hex is automatically lifted because of it.

Really the Type of story I would be happy with is one were Cho goes to Harry and the D.A. to talk about the memory charm thinking it was part of the charms on the D.A. List, Harry and the D.A. are suprised and then start Working with Marietta, Marietta warms up to harry and the D.A. while they are helping her regain her memory and then have Her feel Terrible when she remebers what she did.

Ugh no. In an AU, maybe but this certainly contradicts canon so you'll have to make several changes.

Harry /knows/ that Kingsley modified Marietta's memory (and why) and he's definitely not going to give that information to Marietta (or Cho) after he's already been betrayed by her. It would only lead to Kingsley being fired. The DA certainly /won't/ help Marietta regain her memories because that would get them expelled if Marietta betrays them again. She'll have to feel terrible for what she did /first/ because she /knows/ she betrayed the DA and her friend; only her memories of prior meetings in RoR were modified.

A a story that focuses on theD.A.& Marietta would be something new that the Fandom hasn't dont anything with at all, apart from Bashing Marietta. After all in most Fanfction she seems to end up as one of the Ringleaders of the Girls that bully Luna.

So a stories that Stick insdie Hogawrts and just follows the D.A.& Marietta. with Umbridge and the inquisitorial squad as Background Characters Forcing Marietta to reconcile with the D.A.( because you need some reason for Marietta to go Crawling back to the D.A.)

********** You know whom Marietta directly and knowingly helped with her actions? Voldemort. She was ensuring that Dumbledore was driven out of Hogwarts and that the other students were less able to protect themselves. Not to mention that the entire DA had to know about Umbridge's brand of discipline, which is outright torture by any definition. And yet Marietta, without any need, went to that woman and told her everything.

Traitors and collaborators were usually executed for their actions. There is footage of firing Squads from postwar France on YouTube, and those who were shot there did less to help the Nazis than Marietta did for Voldemort and Umbridge.

The whole purpose of the DA was to prepare its members for the coming fight against Voldemort because Umbridge failed to do so. Their training might have been ineffective against the likes of Bellatrix Lestrange, but would certainly work against the average snatcher.

*** Agreed I was sort of looking at it from a hurt/comfort angle, were hermione and the weasly twins go way to far in their retribution.

So th D.A. Would eventually sort of be split with the weasly twins and hermione on one side that want to keep makeing Marrietta suffer and Cho and eventually Harry on the other who start feeling sorry for Marrieta.

At first I think the whole D.A. Even Cho should be on board with what they are doing to Marrieta and then first Cho and then others start feeling sorry for her.

One thing to remember is that Kingsley obliviated Marrieta in Dumbledore's office so she only remembered the first meeting. So Cho and eventually Harry would find that out About the memory charm and help undo it and by the time the Memory charm was fixed Marrieta would have warmed up to Harry and genuinely feel bad about betraying him and the D.A.

I do think that for embarrassing her Umbridge would have made Marrieta suffer.

So Umbridge probably made Marrieta at the very least Write lines with a blood quil for the embarrassment Marrieta caused her.
