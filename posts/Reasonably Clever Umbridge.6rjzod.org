I wish that Umbridge had been reasonably subtle in trying to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. It seems like if she had taught the test, and very rarely assigned homework, she could have easily been a fairly popular teacher. Subtle things like laughing and brushing off Harry as a little touched would've been so much more effective at changing the student body's opinion.

Sorry, rant over. Are there any fics like this?


** Hmm...how would it change things if Umbridge were less overtly antagonistic?

I mean, she has to torture Harry with the Blood Quill before Hermione is provoked enough to promote the idea of Dumbledore's Army. If she doesn't gloat over nearly catching Sirius, Harry won't learn that her fireplace floo is unmonitored, thus changing the event where he's caught in her office.

But at the same time, since this more subtle Umbridge is less likely to attempt Hagrid's arrest, that means that McGonagall will likely be around when Harry has his fake-vision of Sirius being tortured. That in turn would likely prevent Harry from going to the Department of Mysteries, which means...how would the year end in a climax, then?

With Dumbledore's Army possibly not forming, or Educational Degree #24 not being around, Dumbledore won't be forced out of the school early...perhaps the climax would be when Fudge attempts to have Dumbledore & Harry arrested for treason ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/57ufg7/request_goodnot_as_bad_umbridge/d8ybql4/][see this for my thoughts on his motives]]) following a Quibbler article and public support turning to their views in the face of various mysterious disappearances?

*** I'd imagine no DA, yeah. But this is still Umbridge, she'd still annoy Hermione and Harry plenty without being over the top evil.

I think it's entirely plausible that she manages to give Hagrid, Trelawney, maybe even Binns the sack. Especially Hagrid, he doesn't OWLS and he showed up way after school had started. If you wanted to keep the climax roughly the same, what if he does go to McG? She calls HQ on the floo, gets the run-around from Kreacher, and steps through to check if Sirius is actually there or not. Because Harry's a hothead, he uses the just vacated fireplace to go to the ministry. His friends jump after him to drag him back, but it's too late, he's already gone to the Dept.

I like your idea for an alternate take as well. I think if smart!Umbridge is in charge, the smear campaign would be much more effective than before. With more people openly dismissive, Voldemort gets bolder. I've always thought having order members semi-openly watching the prophesy was dangerous. Perhaps a large percentage of order members 'disappeared', including both Weasley parents dying when the Burrow tragically collapsed.

**** I see where you're both going, but it wouldn't have moved the plot. For example, suppose that Umbridge really /was/ that good at manipulation, right? So let's roll this out a titch.

Umbridge doesn't make that cringey speech in the beginning. She just goes about looking prim and proper, and a little feather-headed, right? First day of class, she announces that there will be no essays, no homework over weekends, and absolutely no interruptions to Quidditch matches.

She says that she's spoken to the other teachers, and gotten a copy of the Quidditch schedule for the year, and has scheduled exams to be at least 2 weeks BEFORE Quidditch, so that even if you're on the team, you have time to enjoy the game without the spectre of an exam looming over you.

All of a sudden, the entire class is freaking THRILLED. Harry talks out of turn, and says, "But we need PRACTICAL demonstrations of defence against the dark arts!" Umbridge says something along the lines of, "Your education in DADA has been spotty at best. I cannot risk accidents in my classroom. I need you all to start from the beginning, and we'll have to move at a slower pace, so that everyone has a chance to catch up. Unless you all WANT more homework, more exams, and more essays?"

It all sounds perfectly reasonable, right? Harry is about to protest, but is shouted down by literally the whole rest of the class. Something along the lines of, "HARRY DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ME."

And then, Umbridge, being magnanimous, says something along the lines of, "Now class. We mustn't be angry at a young man who yearns to stretch beyond the boundaries of his class. I agree, Harry. You will have 12 inches on the use of the protego charm on my desk first thing tomorrow morning. I'll make sure to assign you special assignments through the semester, so that you can get your wish. Now. Anyone else want my special tutoring?"

At that point, Harry can't really argue one way or the other. Umbridge has shut his ass down, and quick. The rest of the year, the other students turn on him and Hermione. Not even Ron will talk to them. "They're both BARMY. Trying to get us extra homework? What is WRONG with them."

From that point onwards, it will become very easy to get the rest of the school thinking that Harry is merely trying to be disruptive. She never outright takes him in to detention, or overtly threatens him, but she does remind him that his spot on the Quidditch team is only as good as his grades are kept up. Continually antagonising teachers is a poor way to ensure a passing grade.

That'll get even his own team mates on her side.

Basically, the rest of the books would take a really dark turn. Umbridge wouldn't be doing big, shouty, angry things against Harry. She'd be doing quiet, needling, persistent chipping away at Harry's character, and casting doubts about his ability to think rationally. She wouldn't have to over reach her authority. She could still get the go-ahead from the Minister to see to it that classes are adequate to the Ministry's standards. She makes it clear that she plans to root out any teacher who is overly harsh on their students, because, "A learning environment lead by fear causes children to be unable to pass their exams. And really, isn't that the point of school?" She broadly implies that she'll curtail Snape's ability to intimidate his students, and assign detentions/take away points willy nilly. She takes one look at Trelawney and has her fired by Dumbledore, because the woman is "clearly not competent to teach the materials on the divination final exam." She has Hagrid removed from the school, because any teacher who hasn't passed the OWLs himself is clearly not suited to teach students.

But she doesn't do it all at once. She starts with the least popular (Snape, Trelawney), and works her way through the rest of the staff. She spaces it out over the course of a few months.

Again, the students are freaking HERE for it, because they no longer have to put up with reams of homework. As long as they can regurgitate what's on the textbook, they're considered passing. You get the students writing glowing letters home about Umbridge, and what a caring, dedicated educator she is.

That's the thing. To let evil win, you don't have to go down the route of big grand gestures. Encourage mediocrity. Encourage stupidity. Laziness. Lack of accountability. Encourage that petty, small-minded, short-sighted thinking, and you've got a populace that doesn't need to be conquered. It's already conquered itself.

***** To add to that, her behaviour would have had to change during the trial itself too. That could change quite a lot as far as her image goes, so she would either have to be absent or she would have to play her cards really well ... which would probably fit her if we got a version that you crafted.

I mean, imagine that she didn't get started on Harry during the trial for how “blah blah, he is evil and deluded” and instead started with how not all the blame lies on Harry, because while all the Dementors are accounted for and him mistaking something else for a Dementor due to stress and fear is his error in decision, it may have very well been due to the inadequate Defence Against Dark Arts education caused by the way too frequent changes of professors, some of whom may not have actually been all that good at it either, so there's no need to punish Harry but the low level of education at Horwarts has to be addressed because students should be taught how to use spells responsibly before they get taught the spells themselves. Not only would that cause Harry's reputation to take a hit too and in a much worse way (since now he's “not taught properly and trigger-happy when afraid” or something like that, meaning any attempt to form DA may very well flop because of that), but it would also render Arabella Figg's help worthless for him (since she couldn't prove that it was a dementor that she saw and by that point people think he mistook something else for one), Dumbledore's attempts to help him would be taken as proof of her words, and people would think that she is actually sensible.

Heck, if she were to do that, her assigning essays on the responsible uses of spells to Harry to keep him busy would feel totally justified to other students even if he miraculously did not interrupt her during class.

****** You have added so many more layers to her character, which is freaking amazing. Think about it: she not only has the entire ministry eating out of her hand, but now is putting Dumbledore's competency into question as well. AND it justifies her being assigned as the new DADA teacher. AND it would mean that she'd be there to inspect other classes much sooner than the Minister having to give her the go-ahead. In fact, any death eaters in the ministry would start a whisper campaign that the education standards must be maintained, and that Umbridge seems to be the only one invested enough in OUR CHILDREN to go through and see to it that it happens. It would get the rest of the wizarding world really really pissed off, and ready to jump at any chance to see to it that Umbridge's decrees go forward.

Again, she wouldn't even have to ban the DA. It would effectively ban itself. There would be plenty of opposition to Harry right from the start. AND? She wouldn't have to imply that his piss poor education was at fault either. It was the stress of having to go through 4th year, and seeing Cedric die. It would be so easy to just conveniently drop certain facts into place, and let the chips fall where they may.

Only /most/ of the students. Those who value their education would probably side with Harry, That probably wouldn't happen on its own, but with Hermione to nudge them a bit, they would quickly see that their future is being sacrificed.

Then Harry, Hermione, and all those students transfer to Beaubatons or elsewhere. Hogwarts loses its top students all at once.

It would be an interesting fic.

****** That's one way it could go. It could also go another direction. I know that when I was in school, and not in accelerated classes, I had obscene amounts of free time after finishing my school work. This meant that I had large quantities of time with which to read books that interested me. By the time I was placed into the accelerated classes, I was on the same level as everyone else, and didn't have to worry about catching up.

Here's the thing: the smartest people (not the ones who get the best grades; that's a different story) in your school will keep their heads down, and do their best on assignments, participate in class, and earn their A. But once the actual work for school is done? They start to pursue the subject even further. They're not the ones who are satisfied to stop at the basic level they're presented with in class.

Any textbook will only give you a smattering of information about the subject. Although it's always adequate to pass the subject (even with flying colours), it's never enough for those who are seriously intelligent. The ones who actually value their education have been quietly plundering the library all along, because they're /interested/ in it.

Just because I was in AP Biology didn't mean that I stopped voraciously consuming science media when the bell rang. I'd still be going home, watching documentaries, reading news articles, and looking up further information in the library.

And here's the thing: those students are generally left alone to their own devices. They're going to be intelligent, and pursue learning regardless of what the people in charge are doing to challenge them. It's an inner drive.

THAT is why this version of Umbridge is so dangerous. The vast majority of students will not strive to learn more if they're not motivated to do so in some way. Competition with other students for grades is not sufficient. It's why teachers wield so much power: they can push the entire class forward. The top of the class will continue to learn regardless of what the teacher says. They're not the ones you want to bother controlling. It's the average student that you need to worry about.

So, if you tell a student who usually pulls a C average that he can get an A by coasting through, he's going to be much more compliant than those who push him forward. My mom had a friend who was a history teacher. Every class, he'd show a film of some kind, instead of lecturing. At the end of the film, he'd throw out like a 5 question multiple choice quiz. If you were BARELY paying attention to the film, you'd get an B+. He passed the vast majority of his class with a high B. The top of his class always got their A grade. The midterm exam was the same questions from the quiz. That you already had the answers to. The final was only the 2nd half of the semester, with the same format. That fucker was voted teacher of the year twice.

****** Like, how easy would it be for Umbridge to see to it that Filch loses his job? "We don't need a squib around our children. The man is deranged. Besides. He's not doing an essential job. That's why we have house elves!" Or getting rid of Peeves. "That poltergeist is a menace to all decent and good people. He needs to be removed." I can't think of any student who'd be angry that Filch has been sacked. It wouldn't be long before some of the children start to see her as their own champion. The only adult who makes sense in this mad world.

I feel like Tom Riddle made his biggest mistake by siding with the populace that had money, but not numbers. An intelligent Tom Riddle would have styled himself champion of the poor, and told them all kind of things like, "You'll never have to go hungry if I'm in charge." Then, out of the other side of his mouth, tell the purebloods, "The only way to control these idiot, unwashed masses is through me. I will make sure that they have bread, they have entertainment, and that they have shelter. Once that's all sorted, we'll keep them in constant struggles amongst their petty little factions." He'd pit the pureblood poor against the muggle born poor. "You may be poor, but at least you have your dignity." He'd put the muggle born against the squibs. "Those filthy squibs have the nerve to be allowed to live amongst decent magical folk, while you have to struggle out there with the mundanes. This is not right!"

He'd never have to be Minister for Magic, or Headmaster of Hogwarts. He'd have plenty of petty, small-minded idiots who will do his bidding in all corners of government, and none of them know that he's behind all of it.

******* The issue with this is that given they had a muggleborn minister just before the rise of Voldemort one could potentially extrapolate that muggleborns were doing pretty well for themselves. There isn't that same body of resentment to harness. Compare that to a few rich people whose power is slowly being eradicated and have the resources to make small problems go away. The muggleborn minister suggests that they were on the up, that they were winning the power struggle, they'd have no need to go down the violent route and the violent route is a must for Voldemort. He want not just to be on top but unopposed. If he just wanted to be immortal he'd have gone into hiding with his horcruxes, if he just wanted power I'm sure he could have replaced the Minister, either with polyjuice, an imperius or other means. We have to assume that Voldemort wanted to kill, main and torture and that requires people who are willing to do it. Unless for some reason all rich powerful purebloods just happen to be insane they have to feel threatened enough to put aside their morality.
