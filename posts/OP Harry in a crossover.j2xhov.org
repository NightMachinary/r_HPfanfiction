Looking for crossover fics with Harry being overpowered compared to most of the people in the crossover verse. No slash please.


** - *Potter's Protector* - linkffn(7665632) Hp/Buffy crossover. HP World. Intro to this series.
- *M-Day* - linkffn(8804823) Marvel/HP Crossover. Second fic.
- *Death's Little Brother* - linkffn(9628789) Smallvill&DC/HP crossover. DC World. Crossover Third fic.
- *Full Circle* - linkffn(12022968) Buffy/HP crossover. Buffyverse. Finale of the series. They go to the Buffyverse.

​

Hokay, due to the whole "Master of Death" title, Harry ends up becoming an aspect of existence. After HP, he ends up going to different universes to do stuff. Sure, he's super powerful and can destroy the world with a snap, but Harry is more of a "guide them to the solution" type of guy.

*** Can you explain how Xander is useful in the potterverse. it's been an age since I've seen Buffy and I remember him being a baseline human with a penchant for one liners and I'm not sure how that would help Harry.

**** Can't really speak for that particular fic, but Xander in fics tends to be a combination of hypercompetent and hyperlucky. So much like Punisher is just a baseline human but handles himself just fine in a world of supers, so does Xander.

** Darkness in the Void - Star Trek TNG/VOY crossover. This is labelled as slash, but they don't even do so much as kiss iirc. If you can handle like, blushing and a little bit of flirtatious innuendo then you'll be fine with it. It has a warning at the start stating that explicit scenes will be marked so you can skip them... but I'm almost positive there aren't actually any of those scenes LOL. The story reads more like a friendship than a romance.

Harry Potter and the Spirit of Revenge - DC Comics crossover. In-progress, possibly abandoned even with the somewhat recent update.

Harry Potter and the Elder Sect - Bewitched crossover. Remember the 60s sitcom with the witch that wiggles her nose? That's Bewitched. This is crack, and at times laugh out loud funny. No pairings.

The Wizard of Harrenhal - Game of Thrones/ASoIaF. One of the better offerings with this crossover, and as a bonus its complete (unlike most GOT crossovers).

Gods Among Us - Battlestar Galactica (and I have no idea which one it is). Harry and Hermione, but not Harmony (I think?). I haven't seen BST before and wasn't hopelessly lost, so there's that. Very infrequent updates, but they keep appearing every month or three anyway.

Of Wizards and Heroes - One of the best MCU crossovers, period, with some great action sequences. Slash, sort of. It's kind of implied? And comes out of nowhere? If you can handle one or two chapters at the very end with an implied slash relationship and pretty much nothing on-screen, then read away. Otherwise, sorry :( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136][LINK]]

Deus Ex Machina - Part of a little oneshot series with the MCU, but the Infinity War thing is using the motivations from the comics instead of the movies. This is crack, pure and unadultered. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3198950/chapters/6956252][LINK]]

(The last two have links included as AO3 is currently down for maintenance and I have no idea how the bot will react to that.)

That being said, I'll respectfully disagree about your opinion of Harry: I personally think the Cho thing was an anomaly and that he really wouldn't have given a toss about her without the Cedric thing. He wasn't really all that interested in /anyone/ tbh. aka, some flavour of Demisexual.

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD crossover - You don't need to know what the anime is to enjoy it. Story is filled with great wholesome moments, fun action, and Harry just being a badass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe]] - linkffn(13326497) - Avenger Crossover - Another really well done story were Harry is OP. Also filled with wholesome moments and fun action scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8333963/1/Emerald-Flight-Book-One-Union][Emerald Flight Book One: Union]] - linkffn(8333963) - Justice League Crossover - This was a pretty interesting story. Has some nice sweet moments. But I can only honestly recommend this story out of the trilogy. Its sequels are kinda repetitive and the charm it had missing imo. But the first one was worth the read.
