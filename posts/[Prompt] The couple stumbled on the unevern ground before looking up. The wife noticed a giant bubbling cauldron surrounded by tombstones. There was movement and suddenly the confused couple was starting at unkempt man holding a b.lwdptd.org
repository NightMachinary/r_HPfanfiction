** Harry looked around at the fancy courtyard they landed in, confusion clearly written on his face, “...Cedric, do you think this is a part of the task?”

“I have no idea, Harry, I thought they said we'd be portkeyed back to the entrance of the maze,” replied Cedric, looking equally as unsure of the situation. “Maybe we're just---“

Suddenly, a chipper female voice broke in, “Welcome to Moonfang Lodge! The number one rated couple's lodge in Sensu Alley! What is---“

“The WHAT”

** The couple was confused for a moment, before one of them realized who they were looking at.

She was an Auror who had gotten permission for them to take a little time off, but of course they could never get a uninterrupted vacation. Last year she had been called in to help with the search for Sirius Black, during which she studied anything that could help predict his movements.

And now, standing in front of her and her boyfriend, was Peter Pettigrew, someone who was supposed to be dead. Well that explains why Black's actions made no sense, but now the question was why and how was Pettigrew Alive.

"Kill Th-" was all either of them heard before she lashed out and stunned both Pettigrew and the baby like thing. Marcus, her bf, then scanned the area for any other surprises.

It was an hour later that they had a team of both Auror's, and Hit wizards/witches on site, Pettigrew in custody, and they baby thing being confirmed as He-who-must-not-be-named.

Auror Joanne and Duelist tutor Marcus were praised as heroes for their quick thinking and finding out the truth of what happened to The Potters. Harry was just glad that nothing too bad happened to him this year.

And Voldemort's plan was ruined as there was no way for him to hide that he survived this whole time, seeing as his main body was now in custody of the ministry of magic.
