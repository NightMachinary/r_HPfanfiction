The stories I'm looking for are those where harry somehow ends up (I don't really care how) in crossover world and have him be very powerful in relation to the other characters of said world. Him ending up in a parallel Harry Potter world is ok as long as it is very AU.


** linkffn(8177168; 8501689; 11157943; 10912355; 11120132) Is a decent starter package but all quite well known and often recommended. Its missing a few great crossovers but these ones all feature a powerful Harry.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

** That's generally the case with every HP character in the Land of Ice and Fire. Those filthy Muggles didn't have any chance against Anti-Muggle Wards, Apparation, Disillusionment, Duplication Charm, False Memory, Fiendfyre, Imperius Curse, Legilimency, and Obliviation. Even Vincent Crabbe could carve out his little kingdom as in the unfortunately abandoned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11394554/1/Vincent-Crabbe-Saves-Westeros][Vincent Crabbe Saves Westeros]], linkffn(11394554)

For truly powerful characters such as Harry, Ginny, and Sirius, they would rule an empire easily as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/The-Wizard-of-Harrenhal][The Wizard of Harrenhal]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(11255223;12195136).

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] has created several parallel universes with multiple versions of some characters (Hermione, Alex Mack, Jack O'Neill, Daniel Jackson, Buffy Summers, Willow Rosenberg, Selina Kyle). [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], often recommended here and by me, plays out in the "Terawattverse". The Trio in this Universe, although lacking magical powers, are significantly more proactive and ruthless than their counterparts in HPverse. They have yet to meet in person, although they are aware of each other's existence.
