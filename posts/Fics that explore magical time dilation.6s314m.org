** This gives me the idea that Hermione would get this idea from her time with a turner. After so many times using it she notices a few milliseconds where time around her slows down before turning backward.

She spells the turning hand so that instead of turning back just enough resistance is applied to slow it's forward advance to 50% and notices that she's now moving twice as fast as the world around her.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Semi-sequel to "In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter." Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story.

** linkffn(30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab) prominently features a summer school of magic in Japan, of all places, with rather extreme time dilation.

In linkffn(Silly Ruler Waving by Horace Nihil), the larger the pocket dimension space that the room of requirement provides, the larger the time dilation effect.

  Hermione Granger is fifteen, sixteen in a few weeks. She has this summer job in the local library she loves, but something is amiss. Why does she spend so much time waving things, like this ruler, in such a silly way ?

** Harry learns to dilate time through occlumency in linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin). It's nowhere near the focus of the story but he uses it to help him fight and think more efficiently in stressful situations.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
