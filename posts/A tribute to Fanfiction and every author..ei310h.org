I'm writing this because it's the end of the decade and I wanted to thank all of you. I started reading fanfics when I was a horny 14 year old boy accidentally stumbling across smut. That was 3.5 years ago and now I'm pretty much addicted to fanfiction. Fanfiction got me into anime as well, simply because I wanted to read more stories. The biggest reason why I started watching Naruto and other shows was so I could read these huge 300k long stories. After I ran out of Naruto fanfiction I started reading Percy Jackson stories and so on, until I had read stories from every fandom I knew of. Then around a year ago I read my first Harry Potter crossover which got me hooked on normal Harry Potter fanfiction. I read around five hours of fanfiction a day and due to my picky "taste" I've pretty much read every fic worth reading. I even gave Ao3 a shot after not finding anything good to read on ffnet but I'm very disappointed with Ao3 and only found a handful of fics I liked.

Again, I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess this is a sort of tribute to the authors that wrote amazing stories which have helped me a lot with escaping to a different world. I don't even know where to post this or if any of you will even read this... However I still wanted to thank all of you for this great experience. Sadly, I feel like the 20s won't be a good time for Fanfiction and I think that I won't find anything good to read anymore, however 2020 could prove me wrong as well.


** I think as long as you keep looking there will always be good fics out there. As an author and a an avid reader I appreciate this! It's hard to be starting out as a writer now days without any way to "advertise." Keep reading and commenting and trust me, we will keep writing.

**** Have you delved into the My Hero Academia fandom? The fanfic community is really growing (especially on ao3) and there are many fantastic ones! Also, I've really gotten into the newer avenger fics that heavily include spiderman. There are some really wholesome ones out there, and also some amazing ones that offer and alternate to Endgame and center around Spidey. Dunno if either of those would be your cup of tea, but thought I'd mention it in case you wanted to find something new.

Trust me, I've been reading about 5 hours of fanfic almost everyday too for the past 10 years, i know the pain of feeling like you have exhausted every good fic in a fandom and the extreme joy of finally finding another super good one. What are some of your favorite hp and naruto ones? Those were my OGs as well :]

***** Yeah, I've already exhausted the My Hero Academia fandom on ffnet and I'm getting tired of reading similar stories every time. After reading most, all of them aren't that different at all. I tried looking for My Hero Academia stories on Ao3 but most were slash or just focused on pairings which I'm not too interested in. As for my favourites... That's a really difficult question, sorry. I've recommended A Bet of a Lifetime [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12567696]] (Naruto) in this thread before because it's my favourite one currently updating.

** I'm the opposite - I can't find fics on FFnet worth reading. I'm Ao3 only these days.

Edit: Copying/pasting a comment I left somewhere else a few days ago. This is how I find fics worth reading on Ao3. It rarely fails to net me something good.

Go to the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search][Search -> Works]]" link.

Scroll down to the "Work Tags" section. Type in some things you're interested in by character (under "character"), pairing under "relationships", or plot element such as "Slytherin Harry Potter" (under "additional tags"). Existing tags will prompt you to autofill, so when you start typing click on the one that pops up that is relevant to your interests.

Now that you have your tag(s) selected, you can start sorting things out. If you want only completed fics or no crossovers (or ONLY crossovers), scroll back up to "Work Info" and select the relevant filters. You can also use this section to find one shots or longgggg fics (under "word count" - typing in <5000 will net you short fics, >100000 will net you long fics).

At the bottom of the search page, under "Search," here are my pro-tips for finding good reads:

For fics that people enjoyed, change the "sort by" to *kudos*. This tends to get me a good mix of good one-shots and plotty things. Sometimes it'll return the hilarious joke fics as the top result, but there will still like be some good reads.

For fics that people tend to re-read or recommend to others, change the "sort by" to *bookmarks*. This tends to return more longfics than one-shots.

If you're there for smutty shit, change the "sort by" to *hits*. Scroll back up to "Work Info" and check the "single chapter" box. This will return porny one-shots that people return to again and again for /reasons/.

You can also use these same methods in filtering tags. Click on a character tag, relationship tag, or additional tag (one that's fandom specific tends to work best), then click on "filter works" if it doesn't automatically take you to a page full of fic. This page is most useful for filtering OUT things you don't want to read (for example, if you want to read "Slytherin Harry Potter" but not "Dark Harry" fics, go to the Slytherin Harry Potter tag and go to "exclude" on the filters). Filtering tags is one of my FAVORITE Ao3 features.

**** My favorite is actually gen, followed by slash/femslash. (I'm bi, so I'm fond of it. Sue me.) Then het. I'm mainly there for good writing above all else. If it's written well and has a tight plot, I'll probably read it. (Although I tend to avoid fics that are purely focused on romance. I like romance on the side, not as the focus.)

If there's a grammar or spelling error in the summary, I won't even click. That's honestly my main issue with FFnet - it's a LOT of crap to wade through, whereas it's easier to filter out the crap on Ao3.

***** Not OP but I read a lot of SW as well - I primarily find fics these days through the tags and filtering architecture that vichan described. The tags I start in are usually either fandom tags (e.g. SW Sequel Trilogy/Original Trilogy/Prequel Trilogy), or a pairing tag. Then I sort by kudos or comments, set to complete works usually, and optionally add a ratings filter. I use exclusions pretty liberally, usually pairings I'm not interested in seeing. Another good way, once you find an author you like, is to look at their other works or their bookmarks.

It might help to post what sort of stuff you're interested in so that people can get you started with recs! I can help if you're interested in Sequel or Prequel stuff, mostly, since that's what I've bookmarked.

******* Also not OP, but in the star wars fandom I'd recommend Fialleril's "Double Agent Verse" (ongoing series, ot au) and esama's "Lost Reflections" (pt slice of life, dead in the water but what is there is good) to just about anyone. For the Kotor fans I'd add "Face of a Sith Lord" (oneshot), "Enemies and Allies" (oneshot), and " Apathetic Revan gets a surprising amount done" (completed series).

******* Agree with [[/u/MelonyBerolVisconti/][u/MelonyBerolVisconti/]], DAV is an exceptional series and Fialleril is an excellent author; their other stories, like the unfinished Heretic Pride and The One Where Anakin and Padme are Pen Pals, are lovely as well. Really good at worldbuilding! [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Fialleril/pseuds/Fialleril/works][Works here.]]

Prequel/OT stories:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6252790/chapters/14326897][Fundamental Force Carriers]]: ~90k and first in a small series. Anakin/Vader, at the moment of his death, is sent back in time. Things go differently. I think this has some stuff from Clone Wars but I'm not certain because I haven't seen it.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12465699][you're not the only one]]: Oneshot. "She is a gift to Lord Vader from the Emperor. Her name is Padme Skywalker." Another exceptional author with lots of great SW works.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/930435][Skywalker Swap]]: 2-part series, the first one is an incredible graphic novel telling ANH if it was Leia Skywalker and Luke Organa.

Sequel stories:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5648131][Tomorrow (there'll be more of us)]]: Oneshot, one of the first (if not the first) Stormtrooper Revolution stories.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5798602/chapters/13364887][have you heard]]: ~40k. One of the many stories inspired by the above, a really multifaceted, nuanced take on a Stormtrooper Revolution.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8468581][Rey's Feast]]: Oneshot, one of my favourite stories about Rey told through exploring food.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6743011][We'll All Float On Okay]]: Oneshot, Leia and Rey bonding.

Conservative estimate - I've read over 10 million words of Hp fanfiction. I'm still discovering works that I adore. I love this fandom - Its such a rich world that authors can take it in hundreds of different ways.

I love this sub, and thank you so much for everyone who contributes to discussions, thoughts, writing, and debating this fandom.

Hope you all have a fantastic 2020.

i don't read quite as much HP fanfics as i used to (at least, ones not by authors who i'm already familiar with), but i still read.

** I read my first fanfiction in 1997 at age 14. Now I'm a crazy old cat lady pushing full steam ahead to 40 and I'm still just as obsessed with this stuff. Lucky for me my hubby doesn't care what I get up to in the wee hours of the night lol. That's 23 years experience I've been reading fanfiction.... and I signed up to Reddit today just to tell you this: I know right now it feels like you've read all there is to read and there will never be anything else worth reading. I cannot tell you how many times I've thought this myself. The truth is that great fanfiction comes and goes in cycles. Some months there are SO many good stories to read, and other months the flow of great stories is dry as a desert. If I had a dollar for every time I told myself "Well that's it. There will never be any more great stories." But then, months down the road, something wonderful would happen. Maybe I would discover a great new show and discover new stories written for that fandom. Or maybe a new fanfic writer would appear on the scene and come up with something wonderful. It never fails. My trick is this: When I feel like the pool of good fanfic is drying up I'll step away from the computer for a while and focus on other things. I'll watch more TV or spend more time harassing (er, I mean loving) my hubby, or I'll switch to reading actual novels for a while. I'll let time go by. Months, usually. Then I'll head on back to AO3 or [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and find all the awesome new stuff I missed. I could go on and on about the marvels of fanfiction but I won't. Just trust me. The best is yet to come. Happy New Year, ya'll.

** I can definitely relate, the only recommendation I can give if your looking for some new fanfiction is giving "worm" a try. I read the HP crossover done by Darth Marrs (which wasn't half bad) and got sucked into the fandom. Which you can mostly find on spacebattles or sufficientvelocity.

Ps. Have you read the (completed) stories by jbern? They are the oldest ones I regularly go back to and are still my favorites. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern]]

*** Thanks for the recommendations, I'll check them out. I haven't read the stories by jbern yet and I've always wanted to, I guess I just forgot. Cheers!
