I find it incredibly hard to continue reading a fanfic that has Hermione's parents be named Dan and Emma, for multiple reasons but the main ones are the fact that I keep picturing Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson as her parents and also because most stories that use those names tend to he unimaginative Hermione wank fests.


** It's just two normal names. I've read well written stories using those names that weren't even Harmony. I think it started out as an inside joke but then everyone started using it.

Another common name pair is Helen and Richard. Sometimes her dad is named John.

The real travesty is that Hermione is one of the main characters and we don't know her parents' names. And I don't want to find out what their names are from a tweet or Pottermore.

*** This is true. I think my main issue with Dan and Emma though is just how oversaturated they are in bad indy Harry fics. You have a high chance of reading an indy harry fic where Hermione is the intended love interest with her parents being named dan and emma. I kinda want to write a fic where her parents are Daniel "Dan" Fenton and Samantha Emma Fenton just for memes

** I'm not really opposed to the names, but the fact that they are used in so many shitty Harmony fics is definitely a major point against them. I still haven't decided if I'm going to use those names in one of my fics, because while I think the names are a fun allusion, I don't want to risk offputting too many readers by association.

** I'm with you OP. The first time I saw Dan and Emma used the only thing that stuck out was that it felt oddly specific. Later I picked up on its use in other fics and figured out why, and then I realized what has bugged me ever since...

In every case (that /I/ read) their names were forced in unnaturally, like a square peg in a round hole. If i ever run into it, it never fails to kick me out of the story for a second or two.

.

"You found Trevor! How can I ever thank you? I'm Hermione, what's your name?"

"Harry."

"My parents would love to meet you, Harry. I'm sure you'd be welcome to stay at our home if you ever needed to. Their names are Dan and Emma. They always belonged together. They fell in love in the first time they ever met. Do you believe in love at first sight, Harry?" she asked looking deeply into his blue eyes.

***** It's not a hard requirement, but that just ticks fanservice for me, because I love literature and historical references.

What I can't read is former SAS member Daniel Granger, who threatens Harry, but gets cowed by his wife Emma Granger when their barely pubescent daughter does the nasty with Harry.

Another fic idea, her parents are exactly like that, but it's canon Hermione.

To me it would be like being turned off fanfiction with Harry named Harry because of the sheer number of bad fics in which, unsurprisingly, Harry's name is Harry XD

** This really doesn't make sense to me: yes, there are plenty of Harmony trashy stories (actually, it is hard to find non-trashy Harmony story, because whole concept of Harmony seems to be flawed), but what does it have to do with names? I don't care whether they are Dan & Emma or Helen & Richard (or whether fem!Harry is Harriet), I do care about the story. In linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) they are Dan & Emma (and it is NOT a Harmony story, because ewww ...), but what matters to me is that the story is good (even though [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][not perfect]]), the same goes for linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), yes it has some severe flaws but overall it is a good story with a good plot, and I don't care that it has Harriet even in its title. And I care even less that in linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) they are Helen & John and even though the Harmony element is the weakest part of the whole story, it is rather good read overall.

So I asked my readers... and they said that a lot of fics use Dan and Emma... and it never occurred to me that it was Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson... and I went along my merry way, blissfully ignorant until another reader commented on it much later on. Yeah. I know. I'm that daft. I was tempted to go back and change it because, well, it felt cringy, but I was already that far in... so I left it. Now I'm wondering if it turns people off that much should I change it? It's not a Harmony; no shipping at all, actually. And people seem to like it.
