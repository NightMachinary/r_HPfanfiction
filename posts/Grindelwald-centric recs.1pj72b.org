I've got an idea for a fic I want to write, but before I can really get started, I want to explore Grindelwald's character to a point where I can write him. Can anyone recommend well-characterized Grindelwald fics for inspiration? Gelbus Grindeldore is acceptable, but not necessary. If the fic gets into the workings of wizarding society, all the better! I love political fics.

This is the fanfiction that got me interested in fanfictions and inspired me to write my own. It is so amazingly well written that I just consider it part of the harry potter series at this point. I really really reccomend it.

*** Awesome! I will check it out! There is no higher recommendation than to say that it's part of your head-canon.

**** Definetly should. Honestly the second and third in the trilogy arent as great, but theyre still good, youll want to read them after reading that link. The third gets a bit unrealistic but still a worthwhile read. The first is still like a fanfiction masterpiece though.

** Not quite a Grindelwald centric fic, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7210431/1/][Living Life in Reverse]] is a Harry goes back and adopts Tom story. Grindelwald is the main antagonist. I've finished this story, but not yet started the sequel (which is complete). It might help you out.
