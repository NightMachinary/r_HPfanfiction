:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What's that fic where Audrey is a Muggle and she and Percy meet and begin dating during his estrangement from his family? Percy isn't as estranged from his family as he is in canon, and at one point in the story Fred and George arrive just after Percy and Audrey get engaged to warn them that Death Eaters are coming. Later on, Molly isn't willing to accept that Percy has married a Muggle.


** I believe it's that one fic where Harry and Hermione run away from a marriage law. Essentially Hermione would've been married to Draco, then Snape, but they were dating.

** linkffn(11916243;12373273) ... I like the sequel better, because it essentially gave up on the Harry/Hermione relationship in the former, and yes, that was the weakest part of that story.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  Percy met Audrey during a trying summer for Percy. Their relationship developed and eventually, they married and had children. This is a look at their story set over the course of events of the war and afterwards.

*** Thanks! Somehow I had completely forgotten about the marriage law aspect.
