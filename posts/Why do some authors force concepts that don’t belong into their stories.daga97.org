Is it just me or are more and more fanfics becoming inconsistent. I read one the other day where it was set in a very traditional Harry Potter world (marriage contracts etc). Not one character seemed to have an issue with this but the author obviously wanted a progressive Hermione, so they have Hermione (who somehow is best friends with the pure blood and traditional Daphne Greengrass) tell Daphne about how she must remember she is her own women and to never let a man have his way, to which Daphne AGREED. It was just so flawed and illogical. That was the last time I read that fic. Now onto my question, while I agree with the basic tenants of feminism why do some authors feel it necessary to force it, and other concepts that don't fit the setting into their stories when their characters have no logical reason to even be thinking about it in the world they live in.


** I know exactly what you mean and totally agree that authors force Hermione & pureblood friendships far to much. Be it with Daphne Greengrass or a muggle hating Harry who inexplicably makes an exception for her.

But I don't understand your point about feminism or strong female characters not belonging in fics that have a heavily patriarchal and traditional society. If Daphne is, for example, the heir to the Greengrass family because there are no male heirs and then gets forced into a marriage contract, why shouldn't she be angry and believe that Men and Women should be treated as equals? It's a totally legitimate view point for her and other pure-blood girls.

**** Hermione is, in my opinion, a bad catalyst. She is unpopular (in AU fics with traditional pureblood culture especially), comes from the outside and has no power.

I agree with you here. Teenager superheroes are pushing hard on my suspension of disbelief. But this topic still touches a fundamental double standard of this fandom:

It's totally ok to powerwank Harry, who can defeat Voldemort in a straight fight at age 15, who navigates effortlessly the Wizengamot at age 14, and who already has a harem by age 13. But if Hermione gets a little skill boost, she's a bloody MARY SUE!!!

My issue with Hermione in fanfiction really depends on the fic. If it's framed as a What-if, you can't just drive up her competency immediately. If it's a badass Hermione fic, give her some flaws. Canon Hermione is awkward. She's excessively stubborn. She's occasionally a hypocrite. She's a bit insecure and performs horribly under pressure.

************** I never said a fic is bad if it has X character. I just said Hermione is inherently an unlikable protagonist. Nothing in fanfiction remotely touches the original 7 books. OOC Harry can still be likable. A 11 year old Harry who is in awe of magic and likes to play around with it is OOC, but you'd have to be a monster to hate the character. But I digress.

Harry in the books honestly does not describe anything but her intelligence and loyalty favorably more than sporadically.

Now you can change the character all you want. Have your own AU. Bump up her skill levels and social status. Make her more attractive. But all in all, a teen Hermione solving all the series problems is just as bad to read as Indy! Harry. Worse is that she doesn't get the plot armor Voldemort gives Harry by refusing to have his underlings kill him or his mother's protection, or brother wand cores.

Her character comes from a somewhat privileged background. 2 dentist parents, vacations, etc. Loving, encouraging parents.

Now contrast that with abused, orphan Harry.

You know what I keep looking for in fics, but can never find? Hermione gaining social skills.

See, that's your /opinion/. And it's as valid - or invalid - as claiming that X character is an inherently unlikable or likeable protagonist since that's entirely subjective. It's about as valid a statement as claiming vanilla ice cream is the best or worst ice cream ever because different people like different things.

I'm sick and tired of abused orphan Harry. Can't stand the tropes any more. That doesn't mean that stories featuring that trope are inherently bad. I can make up some pretentious drivel about how bad the trope is, but it wouldn't change the fact that it's still just my personal taste.

In the end, it's all the same - arguing how someone's taste in ice cream is the only valid one. And no matter how many people agree with them, it doesn't change the fact that it's a stupid claim.

Change what you want, but only one character fits the bill as the main protagonist with canon personalities. It isn't Ron. It isn't Dumbledore. It isn't Snape. It isn't Hermione. It's Harry.

Ok. Fanfiction says you can do that. I'm not here to judge your taste in fanfiction. I'm here to look at the characters.

But I digress, my original point on this thread is if you think it's unrealistic and bad writing for Harry to take the fight to the death eaters, it's even more ridiculous for Hermione to do so, as she doesn't even have the plot protection of Voldemort wanting her for himself to kill.

Not that both are good stories to begin with...

*** The main problem with feminism is that it negatively affects birth rate (sad, but true). Therefore if in the Magical Britain women and men are equal for centuries, there would be a lot more non-native people, because in such cases immigrants are the main source of growing population (look at the modern Europe as an example).

Also there were a lot of powerful women in the human history, but it didn't change position of a woman in a society for a long time.

The same may be true for the Magical Britain: if it's historically patriarchal from pre-SoS times, I don't any reason why men would give up power after it was established.

  The main problem with feminism is that it negatively affects birth rate (sad, but true).
#+end_quote

First, picking apart this idea that feminism is responsible for declining birth rates. There are a lot of reasons why birth rates decline - education, the introduction of birth control, personal choice, shifting societal norms and ideas, families realising that less children = more money to go around. Feminism, if it plays a role at all in declining birth rates, has a negligible impact.

Then there's your later comment:

#+begin_quote
  Because more women start choosing career over having 3+ children (and 3 is minimum for the population growth). More women do this choice, more birth "burden" is put on others.

  Unfortunately it is just a human biology.
#+end_quote

I'm not really sure what you mean by 'it is just a human biology' here, but judging from this comment and your assertion that feminism causing declining birth rates is 'sad but true', you seem to be working under the assumption that more population growth is actually a good thing. We currently have 7 billion people alive today. That's more people than ever that are populating this planet, and its impacts are showing. Climate change, water pollution, air pollution, war after war. The human race has so fundamentally changed the planet that we're now in a new geological age because yes, we have literally etched our existence into the earth. In the long-term, we don't want increasing birth rates - we're having a population crisis, frankly. If our birth rates don't decline, we will outpace the amount of resources our planet can generate for us, if we haven't already.

So tl;dr, feminism does not cause declining birth rates. Declining birth rates is a good thing.

Not really. If you ask families today what their ideal number of kids is, the average seems to hover around 2 in developed countries. Part of this, perhaps, has to do with women increasing their participation in the workforce - it's logical, women work more, they delay having children, etc. So there's your feminism influencing declining birth rates argument there. But how much does it really impact? Why are 2 kids the ideal nowadays? That doesn't really have anything to do with feminism, so much as personal choice and shifting ideas of what is considered the 'perfect family'. It's also to do with the cost of raising a family. Because raising children is /expensive./ You have to send them to school, then college, feed them, buy them fancy gifts, etc. People also aren't as pushed to have children. This is society changing and also the cost of living rising. Economics and cultural shifts at work.

#+begin_quote

Do you mean developed or developing countries here?

Regardless, having a high birth rate does not always help. The countries with the highest birth rate, in fact, are often poor sub-Saharan African countries. If a high birth rate was all that was required for economic growth, we'd all have become rich in a thousand years ago. Instead, we only really started being lifted out of the same closed-loop of poverty generation after generation in the 1700s-1800s, i.e., around the time of the Industrial Revolution.

Here is the contradiction. Ecology matters for the latter. Poor countries don't care about it, therefore low birth rate in countries where ecology matters won't help it in general.

Also right now Europe depends on immigrants as source of new people, neck use their native populations don't reproduce themselves.
