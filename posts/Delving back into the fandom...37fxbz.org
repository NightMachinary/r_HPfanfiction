Okay, so I'm delving back into the fandom, and this time I've decided to cut out the middle man and ask for some recs (rather than trawling through the rough trying to find a few gems.. you know how it is.)

Anyway, I'd love it if you guys could rec some:

- Harry / Draco friendship (I don't mind romance if it's reaaally well written - I've never really explored this pairing, so feel free to try and convert me!)
- Adventure / training to kick Voldy's arse fics!
- Snape as mentor fics
- Snape / Hermione fics (don'tjudgeme)
- Anything that you think is just really awesome that I should read!

Thanks in advance gang! :)

** Broken Mind Fractured Soul (sensiblytainted) has Mentor Snape, fighting Voldemort, and Draco/Harry friendship that develops further. It's a series that's technically complete, but the author is recently working on a next gen sequel.

When A Lioness Fights (kayly silverstorm) is Snape/Hermione. Spy fic, I rather enjoyed it, but Hermione is rather out of character until the full reasoning behind it gets explained in the story.

Not Myself (terion) has mentor/father Snape, it's a pretty decent and long AU that I enjoyed, well developed original characters, and there's friendship with Draco eventually. Complete series, sequels significantly shorter than original story.

The Last Spy (sylphides) is another Snape/Hermione spy type fic. I seem to really enjoy those Lol. Builds on a lot of characters we don't see much in canon, uses the Order in an interesting way, good original characters, and interesting uses of magic.

All if these are on fanfiction.net and things I've read or reread in the last few weeks.

Edit: heavy on possible triggers in the first one, featuring various forms of abuse of varying degrees of horrible, that get dealt with.

** Putting don't judge me was good cause most of these people are extremely judgemental of any pairing they don't like and the cite unrealism (not a word but whatever) but almost every fanfiction is completely different from Canon for fun. You'll still probably get judged though

*** So far nobody has posted any judgment, so I think they're fine. We've all got our guilty pleasures, and while I may dislike Snape as a character, Snape/Hermione is one of mine depending on character development and plot.

** Here are some HG/SS stories I've saved, they're a variety of flavors, the summaries are vague, and I don't even remember what half of them are about, but I know I wouldn't have saved them if I didn't think they were good:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10962196/1/Mistress-of-the-Stacks][Mistress of the Stacks]]: An archaic danger is rampaging through the Hogwarts Library, and it's up to Headmaster Snape and Mistress Granger to solve the mystery in the stacks. But can they overcome their contentious history to fix the problem, or is history doomed to repeat itself? An expanded version written for Irishredlass as a part of the 2014 LJ SSHG Giftfest. Rated M for violence & adult situations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2922053/1/][Dark Angel]]: It all started with the cloaked figure in the window. From there Hermione learns there is no black and white in a war...only shades of grey and a dark angel that comes to her rescue...or does he?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4083094/1/][Requiem of a Dream]]: The war is over, though Hermione Granger's life is no less complicated or dangerous. Severus Snape makes a miraculous return from the dead and everything Hermione thought she knew comes crashing down around her. HG/SS /Nominated for the Quibbler Awards/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4613625/1/][Memento Mori]]: Set seven years after Voldemort's defeat, the wizarding world is anything but the long awaited utopia so many anticipated. Hermione must come to terms with the ghosts of her past, and in the process, discovers a shocking, hidden truth. Post DH. HG/SS.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/The-Apprentice-and-the-Necromancer][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]]: Snape lives and marries Hermione.---MLC with a twist turns into AU-sequel of DH with new dangers, old secrets, and much more.---Virtual penny dreadful. Many short episodes with adventure, romance, a dash of hurt/comfort, and a sprinkling of horror.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the HB P]]: When Professor Snape heals Hermione's injuries after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, they are both surprised by what they learn. The two must work together to help Harry defeat Lord Voldemort.
