So I saw the same old cliche again; 'light-side' Dumbledore, Leader of the Light, head of a coalition of light-sided pureblood families. Right up there with 'but teh greater good!!1' when it comes to manufacturing a bashable Dumbledore for your edgy and cool Grey Harry to break away from and go his own path...bleck!

But, it got me wondering; are there any fics where Dumbledore goes full Jedi? Or at least something jedi-esque without the crossover?

Like, he really does go for the peace, serenity, knowledge, etc, does floating meditation and precognition, his politics are genuine-article good-of-the-community oriented, etc etc? Basically, 'light-side' Dumbledore who really is light-side (no bashing allowed), with a side order of zen?


** YEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!! We need that!

** You know what would be cool? If Dumbledore was reborn in the Star Wars-era as Anakin Skywalker. He has his memories and powers, both force and magic, or one and the same.

** A little late, and it might not perfectly fit your criteria, but Magicks of the Arcane has an actually good, relatable mentor dumbledore.

*** Oh dear, it has a particularly over-dramatic blurb, though...are you sure it's a good read?

**** I enjoyed it when I read it a few years ago, but I wasn't as picky back then. I'd suggest at least giving it a try.
