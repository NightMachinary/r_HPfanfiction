** One ruthless Harry (fighting a harsher war) I really like is on a fic that gets recommended a lot, but I hope you like it anyway.

**** I'm feeling just as conflicted. I want and don't want this story to end. I'll miss it, I just know it.

(I /am/ trying to refrain from rereading though, but I am anxious for the next reread.)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** I particularly liked the dynamic between Harry and Hermione:

*Harry:* DIEDIEDIE! /Avada-/

*Hermione:* [after a nonverbal Disarming Charm to disarm Harry] No, not yet, Harry. This scum is more useful to us alive, for now.

It's also refreshing that the fic doesn't undersell Hermione's talents and abilities the way a lot of Ruthless!Harry fics do: notice how Hermione casually casts most of her non-Unforgivables nonverbally and is usually the one doing the more complex magic.
