Are there other sources of news about Quidditch? Or will I have to create one for my OC to work at?


** I believe there's a /Quidditch Weekly/? Might just be fanon, but if it is it's pretty commin and reasonable fanon. There's definitely a /Which Broomstick/ magazine about professional-quality brooms, so that might have a recurring Quidditch section, too.

*** There's probably a quarterly magazine for each subject, e.g. Anals of Arithmancy, but I would expect a low circulation for most.

So that gives you one each for: Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Charms, Defense, Herbology, Transfiguration and Potions

Astronomy, Divination and history I believe wouldn't have a circulation simply out of low interest and content.

Then you've got your main newspaper, The Daily Prophet, as well as The Quibbler, Teen Witch Weekly and Witch Weekly for human interest stories and gossip.

Rather than having a specific occupation circulation, I would presume, say, a cursebreaker would suscribe to potions, runes, arithmancy etc.

Lastly, you have to ask yourself if Playwizard and Playwitch exist. There are plenty of reasons they both would and would not, but it's up to the individual author's world.

...just because something was omitted in canon doesn't mean there isn't a hole where it should be.

***** That is not a word used where I live so I assumed it was related to "analysis".

I need a smut story involving Hermione, Babbling and Vector in a threesome. Is there a place for commissions somewhere?

I would say it probably is related. "The Annals of [field of study]" would be a journal or magazine wherein researchers of a field would publish scholarly works.

  I would think that Which Broomstick would definitely have a section on current Quidditch events in addition to advertising broomstick models, and Witch Weekly might have a section on Quidditch star athletes. Hope this helps!
#+end_quote

Then you would think wrong.

Which Broomstick is a play on Which? magazine.
