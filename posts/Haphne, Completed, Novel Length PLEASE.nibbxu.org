I'm just looking for Haphne starting at 1st year or before, *Completed*, (Of Novel Length (100k - above) and Ron/Hermione just don't have to be bffs with Harry.

Other than that, the rest is fine.

There could be bashing, there could be no bashing

There could be some stuff about the House of Black, or there could be less politics

It could even be WBWL

â€‹

I really don't care, as long as I can find my Haphne fix for the week

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  A slightly different purchase planning during his first visit to Diagon Alley means that Harry meets a completely different person than Draco Malfoy at Madam Malkin's. How will this encounter change the fate of the world? And will two restless souls together be able to find some happiness and love in a ruthless world? HP/DG

You might check the Haphne reddit too, they'd probably know a few others.
