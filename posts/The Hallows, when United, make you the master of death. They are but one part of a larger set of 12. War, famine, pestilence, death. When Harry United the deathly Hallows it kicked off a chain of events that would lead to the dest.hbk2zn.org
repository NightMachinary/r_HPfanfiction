**** I loved the show! The book is still better, but that's to be expected. Overall a pretty good adaptation though.

***** Personally I preferred the book, but it was cool seeing that scenes of Crowley and Aziraphale through history, and seeing ‚ÄòNanny Azaroth's lullaby was pure gold', hoping for a second season.

**** Yeah but then there should only be Harry, Master of the 12 Elements, right? This prompt is more like every nation has an Avatar for their Element and they do stuff together.

** I read a fic long ago that took it to The Elder Scrolls through Pokemon, ‚ÄúDisturb not the harmony of Fire, Ice, and Lightning.‚Äù Into ES's primary magical elements being those three.

I believe the Wand was Fire, the Stone was Ice, and the Cloak was Lightning. It was all kinds of strange, and I've got no idea what the link is.

*** I really love Elder Scrolls crossovers. Not only has everyone played at least one of the games, the lore is so insanely deep and convoluted and amazing an entire subreddit exists: [[/r/teslore][r/teslore]]. Easily my favourite subreddit apart from this one.
