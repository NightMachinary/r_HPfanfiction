Plot doesn't matter. Neither does goals or sorting or anything like that. Share the best you've read overall in terms of character depth, lore, and writing style.


** All the young dudes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

Marauder era, it is wolf star, but only slightly, but the actual story is AMAZING. It's a few hundred chapters and it's also finished now so you can binge it all, but it made me go from nearing tears to holding back laughter in a matter of seconds, I loved it all

It's Remus's perspective from joining Hogwarts right the way through to prisoner of Azkaban, and I genuinely cried when it was over, throughout the entire thing I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real, or canon, because the writing style was so similar to JK Rowling'a writing style, I just loved it all

*** Lupin is one of my favorite characters. I don't mind wolfstar (usually if it's marauders era not when they're older). But I couldn't get into this one. The idea Lupin was raised in an orphanage and can't read seems like such a departure from the character I love that I could get into it. I went though probably a dozen chapters or so. But, do you think it's worth it to stick with it? Does this characterization of Lupin eventually evolve to the canon-esque character of Lupin or does it continue as brutish & illiterate.

**** He really becomes a soft boi, but he is still stronger than most portrayals of him. He is more moody and easier to snap than other portrayals as well, but he's definitely softer.

The fic does go all the way up to goblet of fire (ish, idk) do there is some older year woflstar, not it's not too much coz the author said themselves that they /can't/ write smut

** I'm not much of a Dramione (draco/hermione) guy. But probably the best fanfiction I've read is a book called "Cruel and beautiful World" by Lena Phoria... it's hard to find it used to be on ffnet but the author took it down because She used the concept to write an actual book series but you can still find the pdf if you Google search for it ... slight warning does have mature content, a dark world but definitely worth the read IMO

** Flying Colours by TauraNorma it's canon Tonks/Lupin from OoTP. She's started writing a HBP series too which is regularly updated. Excellently written and really gets into the mindset of Lupin and Tonks in alternating chapters.
