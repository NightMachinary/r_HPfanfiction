Any fics with Harry or dumbledoor or anyone really where they build/live in/explore or whatever with a tower. I'm just really wanting to read about a wizard/witch with a tower. Heck, even outside of this fandom or in published work would be cool.


** You know the Gryffindor dorms are in a tower, so technically harry has been living in a tower

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

  Inspired by a tumblr post by libations-of-honey-and-milk:In fairy tales and fantasy, two types of people go in towers: princesses and wizards.Princesses are placed there against their will or with the intention of â€˜keeping them safe.'This is very different from wizards, who seek out towers to hone their sorcery in solitude.I would like a story where a princess is placed in an abandoned tower that used to belong to a wizard, and so she spends long years learning the craft of wizardry from the scraps left behind and becomes the most powerful magic wielder the world has seen in centuries, busts out of the tower and wreaks glorious, bloody vengeance on the fools that imprisoned her.That would be my kind of story.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** This is ... a rather unusual request... I'm curious, why a tower?

The whole of the year 3 plot for my story linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) revolves around a metaphorical tower, and contains as many tower motifs as I managed to fit in. Does that count?

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?
