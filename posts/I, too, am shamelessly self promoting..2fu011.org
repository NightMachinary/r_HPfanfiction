** Awesome story! I love when authors write Slytherin!Harry stories that don't completely change his personality.

*** Thanks. I try/will not try to change his personality too much, but mainly his behavior and the things he does as house ideology changes the way he views things/looks at things, but in some other stories he becomes a Draco clone without the influence or money, etc.

**** Yeah, I meant at the beginning of most Slytherin!Harry stories, his personality is already way different. I don't mind if his personality changes within the story, that's a given.
