** Voldemort gets killed in the middle of DH by Luna Lovegood, after which Harry snaps and unleashes Fiendfyre on London to teach the wizards who let Voldemort happen a lesson. It's all foreshadowed when he tried to Crucio Bellatrix and used Sectumsempra on Malfoy. Hermione kills Harry for the greater good and leaves magic to live in the muggle world. Professor Binns is the new Minister for Magic, with Mundungus Fletcher in charge of the economy.

Edit: Snape gives up any attempts of redemption and rejoins Death Eaters just because.

*** Spot on.

If you came out of the +last episode+ epilogue thinking it was a stupid asspull that came out of nowhere, you just weren't paying attention. It was foreshadowed several books ago! Anyone upset about the ending only feels that way because they're mad that their theories didn't come true.

What did you expect, Harry would marry Hermione and pop out a half dozen green-orbed babies, then live happily ever after, all is well???

**** lmao, the last season of GoT made me appreciate the epilogue so much more. While HP fans are griping about kids' names, GoT fans have to live with the finale that retroactively ruined the whole show.

It's like instead of the epilogue, the DH would have ended with the first half of Cursed Child.

the giant world ending threat was an after thought like its like if voldemort got dealt with in the first chapter of book seven and the rest of the book was about winning the house cup for gryffindor

****** I could even live with the underwhelming ending to NK if it was the only problem. But every other plotline and character arc were ruined just as much. Every dumbest decision they could make, they did, and then some. And to be fair, season 7 sucked as well (Euron Greyjoy, why), we just had too much goodwill from the earlier seasons to notice the full extent of it.

Imagine the big showdown with Voldemort where Harry fails to kill him because "they just forgot about the +Iron Fleet+ locket Horcrux"

***** Cursed Child didn't ruin the trio for me, but they did ruin next gen fanfics, because I didn't have a solid impression of their personalities and character of the kids until I read the script. I can easily replace CC Ron, Harry, and Hermione with their book character in my mind, but not so much for Albus, Scorpius, and Rose.

I hate that Rose is a dick that bullies her own cousin for being in Slytherin. I dislike her end ship with Scorpius. I also hate that Hermione and Ron would raise a kid like her. Ugh.

Edit: And the reason they were camping in the woods for half the book is that they all failed geography.

** Then the last book would be even worse! The hero would fully be Hermione, who transfered the horcrux to herself and who then kept the hollows in order to tear down the ministry (Dany-Style with a dragon or something) and give muggleborns their place in society...and she would then be killed by Dobby who would then tell them to vote for a new leader (maybe Harry) while Dobby returns to servitude (his version of the Wall) :(

** OMFG is every subreddit going to be invaded by "Hurr durr GOT didn't end the way I wanted it to so any foreshadowing people point to is nonexistent. Hurr durr"

You can divide screenwriting into 3 classifications: 1 Writing OC, 2 Writing an adaptation and 3 writing OC that fit with an adaptation.

Further, most issues that GOT got they got because they started with 1 book = 1 season. Partly because of the actors ageing. But as we know with hindsight, would not be that necessary. Now if they had doubled the seasons per book it might've become a lot better. They might've had something more than the basics of the story to work with in the last few seasons. But again hindsight allows people to see what should've been done, but it doesn't exist when it happens.

So if you're going to make this comparison, think that each book will be limited in size to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. So go ahead and try to re-write all Harry Potter books to 77K words.

If they were to pull in plot threads that should've started back in season 2 in season 6 it will also have had a ton of backslash.

**** Just the season before she burned the food the Lannisters where taking from the Reach. She preaches that she cares about the people, yet because of that a lot of them would likely starve to death.

Every season she takes a step away from the innocent girl we met in Season 1 episode 1. Season 1, uncaring that her brother was killed. And I don't mean the fact that he was killed but how. She was detached.

Season 2, locked 2 people in a vault to die. Yes they were not the most innocent people in the world, but again a horrifying way to die.

Season 3, the sack of Astapor leaves a power vacuum.

Season 4, Killing Masters who do not even necessarily have anything to do with the killing of slaves. Confiscating wealth from all Masters.

Season 5, death without trail x2, attempts to kill the remaining masters but is ultimately talked out of it. Season 6, Nothing too major here, but she does demand that the Iron Born stop their historical activities without doing that herself.

Season 7, executes both Tarlys and does it by fire (The worst way to be killed even in medieval times), burns the baggage train of grains and food.

Season 8, disregard of the strain her forces and dragons will put on Winterfell's food supplies which would already be rather low after 5 years of wars. Tells Sam she killed her father and brother without much of a care. The "Who is manipulating whom here" scene, by aiding the North Daenerys is solidifying her claim by actually helping the people she claims to rule. Refuses to let her army rest before they go back south, leading to the devastation of her forces. (You can see the same with Harold's forced marches in the Norman Conquest.) Then after she executed Varys again by fire, she laments to Jon how she doesn't have the love of the people only fear. And after Jon refuses to kiss her more she states "Fear it is". Not seeing that her actions leads to fear.

And the finally renegades on her deal with Tyrion to halt the attack when the city bells rings. And instead set the entire city ablaze. And after she says they will go on and liberate people from their rulers everywhere. Then Jon questions her about how she knows what good is, and what about other people's perception of what is good. Her answers leaves a lot to be desired.

Each of these could be ignored on it's own, but put together it paints a picture of worsening morals.

‚Äã

"Breaking the wheel" would mean the destruction of the entire societal structure of the world. If that were to happen overnight it'd be chaos. Any pre-modern society that didn't operate on the concept of local strongmen were not likely to last long. And yet, that is what she proposed with that. At best she'd replace the nobles with maesters, and considering the maesters worked against magic, dragons and the Targaryen family in particular. I don't think she'd last all too long in that world.
