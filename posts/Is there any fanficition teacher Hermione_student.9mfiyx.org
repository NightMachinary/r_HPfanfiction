**** The difference is that "seduced by a teacher" is a VERY common male fantasy. I mean, the current French president was seduced by his teacher when he was 15 and she 39, and no one really batted an eye.

And most of the "victims" are more distraught about the fact that their shag gets into legal trouble for doing something they enjoy rather than distraught that they were "raped". The only pain they would feel would be in their hands from all the high-fives they would be getting from their friends. [[https://www.unilad.co.uk/crime/parents-of-student-who-had-sex-with-teacher-dont-want-her-prosecuted/][Or his from his father]]

And obviously, that only works with reasonably attractive women. If the boy is not into her, that's not just stratutory rape but actual rape. But that's life. You can get away with a lot of shitty things if you are attractive enough. And if you look at fanfics, the women almost always look like models or porn stars.

To make things clear, I am not advocating rape here. But there is a difference between a 16-year-old boy having a thing with his attractive teacher and a woman forcing herself onto someone defenceless and abusing her position of power to get away with it. The latter scenario seems incredibly OOC for Hermione though.

***** To provide a counterpoint. Being seduced by an older bad boy (or male in a position of power) is also a very common female fantasy. Otherwise Snape/Kids still in Hogwarts wouldnt be a thing

Drastically different consequences for the man in that scenario even if she "wanted" it and was quite alright with the arrangement.

But agreed. Either scenario is incedibly OOC for Hermione (And Snape, which is why whenever I see it I take it as a disservice to his character. There were many flaws to Snape's character. That is most certainly not one of them, and not something hed even consider indulging in. That requires so much character twisting that it's not even the same character I just don't bother when I come across it)

To answer the question. If you were writing smut I imagine there's a de aging potion/spell you could put on Ron (Or whoever shes paired with) to act out said fantasy. Thats the closest where I could even imagining her considering it without having her too OOC

I myself am a proponent of Multiverse Theory, so I would make the argument that the moment in time that Future Hermione arrived in the past, it created a branch in the timestream, leading to the creation of a new future that is separate from the one that she came from, but doesn't result in it's destruction.

  Adult Snape grooming Hermione is totally pedophiliac IMO.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but no, it isn't.

Let's be clear: pedophilia involves an adult being sexually attracted to children because they AREN'T exhibiting sexual characteristics yet.

Grooming involves using the leverage of a position of power and/or authority over a young person to brainwash them into accepting sexual advances from that person outside their natural inclinations.

Most Sevmione fics involve Hermione being precocious and pursuing Snape as a personal project to 'fix' him. He isn't grooming shit.

Slughorn/Granger fics [Slunger? Horamione?], however, almost universally involve the use of magic or leverage to make Hermione submit to Horace while she's a student. Unethical, immoral, but also a kink that some people enjoy reading about.

My kink may not be your kink, but condemning the kinks of others doesn't make you better - just more judgemental. Also, it doesn't help the OP find anything.

** I once read a Fic that had Hermione being in her office (in the Gryffindor tower....i think) and some Boys were chatting about their First time with a Girl, but dont know how to handle them and they had the image, that Girls/Woman dont have orgasm (or more cant have an orgasm). Hermione gets curious and decide to teach them, that the females indeed can have an orgasm. The Fic do have an OoC Hermione, because she exhibit herself plenty to the Boys and even has sex with them....all for teaching purpose. I cant remember the name, but i will look, if i can find it again.

There you go. Hermione being somewhat OOC isn't that bad, it's the fact that the boys are OCs (one named Henry) instead of just using, let's say, Harry, Seamus, Justin FF and Terry Boot that makes the story suck. I honestly feel like rewriting that thing (or something similar) with a canon cast would vastly improve the quality.
