If he was able to avoid Azkaban I doubt he would want to be around those who were actually loyal. Maybe he would have gone to teach in France and we could have met him in GOF as a professor from Beauxbatons.

** Personally I see him as really good friends with Severus Snape, they were in Hogwarts together though not the same year, and I see him rubbing elbows with other purebloods and playing the rich, elitist, pureblood games, but in actuality he is passing information over to Severus and helping him spy on the other Death Eaters and Voldemort, making Severus' job a little bit easier and possibly a little bit less dangerous. I think he'd have stood up against Voldemort in the final battle and also tried to help Harry if they ever crossed paths, secretly of course. Dumbledore would've known and trusted him to an extent but probably not unconditionally as with Severus as I really don't see Regulus willingly going underneath someone's thumb especially with how that worked out with Voldemort. But that's my take. He'd have probably tried to reunite with Sirius as well. Whether or not he affected the plot is unknown. I'd like to think he could have perhaps prevented deaths, mainly Fred and Severus' deaths, but of course there is no way to know that.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

**** There are a few factors to consider. Dumbledore vouched for Snape, but he doesn't really know Regulus enough or trusts him enough. The locket-horrcrux thing may remain a secret to the Ministry and unable to be used in a trial. Regulus didn't spy for Dumbledore and there's no evidence of him being near Dumbledore. Regulus might have made more public crimes before turning over, maybe he murdered someone. Do we even know if he "turned over"? For all we know he just wanted to defend his elf and didn't want to join the order. He might still held pureblood ideology.

Of course in a fic this could be handled. But if staying in canon, would require him not murdering anyone and having Dumbledore trusting him instantly and doing good chunk of lying in trial for him.

In case Regulus tells him the entire story, Dumbledore wouldn't want the (presumably) entire Wizengamot to find out about the Horcruxes in a court, or probably anywhere else. He would rather lie and keep that information to himself and do something about it, possibly with Regulus.

We don't, but we also don't know if Snape really turned over. Snape's loyalty to Dumbledore stemmed first from wanting to protect Lily thanks to the dumbass mistake Snape made, then because Voldemort would kill him if he knew he was a traitor.

Regulus probably did have remnants of pureblood supremacy in him, but him first attempting to help kill Voldemort, and also being able to give Dumbledore important info(Dumbledore didn't know Riddle had Horcruxes for sure, just guessed) should be enough. That of course all hinges on whether Regulus does go to Dumbledore, or if he just goes into hiding with Kreacher

Very few Death Eaters had public crimes. Given that Slughorn did his best to avoid associating with Death Eaters, his "I'd have liked the set" comment suggests Regulus was not among the few that did.

A good portion of this fandom believes that he wasn't and/or argues against the idea that Snape was a murderer and, given his actions, I don't know why. At the very least, per his own words, he was a witness to it and didn't care to save those people.

** You know if he had lived... And had like functioning magic I think he would have hid out somewhere Trying to destroy the locket and maybe a year or 2 after the war ended voldemort disappears whatever he'd hear a whisper somehow... 1 For some odd reason I think he would end up hiding out in Canada or something because that's where a British people go to disappear for some reason.... So like maybe a year or 2 after voldemort is vanquished he'd Hear whispers of it in some random very isolated magical community in Canada and then actually get information that his brother is supposedly the right hand of voldemort and is Currently incarcerated in Azkaban... Regulus was a death eaters I think he would have known if Sirius was one as well... So I would like to think regulus considering he found himself standing up to the dark Lord somehow eventually I think he would somehow figure out how to get his brother out A few years earlier than Canon it might take a couple to figure out a game plan and maybe brew in a potion but I would say from getting the information and the fact the guy was walburga's favorite with access to a houseelf... Probably somewhere between 1 to 3 years for him to figure out how to do it properly without getting caught and then I can just kind of imagine Sirius being a bit crazy.... Wanting to find Harry... but Regulus Somehow petrifying his brother and dragging him back across the Atlantic with him until hes seen enough healers and regained enough of his sanity to actually be a functioning human without quite the crazy but while still being Sirius.. I'm kind of picturing a lot of heated very Venomous arguments between those 2 over the course of a couple years while they try and figure out where the fuck Peter is what happened and Just deciding Sirius and Regulus Will share the same identity just so they don't have to keep running from the aurors... A bit of poly juice sirius Leaves the house.. So he looks like regulus or perhaps an Uncle or something if they have access to hair of someone else basically I'm kind of seeing the black brothers become very reluctant roommates over the course of a few years while they figure out what the fuck to do in clear Sirius' name... And I'm picturing Sirius Reaching out to Remus by making his brother help him dig a giant bear pit near the woods where Remus is transforming maybe wherever the hell in Great Britain he is and then just mentally picturing in the morning when Remus is stuck at the bottom of a hole bitching and swearing at Sirius Threatening to murder him before regulus cuts in," Will you shut the bloody hell up lupin rah ran betrayal...blah blah James....Kill you... He didn't do it my brothers no death eater I'm the only crazy flucker between the 2 of us that ever swore an oath in that circle jerk of a crazy fucking organization and I've got the mark to prove it. My brothers unblemish batshit crazy and a right tosser but no death eater. Now will you bloody well shut the hell up sit in your pit quietly and listen to him explain everything and if you don't want anything to do with him after we will leave peacefully. And you can crawl out of the hole you're literally in back to your pathetic life of menial labor and barely eating. " But for regulus looks at his brother who somehow barely containing a smile at the dumbfounded expression on Remus's face and says," Now will you bloody well hurry this the fuckup Sirius I'm missing my tela novela Because you made me help you with this ridiculous operation brother."

Before Sirius being an older brother Tells regulus not to get his knickers in a twist before laughing and saying to Remus, " He is right though." And rolling up the sleeve of both his shirt arms rolling up both his shirt sleeves to show clear unmarked for arms beside the few scars from his time in prison.

" I'm no death eater Mooney."

And then he pulled a lunch Box out from behind his back and shakes the clear plastic side of it to show a very terrified rat in it missing the 4th finger on its right front foot .

"And I'm not a killer "

The whole morning I would expect go rather unpleasantly for Remus who as we all know just want a good cup of tea and a nap after an unpleasant nighttime Transformation.
