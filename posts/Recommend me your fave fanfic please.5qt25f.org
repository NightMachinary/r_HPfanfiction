Like the title says. Have a lot of free time and looking for more fan fic to read. No slash fics please.


** Check out Run by Toujours Padfoot - it's a fantastically unique story, I stayed up way too late finishing it. It's not my favourite per se, but it's so creative & fun & heartbreaking & it captures everyone beautifully. It's an afterlife fic, so it's really fun watching Lily interact with, say, George Weasley. Definitely recommend.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** My fav currently updating fic is: linkffn(For Love of Magic) Harry discovers magic at an early age and gets a grasp of wandless magic before Hogwarts. Has smut.

As for my favorite finished fics, if you've been HP fanfics for a while, you've probably read these anyways: linkffn(A Black Comedy), linkffn(Faery Heroes), linkffn(Princess of the Blacks), linkffn(Delanda Est)

*** I adore 'For Love Of Magic'. Harry is such a prick and i would probably hate him on sight if i ever met him in real life but he does it in a way that you can't really help but understand his points even if you disagree with him.

I really quite like the idea of an amoral Harry that isn't completely evil. He simply sees the world in a different way and i haven't found many fics that could pull that off.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

They'd be significantly throwing away massive advantages of knowing what he and his enemies are doing if they try to deviate, and that could result in disaster. I can follow the thinking there.

** I would definitely read the Albus Potter series. It's the best, most well written, exciting, action packed, and captivating fanfiction I've ever read, and I've read hundreds of fanfictions accumulating to millions of words. It's formatted in the same way as the original books but Albus Potter is the protagonist.

Here's the link to the first one. linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]]. Very AU - Harry raised by Sirius, doesn't come to Hogwarts until 6th year - which is where the story starts, except for a brief prologue. Obviously, from the title, there's a soulbond, but it's not an instantly-in-love thing. Nice and long (386k) and complete.

**** It mostly takes place at Hogwarts, but there is some political stuff. Even when it has the overdone tropes, I think it generally has a very different take. The fall of Fudge and his replacement was definitely unique.

Her writing style is very episodic - she says she writes a bunch of smaller stories that string together in a "season" instead of one big storyline. So try just the first part - it won't end in a cliffhanger. And Harry's first night at Hogwarts was very funny in spots. That's another thing I like about this one - good humor. Not constant, but there.
