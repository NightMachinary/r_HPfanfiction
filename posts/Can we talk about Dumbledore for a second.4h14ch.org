I've seen more evil, manipulative Dumbledores out there than I'd care to count. I'll admit even that he made some terrible choices and put Harry in danger. What I can't be convinced of is that he did any of it out of malice and/or for personal gain. Most of these Dumbledore bashing ffs read like they where written by a less talented Rita Skeeter.

So here's my argument:

Dumbledore's main goal has always been to prevent loss of life. He isn't a political figure (he was offered the MoM position and refused, multiple times), he's a teacher but because A) people look to him for guidance since the Gindelwald incident, B) the ministry is incompetent and C) he was the one to hear the prophecy, he's forced to act against Voldemort and he does this as best as he can. He tries to protect Harry but he knows that he can't, because in the end he will have to face Voldemort no matter what he does, and if it's only because Voldemort believes in the prophecy. He's not trying to shape Harry into a perfect weapon to throw at Voldemort, he's trying to perpare him for when Voldemort eventually comes knocking. This is not a matter of "the greater good" but a matter of choosing a lesser evil. Maybe he's manipulative in doing so, but even that's a point I'd argue. In any case, people tend to write Dumbledore as if he was worse than any other character in the HP universe and I don't understand why. It bugs me.

Edit: I've been made aware of this seriously amazing, in-depth analysis of Dumbledores character. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/]] Thanks you [[/u/bisonburgers]]!


** To make kids heroes, you gotta dumb down the adults. Death Eaters, the Ministry, and the Order were all paragons of incompetence.

Dumbledore, as the leader of the Order, had to be made incompetent and ineffective, or else Harry and Co would never get their chances to shine.

Those kinds of plot are of course fine for teens and children, but as adults looking back at them, we no longer feel satisfied.

Since we are unwilling to attack JKR, her characters in the Books, Dumbledore predominantly, get the bash instead.

** I'd add item D) Dumbledore does not trust himself with executive power or with power over life and death of others, which unfortunately leads him to sometimes treat his enemies better than his friends.

In other words, he is not a perfectly rational, utility-maximizing actor. He is a wise old man with more magical skill than he knows what to do with, and baggage from his attempt to take over the world with Grindelwald, the death of his sister, and his subsequently having to fight and imprison his former best friend (and possibly the love of his life). He is happy to /guide/ others as the Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock, and the Supreme Mugwump, but he does not want to /rule/ them as the Minister. He is also keenly aware that actions have consequences --- especially where magic is involved --- and is more afraid of doing harm than he is of failing to do good.

*** That interpretation, that he is more afraid of doing harm than failing to do good, makes him deeply flawed though. A total failure as a Headmaster and politician. When faced with Death Eaters, especially the second time around, there is no excuse, none at all, not to act. Decisively, and lethally. At the end of book 5, all other options have been tried in the past, and shown to not work. The imprisoned DEs have been freed, the ones citing Imperius revealed to have lied, and the murders have started. At that point, killing the Death Eaters would have been the only moral option, whether by pressuring Fudge to have them executed, or by doing it himself in the Battle fo the Ministry.

** The problem with Dumbledore and this community is that the moment childish innocence leaves your brain his actions begin to make absolutely no sense. Just like the action of many, /many/ other adult characters. It is a series targeted to children and teenagers.

Then you combine that with the fact that you /know/ he's very intelligent. You know the man has a sense for analytical thinking, problem solving, empathy,...

Why did he never check up on Harry (or literally /anyone/ else)? Why did he build traps for freakin Dark Lord Voldemort that first years could overcome? How is it that one of the most knowledgeable people of the wizarding world kind of forgets that there is such a thing as basilisks? Why isn't he protecting Sirius even if he /knows/ that he is innocent? How does one of the most observant people in the castle not notice that his life long friend isn't quite the same? How in the world is Dumbledore going from decade-long politician to government noob while trying to let people see the truth about Voldemort? What the fuck is he thinking when he sends three teens on a chase like the Horcrux hunt?

You arrive at the point where you ask yourself: "What the hell are you up to, old man?" and if you don't remember that, yes, this is all tailored so that Harry can be in the spotlight, you may end up convinced that the old man planned something.

I'm actually writing the outlines to a fic where Dumbledore acts as adults would think of the awe-inspiring wizard. Age Line at the 3rd floor with no announcement of "horrible death if entered". Hogwarts budget gets up in flames for truckloads of roosters in second year. Dumbledore goes chasing after Sirius himself. Goblet of Fire also gets a nice little Age Line for anyone /over/ 18. And fifth year... well, theres where my story starts. And yes, Harry (or Poppy, as this is a fem!Harry) has nothing to do but be a student and merely gets this all from the sidelines.

#+end_quote

Exactly, and we /shouldn't/ forgive him. I think the trouble with defending Dumbledore is that, by talking to those who find him cruel and manipulative, then clearly I must just think exactly the opposite. The truth is I don't.

The problem I have with Ultra Manipulative Dumbledore is that, if you look at the the timeline of the series, it is nearly /impossible/ for him to have manipulated as much as people give him credit for. If you read the prophecy, just take your later knowledge of the books away and it says /almost nothing/ that can be immediately understood. /Voldemort/ jumped to conclusions borne from his fear, and that was the /problem/, he lost his mind due to his fear. /Dumbledore/ did not jump to conclusion about the prophecy.

If one takes time to see what Dumbledore learned throughout the books, then it becomes clear that those things /could not/ have been part of some giant scheme planned a decade earlier, because he learns these things when Harry is 11, 12, 14, and 15. How could have have planned for them if he didn't know these things?

This Ultra Manipulative Dumbledore, therefore, must be a god. How else can he have such amazing foresight, such perfect intuition, and be completely omniscient? There is /nothing/ he can't do, therefore everything he does is clearly /on purpose/ and some form of manipulation to get /his way/. Why?

*/Why?/*

I can't tell you how confused I am trying to figure out what this Dumbledore's /motivations/ are. /Why is he bothering to do all these things?/ And I know we're on a fan fiction sub, but I think people /really do think fan fiction is canon/ sometimes. I have /actually been linked fan fiction/ to justify people's ideas of Dumbledore. *Fan Fiction!!* I love fan fiction as much as the next person, but it is /not sourceable material/.

Earlier I said Voldemort lost his head when he heard the prophecy, went after Harry without being reasonable about it, that's how strong his fear is. Dumbledore, though logical about the prophecy, loses his head over other things - when he sees the Resurrection Stone and wants to bring his sister back. He is weak there, but how poetic that weakness is. Voldemort's fear is death, and he loses his mind where death is concerned. Dumbledore is not scared of death, he readily accepts it, but when he thinks for a moment he can bring his sister back, he loses his mind, and forgets his enlightened view and wishes to bring her to him. He failed, and Death takes him.

Both are fools, opposites, but fools, and Harry is the one, least magical of all, that controlled both his fear and his love, and that is why, poetically, he survives where both Voldemort and Dumbledore die. It is not a story of magic, but of choices, and the reasons behind those choices - our love and fears and conquering them.

It is Dumbledore's wonderfully poetic faults and how they tie in to the themes of the books that make him so fascinating, and yet /so many people/ see him as manipulative, who never loved, an yet his foolish love is /the very core of his characterization/. I feel like those Christians who want to save people by telling them about Jesus. I genuinely feel that people are missing out on a huge wonderful and meaningful part of the series, so convinced are they that Dumbledore is manipulative.

And how do you suggest he's not? It's so easy to call something manipulative, because it inherently requires very little to back it up. "Dumbledore knew that would happen", "He looked sad on purpose to make Harry think he was sad". How can one dispute that? It doesn't matter that there's /no reason/ for Dumbledore to work on such a level of secrecy. It doesn't matter that Dumbledore's backstory is centered around his cowardice and not his desire to manipulate.

And above all, it doesn't matter that it was /Rita Skeeter/ and Aberforth, who so clearly knows very little about his brother, that many people believe. Sometimes I wonder if people were missing The Lost Prophecy, Horcruxes, and Kings Cross Chapters entirely in their books, that there was a huge mis-printing, because the more I talk about Dumbledore, the more I get confused and want to shout to the world, 'It's all in the books!"

Dumbledore is introduced as a perfect omniscient god, then he's broken down and we're meant to question him. Then he's built back up in a single chapter, but not as a god this time, but as a human, and I think people have trouble with that.

****** Sorry this is so very late(I'm trawling through old stuff), but while you have a good point in your post, you do pass over a couple things; Dumbledore was specifically warned by McGonagall about the nature of the Dursleys and Dumbledore chose to ignore that, then he chose never to have Harry checked up on.

Those two things, to me, make Dumbledore a fool. It's not helped by him trying to do everything in a roundabout, enigmatic fashion either.

******* Never too late to talk about Dumbledore!

Did I skip over those two points? I don't think McGonagall's information was new to him, but I suppose if it was, it doesn't really make a difference, he chose to put Harry there either way. I believe Dumbledore when he says Harry was in extreme danger, even while Voldemort was in exile, and for that reason, I think Harry would have lived a very closeted life (pun intended) somewhere else, and the Dursleys is the only place he could be protected while still being able to step outside a house and go to the store and travel. That is, live a normal life.

As for McGonagall's warnings, all she said was they were not "like us" and described their son acting bratty. I don't really think that compares to saving Harry's life.

Secondly from that, maybe Dumbledore did check up on Harry? How do we know he didn't? But I actually agree with you - I don't think he did, I think was Dumbledore being neglectful. He didn't know how horrible it was because he wasn't looking.

  “Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine. An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837)
#+end_quote

I think Dumbledore knew that he had to stay objective or else Voldemort would win, and at first intentionally stayed distant from Harry. But once Harry began at Hogwarts and began to prove how great he was and his loyalty to Dumbledore (Fawkes helping Harry in the Chamber, saving the stone, etc), Dumbledore's heart weakened and he grew to love Harry despite knowing he shouldn't.

Dumbledore position is written to be extremely difficult. On one had, what does it say about him that he placed Harry at the Dursleys, on the other, Harry probably would have been killed if he didn't, so did he do the right thing?

On on hand he kept Harry's necessary death from him, but on the other hand, keeping the secret ensured his survival.

On one hand, he let people think Snape was a Death Eater, but on the other hand it ensured Voldemort did not suspect Snape, thus allowing Snape to become headmaster and protect all the innocent students for the length of the war, which could have gone on for ages.

Most of Dumbledore decisions can be seen as immoral, and yet the alternate is (in my opinion) usually worse. I think it's what makes the writing /so brilliant/ and especially why he's such a controversial character to this day.

** I don't care for bashing fics, not because they present Dumbledore as a maliciously manipulative mastermind. No, that isn't the problem. It's because the majority of them do it so /poorly/.

Most of these fics tend to take place when Dumbledore is the headmaster of *the* school in magical Britain; the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW; and the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. The second position is in the magical version of the UN, while the third one possibly oversees different trials or functions of the Wizengamot, wizarding Britain's court of law. The first allows him to shape generations of witches and wizards. Dumbledore was also a former friend to Grindelwald, not to mention the man who single-handedly bested him. (Here, you may imagine Churchill delivering a KO punch to Hitler.) He's also the only person whom Voldemort fears.

With all that considered, if Dumbledore were truly malign, if he were truly pulling strings from the shadow of the throne, if he is as bad as you could possibly make him out to be, then there's little chance that he would allow a smug, high-minded lordling to ruin his plans. The typical indy!Harry spoilt turd would be Obliviated and sent on his merry way within seconds of confronting Dumbledore with all the facts of his machinations.

But with a man as brilliant and experienced as Dumbledore, I doubt he'd ever allow Harry to get that close. He'd probably mindwipe the kid the second little Lord Potter started questioning his depleted coffers.

Anyway, being manipulative is hardly indicative of an "evil" nature. It's a tool. In this series, it is a tactic in a war being fought by an enemy cloaked in shadows. And like all wars, there are losses. Dumbledore left out the full truth in order to better lead a young wizard to his prophesied sacrifice. That's bad, but what choice was there? A prolonged war to save one boy? One boy against how many others?

Sacrifices are ugly but they are a fact of life. Someone had to be a leader. Someone /was/ a leader and it wasn't Fudge. And leaders have to do terrible things sometimes. One might even say great but terrible things.

Killing Voldemort is one thing given his status (much like killing Osama bin Laden, or Kim Jong Un) and debatable humanity, but Dumbledore absolutely does not have the right or jurisdiction to go after any of the Death Eaters with intent to kill.

And I repeat, I'm sure you're doing the moral thing and executing criminals in your hometown because the law doesn't catch them all. Oh wait, you don't because the law exists for a reason, and while you have leeway to capture and/or stop criminals and hand them over to law enforcement you have exactly zero right to summarily execute them.

As mentioned, outside situations of extreme self defense (see Battle of Hogwarts for instance) the Order's leeway only extended to obstruction and apprehension of Death Eaters. Because, I repeat, it's not their place to be judge, jury and executioner. They're not Aurors, and even Aurors aim to bring people to trial, not [figuratively] gun them down in the streets.

***** Part 1/2:

Not going to make it easy for me, huh? ;D

#+begin_quote
  Leaving Harry at the Dursleys was unnecessary as the one person who could kill him had no form.
#+end_quote

Harry already cannot be killed by Voldemort due to Lily's sacrifice, body or no body, which suggest that Dumbledore has other reasons than preventing Voldemort from murdering this child. The added protection Dumbledore added on top of Lily's provided Harry a home in which he could step outside, not be watched constantly, go to school, and essentially live a normal life. Other forms of protection that were introduced in the series (which is all we can work with) would limit these aspects of his life. Naturally we can say "there's another way not introduced", but in a world of magic, that is a very cheap response, in my opinion. Also, we know from the Seven Potters chapter that Harry was protected by not only Voldemort, but Death Eaters as well.

But bison, he was neglected! Yes, he was, and Dumbledore knew Petunia was a piece of work, but how could he predict her parenting/gaurdianing style when she was a new parent herself? Yes, it's clear she's not ideal, but we're really expecting god-like abilities from Dumbledore, aren't we?

But bison, why did he keep Harry there ten years? It is my belief that Dumbledore's main characterization centers around him attempting to emotionally distance himself from Harry so that he can do what is best for the lives of thousands, but begins to love Harry, thus failing at his original plan. Therefore, I believe this to be the time that he distances himself and is largely unaware of the true nature of Harry's neglect. I never said he was perfect, I just don't think most people are looking at him critically enough to appreciate his characterization. I do no think he was Big Brother-ing everything as much as others do. It makes him seem to god-like.

#+begin_quote
  In the first year the stones' "defences" are a gauntlet so trivial that three eleven year olds with less than a year of magical training and Quirrel a mediocre wizard could beat it.
#+end_quote

The first book is full of things that later seem absolutely ridiculous, and I think it's really important to consider this when looking at the book. I mean, imagine Voldemort being okay with sitting through a year of class? It's hilarious!

Also, the only reason the Stone was at all at risk of being stolen was because Harry fucked it up and went after it. Quirrellmort could not have retrieved the Stone out of the mirror. They /would/ have failed. I think this is proof that Dumbledore /didn't/ want Harry to go after the stone when he did, even if he /did/ want Harry to understand a few things, like the mirror, I do not think that necessarily means he wanted that to happen when Harry was 11.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn't you?” (Book 1, U.S. p. 297).
#+end_quote

Considering he, Hermione, and Ron were in the library researching him for ages, and considering they casually mention his name aloud to Hagrid, even a minimal level of omniscience or manipulative intent would have meant Dumbledore already knew this.

Four years later,

“... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner --- much sooner --- than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837).

Being unable to find enough evidence that he is lying, my only conclusion is that Dumbledore means it --- he did not intend Harry to meet Voldemort at age eleven. This fits in line with how royally Harry fucked up the protection and undoing a years worth of Dumbledore's hard work to keep the stone away from Voldemort. However,

#+begin_quote
  "You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man's fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can say.” (Book 5, U.S. p. 837)
#+end_quote

Harry proved that he was quite special and I believe whatever plans Dumbledore had held for a decade for this child were cracking under pressure, as much as they shouldn't. I think Dumbledore is beginning to love Harry, and wants to protect him, even while he knows the terrible consequences, he convinces himself he doesn't have to face those problems /yet/,

#+begin_quote
  "I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young." (Book 5, U.S. p. 838)

  In the second year if Hermione can figure out that it is a basilisk then Dumbledore should have figured it out long before her as he is supposed to be magnitudes above her in terms of intelligence
#+end_quote

Hermione knew Harry was hearing voices. Even Dumbledore didn't know that because Harry lied to him about it, which to me suggests he understood Harry's connection a lot less than we think he did at this stage. He is skilled at Occlumency, but even Snape asks Harry questions directly rather than just "reading his mind" because it is more complicated, so I don't think the idea that Dumbledore could have known is very strong.

****** Part 2/2;

I'm a fucking idiot and copied it over to paste and then accidentally copied something else..... (and stupidly closed the original thing)

Rather than figuring out how to retrieve that, if it's even possible, I'll rewrite the second half tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to refer to the link in the original post's edit. It's a paper I co-wrote about Dumbledore.

The long and short of what I accidentally copied over is that these /are/ mistakes, they are what makes Dumbledore an interesting character with faults. He is a fool and is often cowardly. He can face Voldemort and Death Eater without blinking, and yet is often cowardly at very basic and human levels. Discovering the reasons why are what make him, in my opinion, infinitely more interesting than a scheming manipulative man who is extremely self-aware and doesn't make any mistakes except getting caught.

If I forget to respond, let me know, I might have just gotten busy.

edit: [[/u/delinquent_turnip]]

Okay, here's the second half now

#+begin_quote
  In the fifth year the whole ignoring Harry thing was a mistake, as was giving him and occlumency teacher that hated him. Also Dumbledore's secrecy with the prophesy alowed Voldemort's trap to work, though the last point is understandable even if it is still a mistake
#+end_quote

It was definitely absolutely a mistake. Again, I'm not trying to say Dumbledore did everything perfectly, because he definitely did not. I just think people are keen to think of Dumbledore as manipulative, that they read Rita Skeeter's and Aberforth's take, which gives us a view of Dumbledore that is very self-aware and power-hungry. The books tear Dumbledore down to pieces, and I think people stopped there and must have skimmed straight over the King's Cross chapter where Dumbledore gives reasons for all his actions that present them in a slightly different light than what the tabloids and those who didn't know him well said. They end up not being mistakes of sly miscalculations, but mistakes of deep emotional blindness. If they were simple "oops, I manipulated people the wrong way", I doubt Dumbledore would be filled with the immense shame he presents in King's Cross.

Okay, so actually talking about fifth year now. This year is essentially the year Dumbledore royally fucks up. For four years he's watched as this boy (a boy he knew he should stay emotionally distant with) went through so much hardship, but at the same time showed so so /so/ much bravery, loyalty (Fawke's went to Harry's in CoS), and love (fighting for his friends and family). And Dumbledore, despite knowing this would ruin his plan, began to care for Harry, began to prioritize him over Voldemort.

But he knew, deep down, that he shouldn't, that there was no way to give Harry the life he deserves this way. He won't live forever to protect Harry, and the immortal Voldemort would still reign supreme. We all know, and Dumbledore definitely knew, Harry would hate living a life of hiding and go after Voldemort anyway and die. Prioritizing Harry /would not have done Harry or anyone any good/, so Dumbledore knew that he must not think emotionally, that that would not solve anyone's problems.

So he tried to avoid it, just like I'm avoiding thinking about how much debt I'm in, and yet it creeped up on him anyway because how can it not? This is war, and things are happening whether he can control them or not. But he prioritized Harry's life and the result was doing nearly the opposite of what Harry really needed. Like an over-bearing parent who doesn't let their kid learn about sex-ed or, well, read Harry Potter books, he over-protected Harry, keeping this enormous burden a secret from him, because as any emotionally weak parent, you forget to do what the child /really/ needs, and do what you /want/ them to need.

And Dumbledore knew, though he pretended not to, that Harry could handle it.

Furthermore Dumbledore was /absolutely/ correct in being paranoid about what Voldemort would do with Harry's mind. I mean, Voldemort totally planted a fake vision, isn't that evidence enough that Dumbledore was right? And yes, he chose the wrong preventative action, but Occlumency is the accepted form of blocking mental attacks, so... what else is Dumbledore going to do? Dumbledore isn't even as good at Occlumency as Snape is, and who else is going to do it? What, should Dumbledore fly in someone from France and say, "Sir, please, this is really confidential, so like... don't tell anyone about this kid's connection with Voldemort's mind, it could lead to lots of deaths. Speaking of death, how's your life insurance plan?" No. And he can't do it himself, because Harry feels Voldemort rise inside him in Dumbledore's presence.

And it's not like he can look up other examples of people who have bits of other people's souls in them and see if it works any differently. Dumbledore is /guessing/ and he guessed right, only Snape was a poor teacher and Harry was crap at Occlumency. But his worries and his reasons for acting that way make sense with what he knew at the time. Dumbledore didn't know until he witnessed it with his own two eyes that Harry didn't need Occlumency at all.

#+begin_quote
  "That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.” (Book 5, ch. 37)

  Sixth year the Gaunt ring although it was his hearts greatest desire so its kind of understandable and I won't hold that against him. Dumbledore also seams to take a great deal of time giving Harry a very small amount of information about Tom Riddle.
#+end_quote

Another thing that is ultimately a huge moment in Dumbledore's (in my opinion wonderful) characterization. He touches the ring. And he does it to bring back his dead sister, quite forgetting she is at peace. He failed, poetically, as a master of death, because someone who was truly master would not have made such a folly, but he also failed Harry. He did not plan to die so soon, but now he has to */COMPLETELY FUCKING RE-THINK EVERYTHING/*.

And so I just want to go on a tangent. Do people who think Dumbledore planned everything from the get-go think he planned his own death too? Serious question. Or do they think his plan, like... didn't change much after he touched the ring? Was he just like "oh, well, I guess I'm dead, but at least my plan to totally manipulate the shit out of Harry can still work! If anything, I get to manipulate more!"? I don't understand how his touching the ring fits into this theory and am /so curious/.

Anyway, now he has to re-think everything, and who is the best option to carry on? Well, Harry of course, not because of the prophecy, but because out of all the willing candidates, he is the one that can't be killed by Voldemort and also the one with a connection to Voldemort's mind and /also/ the one with a wand that recognizes Voldemort as a foe and /also/ with a wand that absorbed Voldemort's own deadly power. Harry may be young, but he is /seriously fucking powerful/ against Voldemort and /nobody/ knows that better than Dumbledore.

It also should be noted that /nowhere/ does Dumbledore tell Harry he needs to act alone. That was Harry's choice. He told Harry not to tell anybody about Horcruxes. That's it, and that was also really fantastic advice, because if Voldemort even had one inkling they were after Horcruxes, he'd make another, or more for good measure.

Also, Dumbledore's speed at which he gives Harry information was slow, but why should it have been faster? What, really, is the benefit in this case. Everything was covered -- plus, towards the end, the speed was dependent on Harry's ability to get Slughorn's memory, so really, we should blame Harry for that 'cause he took his sweet time.

As much as I wrote, I know I could have written more to help explain my points (and indeed have, if you read the post linked in OPs edit). If any part of this is confusing, or you disagree, let me know, I'd love to keep discussing it.

******* Prophecies, as a rule, are vague bullshit. The "either must die at the hand of the other" line was basically Fate going "yea boi we gonna have a /dank-ass/ showdown" and doesn't actually mean he can't die from his house being burned down if Voldemort wasn't the one who did it. It's fire, fire doesn't care.

I do think the Mirror would have stumped Quirrelmort. Even if he could figure out the trick to the spell that hid the stone (Selfish,no; Unselfish, yes) he wouldn't have been able to get it, because the spell used the Mirror's properties, i.e. seeing your heart's desire, to see if you actually wanted the stone for unselfish reasons or if you were just saying that. It's possible a master occlumens could trick it (Assuming that's possible with canon occlumency), but I don't think Quirrelmort was capable of that at that point in time.

There's also the fact that all of this was just meant to delay Quirrelmort until Dumbledore could get there. So even if Quirrelmort could have gotten it eventually, there likely wouldn't have been enough time.

He probably couldn't impersonate Moody perfectly, but I don't think he would need to. All the teachers are /busy/. Dumbledore, even more so. Any interactions would have been quick and shallow how do you do's.

Now I want a fic were Quirrellmort gets tired of the mirror's shit after five minutes and just puts the whole thing in a mokeskin pouch and absconds with it. He has months if not years to figure out the enchantment, no? Or find some other gullible kid to extract the Stone that won't actually burn his face off.

#+end_quote

And? That's not the only issue that had a hand in guiding Dumbledore's decision. Harry was a counterpoint /and/ mirror to Dumbledore's failings in dealing with Riddle's childhood. Both were, when away from Hogwarts, living in a place they intensely hated yet were sent back there each summer. But, and to Dumbledore that made all the difference, Riddle grew up without family and so, in Dumbledore mind, rejected them right back as they had rejected him. This view stems from Dumbledore's own broken family and his guilt about them. He did not dare let another child grow up without family, as bad as they may be.

In Dumbledore's internal narrative external issues can be traced back to lacking family. And as flawed as this view may be, it drives the character in all his good and bad points.

  I concede the point about the second year you are correct though he could have legilemencied it out but that is a weak arguement
#+end_quote

Fair enough. As I get older, I definitely think the first three books are much more childish than I would have admitted when I was younger. I don't consider this a bad thing, though. It doesn't mean I don't enjoy them any less, but just consider things like Voldemort sitting through class all year, and Peter Pettigrew living as Ron's pet rat as significantly different tones from the later series, and I don't want to ignore that clear change in tone when analyzing the books. I think Voldemort, Dumbledore, and almost everyone besides Harry, Ron, and Hermione, (and I'll throw Snape in there too) are much better written in later books (the main trio, and Snape, I think are written well from the get-go). Not because they were poorly written before, but that Rowling had a much better grasp on their characterization at that point, having been in their heads for so long.

All this goes into my thinking about the over-all plot and characterization, so if it's weak that Dumbledore should have realized there was a monster sooner, then it's a weaker plot structure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that makes Dumbledore stupid, it just means that the plot existed in such a way where Dumbledore had to be stumped.

#+begin_quote
  nobody is that good
#+end_quote

I don't think your conclusion is bad, but I don't consider this a very good argument. I understand it feeling extremely implausible, though, but think there are much better arguments than that. I could use that argument for anything, "nobody is that evil" "nobody is that brave", but in a fictional world with ghosts and magic, maybe somebody /is/ that good, you know?

Also, this, once again, seems to fall under plot structure rather than characterization. Not that that makes it any less valid, but as we're talking about characterization, it seems relevant to say.

I think Moody likely would have a "this is me" codephrase, but there is still a /way/, whether or not you find it plausible or not, for Crouch Jr. to get that phrase out of him. In a weakened state, people are much more susceptible to Veritiserum and the Imperius Curse, so he could have gotten it out that way. Certainly Moody is paranoid, but in a world of magic, maybe paranoia isn't a strong enough defense. Pre-planning can only take one so far even in the Muggle World. Having mace on my keys isn't necessarily going to prevent anything just because I thought to put mace on my keys ahead of time.

Voldemort certainly could have found some way /eventually/. But he did not know how the stone was protected until he got there and saw the mirror. He could escape and return, but then he'd likely have been found out due to the evidence that he had been through the obstacles once before, in which case, the stone might be moved again. Hindsight really is 20/20. I could obviously have caught my friend's ex cheating, only I can't read minds. I could have also put a $20 in my car to pay for gas when I accidentally left my wallet at home, but... well, that require foresight too, doesn't it?

As for Voldemort being at the school for a year around students. I know. I really don't think any of the characters besides the main trio were really fleshed out, and although there might not be gaping holes, there are a lot of scenarios that are hard to imagine happening in, say, HBP - they seem laughably innocent. I don't really have specific examples for why I feel this way, except that it seems to me as if it was written with absolutely no idea the magnifying glass people were going to put to the book.

** I personally am fine with Dumbledore Bashing stories. Mostly because I like having more variety in antagonists. The idea that the person you should be able to go to for help is not only the most powerful person in the country, but also in reality not so good natured. It can be a great read of the underdog fighting against a far greater power. Adding Voldemort and you got two antagonists with (normally) far greater power than the main character with an added evil vs. evil & order vs. chaos flavor.

The main problems with Dumbledore bashing are two fold. The first is like you said, there are a lot of them, meaning that you gonna have a lot of similar ideas floating around, and a lot of questionable writing. The second is also connected to the first, poor quality. I lot of stories featuring Dumbledore bashing spend more time emphasizing Dumblemore having bad intentions for the main character and less so emphasizing competence. And that makes a poor antagonist.

Thats an opinion, not a fact. It may be your opinion (and mine) that the best way to deal with the problem was to kill the death eaters, but Dumbledore didn't believe that. It might seem unrealistically optimistic, but he thought that he could imprison the death eaters rather than kill them. He strived for the best case scenario (the least loss of life), and even though it's not what I would have done in his situation, I can understand the desire to try, even if it's unrealistic.

But again to the not killing Death Eaters part. If he had gone around killing them (or if any of the order members had, which they didn't until the final battle) they would have been no better than the Death Eaters themselves, which is not something you write in a book that started out as a childrens series. Also it would have been vigilantism. As someone who was Supreme Mugwup (whatever that may actually be) of the highest wizarding jury, I don't see him resonably doing that.

Examining the book series closer portrays Dumbledore as an idiot content to twiddle his thumbs and forget that Hogwarts is a school, not a place where he can work on his redemption projects (Draco), keep a teacher so horrible that he attempts to poison a child's pet for funsies, or set traps for Evil McWizard.

** as a person who rather dislikes Dumbledore, I'll try to explain why I view him as manipulative and terrible...

(1) Dumbledore knows full well that Harry is neglected and abused by the Dursleys, yet he leaves him there with the excuse of it being for his protection and to prevent him from struggling with the hardships of being a celebrity. sounds like bs to me, he could have put Harry under the protection of the fidelius or a myriad of other options /that don't involve abusing and neglecting a child/. and the whole "it will be better for Harry to grow up without all that fame" thing--that's a really convenient excuse, especially since Harry's newfound sense of belonging in the wizarding world makes him all the more manipulatable, after years of Dursley treatment.

(2) he purposefully withheld information from Harry so that Harry would keep doing what dumbledore wanted, and purposefully groomed him into a pawn willing to sacrifice himself to "save the world"

(3) he knew that he going to die in the Half Blood Prince and didn't tell Harry and oh yeah Harry WATCHED HIM DIE

(4) he locked Sirius up in Grimmauld Place after he was in Azkaban for 12 years, the place where Sirius was abused and escaped from as a child, and had him watch all of his colleagues in the Order actively hell while Sirius had to stew in feelings of worthlessness

(5) he lets Snape, notorious for abusing students, teach in Hogwarts so that he's closer to him

(6) didn't let Ms Figg be nice to him??

(7) didn't let Harry be prefect because he didn't want to be obvious with his favouritism when Gryffindor gets the house cup EVERY year bc of Harry

I can spend essays going through these points with evidence from the books, and if I wasn't on mobile I'd link a bunch of tumblr posts on the subject, but yeah.

*** Okay to you points, because some I understand and some not as much.

(1) Harry was not (physically) abused by the Durslesy. They didn't like him and the was neglected and the fact that he was living in a cupboard is fucked up but Dumbledore couldn't have known about that one before Harry's first year. If he could have reasonably known, tell me how. They are his closest blood relatives so even without the blood protection, leaving Harry with them would have been reasonable. That he left him with them after first year was a bad decicion but I still believe that Dumbledore never knew how far the Dursleys took their dislike of Harry.

(2) He withheld the prophecy from Harry and it lead to Sirius' death. A fact that he regretted. I will agree that he should have told Harry about it earlier but I also see why he didn't. Harry was 15. I wouldn't want to be the one to tell a 15-year-old he's going into a kill or be killed situation with a powerful dark lord. That does things to a child/teen. Still, Harry should have been told after Voldemort returned, I agree. I don't see how that was to groom Harry into anything. If anything we know how resistant Harry is to all forms of manipulation. Are you telling me Harry wouldn't have fought Voldemort if there was no Dumbledore?

(3) I totally agree here, that was shitty.

(4) What else should he have done with Sirius? (No this is a serious question. I've wondered what a better solution would have been)

(5) Again, what would have been a better solution? (again, serious question) Also, Snape is unfair and snide and an asshole but he doesn't abuse students. Fake Moody abused students. Show me one instance where Snape is abusive towards a student in a teaching setting and I'll shut up.

(6) Where is that ever said or implied? Ms Figg was as nice to him as she could be, being the strange, old catlady that she is.

(7) I think the explaination here was that Harry already had enough on his plate and, seriously, he did. Making Ron a prefect also might have had more to do with encouraging Ron and making him feel less in Harry's shadow than it had to do with Harry.

I disagree: Harry may be able to resist some forms of magical coercian, but he is pretty easy to manipulate, if one uses the right levers.

Heck, Draco in PS played on his loyalty to Ron to try to get him in trouble with the duel challenge. However, /Dumbledore/ did not use any of those levers.

***** Sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant to say that Harry wasn't /physically/ abused so that Dumbledore was not completely unreasonable in deciding to give him the blood protection rather than a happy childhood. I'd even argue that it was the right decicion from his point of view since the blood protection saved Harry's life in first year before Dumbledore could step in and again in fifth year when Voldemort tried to posess Harry. He certainly was neglected by the Dursleys in general and verbally abused by Vernon at least. I'm ignoring Dudley here since he was a child and wasn't taught any better but if we include Dudley then, yes he was physically abused, too. I just think that we have to take into account that the first two books, where most of the abuse happens, were childrens fantasy and the narrative of the lost and misstreated 'prince' who returns to his home kingdom is a popular theme there. (there is a rather interesting article about that, btw but I have been told it destroys childhoods of HP fans. It's called "Crowning the King" if you're interested) I imagine if JKR had had any idea of the response she'd get for the HP series, she would have written the Dursleys differently. We can see that in their later character development. But what would have been is not an argument and we have to go with what is actually in the book so yes, you're right. Harry did suffer abuse from his guardians.

**** i'll try to explain as best i can my thoughts, though i do think what you say is valid, but maybe a little too giving(? not sure what the right term is in english)

(1) i think it is a little ridiculous for Dumbledore to drop Harry on the door step and never think to check on him. even if he had no idea about his relationship with the Dursleys, never sending a single person-- harry was underweight, referred to as "freak" and "the boy" and kept in a cupboard. i don't think checking up on him is a huge expectation since Harry is so important. but if you view it as severe oversight maybe...

(2) I think yes if Harry was a normal child you could argue that withholding to protect him makes sense but this boy has been targeted by Voldemort since he was a baby. and i think that random violence and death is more traumatic than death with a reason; knowing why Voldemort did it is important for Harry imo. no it wouldnt be easy but it would be right, something dumbledore claimed to believe. also, by telling him and including him in the da and generally making Harry feel like he was part of a movement to stop Voldemort instead of having all the pressure on him and keeping him in the dark about certain things until the end i think would be better for Harry. and i think harry is very susceptible to manipulation until he overcomes it the hard way. which also could have been made easier if dumbledore put more effort into actually preparing him instead of making him just blindly trust him. it's important to remember that everything we know about the man is in Harry's perspective and he described dumbledore positively

(4) I'm sure he could have put him in a safe house elsewhere, disguised him and have him do overseas things, etc. kingsley shacklebolt wasn't going to catch him, so i think it was an act of disinterest in Sirius' feelings and past at a minimum by locking him up there

(5) dumbledore controlled snape not because of physical closeness but because of the lily situation. he could have put him anywhere and have had him monitored. being a complete asshole to children and picking on students is a form of abuse of power and it's absolutely not ok. hes not harry or nevilles classmate he is their superior and has so much power over them

(6) from hp wikia: "She made sure he didn't particularly enjoy his time with her, and took care never to reveal her heritage to either Harry or the Dursleys, to ensure that the Dursleys would not withdraw Harry from her care"-- she was in constant contact with dumbledore so he knew at minimum that the Dursleys didn't allow harry to enjoy being in her presence and went along with it

(7) yeah on second thought this is true

***** (1) Dumbledore is the headmaster of a school. That is what he is before all other things. I think we tend to forget that a lot. He is not child protective services or whatever magical equivalent exists. If I go with your argumet from point (6) than he /did/ check on Harry through Ms Figg. He cannot be blamed for neglecting him because even if he had just dropped Harry of there, that would have been all we could resonably expect from a school teacher, or even the leader of a rebelion that no longer existed (though I have no idea when the Order disbanded it must have been around that time). Also, the whole thing with the Dursleys calling him "freak" is fanon. Never happens in canon. I checked. Petunia calls her sister a freak, once in front of Harry and a few times in Snapes memories and Dudley calls Hogwarts Harry's "freak school" twice thoughout the series but the word is never actually adressed at Harry.

(2) Harry knows that there was /a/ reason why Voldemort targeted him and his family, Dumbledore tells him as much at the end of 1st year. He knows it wasn't random. Dumbledore just refuses to tell him exactly why, which I suppose was because JKR wanted something to make sure the sequel sells and also because, again, Harry was 11 and Voldemort wasn't back yet so it wasn't an active issue. Adults lie to children all the time, for their own protection and this is one of those cases. As I said before Harry should have been told at the beginning of 5th year, but not earlier. And yes of course, everything we know about all of the HP universe is filterd through Harry's eyes but with that argument we cannot trust anything anymore because Snape could have been less cruel, Hermione less smart and Molly less motherly, ect. Just because it's Harry's perception that shows us Dumbledore in a positive light doesn't mean it's not true.

(4) It's important to remember that Sirius wasn't actually imprisoned in that house. He could (and did) leave it at any time. He'd been on the run for two years befor that. He knew how not to get caught if he really wanted to get away, he would have. He stayed there, even though he hated it, because he wanted to be involved in what the Order did and because he wanted to be close to where Harry was. I'm sure if he had requested it, Dumbledore could have found a suitable overseas mission for him but the wizarding world is a very small one. It's reasonable to assume that Sirius Black was infamous enough that he would not have been save in any wizarding place in Europe and the war with Voldemort never branched that far (though we're going into the realm of my assumptions here). The situation with Sirius wasn't handled very well but putting that only on Dumbledore is a bit much. He had his hands full trying to keep the ministry out of Hogwarts and stopping Voldemort wherever he could.

(5) Dumbledore (in my eyes) is an idealist. He wanted for Snape to be redeemed (same as, lets face it, most of the fandom does since his history was revealed) and he wanted that redemption to involve Harry, Lily's son. Also Snape is a potions master and since the position just opened after Slughorn left it would have made sense to offer Snape a teaching post. He also needed to be close to Dumbledore to keep up his spy status for Voldemort. Voldemort had to believe Snape was still spying for him and what better position for that than in Hogwarts, where Dumbledore lives? I still agree that Snape is an utter git and that he should have been reigned in by Dumbledore more. His treatment of Harry was explainable, if cruel but his treatment of Neville was just plain horrible. Still, he knows his potions and I assume that is why Dumbledore let him stay (since there are apparently very few people capable of teaching potions. Dumbledore gets Slughorn from retirement rather than find a new teacher.)

(6) I don't trust the HP wikia anymore since I tried to figure out the respective time tables for Harry and co using it but let's assume that's true for the arguments sake. So Dumbledore knew that Harry didn't enjoy his life at the Dursleys as much as one would hope. Well we knew as much from book 6. He actually says as much. He knew Harry was unhappy but he judged Harry's happyness against his life and decided the blood protections were what was needed to keep him save. It was the wrong decicion, probably. Maybe. I'm not even sure if it was, seeing as the blood protection was what saved Harry from Quirrel at the end of book 1. We will probably never know because the blood protection and what it does exactly and what it depends on were never explained in detail.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the care and thoughtfulness you're putting into your comments, so thank you so much for that.

Having said that, I see things just slightly differently, so why not share, I guess. :)

(1) Mostly agree on this point, but merely adding that he knows very little of Harry's future /except/ for knowing or guessing very accurately about what Harry's scar means - that's Harry will have to die before Voldemort. I know a lot of people read this and think Dumbledore, like, shrugged, or something (who cares, it's just the life of a child!), I think Dumbledore emotionally distanced himself from Harry so that he could make a logical choice, not an emotional one.

(also just realized, somewhere else in this thread, someone said Dumbledore should have compromised Draco despite the threat on his life, to prevent accidental victims. Fair point, but how does that fit in with Manipulative Dumbledore compromising Harry to save the world? What is different between Harry and Draco? Why is Manipulative Dumbledore blamed for not sacrificing Draco, but for sacrificing Harry?)

Anyway, I think Dumbledore intended to stay emotionally distant from Harry, thus putting himself in a position where he didn't pay close enough attention. I don't remove all the blame from him, but I also don't think he's literally omniscient.

Dumbledore explains this himself. Of course all books are done so they can be entertaining, but also, his answer to Harry is the first instance of his main character arc,

#+begin_quote
  "I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young.”
#+end_quote

He was falling into his trap, he grew to care about Harry, and it affected his judgement. He began making mistakes, and one of those mistakes was not recognizing that although Harry was young, he was capable of handling the news much sooner than 15. Dumbledore's flaw, in my mind, was not in manipulating a young child to do whatever, but in attempting to protect him at all costs while knowing, deep down, that he can't, and that he shouldn't, that doing so would not only inevitably fail, but would result in thousands of deaths.

(5) I don't think Dumbledore is an idealist. I very much think he was a realist. But magic exists in his world, and things like love sacrifices exist, and things like sould breaking when you make Horcruxes, so in his world, being a realist might look very much like an idealist in our world, where there is no magic. In his world, being a good, enlightened person is magically tangible, because choices effect magic, and out ideas effect choices.

As for Snape, Dumbledore can't have known everything, but he also clearly didn't think he was a saint either. I think he just knew there were more important things going on in the world than, my gosh, a mean teacher. It's telling, too, how often Dumbledore defends Harry in front of Snape, but Snape refuses to change his view. Should Dumbledore fire him? Sure, but then we're back at wondering why Draco's life is okay to risk and not the thousands that would be killed if Snape were no longer in the position of spy.

******* You make some very valid points and I agree with much of what you'e saying. There is just one thing that I'm not sure I agree with. I don't think Dumbledore knew about the horcrux in Harry that early on. I always read the books in such a way that, while he was looking into Tom's past beforehand, he only ever came to think of horcruxes after Harry brought him the diary. Let's face it, horcruxes are a very obscure piece of dark magic and the jump from "Tom Riddle has done something to himself in the hope not to die" to "he split his soul into several pieces" is not an intuitive one. After Harry presented him with the destroyed diary, which had possessed Ginny and resisted her atempts to destroy it until Harry used a basilisk fang, that is when I think he activly began to think of horcruxes as a more then just a theoretical possibility. I do agree that he was trying to distance himself from Harry since early on, but I don't think it was because of the horcrux in Harry. I believe it was simply because the prophecy stated he had to die at Voldemort's hands of kill him himself. Harry was most likely to die at Voldemorts hand sooner rather than later because even if we now that Dumbledore doesn't put much stock into prophecies, Riddle did. He would hunt Harry down until either one of them was dead and I think Dumbledore tried to protect himself from the loss he would inevitably face when Harry died. And then Harry kept proving him wrong, simply by not dying. And Dumbledore began caring for the boy but he also figured out that Harry was most likely a horcrux himself so now he had another reason to keep himself emotionally distanced only, as you said, that didn't work out for him.

#+end_quote

I think this is the main point on where we differ, because I don't think Dumbledore is working under the idea that prophecies /have/ to come true.

#+begin_quote
  “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!.. ...Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecies has been fulfilled?” (Book 6, U.S. p. 509)
#+end_quote

In a super simple example, if Trelawney were to say in her prophecy voice, "Next Saturday, Hagrid will trip on a unicorn", Dumbledore would not necessarily think it will happen. However, if he sees that Hagrid is now keeping a unicorn in his yard for class this week and also sees that Hagrid is limping due to an acromantula bite, and is therefore less steady on his feet, and has also invited people over on Saturday for firewhiskey, then Dumbledore may look at the situation and think, "the scenario is ripe for Hagrid to trip on that unicorn on Saturday".

So I think Dumbledore isn't putting too much faith in the prophecy, but looking at things outside the prophecy, and if he happens to come to the same or similar conclusion the prophecy stated, then, well, will you look at that!

I also don't know what Dumbledore knew the night he saw Harry's scar for the first time. I think there is a range of what he could have known that fits with the story. But I think the range is him suspecting what it is, just has no proof, to knowing what it is for certain. I'm definitely more in the "he suspects what it is" boat.

/But/ that doesn't mean he knows Harry will have to /die/, because he doesn't know when Voldemort is coming back. So in my mind, Dumbledore knowing what Harry's scar is, as scary as that is, doesn't /necessarily/ destine Harry to death later. If Voldemort were to remain hidden for 200 years, then literally /nothing/ would have happened with Harry's scar, and he'd live a fully normal life with a scar on his head and then die normally. Sucks for the people in later generations, though, when Voldemort finally does return, though. But Dumbledore, suspicious as I think he was of what Harry's scar meant, doesn't necessarily mean anything will happen with it.

#+begin_quote
  He would hunt Harry down until either one of them was dead and I think Dumbledore tried to protect himself from the loss he would inevitably face when Harry died
#+end_quote

Firstly, don't mean to be negative, it's sooo refreshing talking about Dumbledore with you, and I'm so glad we have similar ideas. Howevre, I disagree with this point, because I think Dumbledore makes it clear that caring for Harry was a flaw, not because he wanted to protect his own heartache, but because it would ruin his plan to defeat Voldemort, and if his plans to defeat Voldemort were ruined he would be responsible for the deaths of thousands.

I think we have similar ideas about Dumbledore altogether, only differ on the timeline, haha!

******* Mmm, let's see Snape's history as a spy.

War: Voldemort's winning, Snape turns and Voldemort's still winning.

Voldemort's death to 1993: Snape has a nice, cushy job and proves that he should never have been given power over anything, ever. In First Year, he saves Harry's life, but I'd argue that as a teacher and an authority figure acting as a substitute to a parent, that's his actual goddamn job. In second year, he gets Draco to set a snake on Harry and persecutes him at every turn. In third, we learn that Neville's worst fear isn't the monster that tortured his parents but Snape, Snape attempts to poison Trevor, and then starts foaming at the mouth when he loses his chance at fame and glory via Order of Merlin.

Fourth: Yeah, no.

Fifth: Voldemort's winning.

Sixth: Voldemort's winning, Snape can't control Draco, end result is Death Eaters invading Hogwarts.

Seventh: Simply carrying out Dumbledore's orders, and then gets his throat torn open by Nagini. Why Voldemort didn't just kill him or stick around to make sure he's dead is anyone's guess.

Snape isn't a spy, he's Dumbledore's glorified screwdriver.

His actual deeds in the seventh book mostly revolve on Dumbledore still pulling his strings from beyond the grave.

Admittedly, Snape's spying isn't helped by the fact that he's a thoroughly unpleasant git that nobody trusts, and that the Order of the Phoenix is 10% competent fighters and 90% people who think the sun shines out of Dumbledore's ass but have virtually nothing to contribute. Compare Arthur and Kingsley. Kingsley could successfully blend in with the muggle PM's detail, Arthur is a blithering twit who still can't pronounce electricity.

Totally fair point about Snape having another position. Hagrid had a unique position, after all, and Dumbledore kept Trelawney at the school despite not being a professor anymore when Umbridge fired her. Snape was a horrible to Harry, but it's possible he was the worst to only our main characters and perfectly fine with Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and students in general. Not defending his actions against our main characters, but to say he was a horrible teacher suggests he can't teach, and he seems to take teaching Potions pretty seriously and was most likely fine until the year we are introduced to him, the first year he has to interact with Harry. It's not nothing that McGonagall has a lot of respect for him (up until she thinks he killed Dumbledore in cold blood anyway).

Also, ignoring the terrible bullying Snape inflicts, he tortures Neville psychologically via Trevor in Book 3 and dismisses the prank on an insecure Hermione with a contemptuous "I see no difference". It's made even worse that he's a teacher who gleefully taunts and mocks an orphan's father in front the orphan's face, and Snape is the reason the orphan is parentless.

As for Snape's role in Book 6, he can't control Draco. He's never actually shown to actually discipline his charges; Slytherins aren't hated because everyone else are huge jerks, they're hated they're absolute assholes, a large amount are Voldemort Youth, and because almost every adult Slytherin we meet is a huge ass. Hell, this leads to an army of Death Eaters storming a school full of children.

As for Dumbledore...he's also ousted in Book 2, in 3 he does diddly squat about the Dementors. The problem with the whole 'corrupt government' thing is that Dumbledore did literally nothing to curtail it. He's the most powerful wizard ever, the most respected wizard ever, and the head of an international body, but then he's either so terrified of mismanaging power or so bad at actually consolidating it that some fat ostrich neutralizes him and a sadist tortures his students, only he's such an imposing figure that not a single student is willing to tell him about Umbridge's quills. Hell, he's not the only one, nobody went to Minerva either, but that's fairly in-character since Minnie is terrible at being a decent parental figure to her wards.

Dumbledore is head of the ICW and the Wizengamot. He was the only man that Voldemort feared. He sat on and is implied to be chief of the Judiciary. He's the Headmaster of the the most prestigious school in Britain. Fudge can't wipe his arse without asking for Dumbledore's advice. And yet we don't actually see anything being done to curtail the eventual probability of Voldemort's return. In fact, the dude with all the power does diddly squat when a pompous little upstart like Lucius has him thrown out of Hogwarts. Voldemort's lackeys still hold power in the ministry, the racist ideology that gave Voldemort an army is still prominent, and Dumbledore doesn't seem inclined to do a thing despite being practically Merlin the Second.

I suppose some blame lies with Rowling turning every adult into a two-bit caricature so a plucky hero could save the world from the Evil Overlord with the Villain Ball taped to his forehead.

Also, /yes/. He thinks he can control Draco and can't. That /is/ bad, that Draco got farther than anyone expected him to. I'm not sure what point your making. Are you saying he should have realized Draco was lying to him? Should have realized how good Draco was at Occlumency, even though it's very nature makes it hard to tell what's being kept from you (how else did Voldemort not realize Snape was using Occlumency against him?)? That if Snape and Dumbledore were just /better/ there wouldn't have been a war because it's their fault for not catching things sooner?

Dumbledore does do diddley squat about the Dementors. Fudge wanted them in the school, Dumbledore refused. Hogwarts is his jurisdiction. You are mistaken when you say Dumbledore is the most powerful. You believe it because the kids think he is, but in reality, he is a principal at a school on a lot of government boards, which a higher corrupt power removed him from /so that/ he no longer has the power you insist he has. It is far too simplistic to expect one person to be able to just... convince the world he's right. What a boring book, and so unrealistic. He has no power to override a corrupt government and implement his ideas over Hogsmeade. If you insist it makes sense that Dumbledore is all-powerful and can override his own government on his every whim, then that will be enough proof that I should stop responding to you.

He's literally holding on to his Headmastership, which shows that he's all kinds of garbage at actually using any kind of power for good or ill. I'll repeat it again, the most powerful, influential and politically powerful wizard in Europe has his jobs stripped from him in less than two months by Cornelius bloody Fudge.

It's nice and all that you think he can't convince the world or something, but in canon Voldemort returned and conquered magical Britain in less than two years. The groundwork was already put in place, with his minions holding official jobs - Lucius is simply the most obvious - which shows that Dumbledore did nothing to actually prevent it.

As for Malfoy, three strikes - Ron, Katie, Rosmerta. Then came the Death Eaters, but everyone was holding the Idiot Ball in that book. Hermione thinks that the the poster boy for Voldemort Youth isn't working for Voldemort, Harry not pointing out that Draco was about to attack with an Unforgivable or offering a memory, Dumbledore and his trips down memory lane that ultimately did little other than serve as exposition for Voldemort's backstory, etc.

As for the racism, the problem is that this is the same attitude that gave Voldemort his army. Less than thirteen years after Voldemort went poof, and Malfoy can swagger around and hurl slurs and death threats. This is less nigger/oreo/chink/uncle Tom/raghead and more children of Nazis and ex-Nazis hurling racist epithets at Jews while gloating about the Fuhrer's return while the authorities do nothing. Slytherin House is still reviled and its members seem to revel in it. Not a single Slytherin calls out Malfoy on his slurs, every single one of the teen Snakes are comfortable enough with the entire racist terminology.

"It is our choices, that make us who we truly are, far more than our abilities".

I also think Dumbledore underestimated Harry, he was a fool and tricked himself into thinking Harry was too young, too innocent, and yet Harry /had/ proved himself.

He used what he knew: The battering ram as you call it worked before when Crouch Jr taught Harry to throw of the imperius curse, something Snape said was simmilar to resisting Legilimency. From his point of view, throwing Legilimency at Harry until he learned might have been the best option. He didn't factor in that Harry respected fake-Moody and hated Snape. Harry didn't aply himself to the Occlumency lessons half as much as he did to the Imperius lessons the year before partially just to spite Snape. That was stupid of him but he was 15. Teenagers are stupid. I'm not saying that Snape did good here. I'm not denying that he hates Harry for a metric shit ton of reasons, most of which are stupid.

** some will argue that he refused being MoM because headmaster offer more influence on the minds of young wizards as proven by harry trusting him even if he acted like shit for all his life.

and evil or not all the mistakes he made should make harry at least hate him.

*** maybe not hate him, but I've never thought Harry looking up to the guy that dropped him on the Dursley's doorstep was reasonable. Humans don't act like that.

**** Harry obviously realized that the Dursleys, being his closest blood relatives and all, would have been the ones he'd end up with since he didn't have any godparents or other family, at least not to his knowledge. Even if it was Dumbledore who dropped him of there, can you honestly tell me that Harry wouldn't have gone to the Dursleys if he hadn't?

He could have put him anywhere, though, couldn't he? No one really knew who he lived with.

Put him somewhere secure and give him parental figures to watch over him. Tell the government that he's with family and they would believe him. He's Dumbledore. He can do no wrong. Right?

My problem with Dumbledore is that even though he's magically powerful and has great political clout, he doesn't use it. He's so afraid of slipping and trying to take over the world again that he's paralyzed.

Yes, hiding Harry with someone who wasn't family was probably illegal. But it was the right thing to do. He should have listened to McGonagall's concerns but he didn't.

Smushing Lucius Malfoy into paste after /Chamber of Secrets/ would have been illegal, but it would have been right. This man tried to kill basically everyone in the school and got away with it.

Yes, it would be illegal. Yes, it could be a slippery slope. He needed to get over the fear of going Big Bad and do a job that no one else was willing to do.
