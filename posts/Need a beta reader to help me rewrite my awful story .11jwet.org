** This is the first sentence of your first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting in the gryffindoor common room sitting by the fire the night after the victory.
#+end_quote

- Gryffindor is spelled with only one 'o'
- Gryffindor should be capitalized because it's a proper noun.\\
- The second instance of the word 'sitting' is completely unnecessary---we already know that they are sitting.
- I'm less sure about this one, but I think you should have a comma before "the night after the victory", as I believe it's a dependent clause.

Revised sentence:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting in the Gryffindor common room by the fire, the night after the victory.
#+end_quote

That's three grammar mistakes and a spelling error in your *very first sentence*. Furthermore, it's obvious that you haven't even bothered to put your work through a spell checker. Here's a helpful list of misspellings in your first chapter:

| Word         | Your Spelling |
|--------------+---------------|
| finally      | finaly        |
| headmistress | headmistriss  |
| wouldn't     | wouden't      |
| immediately  | immediatly    |
| tomorrow     | tommorow      |

Spell check. Use it. And while I'm pointing out misspellings, you might also want to spell the characters names right:

| Name                 | Your Spelling        |
|----------------------+----------------------|
| Hermione             | Hermionie            |
| Kingsley Shacklebolt | Kinglsey Shacklebolt |
| McGonagall           | Mcgonagall           |

Yes, capitalization in names matters, so I'm counting "Mcgonagall" as a misspelling. Although to be fair, you got it right one time out of three.

--------------

All this goes to show that you are putting basically zero effort into your own story. You are asking other people to put in work that you are unwilling to do yourself. Not /unable/, but *unwilling*. This is why I won't help you. And for Merlin's sake, put your offal through a spellchecker before you put it on the internet.

If you had read my whole comment, you probably would have seen:

#+begin_quote
  You are asking other people to put in work that you are unwilling to do yourself. Not unable, but unwilling. This is why I won't help you.
#+end_quote

I think it's kind of ironic how you're offering to beta read a story, but your comment is evidence of you not reading something carefully. Also, there is no circumstance in the English language, where "idea's" is correct. You shouldn't have an apostrophe there. But I'll give you a bonus upvote if can you can make a situation where "Idea's" is grammatically correct.
