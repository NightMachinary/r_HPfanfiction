Looking for stories where Harry pretends to be bad in front of his friends or family for some reason. (idk, like making Death Eaters think he's Voldemort or something) Harry acting like Voldemort or Voldemort's right-hand man or Death Eater is very welcome. If Sirius, Remus, and everyone overreacts really badly to it then all the better. Evil!Harry (the real deal) is okay too. Thank you!


** I remember reading a fic where young Harry successfully impersonated Voldemort. Don't remember the name.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.
