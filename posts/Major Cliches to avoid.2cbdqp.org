** Really, there's very few things in fandom that isn't already a cliche. There even exists cliches /within/ cliches. Eg. A time traveling Harry will almost always willfully disregard Dumbledore.

The most important thing you want to do to avoid a cliche is to write believable characters. There's very little in fandom that hasn't been written already at this point. All of the plots and twists and turns in your head have most likely been done.

Make believable characters. Flesh them out so they're not just caricatures of their canon counterparts. People get hooked in on the plot and the premise. They stay because of your characters.

** My advice is write what you want your story to be. I recently started a HP fanfic because no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find the perfect fanfic out there. Why? Because my taste is slightly different than anyone else's.

Since my advice above wasn't exactly asked for, I will also answer your question as best I can. Cliches that I don't like, and that I have seen a lot are:

- Evil Dumbledore
- Traitorous Hermione
- All powerful Harry
- Anything that is the exact opposite of cannon. (Sure, Draco can be a decent guy, but I don't like it when he suddenly becomes to hero)

Last, there are areas you can explore that haven't been written about as much. The Marauders era is one in particular where I find there to be a lack of good fanfiction. Good luck.

** A few tired clichés that will send many people packing (myself included):

- Mustache-twirling, melodramatically evil Dumbledore
- Magical cores. Just... no.
- Shallow characterization (e.g., Draco can't think of anything wittier to say than, "Well, well, well, if it isn't Potty, Weasel, and the Mudblood...")
- Will-reading angst at Gringotts
- Lengthy shopping trips. Bonus points for magical tattoos or piercings
- Harry's angry at everyone all the time and suddenly incapable of empathy or forgiveness
- One day, everyone wakes up and realizes they are gay
- Over the top bashing of Molly, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Dumbledore, whoever
- Harry (and possibly his friends) suddenly deciding to learn the Animagus transformation and adopting lame-ass Marauder nicknames
- Endless Fred/George ping-pong speech (which they do all of once in canon)
- Harry inheriting multiple peerage titles and more money than the GDP of the UK
- Insistence that everyone call one other 'Lord' and 'Lady'
- Excessive physical abuse by the Dursleys
- Harry-Stu or Ginny-Sue

**** The issue with magical cores is, as [[/u/denarii]] notes, they are a tawdry way of putting limits on magic and providing a cheap excuse for an author's amping Harry up to eleven. They don't exist in canon and don't need to exist.

Magic is hard. The best analogy I've heard for canon HP magic is as described by [[/u/Taure]] elsewhere (DLP): Magic is like piano. You don't have a finite 'core' of piano, a set amount of piano that you can use, after which you have to refill your piano 'core.' You don't have people born with the ability to play piano 100x better than the average person from the get-go simply because they have a big piano core. No, the virtuosos (think Voldemort or Dumbledore) work at it obsessively, learning, over endless hours (typically 8 to 10 hours a day of practice for a decade-plus), to express their natural gifts and perform at the highest level of competency, doing things with their art that leave the average person stunned and awed.

Similarly with magic. Harry has a gift for certain types of magic in canon (specifically, those with an emotive component, as he very definitely has a strong will), but it's not because of his bigger magical p̶e̶n̶i̶s̶ core.

Granted, some very good stories have been written over the years with the artifice of magical cores, but nowadays they seem (to me, at least) tired and cliché, a cheap shortcut rather than a rationalization. If at all possible, it's best for a beginning author to avoid them.

***** The lake Voldemort hid his locket in had a boat trap that would only carry one wizard to the center of the lake. Dumbledore says explicitly that Harry wouldn't even register with it compared to Dumbledore's level of magical presence, so it was safe for them both to cross.

There is a magical level a person has, in canon, and Harry at 16 was still a shrimp who didn't rate at all. Magical ability can be argued around, but not what it means to be an adult with full adult magical power. Cores are just a word, and JKR obviously had something in mind like them, as magical adults are meant to be more than kids in some magic-based way.

Ignoring magical power differences is just as much fanon as magical cores. If Dumbledore had only said "it checks for adults," that would explain things. But that isn't what JKR /wrote/:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the */amount of magical power/* that crossed his lake."

  ...

  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that */your powers/* will register compared to mine."

(from [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2a0il4/in_defense_of_magical_cores/ciqle8c][this discussion]] about magical cores, emphasis mine)

I need an online tattoo of this.

Look, I know magical cores are in some of the worst fics in existence, but something like them are canon in all but name and exact description. Note that, unlike most magical cores, this raises good world-building questions.

It suggests with "unqualified" that perhaps using magic for a certain amount of time or studying it to a certain extent also a affects this measure of a magical person's "power", not just reaching your 18th year as a magical person. Harry isn't /just/ too young, he's too much of a slacker to have leveled up that much by himself, /Headmaster/ Dumbledore subtally and gently hints to the Gryffindor jock.

Wonder if Hermione would have "fit" on that boat with Dumbledore? She was 17 at the time and used a lot more magic, and a lot more casually. Would Dumbledore at 16 have been "too magically powerful"? Did Voldemort set the trap up based on his own magical power at around the time he made the Diary Horcrux, suggesting that 16-17 year old Voldemort would not have fit on the boat with Dumbledore?

Lots of interesting possibilities there that disappear if you assume (incorrectly) that magic is /only/ a skill, like playing the piano. That makes magic less magic, in fact, as it removes a unique quality that doesn't exist in real world skills.

The core thesis relies on an interpretation of hints dropped by Dumbledore, a character who continually manipulates and speaks half-truths to Harry throughout the series and whose words in this case could as easily be interpreted as a shorthand for the adult/underage Wizard distinction (which /is/ canon). This evidence is rather thin.

Arguably the biggest counterargument to cores (or whatever equivalent you might propose) is that not once in any of the seven books do we see someone "run out" of magic or have a spell fail because the Witch or Wizard lacked sufficient magic in their core to cast it. We never see any instance of a Witch or Wizard suffering from magical fatigue from casting too much and draining their magical capacitor bank dry. Mental or physical fatigue? Sure. We see that in spades--Harry's Patronus lessons with Lupin, his Occlumency lessons with Snape, and the DA meetings all are cases in point. But magical fatigue? Never. Nor do we ever hear Hermione natter on about limited magic in one's core/battery/capacitor/mojo-field, and this purportedly fundamental aspect of magic. Nor do we ever see wizards' magic quantified in any meaningful fashion, save categorically (Squib vs. Wizard vs. Muggle or adult vs. underage Wizard).

You'd think that if having a finite mana-battery that fuels spells and needs recharging were so fundamental to the HP magical system, then we might see canon evidence. But we don't. The simplest explanation is that it's unnecessary. "Powerful Wizard" could be read in the same sense as "virtuosic pianist" and it'd change nothing in the books.

With respect to the OP, after reading a few too many wretched fanfiction tales in which cores are used as a crutch to amp their favorite character(s) to eleven (Harry, Hermione, and Neville being the most common recipients of the plus-ups), cores seem to my eyes to be a fanon cliché that novice authors should avoid, as they tend to cheapen everything. Harry isn't strong because of his indomitable will forged in adversity, but because the right niggy-niggy swam up his Mum's hoo-hah, making him ultra-mega, able to cast spells with nary a thought. Hermione isn't a great Witch because of her steadfast dedication to her craft, but because she just happened to be born with more magical Midi-clorians. Meh. Nine times out of ten, it's just leads to lazy and uninspired writing.

No, it doesn't. Please don't spread misinformation like this. You are reading your own obvious and self-proclaimed prejudice into my story, not reading what was written. Just the same as with canon as written.

The only characters in /Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ I suggest are special in that regard are Hermione, Dumbledore, and Voldemort (and, I guess, historically Merlin). Harry has the opposite problem for almost the entire story, sort of, and only offhandedly thought he was unusual in that way himself before his little accident. Some of Harry's DA/DoM friends are said to be magically strong, but not because of their cores. There is no measuring contest there, just Harry's memories of his friends and his opinions.

In my story, Hermione is said, by her own second-hand report, to be as well-developed in that way as an adult at the age of eleven -- which is commented on as very unusual by third-parties. None of her dark future powers are based on that fact, though -- that isn't ever even suggested, just that she had always been powerful and practiced a lot without getting tired. It is clearly stated she made dark pacts and gained unnatural powers beyond normal magicals as an adult. She was scary in the dark future because of that and her obsessive drive, not some outsized core issues.

"Outsized cores" are not something that drive my story or bring my characters victory over their challenges, nor is it similar in other ways to the fics that you so pan in your post. Except that I use your trigger phrase, "magical cores." In fact, no plot point of mine has ever hung on magical core sizing winning the day. So I don't see why I'd support the idea that they were canon, other than the fact that I see limits of some kind for magic as being necessary for good storytelling.

Dumbledore didn't just give hints in book six, he basically had the last word on how magical power worked. The boat was based on magical power, which Voldemort considered important. Voldemort underestimates people who are magically weaker than him. Like Muggles, house elves, and children. So Dumbledore and Harry didn't use magic. They used teamwork, bravery, and sacrifice. Message received. Then Snape kills Dumbledore. After that, no adults explain anything about magic ever again.

JKR wasn't interested in making a detailed magical system, because that wasn't what the story was about. But there needs to be a logical reason why magic isn't used like it is free and effortless, compared to how tiring waving a stick around and chanting usually is. Otherwise, it would be used differently than in canon.

Dumbledore +lies+ manipulates is a terrible argument against there being some kind of rational magical power system, with logical limits.

Nor does anyone take a piss. But we still logically have to assume such was happening to the primary characters on a regular basis, but in non-plot-interesting ways.

More to the point, we don't see anyone do anything that belies the idea that there are limits that define magical behavior. Running around constantly casting spells would be good proof that there were few if any limits. The lack of magic use in everyday life (even if not in the corridors) in canon is, in fact, the best argument that there are /strict/ limits on magic.

Nor do we hear about Hermione nattering on about menstruating, though that surely happened as well. You can't define these canon elements from their absence when they never mattered in the first place to the story. No one excluded magical cores from a detailed lecture on magic, because it was never written in the first place.

Not having detailed canon discussion of something that is a new focus for a story going in a different direction from JKR's works is merely logical. They don't talk about magical power levels when Harry is tired from Occlumency lessons, but Hermione also doesn't go around talking about ATP and caloric intake when Harry is tired from playing Quidditch.

If, like JKR, you aren't writing a story where you can /change/ your magical power (other than possibly dark magic), why would school children bring it up? In a story where someone isn't able to /change/ anything about their genetic muscle fiber group makeup, it also wouldn't make sense for teenagers to bring it up. Which they usually don't, in real life. They just try out for the high school sports team and hope to make it.

JKR wasn't interested in making a detailed magical system, because that wasn't what the story was about. But there needs to be a logical reason why magic isn't used like it is free and effortless. Otherwise, it would be used differently than in canon. Not-magical-cores isn't an answer. JKR doesn't give one because she never solves a problem in her stories by showing details of magical education, or even really of spell use itself, excluding possibly the first year's troll. Not even the patronus is really /explained/ -- it has even /fewer/ described magical elements and mechanics than the levitation spell, and eventually works even more unexpectedly in a clutch situation.

If someone wants to write a story that is actually about people using magic, they need to do a lot /better/ than JKR did explaining how it actually works.

*tl;dr Reading is fundamental. Teens in HP don't gossip about physical fitness, so why would they with magical fitness. Canon Dumbledore isn't a lying manipulator. The idea that magic is untouchable by logic or limits is the /real/ major cliche to avoid.*

This logic, which boils down to: "we don't see unlimited casting in canon; therefore, a person's magic must be finite" is faulty.

Consider real life. We don't see unlimited writing either, but there are no "strict limits" on the amount one can hope to pen, no "core" of words that an author exhausts. So why don't most writers plop their Cheetos-expanded posteriors in front their computers and spew heaps of prose for ten hours a day? I mean, it's just keystrokes, hardly physically strenuous. According to your magical core logic, there must necessarily be a fundamental limitation, a "core" that is exhausted in the act of writing, which is ludicrous.

Writing is a hard task. Activities that are mentally difficult are ones that few can do at a high level for extended periods of time. Take whatever such activity you want--writing, piano, theoretical physics--it really doesn't matter. These things are inherently fatiguing and therefore self-limiting. My argument is that it is the same with magic, which we know from canon is hard. That magic is not spammed 24/7 does not necessarily lead to the existence of magical Pez dispensers. Rather, it could be that magic is just hard enough that casting a spell is simply not worth the bother a lot of the time, which is why people don't barf out spells without breaks. This is a perfectly serviceable limitation on HP magic, one that's been used elsewhere in fantasy literature. (For example, it's the one Lev Grossman uses in his /Magicians/ series.)

** - Character bashing: Ron/Ginny/Molly are selfish, evil, and use potions. Snape is an idiot and pure evil. Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort. Hermione is a traitor. The Marauders were all stupid and violent thugs. And so on.

- super!Harry: Harry is a more powerful wizard than people over twice his age, and he is a match for Voldemort who has spent decades doing whatever unholy dark things to strengthen himself, or Dumbledore with his superior talent and the elder wand.

- Things are suddenly easy to learn: Occlumency is a /rare/ talent, and near impossible to master... otherwise it would be a common talent, because people would want to protect their minds. Spell invention is /hard/. Otherwise Hermione would have been doing it all the time. Animagi transformations take years to master. The Marauders were very talented and determined. Snape was a freak of nature that way. Harry's only real talents were DADA and Quidditch.

- Snape is suddenly not a brilliant actor. So good, even Dumbledore was surprised by his depth of feelings concerning Lily, and by his willingness to return to spying - and he was the man who knew him best. He was obsessively determined to see Voldemort die, and students could not have found him out by accident.

- Snape is surprisingly not a bastard: If that's who he really is or just his adopted persona, we'll never know... and it does not matter. He is not nice, and during the Hogwarts years it is a safe bet that he will probably never be nice. He's obsessive, vindictive, and "somewhat cruel" (the only characters in canon JKR called "cruel" without reservation are the Weasley twins).

- Draco is nice! Wrong. He's spoiled, arrogant, /sincerely racist/, and believes the world should cater his every whim. Lucius Malfoy is slime. The only positive thing about him is that he cares for his family. Narcissa Malfoy we know very little about.

- Sirius Black post Azkaban is A-OK: Well, maybe not Snape-level angstworthy levels of damaged, but he's broken. He is not above lying to Harry or twisting the truth in order to make the Marauders days and rivalry with Snape seem a glorious battle of good vs. evil.

- Sirius/Snape/Remus romance with someone under 20: Despite all three having good cases for them being emotionally stunted (Remus enough to run from his pregnant wife)... there is no way a partner that young would be able to be on the same page as they are.

- Voldemort in a romantic setting: First of all, eww. Second of all, you know what they say about men's noses? That might explain why he's so vicious. Third, it's canon that he doesn't understand romance / love / etc.

CPR is easy to learn -- a four hour course can certify you for AED (automated external defibrillator) operation and heartsaver CPR. Most people don't even try. People generally want their loved ones to live.

DADA is the magical self-defense class, and they take it seriously, and as we saw in the Harry/Snape duel in the end of HBP, occlumency is critical for self defense - Harry could square off against most DEs, while Snape casually wiped the floor with him without attacking or even bothering to stop talking.

Also, how useful is Legillimency? It requires keeping eye contact with the target, apparently, which isn't easy in combat situations. So it's more of a Defense Against Intrigue or Defense Against Interrogation skill than a Defense Against the Dark Arts skill. Appropriate for Aurors and politicians, but no more useful for most people than the ability to distinguish which poison has been applied to one's wine by color and bouquet.

You become above the law, and no secret will ever be safe. Don't get me started on sports, gambling and basically everything that involves a competition of sorts.

It doesn't matter if only a few know it, occlumency suddenly seems like a very good idea for self-preservation.

******* My headcanon is that Occlumency is, in fact, very difficult and /traumatic/ to learn and can only be taught by a skilled Legilimens.

Snape wasn't just being sadistic with the way he taught Harry: any qualia (thought, sensation, emotion, memory) that an Occlumens can't handle being pushed into their head is a way for a Legilimens to breach the Occlumency. Therefore, a student of Occlumency must be trained to disassociate from qualia whose terribleness is only limited by the imagination and the stomach of the attacking Legilimens. I'd go as far as to say that successful Occlumency training can cause PTSD and permanent personality changes: none of the Occlumenses we see are exemplars of mental health. This also implies that the quality of Occlumency training is limited, in part, by how good a Legilimens the instructor is.

Speaking of which, the good news are that while almost any wizard can cast /Legilimens/, effective use of Legilimency is also very, very hard. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads. Interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention /lots/ of practice.

Using it in real-time to help in combat is something only a handful of people alive at a given time can do, especially since it needs to be done wandlessly. (My headcanon is that Legilimency is easier to do wandlessly than most spells, though.) Not only that, a basic Shield Charm blocks it.

This explains why, on the one hand, almost nobody learns Occlumency, but, on the other hand, almost everybody's minds are safe almost all the time.

******** My belief is that the best description of Occlumency is in A Difference in the Family... though that shows an extreme case of it. I'd say that it's a chicken and egg thing - people with PTSD or trauma that would cause them to want to dissociate themselves from their emotions would have a better chance at learning Occlumency. Harry was the exact opposite, he lived off his emotions, and for him that would be the most unnatural thing in the world.

Snape IMO when teaching was giving Harry practice against Voldemort, not the finer details. As we know from the nightmares, Voldemort had a heavy hand with Legilimency, and Snape wanted Harry to be able to fend that off. It's like preparing for a one mile run: the best way to prepare is to run a mile plenty of times, not running eight miles or sprinting over and over again.

I'm not sure that wandless Legilimency is easy. Wandless magic is super advanced stuff, that not even all the teachers at Hogwarts can pull off - and they are some of the most powerful and skilled witches and wizards in the world. I'd think that Legilimens is classic Dark Arts stuff - allowed legally only to healers and aurors. Though I don't think it would be particularly easy, as you would have to have a certain understanding of the human mind in order to make it work (magic requires specific intent, not only wand movement and verbalization).

I had simplified it a bit. To elaborate, my headcanon is that the Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a mental channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster, allowing the caster to send qualia at the target and conveying qualia that arise in response back to the caster.

Eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal".

That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts.

A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

All in all, The Santi's /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ gets most of the credit for my Legiclumency headcanon (though mine has difficulty of both upped by a lot relative to that fic), just as it became my headcanon for Durmstrang.

********** Fair enough. I think Occlumency at it's base is a kind of magical dissociative disorder that can be controlled. Legilimency would be the other side of things: magical reading of body language, expressions and the such... only with direct access to the nervous system. To decipher it you need similar experiences, and be naturally observant. Voldemort, Dumbledore and Snape fit all these criteria, which is why they are the top tier at the art... though Voldemort has a blind spot when it comes to care/love, which would make him the weaker of the three at it (though only in very specific circumstances).

Anyways, I'll recommend my second favorite fic again ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]]) just in case. It explains the darker side of Occlumency like no other (Dumbledore tries to help Snape alleviate the damage it causes from his second year onwards, but only succeeds up to a point).

That would mean politics, finance, military, research, and so on. Otherwise, someone could just rife through their brains, then obliviate them - security compromised and no one the wiser for it.

****** As much as I have mixed feelings about HPMOR, the author makes a good point: you can't make Harry a Jedi without giving Voldemort a Death Star. The balance needs to be kept.

Also, if you want to keep to realism, there are very few people who have a ridiculous talent for something. Actually, the only three known to exist are mathematics, music and memory. It requires approximately 10000 hours of practice to master a subject, meaning getting to your full capacity. That is the source of the saying "old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance" - Harry may have been freakishly good at DADA, but Snape wiped the floor with Harry, not taking a pause from talking or casually walking towards him. The only reason Voldemort lost was a careful plot by Dumbledore and the fact that he was arrogant enough to make his battles with Harry a contest of will rather than skill.

If you're going that route:

- Voldemort may be arrogant, crazy, whatever... but he's not stupid. And his raw power is unmatched except by Dumbledore with the elder wand.

- A trillion familiars (actually, even two) is too much.

- Hermione may be very smart, but she has her weak points. She doesn't have Harry's talent for DADA, nor Snape's skill with potions or spell invention... etc.

- Harry was only extraordinarily talented in DADA and flying on a broom. Perhaps he would have found another skill or two to excel at, but the skills for each class are different. I'd think that Arithmancy and Ancient Runes are kind of "theoretical knowledge" courses that might help tie things together, but as Harry never took those in canon, we may never know.

- You want Harry to be better than everyone? That's a load of hard work. There are no shortcuts for everything, otherwise, rich purebloods would always be the best students because they have an unfair advantage as to learning them from family. Talent will only get you so far, and the same goes for genius. To be way ahead of everyone? A time turner would help.

- Girl-who-lived stories are complex, because the dynamics change. Snape obviously will not react the same (choose to ignore? be slightly less of a git? be equally unfair as he is to other students?), and that causes a lot of changes. Hermione always respected Snape, so now she might be even more sure about it. Ron? Don't know. Neville will still be a lightning rod of hatred though. If she looks like Lily, will that help Snape let go of his obsession? If so, what does that mean for his role as a spy? The ripple effect would be huge. Other teachers would also treat a girl differently than a boy. McGonagall automatically assumed Harry/Ron/Hermione were the new Marauders, doubtlessly because Harry looked so much like James - would be quicker to accept a girl, probably.

Totally agree on everything you said except this. Even the principle is sound, but in this case, I have another thought;

Increasing the skills of the Harry replacement doesn't require increased abilities in the opposition if the goals are more ambitious. Canon is the story of an average bloke with a good heart being juggled by forces well beyond his understanding in order to end an unbalancing force in the world. Perfectly fine in that case for the end to be a deus-ex/sacrifice play/The bad guy loses because he didn't realize he was trapped in a heroic saga.

If Miss Harry v.2 takes on a heavier burden- not just to act as the dutch boy plugging a leak of evil getting in everyone's basements but instead to proactively seek to repair the weakness that leads to abuses of power, then the 'villain' of the work has been expanded in scope without having to expand their capabilities.

Why do I bring it up? Too many stories seem to go for adding magic without leveraging all the capabilities of 'typical magic' we're shown in canon. It's like when bad writers give Harry a billion Galleons- he already had money to burn and never used it, so why are you giving him more?

********* 'Repairing the weaknesses' depends on which weaknesses you're interested in writing about, but in my head-canon, much of the problem in how the wizarding world operates is that the lawmakers aren't held accountable for their legislation and most of public opinion is guided by Rita Skeeter and her boss, Barnabus 'I keep the Galleons from bribes in my-' Cuffe.

There's also the societal half-hearted efforts at education; sure, the kids are trained how to keep their magic under control, but then there's almost nothing teaching them what they should do with it, and so they're never expected to be anything more than quirky West country folk each with their own sonic screwdriver to play with. Abusing the weak doesn't even require hatred- just boredom and lack of guidance.

That's one view of it. The point I was making is that Harry never wanted to have influence, so he ditched every chance to say something meaningful when in the spotlight. A focused and motivated protagonist could do so much more, fight so many other worthy battles along the way.

*** Not trying to argue/bash/offend, just offering a contrasting opinion.

I'm going to disagree with you about non-canon pairings being "a stain on our fandom" that new writers should "avoid at all costs." I'm not interested in reading an addition to JK Rowling's stories; I read fanfiction because I'm interested in the world Rowling created and what other people can make in it.

The Harry Potter series is fun, yes. But I don't see any of the characters as so perfect that I don't want to see any change in a thing about them and just want more of the exact same character. I'm interested in /what else/. /What if/.

"Ginny goes through trials and tribulations playing professional Quidditch after graduating Hogwarts." Yes, Rowling said that happened. Boring.

"The Dursleys' treatment of Harry turns his magic inward, building until it bursts out in a dragon Animagus form." Interesting! Same building blocks as exist in canon, but rearranged into what new shape? I'll read and find out.

And non-canon pairings is a huge part of "what if" to me -- what if this person isn't the same as in canon? And this person? Perfectly reasonable then they won't be attracted to the same people. A Harry who's been able to turn into a dragon since he was five is going to grow up a very different person than the person he was in canon. In a well written story, I'll happily accept him getting into a relationship with Luna Lovegood. Or Daphne Greengrass. Or Viktor Krum. Or one of the merfolk in the lake.

Keep the canon building blocks, reassemble into as different a structure than the original as possible. That's what makes fanfiction fun to me. And in that regard, OP, any cliche can be done well. Some people hate fics where Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Some people love them. Some people like Marauder-era fics, some only read Harry-centric fics. Write what seems fun to you, and if you write it well, other people will enjoy it too.

*** I'm going to have to disagree with your statement about the pairings. Part of the beauty of fanfiction is that we can read about characters in an established world facing any situation imaginable. This not only includes Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione raising a family while working for the Ministry, etc, it also includes stories like what if Voldemort won or what if Hermione went back in time to befriend Snape or what would a relationship between Harry, Hermione and Fleur look like? Those 'what ifs' make fanfiction enjoyable. To say that non-canon pairings is a stain on the fandom is really harsh.

One thing I have learned by reading a ton of fanfiction is that everyone likes something different - and that's okay. No two people like the exact same everything and that applies to what one finds entertaining as well. You do not like non-canon ships. Your readers don't like them either. But honesty, if you wrote a Ron/Hermione story, for example, the people who read that story most likely enjoy that pairing and may or may not appreciate, say Draco/Hermione. Of course those reader preferences will likely lean more towards a canon spin than not. That's okay. Telling someone to avoid writing non-canon pairings because you don't agree with them is not.

  Canon relationship stories -- by far the most popular.)

As for the popularity of non-canon ships, let's look at the number of fics written and uploaded to fanfiction.net. This number is not an exact count of any given pairing, but I think it could give us a pretty quick look at the popularity of certain characters featuring in a story together.

Canon pairings:

- James/Lily - 33.9k fics uploaded
- Ron/Hermione - 26.6k fics
- Harry/Ginny - 23.7k
- Lupin/Tonks - 6.2k\\
- Lucius/Narcissa - 1.9k
- Draco/Astoria - 1.7k
- Bill/Fleur - 478

--------------

Non-canon pairings:

- Draco/Hermione - 55.6k
- Draco/Harry - 52.7k
- Harry/Hermione - 28.6k
- Sirius/Lupin - 18.7k
- Harry/Snape - 17.5k
- Snape/Hermione - 16.4k
- Snape/Lily - 6.5k

It appears to me that non-canon ships are what's most popular.

***** The number of stories is a good idea on how much interest there is in a story featuring those characters in general. Delving much deeper than that (like the other criteria you mentioned), is not easy to determine based on the sorting features of fanfiction.net.

If I search for stories by number of reviews for completed stories over 40k words uploaded after July 2007, looking carefully at stories with romantic pairings, the top 5 list would look like:

1. Harry Crow - Harry/Hermione - 23,711 reviews
2. Isolation - Draco/Hermione - 11,310 reviews
3. Death of Today - Harry/Voldemort - 7,690 reviews
4. Chasing the Sun - Snape/Hermione - 7,068 reviews
5. The Apprentice and the Necromancer - Snape/Hermione - 7,006 reviews

The top reviewed canon pairing story with the above criteria I could find is: The Bonds of Blood - Harry/Ginny - 3,996 reviews

Same criteria but sorted by favorites:

1. Harry Crow - Harry/Hermione - 10,737 favorites
2. Isolation - Draco/Hermione - 10,429 favorites
3. Simply Irresistible - Draco/Hermione - 7,636 favorites
4. Delenda Est - Harry/Bellatrix - 7,487 favorites
5. A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy - Draco/Hermione - 6,285

Top canon pairing story by favorites with same criteria: Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always - Harry/Ginny - 4,182 favorites

To me, all signs still point to non-canon pairings being more popular than canon pairings.

****** My latest story, the third story in a saga so far (a Harry/Ginny story, with a latent Ron/Hermione ship) has 300 reviews in 9 chapters less than a month. The first story in the saga, has been around for 2 1/4 years and has 1.7 million hits, 1780 Favs and 69 c2 communities. That is two years.

Many of the stories you've labeled have been out for anywhere between 3-7 years. Meaning that is how much time they've had to have that many reviews and favorites in that many years.

I might be wrong in some parts, when it comes to the popularity, but judging by my latest story 300 reviews in 9 chapters, 215 favorites and 415 followers in a distinctly Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione paring story, in less than a month is pretty good for a canon ship story. So as of recent, the canon ships are still very strong.

******* You have a very good story. Thank you very much for adding to the community. Every voice is important and improves fan fiction in general.

But this conversation just proves that there are many different 'favorites' witihin Harrydom. And there is plenty of room for all of them. People will gravitate to what they like. Trying to discuss what is *most* popular though doesn't really amount to much because it is so individualized. There is no prize for being most popular here.

Again thank you for making the community better with your story. You play a very important role by providing interesting stories for other to read. I hope you get a lot of enjoyment from your readers and their posts.

******* You're missing the point. He mentioned stories written after DH, which you said is when canon pairings became the most popular. Harry Crow, published in 2012, has nearly 24000 reviews. 14 months ago. That's 1700 reviews A MONTH. If you're going to flaunt a canon pairing story, do one with more than 300 reviews. It's not exactly the rarest thing.

*** I think the very essence of fanfiction is that you can write completely different ships.

To say not to write non-canon ships is limiting yourself to pretty poor pairings in canon. Harry/Ginny is one of the most underdeveloped and out of left field storylines in the whole series. Ginny serves little purpose besides being Harry's main romantic attraction. Other pairings, such as Bill/Fleur and Lupin/Tonks are poor as well.

Writing non-canon ships doesn't fall under a cliche.

***** Ginny has no development in the books after Second Year. She becomes adept at dueling in OotP with no explanation. Then becomes Harry's love interest in HBP and that's it. You could have replaced her with any number of characters and it wouldn't have mattered. It's not about like/dislike of Ginny. There's just very little to begin with in the first place. Her sole purpose is to be Harry's love interest.

Point being that your initial supposition that fanfiction should only have canon relationships is strange seeing as how the canon relationships aren't that strong to begin with.

******* I have read the books several times over.

Look at the list of actions you have for her. All of then are related to becoming close to Harry. Her character arc after the second book revolved around joining the DA (as several others do); dating Dean, and then becoming Harry's love interest. She essentially ends in the sixth book since she is just a peripheral character in the seventh.

Replacing her with Susan Bones or Parvati or anyone would have had the same affect.

********* Seven books and her sole purpose is to tell Harry he's not possessed?

It is telling that she has little purpose or role in the seventh book. We are told that she is good at dueling, flying, and is a spitfire. But from the moment she and Harry finally get together in the sixth book on, she has no other purpose. The end of her arc is dating Harry.

It is not a matter of disliking Ginny. I rarely ever bash Ginny when I write. But in canon, she, and her relationship with Harry, are very /underdeveloped/

******* Someone's eating prickle pills :(

You know that saying about writing that goes "don't tell, show" or something like that? We're told about Ginny and Harry's relationship. We don't really get to see it form and grow. The rest of the relationships are like that too. The focus of the books isn't on romantic relationships, so obviously we don't know much about Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny, etc.

People can easily make arguments that other non-canon relationships would work too. Yeah, I'll always prefer canon and like it best, but it can be interesting to think "what if."

*** If fan fiction authors are disrespecting Rowling by thinking the canon ones are subpar and other options could be better, then she must have had a serous case of self loathing recently. I'm of course referring to the comments that she made in her interview with Emma Watson. Before you say that "her quotes were taken out of context", "she's been Rita Skeeter'd", "she got influenced only by the movies", and the myriad of other excuses people make to ignore what she really said, note that I've read the interview top to bottom numerous times. The gist I got out of it: she regrets the Ron/ Hermione relationship. Does she specifically say the word 'regret' in her comments? No, but everything else she says heavily implies it. Namely, that "I'm not sure you could have got over that in an adult relationship, there was too much fundamental incompatibility" and "What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it". If that doesn't scream regret, I don't know what does. She even says that Harry and Hermione could have been a better fit. Now, by your admission, any other pairing but from canon is 'OOC' and completely 'harmful to the fandom'. What I don't see is how a couple that 'is in many ways' a better fit, against the characters presented in the books. You make it sound as if it is heresy as to not share the same opinion as you. And if you're going to say that Rowling's word is law, then don't cover your ears and yell 'LALALALA' when she says something that you don't like.

***** Um... No she didn't. Emma said that the line about marriage counseling was taken out of context--which it was--and you can see that I never mentioned that once. JK hasn't said anything since. It's my denial that I'm giving an explanation and backing them up with quotes by the author herself? OK. And by excessive PDA, do you mean when Ron kisses his wife's cheek teasingly. Wow, somebody call the cops. I really don't see how you can take the complete text of an interview out of context unless you only look at a few lines and form your opinion from them. Like I said before, the whole thing makes it seem as she regrets the pairing. So, I'm sorry, I won't be admitting anything today.
