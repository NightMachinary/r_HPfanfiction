** Are you looking for that as the primary theme or simply one feature within a fic?

**** In that case I know of two that I can link once I am off mobile- one is where Hermione is a parselmouth despite being a muggleborn- snakes having sapience and scientists having missed that throws her trust of authority for a right loop, the other is an HP/MLP crossover - if wishes were ponies by tkepner, iirc it has it occur in the book two of that series

To be clear the above are about curing lycanthropy, in terms of advancing werewolf rights there is also a campaign for such launched by Hermione and Voldemort's dad in the 20s or so, also there is a treaty where they have sovereignty of their own territory. Those I can link here. linkffn(in the bleak midwinter) linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom by mizuni-sama)

Also can't believe I missed linkffn(the sum of their parts) where this is arguably the driving force behind the fic

Hey [[/u/NotSoSnarky][u/NotSoSnarky]] I've made some edits

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
