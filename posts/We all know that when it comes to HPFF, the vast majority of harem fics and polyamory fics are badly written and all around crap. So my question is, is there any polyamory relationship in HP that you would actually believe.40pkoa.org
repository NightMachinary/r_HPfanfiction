If you don't know what polyamory is, in a nutshell, it's having multiple partners. It's extremely rare for people to have them, but it's not impossible.

I suppose if I had to pick one hyperthetical relationship that could work, then I'd go with Harry/Ginny/Luna. I think Harry and Luna is very possible and Harry/Ginny is already canon, so with some good writing, combining the two might not be too crazy. Plus, Ginny and Luna are canonically friends.


** That involve Harry? Not really.

I could see Fred and George swapping off on their girlfriends as a prank but not as an actual threesome. I could maybe see all four of them having a plural marriage or relationship of some kind, though.

EDIT: If we're talking AU or fics that have done polyamory well, look no further than the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs. linkffn(Firebird's Son) Most realistic polyamory story I've ready.

** I don't remember the name, but there was one (or maybe even multiple), where Harry has several bethrothed girls and where his parents are alive for a bit longer.

You have to understand that polyamory is only 'weird' in monoamorous societies, and some stories go into great detail and through even greater effort to paint the magical community as a polyamorous one.

Let's sum up the things I remember:

- in the real world, couples would need ~2.3 children to keep the population of their country steady. This number is even higher when the chance of survival is lower (e.g. because of a madman starting a war decimating the population). In the magical world this number would be a bit different, because of several reasons:\\
  First of all, child mortality is probably lower, because magic can be used to save sick and weak children, which would lower this needed number. Death through war on the other hand would raise this number significantly. Second thing to note is that muggleborns help to upkeep the population numbers, but some argue that these muggles are likely related to outcast squibs, and therefore are also connected to the statistics. As war seems to be a lot more commonplace in the magical community, I'd assume the number needed to sustain the population is closer to 3 than to 2.

Then there are pureblood politics and ideology, which also introduce the behaviour of name-grooming. Which families are worthy of marrying into, which political ties are helpful, which are not? Marriage as a political mean is well documented in the real world, and with the magical world lagging behind in everything, also likely to still exist there. But, what do when you don't have enough daughters or sons to establish meaningful ties? Well, you either marry your son to several wives (earning a lot of money in the process, as you'll receive bribes to connect your only heir to other families), or you allow several men to marry your daughter (which might be even better, as your faughter will then be mother to the heir of several families).

This system of marrying multiple people is even more important, if the political system (like the wihengamot) benefits those the most, who have many family members who vote for each other, or if seats in the government are even reserved for people from important families.

This system has existed for centuries, and is probably deeply ingrained into the minds of the magical community.

Lily Potter, hogging James Potter (and his entire lineage) to herself is probably unusual and was only possible because they were the only potters left, so noone could enforce bethrothals and engagement contracts.

Now comes Harry Potter, born into a war-torn magical britain. The future of uncertain, many people have died, and the Potters can clearly see that Harry will not have such a care-free time at Hogwarts as they did, not with the war going on, and will have to watch out for death eaters trying to recruit him to their side.

So who will win the argument, James, suggesting to protect Harry by binding him to some trusted families, or Lily, who just wants her son to be happy?

James has the better arguments - Harry will grow up around those few trusted families anyway, it'll provide a family for him in the worst case scenario of the potters dying during the war, he's in a influental position (single heir to multiple lineages), and if things don't work out at all, these contracts can still be renegotiated or broken.

Lily will see reason and sinply adjust the deal, like allowing Harry to veto or something like that.

Harry grows up around one or two of these future spouses, when voldemort 'finally' kills his parents. Now not only does he live with his spouse 24/7 and gets reinforced by the other families to go through with it, but he'll probably also see the spouses as a connection to his own parents, as someone his parents approved of, as someone they wanted him to be happy with.

So yes, I can see a harem or polyamorous relationship happening, but mostly in AU fics, where Harry lives in the magical world a bit longer before his parents die.

The other scenario I can see is two girls (or boys, if you are into that) falling for him, and then both refusing to give up on him. This is an important distinction to the 'two girls deciding to share him' storyline, because here Harry is the one trying to prevent both of them from hurting because of choosing the other one. Harry can sacrifice himself and bear a relationship where two girls depend on him, he however can't bear a relationship where he feels like he is receiving too much.

That's my two cents on the issue.

I could honestly see Luna in a polymory, although no specifics in who the other partners would be. Possibly some combination of Harry, Rolf and/or Ginny. Or maybe with Neville and someone else, like Hannah Abbott?

I could also see James/Lily/Sirius. You'd have to build the chemistry between James and Sirius that there's something 'more than' friends between them. Then James starts dating Lily. Then Sirius is kind of that third wheel until he's part of the relationship.

Neville is another character that doesn't show much jealousy (see: he doesn't resent Harry for being Ginny's obvious first choice at the Yule Ball) and I think he would be interested if it was someone else suggested it.

Tonks also doesn't have a jealous streak. I think everyone else with a firmly delineated character is too possessive over their crushes to be comfortable flaunting established monogamous traditions. Maybe in a universe where polyamory is accepted, but in canon the characters would need to 1. not be possessive and 2. openminded enough to pursue a polyamorous relationship in a world that discourages them.

It's better to just forsake the attempt than try to tweak characters in order to make their threesome believable. Lupin and Tonks had very little interaction with Snape (whom Rowling herself referred to as a character who no one would want to be loved by), and none of it sympathetic. Again, OP talked about /believable/ ships, not whatever crazy possibility your mind comes up with while you're high on crack.

You need to present an actual /reason/ why a character would want to engage in a relationship with another two.

********** the obvious response being that your interpretation of what is or is not plausible isn't shared by everyone. an elaboration would have to spiral into a discussion about the characters themselves...which i don't feel like getting into.

** Snape/Sirius/Remus - i can see the hate sex there, though nothing romantically

Harry/Draco/Blaise - there are a few fics out there of this triad i really like, I'd never thought of it reading the books though

Harry/Luna/Neville - I think they'd be very flower power peace love and harmony together or maybe commune like - more bff with benefits maybe, but living together

Voldemort/any of his death eaters - in a very unbalanced way \shudder\

Lestrange/Lestrange/Lestrange - equally unbalanced
