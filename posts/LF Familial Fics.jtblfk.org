I just finished A Bond of Family series by Daily and now I'm craving fics that focus on family dynamics. Any recommendations of Sirius, Lupin, or Snape adopting Harry or anything in that realm? I'd prefer if they are complete or actively updating WIP. Thanks!


** Cure oneshot where Sirius adopts Harry: linkao3(Sirius Black Is Sick of Your Parenting Advice)

I haven't read these myself but I often see them recommended: linkao3(The Meaning of Mistletoe) and linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** A [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/487526][Marauders Plan]] is definitely one to read! He didn't get to raise Harry from a baby, but he does raise him after PoA. ( There are parallels to A Bond of Family, but it is different enough to enjoy) COMPLETE

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1336825][Harry Potter and the Godfathers]] is a WIP, the author updates, but the updates can have a few months in between.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2129089/1/Truths][Truths]] Sirius is released from prison and gains custody of 5 year old Harry. It is a 4 or 5 part series with some one shots. Its well written, and one of my favorite family fics. COMPLETE

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24460507?view_full_work=true][Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter]] Sirius gets a trial and raises Harry with the help of his grandfather. WIP, a lot of world building, powerful Harry, and it gives me some Gam of Thrones feels (but it isn't classified as.a cross over). The writing is amazing.

I loved this fic, but it was last updated in July of this year. Technically all of he sections are finished, but the series isn't. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1053980][Before the Thunder]] This is a fun fic. Currently paused in year 3. Wolfstar raises Harry after Sirius is released from prison.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One]] Sirius escapes and takes Harry with him. Harry doesn't attend Hogwarts until year 5. COMPLETE

** The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga has this and is still updating (pretty much finished with the plot though). Writing is consistently high quality.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
