- Any length is acceptable

- The real Mad-Eye must reveal himself

Bonus:

- Mad-Eye actually has plans for what to do if somebody ever kidnaps and impersonates him

- Mad-Eye vs. Imposter


** An easy escape method for writing an escape could be incoherent mumbling to himself and his delirious slurred words form the name of a house elf who appears when called because he is in Hogwarts.

*** That'd be awesome.

And now I feel sorry for whichever poor House Elf has such a terrible name as that.

** "The fourth Triwizard champion. Harry Potter."

"Harry, go."

/meanwhile, in Moody's quarters/

A trunk clunks open. The sneakoscope whir as a wooden, clawed foot is launched out of the opening.

"Free! Free!" screams Alastor Moody.

"Now, I'm going to stuff my foot up that dickhole's arse. Onwards we go!"

/in the Champions' Room/

Barty Crouch finished his explaination of the Goblet's deception. He smiled to himself, satisfied. Everything was going to plan.

/in the Great Hall/

"Piece of trash took my goddamn eye. God, I miss having depth perception."

"Would sir like Dobby to help you?"

"Good elf. Take me to Dumbledore."

/in the Champions' Room/

"Goodnight, children. Alastor, lead the--"

Dumbledore was cut off by a large crack and the appearance of a house elf and...

*Another* Alastor Moody?

"Yargh!" yelled the newcomer. "I'm going to stuff my foot up your arse, Death Eater scum!"

Unfortunately for Barty Crouch Junior, Moody had lost all sense and depth perception. As a result, the foot was roughly stuffed into the wrong opening.

Barty Snr. was arrested, while his son was transported to St. Mungos to be examined.

"How did this get in there?"
