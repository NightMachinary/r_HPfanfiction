I'm a huge math person, and I think about arithmancy a lot and how it work. I tend to gravitate towards shit like complex roots of real numbers, or modulus, or conservative fields, or matrix determinants, or Fermat numbers and prime number equations, or polar/spherical/cylindrical coordinates, but like, 13 year olds are supposed to be learning this shit on the basis of MAYBE some algebra knowledge, so like ..?? Maybe wizards operate on base 7?


** I dare say linkffn(The Arithmancer By White Squirrel) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Arichmedes by White Squirrel) are exactly what you are looking for, in case you didn't already know about it.

Fanon generally has it involved in spellcrafting in some way.

***** I've heard that said, though in my mind I tend to equate it more with calculus. I just have such a hard time picturing Hermione liking Divination-related /anything/! Even if it does have math.

***** I think Rowling just took Arithmancy as what it is in our world, Divination with numbers, not even statistics related or anything ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmancy][see wikipedia]]). I always felt it hard to believe that Hermione would enjoy this, although someone around here recently wrote a good comment about why she would like it. Something about the vagueness of Divination being what she dislikes and predicting the future using numbers, meaning using logic appeals to her much more. Also it is something you can learn out of a book, not like Divination.

I am always happy to see some other interpretation of Arithmancy in fanfics since to me the subject always felt stupid. Although something more logical than the canon understanding of the subject would fit less into the world Rowling created.

** Can absolutely confirm that "The Arithmancer" and "Lady Archimedes" are definitely what you're looking for. Hermione as protagonist and there's some clever use of actual maths, though I must say, a lot of it just boils down to technobabble with some tenuous link to the matter at hand (for example certain spells that have to do with reshaping things being dependent on linear algebra because linear transformations). It's good, just a bit long, occasionally repetitive, and don't expect really clever exploitation of the math-magic link, in the end it mostly boils down to "it just works". The actual maths that are mentioned though appeared all correct to me.

**** I think the author did know the math, they just didn't know how to apply it to magic because realistically...

Supposing I was given some kind of developer console to the universe, in which I can affect its fundamental variables to any degree, with no energy constraints. Well, Lumos would be easy, it's just a bunch of electromagnetic waves. Wingardium Leviosa, similarly, is just some kind of extra force. But transfiguration? All the various complicated magics they use in the series? None of those would be programmable with anything outside of a supercomputer. No way a human mind, even of a genius polymath, could make sense of them. And that's without even getting into how abstract a concept soul magic is.

I didn't hate the fic, but it's not one of my favourites either. I finished it mostly because of investment, but was pretty worn out by the end of it.
