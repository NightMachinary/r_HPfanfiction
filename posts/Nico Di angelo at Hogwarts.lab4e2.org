So, the idea is a long story with Nico Di Angelo of Percy Jackson and the Olympians/Hero of Olympus at Hogwarts.

To be clear, I talk of fanfictions with only Nico, I find awkard to have others characters of PJO/HOH there (except Hazel, because having Nico being with his sister at hogwarts do interest me).

I want Nico at Hogwarts, not "the demi-gods are so great, look, Percy Jackson had defeat 10 Death-Eaters and had fight a dragon with his bare hands" kind of story, hence why only Nico is better (since while he is powerful, it is different, and he would be the only one there, so, a game changer, but not a game breaker (if what I said made sense).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13157685/1/Best-Friends]] this is a example of what I talk (although I would had like less Riordan characters).

Nico is a interesting character, and I would love to see him well used (either Gryffindor, Hupplepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin, I have no problems) in Harry Potter.

And it's hard to find fanfictions of that who aren't cringe, hence why I ask here (I didn't said than i didn't saw good ones, but still).

If you know ones, please tell me.
