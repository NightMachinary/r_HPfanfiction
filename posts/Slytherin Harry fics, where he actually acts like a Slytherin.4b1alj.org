There are some fanfics with Slytherin Harry but I'm afraid that in most of them Harry still acts like a total Gryffindor.

Are there any fics where Harry actually is cunning and ambitious but not evil.


** Fuck, I'll give it a shot anyways. Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li); Linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning); Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness); Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection)

I feel like I'm forgetting some but this will do for now.

**** Only because he basically refused to go to Slytherin. Read the fic and tell me he doesn't belong in Slytherin in that story.

I think that this will fit your description. The beginning is rather weak, but it gets much better and is updated weekly.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
