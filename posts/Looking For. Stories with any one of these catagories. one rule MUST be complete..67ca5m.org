just to let people know i tried google and yes i tried the community section of fanfiction.net. inheritance fanfics, has a dragon/basilisk/snake familiar, dark harry, and last but not least slash (don't judge). I know im asking for a lot of different kinds of fanfics I just struggle to find good stories. preferably longer than 50k words because i read on a daily bases. i hate reading unfinished stories because i have to wait for it to continue or its just never finished


** Have you discovered scryer.darklordpotter.net?

It's a much better search than either Google or the one on fanfiction.net

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
