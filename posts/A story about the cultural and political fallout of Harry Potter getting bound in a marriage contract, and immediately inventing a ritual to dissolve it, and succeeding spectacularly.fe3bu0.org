Harry comes of age, is notified that somebody got dibs on him as a spouse, utterly destroys the contract within a couple of chapters, and all hell breaks loose across the old magical families of the whole world: suddenly the horrible choice your parents made about your future is no longer set in stone and you have a chance to unmake it - if anyone can convince Harry Potter to release the formula for his new ritual in spite of the consequences. The longer he waits to publicly pronounce himself the more carnage is wreaked by the uncertainty: people refusing to marry each other are excommunicated from family and friends, suffer debilitating powerful curses after exceeding their deadlines. Goblin banks are attacked outright. But all this mounting pain pales beside the potential fracturing of wizard society should the ritual be leaked or worse, successfully replicated elsewhere.

This does assume as base premise that, if not in Britain then in other, more traditionalist magical communities, arranged marriages are still common among families of significant influence and that social mores are a lot further backwards in general than seen in the books and films.

Edit: more brainstorming thanks to what was said in comments below.

I agree that a young Harry would probably not be up to sorting himself out all on his own. Hermione is best for the task within his entourage - and she is not very likely to hold back the contents of her discovery. So how about this:

Chief Auror Harry, is in his late twenties to early thirties. He and his would-be future wife are informed of their predicament by the goblins just a few months if the deadline, at which point some dire disaster awaits if the contract is left unfulfilled. This Harry has been fighting crime professionally, dealing with dark lords, gangs overpowered petty thieves and whatnot for years. He will by now know something about everything including complex dodgy rituals, if only because, at least once, he had to be able to safely sabotage one without destroying the world in the process. He strings together a rite that nullified his marriage contract without harm or (physical) grief to any involved. This achievement is leaked to the public, possibly by the family that Harry was supposed to marry into, and shit hits the fan.

Ok, why does shit hit the fan?

Well, let's think of the context of this fanon version of wizard society.

In the last century, tradition has received several hard kicks in the shins: Grindelwald's defeat decades ago, and the two most successful pureblood supremacist incursions twice thwarted in living memory. Britain might be the single most progressive magical country at this time given how thoroughly the blood purist elites have been discredited. This development will not have escaped the attention of other magical nations.

Harry Potter is alive and renowned as a strong role model, that each new generation looks up to more than the last. And when he breaks his marriage contract, some youngsters around the world realize that they value his example of self-determination in a moderate, accepting society, more than the values that their parents have perhaps half-heartedly tried to instill in them. Marriage freedom becomes the base of a big reform movement from would-be newlyweds around the world: their parents offer varying resistance and support, but the older generation put their feet down in outrage: "It's bad enough how far we've fallen, but no further!" whence the conflict.

One further idea: the ritual Harry put together is not necessarily universal. Perhaps it only worked for him and would fail catastrophically for anyone else. That's a beginning of a reason he couldn't just share the data. He found out what would work for him through trial and error, but doesn't know how to design the procedure for someone else.

I repeat that I know this does not reflect the degree of social development visible in Rowling's work.

** Another thought: Being able to break a contract is not too crucial - if everyone wanted to break them if they could, they would not have been made in the first place. If your parents are willing to do this to you, odds are you were raised to think it is ok and will do it to your kids. So, the contract is not as important as the social pressure and custom.

** Also, if you can force your kids to marry with a contract you can force them to do other things as well. Like fighting for Voldemort or the Ministry. Marriage contracts that cannot be broken have far-reaching consequences.

** I do not see Harry inventing this, but Hermione. Harry is not really a spellcrafter. And the consequences depend on the fanon society - canon society does not work like that. People would behave differently if they had such contracts. And Harry and co. would have known about that in advance.

*** Maybe, but imagine if the society did work like that and Harry invented it entirely accidentally - he has absolutely no idea why or how it works, only that it does.

Then add in everyone going batshit crazy over his invention and desperately trying to steal it from him. :D

***** Because he has no idea what he did and has nothing to give away. Essentially, he did the ritual-design equivalent of throwing whatever random chemicals were dotted around the lab and whatever he had left in his kitchen cupboards into a potion and it ended up curing cancer. But he has no idea what any of that stuff was - only, since he's now free of the contract and keeps telling everyone he has no idea how he did it, everyone assumes he is an arsehole keeping the secret to himself.

******* My opinion on pensieves is rather sceptical, but a fair point. They're not very bound by the actual reality of memories, so a panicked and confused memory would be perfectly clear and even the things Harry had no chance of seeing or registered would be viewable in 3d, so... yeah. That'd work.
