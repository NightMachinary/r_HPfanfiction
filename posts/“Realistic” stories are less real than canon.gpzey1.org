I often meet the word “realistic” (or “more realistic”) in either a story title or annotation. Unfortunately each time I see that it's nothing more than a click-bait.

The latest example is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1662466][Totally Realistic]] series.

While an author adds more psychological consequences of Harry's abuse he completely forgets about other characters, canon and butterfly effect of his changes.

Now each time I see “realistic” in a story description I skip it with a thought that the author is an arrogant teenager.


** Realism is a quixotic quest when writing fantasy. There can be no realism in a fic about wizards.

What people should strive for is consistency. If the muggle world of the fic is meant to be consistent with real life, there should be consequences for the Dursleys actions. Enhanced realism/(consistency with real life) in one case such as Harry suffering effects of abuse, fails in its goal if it is not accompanied by consistency within the rest of the fic. In this case, a realistic approach to how abuse effects a single child can't ignore how the effects of the abuse on that child affect others.

JK Rowling didn't strive for realism in her depictions of abuse in the slightest, but she was consistent in that. Mrs. Weasely hardly bats an eye at the idea of bars on Harry's windows in the same way no one bats an eye at Neville being dropped out of a window.

The only person in Harry Potter that really shows any signs of the effects of abuse is Snape, who unfortunately shows the cycle of the perpetuation of abuse.

And that is a big problem if you want to write a fic which deals with the abuse. Because you either whitewash the actions of pretty much every adult, or you accept that those people do not have Harry's best interest in mind, even if they think they do (Mrs Weasley). Therefore, you will have to scrap together a cast from background characters who have not been burned in that regard (eg the Tonks, Professor Sinistra, Hestia Jones, Sirius, Hannah's mother and so on).

I would slightly dispute that. I understand what you mean, but let me play a bit with the word “realism”. For you it seems to mean something like “story is as close to the objective reality and scientific conclusions as possible”, right?

Let me point out the literary movement of the nineteenth century called realism. Henry James is [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548ks][quoted on BBC show about the realism]] as saying that “realism is what in some shape or form we might encounter, whereas romanticism is something we will never encounter.”

On the one hand you have novels like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Mr_Polly][H. G. Wells' “History of Mr Polly”]] with normal story of normal person in the normal world. On the other hand you have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe][“Ivanhoe” by Sir Walter Scott]], the story in history, about kings, bandits, knights. However, my point is that the difference is deeper than just stage set of the story, it is about the story itself. The realist story deals with normal passions of normal people (here infidelity, meaning of life, finding a life partner). The romantic one is all about extremes: extreme love, saving the kingdom (or whole world in other cases), the main opponent in Ivanhoe “[u]nscathed by the lance of his enemy, [...] died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions”.

I probably cannot claim that Harry Potter books are the realist adventure stories in line with “Farewell to Arms”, “All Quiet on the Western Front”, or even “The Good Soldier Švejk”, even considering that they are for teenagers/young adults. However, I would claim, that they are surprisingly closer to these than the classical fantasy (“Conan the Barbarian”, Marvel superheroes, but even perhaps “The Earthsea Cycle”), and that exactly not noticing this difference makes most crossovers and all attempts to create super!Harry (isn't it remarkable how incredibly non-superhero Harry is in the books?) are doomed from the beginning, and why for example stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] or linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) are much closer to the canon in my opinion (and I don't mean such trivialities as pairing, but deeper spirit of the books).

So, yes, I think it is possible to write stories in the style of the magicians' realism (nothing to do with the magical realism, which I completely detest), and that is possible to write realist story among wizards.

**** Interesting perspective on the definition of "realism" as applied to fanfiction, especially considering "realism" in art as well. I would still argue that a majority of fanfiction authors take realism to mean what I had originally described and what you had surmised of my definition rather than a literary movement.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

*** The realism is not about magic, but characters.

While JKR did an amazing job portraying her heroes, she often disregarded the characters in a favor of the plot moving forward.

“Realistic” stories promise to fix this, but while focusing on Harry only they dismiss all other characters and JKR's work of making them.

** I guess the realism in your example is Harry being afraid of speaking his mind unless it comes to worshipping Hermione.

If you read it as a parody of your average Hermiome worship fic, it's amusing. Given the copy and paste of PS, the Halloween chapter is very funny.

Anyway, yeah most "realistic" fics focus on Harry treating their favorite character better than they deserve and/or fixing plot holes, many of which aren't there. The latter is particularly grating because it often comes with the arrogant belief they're being clever when it's usually just a lack of reading comprehension on their part.

*** First two books aren't worth reading. You can easily skip them without missing anything.

The things start to change in the 3rd one and the 5th feels completely different from canon (with very controversial ending). A the same time the 5th book demonstrates all the problems I listed above.

** Some fics strive to be realistic in some areas but utterly fail in others. The fic that shall not be named has a very well thought out, non-contradictory time travel system but fails at depicting eleven year olds.

I'm thinking of taking special relativity into account for my planned wizards in space fic, to give them more of a challenge. But I highly doubt it's anywhere close to realistic in the depictions of goblin society.

**** I agree... saying they're a teenager suggests they might still have a chance to grow and mature emotionally. (And hints at the idea that maybe we remember what it was like to be that arrogant. To remember back to the times when we once thought we knew better than everyone. I certainly remember myself at that age and cringe).

But I suppose LondonFoggie is right too... plenty of people never move past that at all. Mentally they remain a teenager forever.
