For example: out of all the H/Hr-stories *Three To Backstep* linkffn(10766595) made me hate Hermione with a passion. Even though the author has Daphne 'curb' Hermione's more annoying side, she still grinds my gears with everything she does or says.

Tbh, the whole fic isn't that great, but the characterisation of Hermione is /the worst/ in here.


** No fanfic is going to change my perception of Book characters.

I may hate them in that particular setting, but since fanfics are all about exploring alternate scenarios, some Book characters I like are bound to become despicable in these scenarios, and some I hate will become adorable.

For example, Ron in the Movies, which were basically fanfictions written by the screenwriter Steve Kloves, was an awful person Hermione should not get together with. Or that Harry in The Cursed Child was a real dick, sounding much like Umbridge on multiple occasions.

*** Oh I don't mean ruin the character 'forever', but just for the duration of that fic (or however long you dare continue reading..).

Cursed Child is for the HP books what 'My Immortal' is for HP Fanfiction. There will always be "fans", but the majority will recognize that it's utter crap.

** Indy!Lord!Potter fics are the best way to make me hate Harry.

Your average Harmony fic makes me hate Hermione

"Ron-Did-Nothing-Wrong" kinda fics make me despise Ron.

What I'm trying to say here is that there is at least one trope, cliche or genre of fic that makes me hate a specific character. As in - a temporary hate that subsides when my higher brain functions remind me that this is fanfiction, not canon.

** Typically if a story descends too far into character bashing I drop the fic, not the character.

** Hmm ... well, it may seem like a weird answer, but it's generally hard for me to hate characters because if they are just that bad then I simply don't care about them (e.g. Umbridge) and if they are not exactly that bad but do something terrible for reasons that aren't nonsense then I generally pity them (e.g. Albus).

As such, the one fanfic I can say with full certainty that made me hate a character was “The Shadow of Angmar”, and the character was /Harry/. I liked him for being an interesting and overall positive character, pitied him for the mistakes he made and the pain he went through, but hated him for how he kept on being blind to why those mistakes happened. I guess ... in a way, it reminded me of myself from a long time ago, the part about being blind.

**** I actually do genuinely like him, though. I think that's what allowed me to hate him as well, instead of just shrugging and moving on.

** It's the fault of no particular fic, but I hate romance fics and I /really/ can't read most Hermione pairing fics anymore. Any of them. It's down to gen or the occasional grudging rarepair if she's the main character.

And it's kind of my fault. When I first got into this fandom, I made the mistake of sorting by reviews. I read everything with gusto, only clicking out of the severely cliched or poorly written. In my gluttony to read more of the magical world, I was eventually crushed by the melange of bad tropes, bad writing, bad characterization, bad romance, and bad plotting, pressed by its weight into a tiny black ball of hatred for all things involving enthusiastic shipping.

Hermione is great but she is also fallible, flawed, and, let's face it, used in canon as a walking, talking plot-solver and info-dumper. She is *not* a super-attractive super-genius who can do no wrong and is right about everything.

Harry fics aren't quite at the same point for me, mostly because I automatically pass over anything that involves him being shipped with someone he actively hates. His characterization just doesn't support that for me.

** A bunch of fics made me hate Dumbledore for a while. Too many to count. It took some time to separate fanfic beard-twirling Dumbledore from the flawed but ultimately well-meaning Dumbledore in canon.

*** Hahaha funny, cause those fics, in the end, made me hate Dumbledore less and Harry more. I get that (in those fics) Harry has every right to be angry and to fight for freedom, but does that have to make him some arrogant staff wielding vengeance "god" with even more names than Dumbledore could've dreamed of? :p

**** 1) She isn't clever. Yes she is intelligent, she read a lot of book, but she isn't clever. In first year, any sensible person would have excepted that Severus' riddle was a trap. What if all potion are poisons? 2) She is ready to betray Harry for authority, like in fifth year were she stopped writing to Harry even though she knew that it would hurt him a lot. Why did she do that? Because Dumbledore said so. 3) She doesn't admit making mistake, like again in fifth year where she let Harry get all the trouble because of the DA, when Umbridge was ready to expell Harry she didn't say that she was the one who created the group and that she should be expelled not Harry. 4) She doesn't like when someone else has solutions, like when Harry suspected that Draco was a Death Eater (Because of it, Dumbledore died). Or in seventh year when Harry wanted to go to Godric Hollow (because of it Nagini was waiting for them when she finally decided to go). 5) She can be horribly jealous. Not like Ron, okay, but still. If my friend aced an exam by cheating I wouldn't be jealous but happy for him. Especially if it's a subject where he has a lot of trouble.

I have other points but those 5 points are some reason why I don't like her.

** Pretty much every HP fic I've read has helped me hate Harry Potter just a little more. With four exceptions:

- In /A Slytherin at War/ and /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/, Harry is relegated to his natural role: that of a side character.
- In /Harry Potter Without Harry Potter/ and the Alexandra Quick series, Harry doesn't appear.
