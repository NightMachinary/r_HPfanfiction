After being disappointed with some of these fics, and probably reading all, if not most of the good ones in this genre, I decided to try my hand writing one, but I wanted to ask your opinions on some of the ideas I had for it(not only limited to the House itself), the setting is a bit AU.

A note about Harry: Here, he is a bit more bitter towards his relatives(no they do not torture him or anything), and later towards the muggle world in general, so he is very receptive towards the wizarding world, especially after making friends in it.

*1- Make the Slytherins in first years just a bit more thoughtful and aware of politics, instead of mini politicians at eleven.*

This is my answer to "How to make Slytherin House not turn into a Green and Silver Gryffindor?", some fics just make the Slytherins turn into expys for their Gryffindor counterparts, others turn the House into Game of Thrones Kids, I want to find a middle ground,

I am thinking of Slytherins being those kids who kind of accepted their parent's ambitions for them and maybe had some ambitions of their own that are very strong for them, they are also receiving some training in politics and "cunning", but being eleven years old, can't use most of it yet, this can change over the years.

*2-Harry gets a crash course in Wizarding culture, customs and pureblood manners, this not only includes things like greetings and how to walk(cue walking with books stacked on your head) but observing of Sacred Days and rituals, maybe even sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to dance under the moonlight.*

I am testing who would be a better guide, I am thinking either Draco or Daphne, the motivation, Harry wants to connect with this world that "freed" him, well, for the kids they may want to include him and the parents want the propaganda.

*3-Some additions to dueling, name a wand equivalent of a parry dagger. And an approach similar to fencing.*

I read some fics where Harry dual-wields wands, and I didn't like it too much, but I thought of some wizards using a smaller wand the same way you would use a parry dagger/knife in fencing, mostly for defense and assisting the main one, now, the great majority of wizards don't use them, because it's purely for combat, requires specialized training and can be taxing, so this is a mostly Aurors thing, really powerful wizards don't need them or even scoff at them(Dumbledore, Tom Riddle).

*4-Inheritance and Heritage, no, nothing to do with eleven rings and billions of Galleons being handed to him by the goblins, more to do with his Potter side of the family.*

This is a Harry who wants to connect with his family, so inside a Storage Vault he finds some of his grandparent's Journals(his parent's were lost in Godric's Hollow), where he learns a bit more about their customs and history.

Yes, he might also get a ring and can claim the Slytherin name through his mother (that has no money or uber-powerful artifacts because it was all passed down to branches, it's just a ring and one thing to almost screw him royally in the Second Year). Riddle never got it because his branch wasn't of the firstborn. Cliche I know, but we need a better excuse for Parseltongue and entering the Chamber.

*5-Peer pressure, re-reading the books, I realized how much Harry's view of things was colored by his peers.* *Here is the same, but a bit different.*

I noticed how much he accepted and ran with the first impressions he got of things until he got a strong nudge to change his opinions.

Here it will be the same, Harry, instead of the lazy but well-intentioned and brave Ron and the smart but muggle biased Hermione gets a group of peers who focus heavily on goals and results but who are extremely biased towards wizarding culture, this makes the Harry who has a less than stellar experience with muggles embrace this world much more readily than in canon. He is also more motivated to study so he can keep up.

*6-More Worldbuilding, more places to visit.*

I always thought HP World was too closed off, so using some of the stuff from Pottermore and Fantastic Beasts, I want to make the world bigger, I plan for this to be a long fic after a good start(perhaps making the first 2-3 years a bit faster so we have a starting point with a decent age and some experience), Voldemort will also take some time before he becomes a real problem.

*7(because it's a good number)-Ritualistic Magic, at first simple and harmless rituals that are considered Dark just for being rituals(similar to the stuff at the start of* *Enveloped in the Darkness* *).*

They are only practiced by the purebloods(they form Circles in Hogwarts) almost in secret(staff pretends it's nothing), but I want to add some Celtic or other pagan customs(think BBC Merlin, nothing too heavy), I would be grateful for some materials and suggestions. I will probably have some stupid older kids summon a demon or something in the forest and have Harry and Co. deal with it at some point.

​

*That's basically it, any suggestions, critiques, ideas, and similar fics recommendations are greatly appreciated. I am still outlining and drafting, but a beta would also be appreciated.*


** First suggestion: forget the pureblood manners/etiquette stuff. Maybe this is just me, but I think it usually just adds nothing to the story and just makes the dialogue more grating to read. And it's not like there's any reason in canon to think 'pureblood etiquette' is important. Did Tom Riddle learn about proper pureblood manners in his muggle orphanage? No, but he ruled Slytherin house anyway because he was powerful and ruthless. There's no indication Draco has manners, he's popular in his house because his dad is rich/powerful.

Another popular Slytherin!Harry trope I think you shouldn't include--child marriage contracts. Mostly because its creepy and generally a sign of a badly written story, but it's also completely ahistorical for Britain. The magical/muggle worlds separated around 1700 iirc, and the average age of marriage in England in 1200-1800 was around 25 for women. Child marriage was common in most of the world during that time, but not in Britain.

A Slytherin!Harry trope that should be used more: pagan religious customs/rituals. It can be an interesting way to add to your worldbuilding, and make the magical world seem more magical/mysterious.

These will go hand in hand, the etiquette stuff will be just at the beginning and basic stuff like proper stance and one or two custom like who offers a handshake or treating ladies.

The pagan religious and customs will be much more important and prevalent.

No such thing here, lol, I may have one of the Patil twins commenting on it(it still happens in India) but the "arranged marriage" part in Britain limits itself to frowning upon cousins marrying. Noone here getting in an unbreakable marriage contract. However, feudal societies can be prone to have arranged marriages of adults as part of family alliances and a way to control dowry, I don't think it will fit here, some parents may try to play matchmakers though.

** Advice: /Do not do 4./ If you want to shoot your story in the knees then go ahead. But if you want to be a minimum credible than you will not approach this trope by two thousand miles because not doing so is called /suicide/. Voldemort is the direct descendant of Slytherin, not Harry, end of discussion. There isn't a Slytherin name to claim because that name became Gaunt, just like Hufflepuff became Smith. Go with the grandparents' journal, but nothing else you said about this point.

Number 3 is very iffy. I'd advise you not touching upon this before at least sixth year. Using two wands simultaneously is useless if you can't cast silently and is in no way like wielding two guns. I appreciate more what the movies seem to imply with Lucius Malfoy using his cane as a protective item, but that's just my opinion.

Pure-blood manners don't really make sense and are grating to read. If you want to include good manners, sure, you can also base yourself on Victorian/Edwardian code of conduct for high society, but do /not/ do anything like people call a literal child 'Lord Potter' and others being called 'Heir Malfoy' or 'Heiress Greengrass'. No one does that and no one ever did that. In a civil but not really formal setting like Hogwarts, they would be called Mister and Miss (Noble House Name which isn't their last name).

The rest seems alright, but in the end, it's your call.

Eh, so that's why it's AU, same reason Harry's grandparents are Charlus and Dorea instead of Fleamont and Euphemia, I always thought the whole parselmouth by Horcrux was stupid, so here Harry is meant to be mirror and foil for Riddle in this. And in the AU the line of Slytherin will not be the only parselmouths, it's a rare trait, but happens more in the east or in Greece, still ostracized in Britain though.

Harry's line is through a bastard line that mostly squibbed until his mother, but magic doesn't care for marriages, it cares for blood.

The Gaunt line from which Voldemort comes is from a second son, he is not of the firstborn's blood, they got the money and properties because the firstborn didn't have /legitimate/ children, but not the ring because the line was still alive, and Voldemort hid this from those in the know(he never found out the line though). So the genealogy is a bit different.

  'Lord Potter' and others being called 'Heir Malfoy' or 'Heiress Greengrass'.
#+end_quote

That always sounded weird to me, I believe this comes from Japanese culture because IIRC there is a situation where they put 'heir' at the front. So it must have spread from Naruto fics or something.

I can see adults calling children Lord in Game of Thrones, not Harry Potter, and yes etiquette is mostly good manners from high society. I can see adults calling others Lords if they actually have the proper title OR hold an office that calls for it, but it's mostly Mr.

#+end_quote

I didn't say two guns, it's actually contrary to that, I said like a parrying dagger, so for blocking or parrying, not for attacking. I may drop this if I don't like how the fights and duels flow.

And it's not easy to use, it takes training and is magically exhausting, it allows one to attack and defend at the same time, or attack and defend in different directions, but if you don't practice it's unwieldy, by the time Harry reads about it only people like Amelia Bones and Kingsley Shackelbolt along with few others can use it, Harry's grandfather used it in the Grindelwald War, that's what picks his interest, he learns the same style but without the second wand because 1. he doesn't have a proper second wand(it's different from a regular wand) and 2. he can't cast protego and variants silently until later.

I might actually substitute the whole thing to just being a different style that was particular to Charlus but not James, this idea came while imagining how would a wizard fight if surrounded (and he's not a master who can transfigure and animate stuff to auto block spells or an expert at combat apparition or something)

  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

** I mean my general concern would be: what makes your story original? What makes it worth reading? Because as it goes now you've just listed a bunch of tropes - it sounds basically like every other mediocre Slytherin!Harry fic. You say yourself that you're disappointed with other fics. How will you make yours stand out?

One note is I'd scrap all nobility/pureblood etiquette lessons. It's boring and grating to read. Introducing alternate wizarding traditions and culture can be nice, but I don't care to read about “persecuted” dark wizards, which is a common theme in those stories. I think Harry delving more into his family history could be interesting if done well.

#+end_quote

Good question, most of those I have read, are of poor quality, either in grammar, spelling, or writing wise, with lots of bad tropes, and trying to be edgy.

Most have never really explored the consequences of some changes and have only used those to give Harry more power or to make him even edgier. Also many have bad romance or harems. They give and give without consequence, and often too much that is not useful to the story(10 houses? Billions of Galleons? WTF)

Things I want to explore:

-How would a decent Dumbledore(closer to canon) react to a Harry in Slytherin that seems to be really liking wizarding culture, despise muggles, and enjoys the company of some children who are inadvertently sharing their prejudices(nothing overt at first) with him?

-How would the moldable Harry react to a very different environment and influences?

-How would Harry and Hogwarts react in the Second Year when he is officially the "Heir" of Slytherin but has nothing to with the attacks and only some in his own House believe him.

-Later, how would Voldemort react when his prophesized foil seems to be stealing the heritage he thought unique to him.

In this story I want Harry to embrace his family history more, build up Potter history a bit (Potioneers, soldiers, etc) (and Wizarding culture along with it), and these things to matter to him, for example there will be a Potter Manor, but instead of Avalon 2.0 it's a dilapidated big house that needs a lot work to be restored and safe.

Wow, people seem really bothered by those, I guess I will cut back and just cite these happened and focus more on traditions and customs. I also think I was not able to communicate what I mean with etiquette lessons.

**** That all sounds reasonable. I'd be interested in a well portrayed Harry-Dumbledore dynamic without bashing.

Some more things to consider:

- Will you be following the stations of canon?whats the actual plot of the story?
- what are Harry's motivations? What drives his character?
- will it be a seven year story starting in first year? Those can be hard to finish from what I've seen. How much time would you spend on every year?

Good luck with your story. Please link it here when you get around to posting

Yeah, no bashing here, I understand some people can see him as Manipulative, but I think the way JKR wrote him and some plotholes causes this more than the character himself. He is one of my favorites and Mentor!Dumbledore is one of my favorite tropes.

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Most of the things external to Harry will probably still happen, but the results will be different because Harry will be different. Some new things will happen due to this condition(mostly because Harry will be more mobile during Summers and have more contact with more people)

​

#+begin_quote
  what are Harry's motivations? What drives his character?
#+end_quote

At first, the want to belong, while the Dursleys do not torture or beat him or something, they do make him feel very unwelcome, different in bad way and dislocated, so when practically overnight he discovers there's a whole world that will accept him, a world where he has a family(even if they are all gone) that is like him and even distant blood relatives, he just jumps right in.

Of course, over time there will be more things, a sense of duty, honor, care for others, etc, but all will come from this want to belong to something. Sometimes this will lead to bad things too.

​

#+begin_quote
  will it be a seven year story starting in first year? Those can be hard to finish from what I've seen. How much time would you spend on every year?
#+end_quote

Well, some years will be shorter than others(like Third Year) while some summers will be longer(without the blood wards after the First Year, he sometimes will have to go abroad and visit other places, so he will have Summer adventures too.

The draft is still very crude(this is why I am asking opinions now, so I can change stuff without losing hours of work), but the outline goes a bit after 1998. As I said this will be a long fic.

Please. This alone is interesting. The whole scarcrux = parseltongue thing felt really stupid to me. It being a natural gift feels more... organic than it being a bleedover gift from the horcrux.

And it having actual drawbacks is hilarious. I can see Harry reading the first message on the wall and he just goes "Crap..." and everybody's eyes slowly turn to him at once.

You could also have more people being parselmouths. Have Harry trick people into revealing they are parselmouths. It's a magical gift, it would be hilarious if there was a half-blood and muggleborn who could speak it too.

​

  *any suggestions*
#+end_quote

How are the Dursleys being handled? If you are getting rid of them, you can still keep the "protections". Blood adoption potion. Just hire a squib or someone to take one keyed to Petunia. Still get the protections, but none of the Dursleys. AND! It would probably work better this way than with the outright hate the Dursleys were giving him before. This could also potentially give breathing space from Dumbledore, or have him rethink a bunch of things.

It will be a fancy signet ring, to seal letters and documents, the magical part of it is that it adjusts it's size and can only be worn by the heir/Head of the House, and can't be forcefully removed. It also doesn't have that nifty ability to hide itself. It mostly serves as a certificate. There is a Potter ring, but it can only be worn by the actual Head(so not a minor) and that's it. Badges of Office, not Lantern Rings.

Yes, I always thought most fics don't explore how problematic Harry being in Slytherin can be, and in this one he wears the ring(because it makes him feel connected to his ancestors) since basically day one, so Second Year is worse than in canon(think Aurors showing up to take him for questioning, people leaving throwing dead snakes at him).

There will be more, but not in Britain, more to the east and in Greece, I am thinking of having some parselmagic involved, but mostly for healing.

Well as of now, he is going to leave in the summer before Second Year because he gets sick of them(after learning of his family), he runs to the dilapidated Potter Manor(no instant magical fortress full of house elves here) and claims it as his home(using an old ceremony), inadvertently breaking the wards and giving Dumbledore and himself lots of trouble. A theme will be him restoring the Manor and learning new things while doing it. The lack of wards will have consequences. This can change.

I don't like this whole blood ward thing because it's clearly an excuse, but here it can be useful to teach Harry to not do ceremonies he doesn't fully understand and that rash actions can have unforeseen consequences.
