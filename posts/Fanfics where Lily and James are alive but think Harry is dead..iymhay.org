I read some of that topic and I really liked it!

So if you have any recommendations I'll really appreciate it! Thanks in advance.

â€‹

EDIT 1: (I've read some of the most famous ones, like The Darkness Within)


** I've got a few. I love these types of stories as well! (Darkness Within is my all time favorite.)

Okay, first off is a story you may have read. It's the story that "Darkness Within" was based off of. It's called "A Shattered Prophesy." I will admit, I'm hesitant to recommend this one, because it is tragic. There's no special reconnection with Lily and James. If you are looking for a happy ending, then this is not the story for you.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy]]

Secondly, is a story called "Love and Love Again." I loved this one, but I will warn you it is NOT complete. I believe it was around thirty chapters in. It is unlike the others I am recommending, because Harry's backstory is different. He was not raised by Voldemort in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again]]

Lastly, is called "Light up the Sky." Again this is NOT complete (sorry) but I enjoyed it anyways. It was really cute and nice.

Hope these are helpful. :)

** I'm gonna have to recommend linkffn(From Ruin by GraeFoxx).

It isn't complete yet (and probably won't be for a good while yet), but as a patron of the author I can guarantee they're still working on it. There's also a lot of it already written.

It's very dark, though. There are much darker fics, of course, but From Ruin gets pretty damn dark.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

** This gets recommended all the time, but linkffn(A Black Comedy) has this. Harry travels to another dimension where he died but his parents lived.

Very little focus on his parents, but it is revealed at some point. Don't wanna spoil to much in the very unlikely event that you haven't already read the fic.

*** Woah, I remember reading that when it still was a wip. As it was literal ages ago I don't remember much including why I dropped off. Would You recommend going back to it? Did it have any weaker parts in the middle that are worth going throught?

**** Honestly, I think it's hilarious. A lot of people don't like its brand of humor, but it works great for me. I guess YMMV. It's pretty engaging all the way through. There are parts I might skip if I'm re-reading, but I've read it several times now. For your first time, I imagine you'll like it.

Might be several things from noping out, throught losing link and forgetting to follow or too difficult level of english as I was still learning then. I will give it another shot now. Thank You ðŸ™‚

** linkffn(I'm not a hero)

It's sorta a reverse of what you asked for - Lily and James are alive in St. Mungo's with Harry being unaware of it. It's an interesting take on WBWL where the brother isn't a complete ass, and they make up when they meet their parents. It also contains Dumbledore bashing that doesn't turn the guy into a caricature - him just being a guy who makes mistakes and is really hated by Harry. And something that's even rarer - a Daphne Greengrass that's a character, rather then a walking cliche.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)
