I'm looking for well-written, novel-length fics where Harry is as paranoid (or more than) Moody.

The more action-packed, the better!

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** I really like this series but it seems the author doesn't really like it and doesn't care that much about updating. While read it I saw lots of a/n's like "this will probably be the last one" or "this won't be updated again unless I feel like it". It's really sad because I found it very entertaining to read, with a strong characterization of lazy!harry.

** Not quite the length that you were looking for, but there is a Harry raised by Moody story in Rorschach's Blot's odd ideas collection.

It starts here: [[http://fanfiction.net/s/2565609/2/]]

There's several (at least three, I think) chapters. That only comes out to a few thousand words though.

***** It is slowly gaining sentience.

[[/u/Tusing]] will be forever more remembered thusly:

"Great. See, this is how it all starts. When we're all just organic batteries, guess who they'll blame? 'This is all [[/u/Tusing]]'s fault. What a tool he was. I have to spend all day computing pi because he plugged in the Overlord.'"

** Sadly not novel length, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3427377/1/Harry-gets-Motivated][Harry Gets Motivated]] has imperious induced paranoia in spades.

If someone managed to flesh out that concept into a novel length fic they'd be my hero. It is a pretty good idea, have someone imperious you to study and train hard and enjoy it.

Of course, letting Moody be the one to do it to you is of questionable logic....
