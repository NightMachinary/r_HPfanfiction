I am writing one with new OCs where it's about life in a school other than Hogwarts and based in America.

How many others would like to read about other schools across the Magical world? And what part of the world do you think would give the most interesting school?

Sorry, it is on Wattpad, but there are a ton of other Harry Potter fanfics there too.


** I really wanna see the magical schools in Amsterdam,Morocco,Thailand and Japan
