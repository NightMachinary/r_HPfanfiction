Read it a while ago, have totally forgotten the title, and Google's not helping. Set in canon era, but students were resorted every year; I'm pretty sure Harry got Slytherin at some point, but was in Gryffindor mostly. I don't think it was a terribly long fic. Sort of in the style of dirgewithoutmusic's boy with a scar series, I think. Thanks in advance!


** Huh, that's a really interesting idea. Hope you find it OP!

** Hmm, a search for "fanfiction hat resorts students annually" looks somewhat promising, with a couple featuring all 5th years being resorted each year.

** Not the right story, but next month's Book Club story has the element of resorting in it. The link is in the stickied post.

*** (I've read Hogwarts Divided) While it definitely has an emphasis on the Sorting Hat, I wouldn't say it has much to do about "resorting." It is much more about looking at the qualities of each house and young wizards/witches of Hogwarts thinking about the houses and why they belong. Also by the middle-end it was very, very little to do with houses imo (which is a good thing)!
