** The NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series has the main characters exploring some parts of Egypt, India, Australia, continental Europe and even briefly the Americas. But still the main story happens for the most part at Hogwarts.

** Linkffn(the accidental animagus) has a good bit of non-Britain WW, the short sequel of vignettes are all about various places in the WW (linkffn(the world of the accidental animagus)), setting up for the real sequel Animagus at War linkffn(animagus at war), where it seems like they're gonna go much more in depth with it, though it's still continuing.

The middle sequel is a really fun take. It explores one place on each continent, and I think you don't have to read the prequel to find it enjoyable.

  “I have kids," Clint said. "I know dad behavior when I see it.”Tony blinked multiple consecutive times, processing the statement. “Excuse me?”“Tony,” Steve said now, “how long have you had a son? And how come we've never known about him?”“Yeah,” Clint spoke again, “I thought I was the only one with a secret family. Turns out you've had one longer than me!”-------Peter gets to spend all summer living in Avengers Tower with Tony. When the Rogue Avengers get pardoned and come back to live at the Tower too, they're confused as to who Peter is. However, once they see how Tony acts around Peter, that confusion goes away, as they know for certain who Peter must be - Tony's secret son.Tony and Peter decide to make the most of the situation, and play along. They hope they can keep up the act all summer. But they soon learn that they barely have to act at all.
