** The fic was apparently named "Enticingly".

  Enticingly by ObsidianPen | 19K | WIP

  â€˜To be an alpha or an omega is to be ruled by your magical tendencies. They are governed by uncontrollable instinct rather than logic. Being a beta may not be nearly so romantic, but it is a life of freedom. You should all hope to be so lucky.' Years later, and Harry Potter, burning with an unnatural heat that was as unlikely as he was, couldn't have agreed with Snape's words more.

ObsidianPen recently asked readers not to share arround copies of some of their old fics that were taken down. I think it's best to err on the side of caution and assume that if the author wanted the fic to be shared then they would have kept it up online.

*** Thank you for your info. I don't know ObsidianPen asked us that. I just like that fics, it was a slow update fic, I waited for months so I can read couple of chapters at once. So sad that it was taken down.

Thank you.
