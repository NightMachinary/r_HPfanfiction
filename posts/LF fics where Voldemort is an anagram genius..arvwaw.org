Like ever since he was a kid, he'd ask people their names and quickly write out all the possible anagrams from them because he's obsessed with this concept.

Fast forward to when Tom becomes a Dark Lord, he's so good at it that he can do it all off the top of his head. This will probably come under crack, but are there any fics like this, perhaps?

*** You see, that's where it all started. Tom was honestly a normal boy who had an obsession with making anagrams, due to his odd middle name. He's been trying to make out any sort of hidden puzzle from his name, and other than ‘I am Lord Voldemort' did ‘Mr Tom a Dildo Lover' catch his attention.

It infuriated him, but it was a secret that only he knew. Next does his magical heritage become revealed to him. Of course! Now he'll use magic to solve his name and where it came from. And so on his way to Hogwarts --- Tom has fixated an obsession with Dumbledore after learning all of his names at once --- he makes ‘friends' and practises his raw talent in anagrams to make them bow to his feet.

But what happens next? Why, a fellow student who is a Muggleborn strolls inside and announces that they too are skilled in the art of anagrams. Tom has never met anybody who has come close to his level, not even his teachers in his Muggle school --- his friends are surrounding him, so he cannot stand down.

After proudly stating his full name for everyone to hear, Tom then allows the Muggleborn to show off their ‘knowledge' in the art while he constructs a plan in the back of his mind to reduce their self-esteem into mere ashes. But he's suddenly brought out of his brief dazing as his new friends begin to laugh. He asks what's funny and follows to where they are pointing to.

Mr Tom a Dildo Lover is floating in front of him as the Muggleborn mocks him as well when they choose to use his name as an example --- Tom goes insane before the Hogwarts Express even reaches the school. After he's sorted and alone in his bed, pure and utter hatred towards Muggleborns brews within him as his hand cannot stop with the anagrams of his name.

Then it appears --- I am Lord Voldemort. Tom grins as he swears to himself that he will be the greatest anagramist (yes, he's mad enough to make that up) that the world has ever seen --- first kill all Muggleborns and Muggles because why not, then show off his superior anagramy skills.

Upstairs, Dumbledore is twirling his beard with a twinkle in his eye as he senses a presence that may rival his unmatched skill in anagrams...

I don't know why I did all of this. Man, did I go off on a tangent.
