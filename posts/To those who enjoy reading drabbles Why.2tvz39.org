I happen to greatly dislike drabbles, but I still see them regularly when I'm browsing for new HP material to read. I've tried giving them a chance in the past, but the 100 word limit just doesn't do it for me. While I understand the appeal of one-shots and short stories for their brevity, drabbles seem like they take it to an extreme. To those of you who enjoy reading drabbles, is there something I'm missing? Have I just not read a really good one yet? Do you think it just depends on your reading style?


** The only drabbles I enjoy are those who pick out a specific dialouge or scene from the originals and rewrite it, altering important aspects of the story. But I don't seek them out, I stumble upon them.

** I think they're great for capturing a certain emotion, especially when it wouldnt work for a whole story

** I would analogize it to appreciating a pencil sketch "study" versus a fine oil painting. A drabble can paint a little vignette. The classic example of microfiction taken to the extreme, but still painting a coherent narrative is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn]["For sale: baby shoes, never worn."]]

** Ever read a poem?

Stories should be sized according to what one needs to write them effectively and some story concepts (e.g., [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4403728/1/Harry-James-Potter-Anagram][this one of mine]], which is about 200 words long) are better done in short form than long.

*** Agreed! A drabble is just a format, more suited for certain stories than others. IMO, the shorter stories are the hardest to write well. They're deceptively simple and can vary in style so much, I wouldn't be surprised if most people haven't read one they like.

It's the stories /over/ a certain length that make me wary; gratuitous writing is a bigger sin in my book.

** I write drabbles (under 1000 words but usually over 100) because when writing longer fiction, my ideas sometimes gets lost. Sometime with ficts, I want to just highlight certain scenes. For example, I am doing a drabble collection where Tom Riddle is only months older than Lucius and is being raised by his mother. Instead of doing a long drawn out fict about it, I just do snapshots of things I want the reader to know. It's very freeing instead of doing my usual planning process and easier to pants. Funny enough, I don't usually read things under 100k myself unless it's hellishly good.

** I wrote a 3,000 word long story once because a) I wanted to explore something in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][another author's universe]] and b) the idea wasn't big enough (or maybe my skills weren't good enough) to generate more content.

I am guessing something similar happens with “drabble” texts --- the novice authors either feel like they have something to say or just want to make their contribution to the community but their skills and/or self-discipline are not sufficient yet for producing a larger work.

You can also think about this in a statistical context --- a % from those who were writing 0<x<1,000 WL stories yesterday are writing 1,000<x<10,000 stories today and may write 10,000<x<? tomorrow.
