I'm looking for more stories like linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer) . Not necessarily Harry becoming a dark lord (though I *did* look through previous threads in this subreddit first), but where ending the war didn't actually fix anything. It didn't solve the prejudices, or the bigotry. There's an entire wizarding world still left to fix, and nobody seems willing to actually do something about it since the war is 'over' and they can go back to their lives. So Harry steps back up and gets his hands dirty.

*Preferences*:

60k+ words, but flexible

Passable grammar & spelling

On a site with a decent mobile format

*Requirements*:

Complete

That said, I'll take a look at whatever is recommended :) Thank you!


** *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): not only wasn't the Wizarding government willing to change, but it still had the nerve to pass a marriage law, the ultimate form of tyranny. Harry and Hermione basically went over the edge, started a revolution, and executed anyone who voted for the law. But foreign pureblood regimes were not happy to let this pass.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

****** I've also added a prologue which further explains why they thought violent revolution was the best way to react. And how the aftermath of the war went for the rank and file Death Eaters.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
