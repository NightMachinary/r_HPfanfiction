When Voldemort died, the Death Eaters who remained at large didn't really get up to much. Over a decade later, Lucius tossed a cursed object Voldemort had him hold onto in Ginny Weasley's cauldron. Two years after that, Crouch Jr. and Wormtail resurrected Tom, and the other Death Eaters had a bit of "World Cup fun".

​

So, if Voldemort had been well and truly dead, would there have been no conflict as such? Without Tom Riddle, would all that is evil in the wizarding world have remained...unorganised?

I refuse to believe that.

So, instead of making Harry completely OP, why not invent a more believable and rational villain than wizard!Hitler?\\
Don't get wrong, I love a bit of slice-of-life/boarding school shenanigans, but mostly I want to see Harry defeat some kind of Bad (even if it's himself) and I wanna see cool magic. In the same spirit as Snape inventing Sectumsempra and Muffliato, the Marauders becoming animagi and enchanting a piece of parchment into their wondrous map, and the inter-house rivalry/fighting.

So, maybe Harry IS the Boy Who Lived, but Dumbledore pretends he defeated Voldemort, so Harry doesn't have a target on his back and can have a normal childhood. The Potters are alive and they're good parents. Harry doesn't have any siblings, and makes quick friends with Ron. One summer, they get drunk or high off some herbs from mah boi Neville and steal Mr. Weasley's Ford Anglia and end up in Albania with Draco Malfoy, of all people. Friendships get tested, enemies sometimes becomes friends, and Harry does progressively crazier things until he figures fuck it all, and casts fiendfyre. And let me tell you, he loves it, nothing's ever made as much sense as this. not even firewhisky. What starts as ye ol' teenage rebellion ends in some serious fuckery our lil buddy Harry.

​

Anyway, I've clearly run out of ideas. Mainly, I'm just curious as to what y'all think re: potential sources of conflict in a world where Harry is the BWL, no one but his parents and Dumbledore know about it, and Voldemort is very dead.


** It depends on the story you want to tell. Within Britain, Malfoy is the most obvious one - it wouldn't take much to have him be a more politically focused Voldemort (with less raw power), and I could certainly see him using both the more malleable death eaters (taking control of them/making his own organization) and the more fanatical (spinning them off/encouraging attacks to give him more political power).

There are other options, of course. You could take certain magical creature factions, and make them start to rise up/agitate more directly. Without Voldemort, for instance, maybe Fenrir Greyback is doing his own thing. Maybe it's Vampires or hags, or all of them - the second class citizens that Magical Britain ignores/hurts.

There's always the option of taking someone or a group from outside the UK, as well. The magical world is woefully underdeveloped - and concocting a volatile geopolitical situation would not be too difficult to put in place for a major magical war/conflict. Same with spillover conflicts - if Britain is stable in this universe, perhaps another nearby one /isn't/, and that could affect the UK directly or indirectly.

A final option that I can think of is some sort of secretive society could provide for a useful villain figure. Maybe it's one dedicated just to their own power, and some of the artifacts left behind by Slytherin/the Founders, Merlin, and Voldemort appeal to them for their power - and they start to move on destabilizing Britain to give them an opening to seize them. Maybe you want to play up a more demonic or eldritch flair that we don't see in standard HP - and make them want to summon an evil demonic entity.

In your case, I think I would lean towards either Malfoy or a group targeting artifacts. You want a bad guy who will come after Harry or Hogwarts, and not be /too/ strong, I'd guess - and both of those would have the desire to do so.

** Malfoy, if he manages to organize the death eaters into something more similar to mafia. Less murder, more organized crime. Murder is bad for business after all.

I feel Bellatrix is too much of a loose cannon to be a proper high end villain.

Some fics have Rookwood as an ex-unspeakable who gets really dangerous. He could become a solo threat too.

*** Yeah, my favorite option is Rookwood as well. He has the most potential to be truly dangerous since he was an Unspeakable. Malfoy has money, but c'mon... he lost against dobby when he foolishly tried to Avada Kedavra Harry in Hogwarts (also points out that he isn't that smart and rather emotional - easy to trigger). Malfoy does have some potential due to his connections, but that won't keep him long in power since that type of situation calls for betrayal/corruption. He will never be able to control an organization of dangerous psychos only with money alone - you need to have personal power too.\\
Rookwood should be able to use his knowledge that he gathered in his time as Unspeakable to enhance his strength with rituals/blood-magic/ and who knows what. He also seems more ruthless since he went to Azkaban for his crimes instead of acting like a cowardly victim who was forced against his will. People like this are more dangerous since they are not dependant on their environment (social connections/family/ etc).

My second favorite for a villain would be Fenrir Greyback. He was a stupid brute in the books, but still extremely dangerous. Hive him the brain of Hannibal Lecter or so and magical Britain will drown in blood. That guy is a savage, a psycho and a nefarious sadist, and dreams about a world that is ruled by werewolves. Greyback is the only one besides Voldy who has an agenda. He wants to turn as many people as possible into werewolves and form some kind of army of vicious beasts.

** Lucius is the prime candidate. Still believes in blood supremacy, doesn't have the martial might of Voldemort but is maybe even better at uniting the wizarding world towards his vision, given how successful he is at influencing Fudge and the board of governors.

This is a bit more political of a story, catching Lucius in lies and showing people what his real goals are and that Lucius doesn't really have their best interests at heart, while also avoiding plausibly deniable assassination attempts rather than pitched battles.

** I think it would still be Death Eaters, but not necessarily under that name. The thing is, the hatred of muggleborns/halfbloods and things like muggle baiting existed waaaay before Voldemort. He's just a guy taking advantage of an already available base of followers. Without their leader the Death Eaters as an organization may have fallen apart, but with all that resentment and bigotry, it was really only a matter of time before they as either individuals or small group start going for the hate crimes again. Especially if Harry wasn't used as a symbol of Voldemort's defeat. Without the propaganda figure of the powerful boy-who-lived I doubt so many of the death eaters would have gone underground. I don't know if any one would ever take Voldemort's place as a leader again, but I don't think it really matters. Someone like Malfoy in a position of power can cause a lot more damage by making laws that limit muggleborn's quality of life than by attacking them one at a time. At the same time, eventually events like the world cup would become more frequent as the hate group grew in confidence and there would probably be a lot more lone actions than there was when Voldemort had the reins. In a way they would be more dangerous disorganized and attacking or sabotaging muggles/muggleborns/blood traitors/etc.. because the only way to really take down a leaderless hate group is to catch every member and to kill their ideology before the next generation embraces it.

** Umbridge, Fudge, Malfoy, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and of course *Barty Crouch Jr* can all be made into credible enemies.

Let's just assume that Barty Sr lost control of Jr at beginning of Year 4, he killed Sr, escaped, and tried to avenge his fallen Dark Lord. He then busted his comrades from Azkaban, and together they could wreck some serious havocs.

** I'm not sure what your question is. The villain or source of conflict can be anything the author wants- from real people to monsters to concepts and ideas. Your only limit is your imagination.

- Mental health like depression, anxiety, etc. Harry can deal with his time with the Dursleys. Even worse if Voldemort is truly dead and he didn't need the protection so there was no point in his suffering.
- Corrupt government/ politicians- Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean the pureblood ideology is dead. (Stalin and Hitler have been dead for over 50 years and yet there are still imbeciles that believe in their ideology.) So you can focus on Harry fighting the ideology of blood purists and the laws that discriminate. Mind you, some people will consider fics that focus on politics a bit dull.
- Bring back the old villain *cough* Rise of Skywalker *cough*. Just have Grindelwald escape the prison. Or have a horcrux and come back to life.
- Or you can always go for even older stories. Frankenstein, Dracula (just got a tv series BTW), The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Monk, etc. Or even older- you can go biblical with demons and stuff like Supernatural. Or even /more/ older- Egyptian mummies (fun movie from the late '90s), Greek mythology is full of various beasties (not to mention Zeus having sex with everything with a pulse). Say Harry meets Bill and decides to become a curse breaker. Visits some ancient tomb, unearths an evil long forgotten and feels responsible about defeating it. Kind of like Indiana Jones and Lara Croft.
- Or you can have Harry be an auror and investigate murders. Though I'm not sure what novelty one can bring to that genre. Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle pretty much nailed it.
- I suppose you can always throw him in some sort of a "forbidden" and tragic relationship and create as much conflict as you want between Harry and his love interest and the love interest's parents. But that's just boring.

** Well... I think Harry deep-down is just a good person, even with a bad upbringing he still had a lot of "moral fibre" in him that makes him avoid antagonism or hurtful behaviour. I don't like the idea of him "snapping" in the way you describe. Most Dark Harry stories tend to oversimplify the deterioration of his character and it irritates me. And if Harry is the Boy Who Lived then wouldn't his parents be dead still? Unless you change that too.

Anyway, there's lots of options for opponents to naturally occur without Voldemort.

1. Lucius Malfoy (or some other smart former-Death Eater), pulls the strings behind the Ministry to cause problems. His motivations being a sociopathic need control / megalomania / greed / sense of superiority and so forth.

2. The Ministry of Magic itself as the villian. Even without someone behind the scenes pulling the strings, the Ministry makes mistakes, or takes a course of action, or implements policy that causes problems and sets them in opposition to Harry and his friends.

3. The Death Eaters in Azkaban are broken out or escape (or are they released early?), what actions do they take on society/Harry/Dumbledore/the Ministry when they have their chance for revenge?

4. Grindelwald follower resurgence / Grindelwald returns?

5. Rogue Auror or Department of Mysteries employee etc. Rogue killer/serial killer sort of thing

6. Dumbledore turns against the Ministry for whatever reason

7. Basilisk loose from Chamber of Secrets

8. Some new self-proclaimed Dark Lord etc. You'd have to invent him/her yourself. What does the Order do? What does the Ministry do? What happens at Hogwarts? What happens in the TriWizard tournament? etc etc.

Honestly you could say more than half of this about a lot of countries today. America included. The President of the US has a fuck load of executive powers they can use. Trump could literally decide to end the world today. And half the world wouldn't even be surprised.

And don't even get me started on the wild shit people believe in because the news or the internet. If anything, Rowling made that part /very/ realistic.

***** But Dumbledore didn't believe in the prophecy. He explicitly says this in HBP. He tells Harry he's free to turn his back on the prophecy and that the only reason it even matters at all is because Voldemort thinks so.

Furthermore, he also tells Harry that he can stay dead in DH. If the prophecy was absolutely true, only Harry would be able to finish Voldemort off. But Dumbledore seems perfectly fine with Harry choosing to stay dead.

What I don't get is how low standards some people have regarding good and evil. Or how deluded some people are that they will listen to what is told to them but not /think/ about what they're seeing. Both of this is very applicable to Dumbledore in both canon and fanfiction. For example, I've lost count of the number of stories where Dumbledore has been accessory to child abuse, involved in throwing innocent people in prison or had kept silent when he has proof of innocence and still I'm being told in the story that he's /not/ evil. Just because he wants to defeat Voldemort doesn't make him a good person; his intentions don't make him a good person, if his actions are categorically evil, he's evil no matter what his intentions are.

** I don't think it would have remained disorganized. At the end of the day, the real antagonist of the series is the culture itself. The culture of the wizarding world lends itself to creating division within itself. Using classifications such as muggleborn, half-blood, pureblood is within itself divisive. This type of environment will have a demagogue rising up that consolidates this type of mentality to the determinant of the rest of population.

I think the best way to explore this concept is by incorporating political intrigue with the rise of a new leader that consolidates this type of feeling.

** Follow World history and pick a character that best falls in line with the "evil" faction. In a way WWI and WWII are both Great Wizarding Wars. The Pureblood elites targeting muggles and muggleborns. I know Grindlewald was more against the Statute of Secrecy and muggles but his supporters obviously felt they were the superior class.

You could write Wizarding Britain at civil war against a move towards a "safe" regime which is actually a move toward a totalitarian state by the Ministry. I think it would offer great dynamic for former Deatheaters to align with Phoenix members because their common enemy is the Ministry itself. People who were once allies would become enemies.
