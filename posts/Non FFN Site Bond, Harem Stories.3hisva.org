** Bond stories are a guilty pleasure of mine as well. Have you checked out AO3? I know some authors have switched to publishing primarily on there instead of on FFN. I'll edi t this post shortly with some on there after I make sure they're not on FFN.

Edit: So apparently AO3 is dominated by HP/[Insert Slytherin Male]. I'll keep looking.

**** The few stories I found involving the word bond or soul bond (And variations) were either really short, slash, Harry/Ginny, or already on FFN. Sorry! Hopefully people will know of some elsewhere.

** This might be a stupid question but what is a "Harem" or "Bonding" Story I generally am narrow sighted when i look for something to read so I don't know that I've stumbled across any of these.

*** Harem means multiple females per male. Bonding stories are generally just called soul-bond fics. Usually this means two people touch/kiss/meet for the first time and a magical connection forms and they fall in love. Usually with granted powers, like telepathy.

These are generally looked down upon(for good reason) because they're pretty much universally shit. Harem fics are written by teenage boys who like the thought of having a stable of women to themselves, soul-bond fics are written by teenage girls who want a perfect fairytale romance.

I've read a couple soul-bond fics that are good, because they change the equation where the bond isn't some amazing thing and has severe problems, the two people don't just suddenly love each other. I can only think of one harem story I really liked and it was humorous which makes it much easier to stomach. It was also H/Hr/L and not Harry + 20 girls or some shit.

edit: I should also say that as bad as they are, I keep reading more of them.

** I am hesitent to give you [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][this site]], but they have the single greatest seach engine on the internet (Better than google) when the authers use the tags correct. And due to their no slash rule they are a breeding ground for Harem, Taboo parings and nearly all imagenable guilty plesures.

Soo be hesitant when you go into it, but maybe you will find what you seek.

Edit: They even have search options and catagories for Bonds of all kinds and Harems, heck it's possible to combine those ones and find fics with all the things.

** I have two stories that involve a bond. The first is short and bond isn't mentioned; the second is the sequel to the first, is in progress, and the bond develops slowly - I'm not a teen girl and the story isn't meant to be a fairy-tale romance. :)
