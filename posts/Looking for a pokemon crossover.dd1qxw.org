I'm looking for a specific pokemon/harry potter crossover, all i remember was that every magical got sick, and when they got better they had turned into pokemon, Harry was a mew, Dumbledore was an alakazam, Hermione was a ralts, and Ron was a cyndaquil, among others


** Hmm...the only story I know of where Harry is a Mew is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4826372/1/Harry-Mewter][Harry Mewter]], which I suspect you already know. Hermione ended up an Eevee and Ron ended up an Entei in that one.

Um, are you sure you don't remember anything else? Do you remember which site it was on? Do any specific scenes come to mind (aside from 'everyone finds out they're a pokemon')?\\
Actually, did the characters in the story recognise that they're pokemon-pokemon, or did they come up with new species names and such?\\
Did they stay in the Harry Potter world, or did they end up travelling to the Pokemon world?

*** they were all in the harry potter world, it was just before second year, cause i'm pretty sure it was lockhart as the def professor, i think draco was an eevee, yeah hermione recognizes that they are pokemon-pokemon cause a family member loves the games/show, and i remember harry trying to open up the gargoyle to dumbledore's office by speaking to it telepathically but stone doesn't have a mind to connect to, and it was on fanfiction.net. oh, and some of them were more pokemon fusions than outright pokemon, cause draco might of been an eevee but he still walked on two feet

**** I'm searching fanfiction.net now, but I'm not having much luck. I did find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11276664/1/Hissy-Fit][Hissy Fit]], it's a small collection of Harry-as-a-pokemon one-shots that distracted me for a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/Pok%C3%A9mon-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/80/224/][https://www.fanfiction.net/Pok√©mon-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/80/224/]]\\
I don't know how to get through all of this...I tried searching for Harry P. and Mew character tags but there were only a few fics and none of them seemed to match.
