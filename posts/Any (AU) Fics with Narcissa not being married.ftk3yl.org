I got curious for the title. AU Fics that might still has some Canon consistencies, like Tom Riddle or some sort of things. However, she and Lucius dont marry.....or if, it happens rather late. The fic doesnt have to be from her POV or Narcissa-centric, so one of the Canon characters can still "visit" her and its from his/her view

This has a nice Narcissa centered subplot
