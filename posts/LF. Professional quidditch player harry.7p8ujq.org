I'm looking for some more after the war fanfics where Harry is a professional quidditch player with some storyline. I've read vitam Paramus. Looking for something similar. Possibly a romance?


** I also wrote linkffn(6862426) which is also a post Hogwarts quidditch based fic. it focuses more on game stuff whereas VP deals more with the day-to-day.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

*** Hey. How cool is it to get a response from the very author of Vitam Paramus. Feel like I've met a celebrity. I just finished re-reading Vitam Paramus. Will re-read the quidditch world cup too. Thanks for the rec

** After Vitam Paramus, the first one that comes to my head is linkffn(7711029). It does have a lot of issues though, mostly with believability. But it's an okay time waster.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** linkffn(Harry and the Veela by Z-Bond)

It has a lot of issues, and it is pretty tropey but it is Harry as a pro quidditch player.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD
