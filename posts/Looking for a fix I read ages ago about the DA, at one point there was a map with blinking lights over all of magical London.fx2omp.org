They operated out of the room of requirement and I think were weeding out death eaters? I remember one giant scene where they had a large marauders-like map of London and Ron was strategizing a battle while watching this map. I can't remember much else unfortunately!

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
