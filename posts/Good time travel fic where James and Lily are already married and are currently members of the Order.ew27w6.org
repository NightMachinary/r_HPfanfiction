I am very sorry in advance if this is incredibly cliche. I am still new to looking for Harry Potter fics. Can the fic also have it to where Harry tells the truth and works together with the Order to fight Voldemort? Preferably no slash.


** Well, "face death in the hope" ticks all of your boxes, although it is tagged as slash. There's been no romance so far, though. The charactarization of James and Lily is great in my opinion.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** So, my favorite fic has time travel to the period after Lily and James are married, but Hermione is the protagonist, not Harry. Hermione goes to 169 days prior to the potters' deaths. Linkffn(one hundred sixty nine by Mrs. J's soup).

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
