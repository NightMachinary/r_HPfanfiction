** I am eager for it to contine, but I found his letter to be really stuffy. Like, I somehow doubt he retains that much of a air about him and could still be a bit attractive.

Maybe cut that back a little? Other than that, fantastic so far!

** I think RON is way too OOC in this. Ron Weasley caring so much about grades is quite baffling. Also way too much shout speech. However I will continue to read as at least the premise is interesting well as long is doesn't turn into another RW/SM borefest
