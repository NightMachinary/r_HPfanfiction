So, I'm searching for something like this:

For those who don't know it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2737363/1/Twists-of-Fate][Twists of Fate]] is a great fanfic with a Harry turned Vampire in it. He's called Ryan Lupin in it and the much beloved werewolve Remus took on the role of a father. Lily and James Potter survived the attack of Voldemort just to find their baby boy lying in the crib, undead. Turned into a vampire by one of Voldemorts underlings. They wanted to kill him to end Harry's suffering but Lupin stepped in and took him away from the Potters. The story starts when Harry aka. Ryan enters Hogwarts in the third year.

I love the premise of the whole story but it is pretty much dead, unfortunatly. And by pretty much dead I mean that the last update was in 2006.

So yea, do you know some other Vampire!Harry stories that don't go all out Twilight? If^{they^{sparkle^{imma^{cut^{someone}}}}}


** Sounds great. Except for the retarded name change

*** I am wondering what's the point of marking it as Harry Potter being the main character if its basically an OC.

**** I think that because it is Harry Potter, but instead of just saying that he's a vampire, the author actually thought the whole thing through and Ryan Lupin is what came out of that process.
