*** There's a Worm/MoL/Naruto/Homestuck crossover on Spacebattles where characters in each randomly get an interdimensional channel allowing them to communicate with each other. Not very good, though, I think the author just made it to see what would happen. There aren't any big issues with the writing, but the premise is weak and the author hasn't made it obvious what plot they've got in mind for it if any.

**** It will come eventually. MoL is just far too good not to attract fanfiction authors.
