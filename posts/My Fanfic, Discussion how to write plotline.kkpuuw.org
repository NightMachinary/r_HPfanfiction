So I'm writing a fanfic, it's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13771108/1/The-Magician][The Magician]] . I'm pretty new to this and everything is a work in progress so keep that in mind. The only things I've changed so far is that Neville is the BWL and Harry ran away from the Dursleys. I've finished the first year and I was wondering who I should have him be on the Hogwarts Express with for the second year. I could just have him sit with the Golden Trio again but I could also have him interact with plenty of other characters. Thoughts?


** Maybe he could meet Colin Creevey

*** Interesting thought. Colin would likely be start struck by Neville and spend most of his time annoying Harry. Where do you see this going?

**** Maybe instead of annoying then nev finds him endearing so takes him on as a genuine friend

***** Sorry I should have been more clear. The story is still Harry-centric so I was asking whom he would ride with. Also it would be out of character for people to find Colin endearing. I'm trying to write a more realistic plot where the only change is in the beginning and the rest is from a butterfly effect.

** hmm. Personally, i don't think the cannon trio is plausible in this AU. I that ron would be Neville's friend, not harry's. (I'm not bashing or anything, but don't you think ron would be slightly more attracted to the BWL instead of a child run away?) As for Hermione, I imagine it depends. I haven't read your fic so I can see it going one of two ways. If harry is hardened by his time on the streets/at an orphanage, I could see him being angry or annoyed at Hermione's naivete; if not, I think he would be sympathetic to a social outsider like he used to be/is. For other possible friendships, I would have to say it depends on which house you have planned for him to be in. For Ravenclaw, I personally would like to see more terry boot & harry friend fics. For Hufflepuff, perhaps Justin flinch-fletchley? Honestly, from the summary you've provided, I don't think he would be fit for Gryffindor, but if you decided otherwise, I have never seen a good harry fic with dean and Seamus as his best friends. Lastly, for Slytherin, I have a somewhat peculiar idea. I was thinking maybe he would be independent for a year (so no friends, or just study-pals with Blaise or Theodore not) and then bond with Astoria Greengrass? These are all suggestions, so feel free to ignore them, but I hope you consider it!

*** Sorry I should have been more clear, when I said Golden Trio I meant Neville, Ron, and Hermione who are all in Gryffindor. Harry is in Slytherin. He's acquainted with the golden trio but doesn't call them friends.
