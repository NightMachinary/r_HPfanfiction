This man was about to shit his colorful robes, lol. I have no idea why I never thought about that.

EDIT: I'm not sure why my phone autocorrected Dumbledore to singular possessive, but I'm very disappointed. :(


** I never believed what he said to be the whole truth. Seems more like that Rowling just either amended the RoR to fit his story, while also pretending that Dumbledore was hinting something useful to Harry, when in reality he knew where the RoR was and how to get in. Just didn't know ALL of its uses, perhaps.

*** No, in GoF Harry notes that Dumbledore gave him a significant look while telling his story. He obviously knew about the room, but he couldn't very well tell Harry that in public given how abusable the room is.

Yes, I said as much. My point of Dumbledore not knowing all of it uses, its simply because he probably didn't know the "Room of Lost Things" else he could've deduced the possibility of Riddle hiding a horcrux in it, considering the time it took for Riddle to get to his office and back. Its just a speculation, we simply don't know what Rowling wanted for Albus to know.

**** Few things in life are humorous if you think about it, in my experience. For instance, you might think a pupper playing with a ball is cute and funny, but if you think about it, you might just realise that he's actually honing his grappling and agressive tendencies. Or not, this could be just BS, if you think about it. :)

*** Well that sounds very likely. But it could be just that he was pacing thinking about something that the room of requirement couldn't give him, but did need to use the bathroom so it gave him that. Since it was also on his mind.

When you get older, you'll find the meandiering creeps in even there. Along with forgetting why you'd got up, which I didn't think was even /possible/ until the first time it happened to me.

***** Canon door is Hufflepuff, only revealed when you actually need the help and display determination to get it.

Gryffindor's RoR was guarded by a modified boggart that transformed into something like a dragon or nundu or whatever and students would have to battle it to progress- later deemed "unsafe" despite the random monsters never killing anyone and this RoR was bricked over by the Ministry around the same time the Triwizard Tournaments were canceled.

Ravenclaw's RoR wasn't really hidden or guarded or anything, it's just a random broom closet that acts like a random broom closet to anyone that hasn't gone through the Founder's little scavenger-hunt in the library and read between the lines of each book to get the secret.

Slytherin's RoR is actually the Chamber of Secrets, it's true purpose was only told to scions of noble families with the other more sinister rumor being spread around to ensure nobody too gullible for the House of Cunning would go looking for it. Unfortunately, all the noble families in on the secret died in the various Crusades (Because like any good chivalrous wizards of Merlin's tradition, they were all super-royalists even if they weren't too big on the Pope) before they got a chance to tell their heirs. Much later, Tom stumbles on Salazar's personal entrance hoping to find a monster to kill muggleborns with, so the RoR helpfully makes a basilisk for him.

** I can see doing this myself.

Need to go to the restroom, start heading that way while thinking. A stray thought catches my attention and I begin to pace back and forth while thinking it out. Meanwhile the need to use the restroom increases but I ignore it while working out my flash of inspiration.

Without consciously thinking about it: having a restroom just appear would be incredibly convenient. And so it does.

** There seems to be a number of conspiracy theorys about Dumbledore being aware of the RoR but my thoughts on it have always been to take what he says there at face value.

The RoR and the Headmaster's office are both on the 7th floor, Dumbledore spends a lot of time in his office so it's not strange to think that sometimes he needs to stretch his legs. Dumbledore is an old man, is he going to climb lots of staircases up and down just to take a break from his paperwork or to do some thinking? Or will he just wander around the corridor his office is already on?
