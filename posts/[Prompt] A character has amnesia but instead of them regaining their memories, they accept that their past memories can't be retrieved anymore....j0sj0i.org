... And they build a new life for themselves?

A thought just popped up that what if after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry loses all the memories of his life up until he fell made this declaration in the book:

"That wand's more trouble than it's worth." said Harry. "And quite honestly," he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, "I've had enough trouble for a lifetime."

He wakes up the following day with retrograde amnesia. And then to make things different, there is no magical or mundane way for him to regain those memories, which worries the people around him. I know that it's going to hurt the people around him a lot that they're grieving and Harry can't because he's forgotten the people who died but I'm not looking for that kind of story.

I'm looking for something a bit further along the future where Harry eventually is OK with his condition. He could have been placed in St. Mungo's but was released after a few years because he's not Lockhart level helpless. He has retained his motor, language and magical skills. While the rest of Wizarding World romanticizes him as a tragic figure for losing his memories in exchange for the final defeat of Voldemort, Harry accepts his memory loss and rolls with it. He probably moves to another country. So really, this memory loss is almost like a blessing for him where he can restart his life.

Anyway, as a background check to see of anyone has ever written anything like this, I found these fics:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13082262]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/Eternal-Sunshine-of-the-Scourgified-Mind]])

The characters eventually regained their memories in these.

As background reading, too, I found this article on retrograde amnesia: [[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/amnesia-and-the-self-that-remains-when-memory-is-lost/266662/]]


** I just recced this fic earlier - Swung by Serafim linkao3(9821300) is based on this premise. Lockhart's obliviate spell worked. Ron only loses a few minutes, but Harry loses all memories after Voldemort killing his parents. Harry is starting from scratch, a blank slate, while everyone else has preconceived ideas about who he is.

Snape makes an offhand comment "maybe it will be an improvement" that Harry 2.0 takes to heart. He befriends Snape, mostly against Snape's will, because everyone else is looking for the original Harry. Meanwhile Harry 2.0 is like "I'm happy now, it sounds like I wasn't before, why would I want those memories back?"

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** You know, it'd be an interesting take on this.

Harry's relationships with people, like anyone would be, were defined by his memories and experiences of them.

While his personality would be the same, the attachments he had to people would be gone.

That'd have both positive and negative effects, and how he'd interact with people would depend on how they interact with him now.

IIRC there was a take on this in a Buffy fanfiction, where Xander gets wiped -- the Scoobies keep their distance from him, hoping to keep him safe through ignorance, and he just says "fuck it", ups and leaves for Los Angeles because he has no apparent ties in Sunnydale, and everyone's like "wait, wait? He left? Why?".

Xander didn't know them, outside of gossip, and that gossip was apparently 'false'. So, he left. No attachments, no interest.
