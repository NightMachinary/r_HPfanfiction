I'm trying to find more femharry stories


** You should probably change to the request flair as that's more appropriate here.

And if you don't mind femslash, here's a couple of stuff I really love:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8660698][Yule Ball Panic]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/philosophize/pseuds/philosophize][philosophize]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19990375][Calming Draught, Taken Twice Daily]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/OxfordOctopus/pseuds/OxfordOctopus][OxfordOctopus]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19181719][Stars Out]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/wynnebat/pseuds/wynnebat][wynnebat]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002564/1/Holly-Poter-and-the-Trials-of-Asking-Her-Crush-to-the-Yule-Ball][Holly Poter and the Trials of Asking Her Crush to the Yule Ball]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6938788/Violet-Rose-of-Darkness][Violet Rose of Darkness]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929][Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Enigmaris/pseuds/Enigmaris][Enigmaris]]

And then here's some great gen stuff:

(Warning: they both include discussions of sexual abuse)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25917352][Swiftly Falling Snow]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Welfycat/pseuds/Welfycat][Welfycat]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19750132][Skeletons in Her Closet]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/OxfordOctopus/pseuds/OxfordOctopus][OxfordOctopus]]

There is also the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/160208][Eyesight]] series where Harry is genderqueer. It's poly though, so YMMV.

** Flair should be 'Request' instead of 'What's that fic'. WTF means you're looking for a certain fic in particular.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (deviation from canon is exponential, but slow to start). See first chapter for preface discussion of background/differences from canon. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  The Girl Who Lived is young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. A story of her mischief and troubles in her fourth year of Hogwarts. New tasks, humor, fem!Harry/Fleur. Not related to my other story, Tales of Three.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

  what if Harry Potter had been born a girl? Would the Dursleys have treated him differently? Would he have the same friends? Would he be in the same house? Now starting 6th year!
