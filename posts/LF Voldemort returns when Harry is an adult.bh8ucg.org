Hey guys! Another one for you all. I'm looking for stories that involve Voldemort returning when Harry is an adult. Does not have to follow canon per say. Would prefer if Voldemort was forced to wait to return rather than a third coming of Voldemort, but either is fine. Would prefer Het pairings but any pairings would work.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily survived and fled magical Britain, and Harry never went to Hogwarts. Voldemort came back in 2005, significantly changed his strategy, and is doing very well in 2023.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): After Hallowing 1981, Lucius Malfoy showed more competence and managed to take over Magical Britain. Dumbledore had to flee for France with his remaining followers, but they would have their revenge 18 years later. Dumbledore's first move: find and resurrect Voldemort, but with a twist.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
