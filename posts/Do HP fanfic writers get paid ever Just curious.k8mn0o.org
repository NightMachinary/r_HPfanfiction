** Yes and no. I don't think you can be paid directly for a specific fanfiction, but fanfic authors have been known to solicit funds for Patreon accounts and the like. That way, you're not buying a specific story, just supporting them so that they can concentrate on their ‚Äúart‚Äù.

It was kind of distasteful for me, but I guess they earned enough to make it worth their while. Just be warned that for those that go this route, they have to churn out popular mass-market fanfic to appeal to as many people as possible. They're no longer an artist, they're an assembly line.

Again, not my thing, but I try not to judge if it's legal.

  Interesting. My main reason for asking is bc the quality of some of these fics is so damn good, better than actual non HP books I've read, so I wonder if the HP fanfic writers who are truly talented get paid for it.

**** I know what you mean. There are a few authors I would give a few bucks to, because their stories are so hauntingly lovely and thought provoking and you know they must have sank so many hours into producing something like that.

However, in my experience the Venn diagram between these authors and the ones with Patreon accounts almost never overlap, so... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** While fanfics authors can't be (legally) paid for their fics (even though they can be "supported" by Patreon or other means), the more "serious" authors usually use fanfics to hone their skill. It's not very rare for the most talented one to have publised their own books on the side, sometimes even a reworked version of their fanfics (50 shades of gray beinh the best known example).

** I dont know the legality of it all but people do commissions. A few years ago, I saw someone on Tumblr who has a six month waiting list and since their commissioned works take precedence over their own WIPs, she's telling people if they want another chapter, they have to pay for it...and people were. A few blogs I followed had KoFi, buy someone a coffee, and they would submit a prompt and the prompt would usually be written as a drabble or one-shot

my understanding from a few threads i read is that is that it's legal to take money for fanfic commissions, because they're just paying for your time/expertise in writing them. This is similar to how fan artists take commissions. BUT it's illegal to "sell" a fanfic to multiple people - ie, you write the fic/chapter, then people pay to see it/for you to post it.

*** I wonder if writing on commission is legally any different than creating visual art on commission ü§î it's extremely popular for artists to take commissions and even sell merch for characters in fandom, but I have never seen a FF author do the same.

** Not for fanfiction. People cannot make revenue from fanfiction. It's also illegal and against the ToS on fanfiction hosting sites to advertise your Patreon/commissions, though you can still find authors doing that.

** Ao3 makes a point of mentioning they are a non-profit site but i see some authors linking a Patreon in their notes section not exactly saying 'give me money' but its there if people were inclined to.

Also I see people saying 'this was a commission' a lot these days money is involved behind the scenes but you are not directly allowed to ask for payment you have to be Weasley (pun intended) about it. Like people are paying you because they like you not for your actual work haha

*** It's against AO3 terms of service to link Patreon. If anyone who does that gets reported, the author gets punished for violating those terms (I'm unaware of the particulars, but I know it's happened).

** The answer is no. But actually yes? They'd get their pants sued off by Rowling and Universal if they collected money for their work, but I'm willing to bet some set up patreons, and get donations through that. It's also not unheard of fanfic authors are later able to make successful original works while utilizing the writing experience they gained while writing fanfiction.

** Ok. To everyone saying that it's illegal to get paid for, and a gray area to write.

Ms. Rowling (the person who owns the copyrights to HP) said that as long as no one charged for it, it was fine. This makes writing it fine. Can't argue with the copyright holder. And, if you don't charge for it, you can make money off it. Ads and such.

*** Are you certain? I thought that it was the opposite, that JKR had a history of going after fanfic writers. So many fics set in the Harry Potter universe or that use the characters start with a disclaimer that no $ is being made off the work (I have seen lots that are semi-serious appeals directly to JKR). I have never seen these same sorts of disclaimers or appeals in any other fandoms that I read fic from. However, these are older HP fics (5+ years old) on FFN - maybe she's loosened up?

** The closest I can think of was the author of Methods Of Rationality asking for donations to the non profit he worked at, in order to release chapters quicker. But that caused a bit of a controversy so it stopped pretty quick.
