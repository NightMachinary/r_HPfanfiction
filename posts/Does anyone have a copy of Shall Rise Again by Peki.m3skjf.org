So I used to be really into HP fanfiction back in the day and this was by far my favourite fic. It's actually still one of my favourite fictional things ever and I occasionally reread it. However, the author seems to have taken down the last ten or so chapters off the livejournal where she used to publish it and she never did reupload the corrected versions.

I also saw that the people on the dracoandginny.com forums sent each other pdf copies by email but I couldn't find the password to my old account and couldn't bother making a new one at the time so I never ended up asking them and the forums are now down for maintenance.

I was wondering if someone maybe had a copy and, if yes, if they could send it to me.

I adore this fic, it kept me alive and hopeful through so many rough patches in my life and the last, like, three re-reads I did since the last part because I can't find it anywhere and the author's not responding.

Thank you in advance!


** I'm still looking! ;) These fics have a way of eventually showing up again. So don't lose hope yet.
