So I've read several alternate Sorting fics and I'm looking for more. I'm specifically looking for well written fics with little to no character bashing about Hermione being sorted into Ravenclaw, and I've already looked at HPMOR so I don't need any links to that one. Any links would be greatly appreciated.


** Seconding this search, are there fics where she /thrives/ in Ravenclaw, especially independently of a Ravenclaw!Harry or some other Designated Romantic Interest? [1]

There is a significant number of fics where she gets sorted there mainly to facilitate a Genius!Harry/(NotAsGenius)!Hermione 'ship [2]; or is lonely and/or bullied by everyone until her Designated Love Interest arrives on the scene and starts Defending Her Honor.

There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359064/][The Ravenclaw Chronicles]] by ivorynightfall, but it's only gotten as far as the third year and hasn't updated since late 2010.

[1] Of course, in HPMOR, she [[/s][SPOILER for late chapters of HPMOR]].

[2] A certain fanfic with an avian title comes to mind.

*** Yeah, this is pretty much what I want, with Hermione thriving without derailing her. Ravenclaw Chronicles is mostly good, but the Ginny bashing gets pretty annoying (I will never understand people who say that she's a stalker.

**** It's been too long since I'd read it. It did tweak Hermione's character by making her less gifted: the fic's Hermione, if she had also been involved in Harry's adventures, would not have kept the top spot.

What I'd like to see is fic that's essentially "/Applied Cultural Anthropology/, Ravenclaw Mode", where Hermione develops and thrives independently of Harry, only intersecting with his adventures occasionally.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142024/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorting-Hat-s-Gift][Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift by AntaresTheEigthPleiade]] has Ravenclaw!Hermione. It's the first book in a series of re-writes, but Hermione is obviously not the main character, because it's a twinfic, WBWL, Slytherin!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, etc, etc. Lots of stuff about prophecies, and Hermione's cleverness is valued, not looked down on by her friends. I'm currently near the end of the second book (Harry Potter and the Two Heirs of Slytherin), and I think there are at least 2 more completed books. It's a significant departure from canon, but also features the major plot elements, including horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews]] has Ravenclaw!Hermione & Harry, but it also ships them, is a twinfic, WBWL, starts in year 7, etc. It's complete, but the sequel is very important and frustratingly incomplete.

I'm in the middle of reading through a whole list of twinfic, which is why it keeps coming up in my recommendations. Hope these are interesting to you!

*** Nice suggestions, but I'd prefer books that aren't WBWL. Thanks anyway!

**** These sorts of fics often tend to have their "Harry" basically achieve everything that Hermione does /and more/, with Hermione not actually getting to /do/ much. Do these two fit this mold?

** I've found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5419767/1/An-Effortless-Show-of-Segue-Prowess][An Effortless Show of Segue Prowess]], where Hermione is born a month early and is a second year in Harry's first year. It's discontinued, but is a good take on an interesting idea.

*** Eh... It's decently written, but I wouldn't call it a good take, more of a Beggers Can't Be Choosers situation. It's not really about Hermione triving in Ravenclaw, it's about Hermione facilitating Harry thriving in Ravenclaw.

- It's got the whole "Hermione's obsessed with rules" fanon in effect, even in places where it doesn't make sense narratively, and complete with her being lectured about it sometimes being OK to break the rules.

- Despite Harry and Hermione being in different years, they end up becoming friends on Hogwarts express, and...

- ... so far, I don't see Hermione actually doing anything other than helping Harry do stuff.

- And, Harry insta-learning 2nd-year spells on his first ride on Hogwarts express raises red flags that either the author is going for a genius!Harry AU or is not paying attention, neither a good thing.

***** Harry is darned near a Sue... Everyone fawns over him from the beginning without any particular reason, he is super-talented, he comes up with all the great ideas, etc..
