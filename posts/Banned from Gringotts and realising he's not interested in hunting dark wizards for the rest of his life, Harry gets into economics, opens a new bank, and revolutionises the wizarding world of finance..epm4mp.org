**** Like most kids who grew up in bad situations Harry knew how survive. Like some of those kids he also knew how to get ahead some. Like a small number of them he knew how to get ahead on someone else's quid and get them to thank you for it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

"So I pay you a galleon, and you give me five galleons back? How does that work mate?" Ron was really confused on what Harry was talking about.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hermione stopped Harry outside the library.

"You know pyramid schemes always fall apart at the end right? What's your plan then?"

Harry shrugged and gave Hermione a smirk.

"Oblivate Ron and confund him, blame it all on Malfoy."

Hermione was shocked at Harry's plan. That was horrible, and worst of all it would likely work.

"I'll give you 15% if you can get Ravenclaw as well and help spread it's Malfoys idea."

Hermione narrowed her eyes, of all the things Harry had done.

"30% Ravenclaw will be a tough sell."

"25% and you have a deal."

They both nodded sure they had gotten a good deal.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Thanks for the idea, had to write it out real quick.
