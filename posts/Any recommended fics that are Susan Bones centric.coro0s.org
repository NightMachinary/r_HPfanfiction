It can be Susan/Harry or anything else, I've read a few and I think that she has the most viability as a background character to make a good story without the hangups of other fics. Just hoping to read the best of Haran?


** 2 things.

First, don't use Haran, its horrible. Most pairing names suck, but this takes the pot.

Second, I like this, even if its been a while since its been updated. linkffn(Final Protocol by Lord Silvere)

#+begin_quote
  Susan Bones, permanent nurse and bodyguard to the comatose Harry Potter, is commanded to execute the Order's final protocol. As hoped, Harry and Susan are transported to the past. But, Harry's recovery is only partial, so Susan must add to her duties the role of foot soldier as the two use their knowledge of the future against Voldemort. H/S. Time Travel. Subtle Soul Bond

**** Ship names are dumb, some are dumber than others.

Haran and Garry take the cake, though.

Harmony is kinda neat, I've seen people add on to that in neat ways too. "Lunar Harmony" being Luna/Harry/Hermione. Think I've also seen Osseous Harmony which is Susan/Harry/Hermione.

** It's still Harry centric but Susan is involved in pretty much every major plot point and is elevated to a main character in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Worth of the Soul). I guess there's also linkffn(Susan Bones and the Prisoner of Azkaban) but I would hesitate to call it great.
