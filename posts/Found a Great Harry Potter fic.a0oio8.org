[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12692794/1/Whelped]] Read it in the middle of the night , made me shiver

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022207/1/Anticlockwise]] Also another fic by the same author. This is also pretty good


** So tell us something about them. Because apparently (at least according to [[/u/SecretAgendaMan]]), it is not for everybody.

Just dumping links, without even calling the bot, does not really leave us with much information.

(Also tag this as recommendation)

*** The summary of the story isn't actually a summary, it just says that the fic is Snape being tasked with taking the letter to the boy no one has seen in a decade.

OP is right when he says that telling more about the fic would lessen its impact, being a "horror" fic, but while the descriptions and characterisations are quite good, the story itself is quite meh. I felt that the author was trying too hard to make a horror story, and ended up with something that more or less leaves you scratching your head wondering what you just read. You also find yourself raising your eyebrows and going, "Really?" every now and then.

It's not nearly as horrifying as the user below is making it out to be, and it doesn't really catch you off guard all that much. Right from the first paragraph, there's signs that this isn't a regular story.

The thing that I'm really curious about is where the Dursleys are getting so many animals from. That can't be cheap.

**** What caught me off guard specifically was the animal stuff That's where my initial "WTF" came from.

I obviously knew that the story was headed in a dark direction and was prepped for that because of the atmosphere it built up, but the animals just seemed over the top and edgy to me. Just horror for the sake of being horror at that point.

Exactly, like the author was really trying too hard to make the reader jump. From personal experience, horror stories just make people laugh.

*** The problem is if I tell something about it, it would'nt have the same impact. Horror never has the same impact as you jumping in uncharted.

**** Then at least put up a content warning for horror. That way people who are not into it can avoid it and know what genre you are promoting.

**** Whelped has no genre tag, and I couldn't see the summary since it's a direct link, so imagine my surprise when I'm thrust into some grimdark edgy horror story with no warning.

Caught me off guard, and definitely not my cup of tea.

** Whelped is one of the most terrifying, fucked-up stories I've ever read. It is so brilliant and well-written, and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone, lol.
