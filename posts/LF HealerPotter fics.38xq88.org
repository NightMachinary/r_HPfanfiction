I just read Reparations and Foundations (by Sara's Girl) and I'm really craving more of that world! So any more where Harry is aiming for a career in healing people? Or doing it when he's younger, in Hogwarts? My favorite atmosphere is definitely St. Mungos, but I've read a few fics where the authors capitalize on parsletongue magic or another form of magic for healing others/oneself. Anything like that would be great!


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]], Harry winds up working as an apprentice to Madam Pomfrey in the hospital wing.

This is overall a pretty good story, and it was among the first I ever read that made me realize that Snape does /not/ have to be a complete and utter bastard.

*** I see what you mean by kinda. Just read through the whole thing and while it was a good story (-some really convoluted drama at the end that felt forced and like the author was trying to punish the readers.), Harry was a healer in name only.

**** It was too good of a story imo not to reccomend anyway. Although i was recently reminded of another story where Harry is one. That is to say he's a doctor. A healer... well not so much. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/1/In-the-Mind-of-a-Scientist][+Zelda+ I mean Link]].

***** Don't get me wrong, overall I really enjoyed it, it was different. Oh man, that series goes in a direction I was not expecting (Read it a few months ago.)

** Could you link the fic(s) where Harry uses parselmagic to heal people? That is an intriguing concept given the cultural bias involved...

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] which was already mentioned in this thread is the only one I've read. It is very good I think.

AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

**** I read the first few chapters of that fic awhile back when it was the subject of the book club, and I didn't care for it. It seemed to lack any real sense of conflict or tension.

***** To be honest I can't remember the specifics of the plot. I know I liked it a lot, and I do remember that it has a weak start, so you might want to give it a couple extra chapters to get your attention. To each their own.

** I linked this one below but I wasn't sure you'd see it so here it is again. I was recently reminded of another story where Harry is a doctor if not quite a healer. It is a fun story nonetheless. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8551180/1/In-the-Mind-of-a-Scientist][Link]].
