So this is going to sound weird but basically any AU where Voldemort is a adult stuck in a child's body. It can be that hes a adult stuck in his own body as a child and has to grow up again. Or he can be stuck as say young Harry Potter and has to grow up again as Harry. He does remember his adult life at least to some degree. It has to actually be Voldemort not Voldemorts horcrux that's effecting Harry's personality. Preferably no ships.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.
