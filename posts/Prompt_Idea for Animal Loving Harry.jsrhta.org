Like the title suggests, I have had this idea for a long period of time.

In my mind, Harry is a lot more anti-social - or he has Aspergers/Autism - and has an affinity towards animals, and later on in Hogwarts, for Magical Creatures. I.E, he trusts animals and is more comfortable around them than other people.

For example, to escape the Dursley's treatment, Harry runs away, and somehow finds himself on a farm, and he enjoys himself there, he bonds with all the various animals that are there, and the animals love him back like he was one of thier own.

/[If you want, you could have some of the creatures being more like a motherly/fatherly towards him]/

He has a very strong bond with Hagrid as he also loves animals/magical creatures, and because of the shared interest, Harry can be more comfortable with Hagrid.


** Have you read Harry Potter Get's Smart and Takes Control? It's part of his characterisation, though the events are surrounding the usual Dumbledore bashing crisis and trying to get passed them.

I definitely think more animal-loving Harrys are always welcome though

** Huh, I'm just now realizing that I've never seen an autistic Harry.

*** I mean, I guess I can attempt myself, as I do have Asperger's myself.
