Fics that focus on how the Blitz and wartime experiences shaped Tom to be who he was, please. Preferably darker fics, I just think it's not written about enough. Thanks!


** I mean, he technically would've been at Hogwarts throughout the entire Blitz on London, and there was never any bombings in Scotland, so he canonically wouldn't have seen it.

I would also be interested in reading those fics though. I'd imagine him returning to the Orphanage after his year was over and seeing London being devastated would be quite a strong image to him.

*** No, he wasn't. It is expressly mentioned that he asked the Headmaster to stay in the Hogwarts even during the summer vacations and it was never permitted. It is difficult to decide when exactly the Blitz ended (of course, bombing of England continued even long after the plans for the invasion to the United Kingdom were shelved) so linkao3(17975003) is not completely unrealistic.

**** The Blitz was like eight months long, September 1940 to May 1941. He may have experienced bombing, but he'd've been at Hogwarts between September and May, no?

If memory serves, the Summer Holidays were only two-three months in canon, so they wouldn't have started until June/July. Can't remember if he was allowed to stay over Christmas or not, but the Summer Holidays would've been post-Blitz.

***** Even if he wasnt there during the bombings themselves he would have 100% felt the effects of them. Hell he may have even been one of those kids that got evacuated, probably multiple times since the wizards never gave a shit about him. Is it any wonder Tom Riddle became Voldemort? I mean shit he was already a sociopath

****** Oh agreed. Like Ceplma said, I am entirely nitpicking here. The Blitz was just a specific name for a specific campaign, not the war-time bombing as a whole. He may've experienced bombings, but he wouldn't have experienced the full-effort bombings of the Blitz.

That's actually a good question - would he have been evacuated? I'm not sure how the magical influence would change that practice, or if a kid who already spent 9-10 months of the year out of the city would've been 'on the list', so to speak.

***** OK, if you want to be nitpicking about it. Of course, I have counted The Battle of Britain as a part of the Blitz in this sense. Bombs falling on London were same then as later.

****** Semantically the same, sure, but they were different types of bombs and in far less intensive rounds. So, yes, I am definitely nitpicking [:D]. Thank you for the clarification though - if you're taking the German view of those events, then you're quite right that he would've been there. I do forget sometimes that it's counted differently there. The campaign was a whole year by German reckoning, right?

******* Do you really mean to say that if there is a question about a fanfiction dealing with experience of Tom Riddle in the Second World War you will keep as absolutely separate The Blitz and The Battle of Britain as two separate events. Because of course everybody who in the casual talk mentions Blitz certainly cannot mean bombing of England during the Battle of Britain. WHAT?

******** I mean, it'd depend on which was most useful for the point I was making. If it was someone who knew the specifics (eg. the older historian friend trope from Archaeologist movies) then I'd make a point to me nitpicking. If it was someone who was educated in Germany or someone who simply wasn't likely to know or care they were two things, I'd take the combined approach. In whatever the word is for unlinked-to-a-particular-character narration, I'd probably keep the two separate as well - The Blitz is the Blitz and The Battle of Britain is The Battle of Britain - and refer to them collectively with a general term like 'the bombings' or something. Really though, it depends on what would be most useful for the story I'd be hypothetically telling. Most people in England would refer to them separately though, it's how we're commonly educated.

Like I said, I'm just nitpicking. :)

*********** You mean like Margaret Thatcher on the French Revolution (from Wikiquote):

#+begin_quote
  For me as a British Conservative, with Edmund Burke the father of Conservatism and first great perceptive critic of the Revolution as my ideological mentor, the events of 1789 represent a perennial illusion in politics. The French Revolution was a Utopian attempt to overthrow a traditional order --- one with many imperfections, certainly --- in the name of abstract ideas, formulated by vain intellectuals, which lapsed, not by chance but through weakness and wickedness, into purges, mass murder and war. In so many ways it anticipated the still more terrible Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The English tradition of liberty, however, grew over the centuries: its most marked features are continuity, respect for law and a sense of balance, as demonstrated by the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

************ Indeed. Precisely like Margaret Thatcher.

Admittedly, the teaching is a lot more relaxed these days, but it's still a broadly negative perception among older generations here. For any twenty-somethings who care about such things, we generally see the Nobility as having 'had it coming to them'. That whole 'let them eat brioche' thing was a rather effective indictment of the Ancien Regime, even to our non-Revolutionary English minds. But we do still have rich people who believe that being poor is a choice and a failing of the impoverished with no societal influence whatsoever, so we're definitely partially in favour of the Aristocrats there. :)

** I know several fics where it is at least brought up, including one of my own.

linkao3(Runic War Warding) Voldemort mentions that one of the reasons he refuses to trust Dumbledore is because Dumbledore sent him back to the orphanage at the height of the blitz where he was forbidden to do magic.

linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) In a historically accurate twist on how most fics approach the issue, Emily (fem!Voldemort) was /not/ in London during the blitz, and was evacuated to a less at-risk area for the duration of her summers. Doing so is actually what led her to the discovery of the Gaunts and Riddles, as she was taken in by a family in Little Hangleton at one point.

linkffn(Departure from the Diary) My own fic. Witnessing a few vagrants be blown to pieces by a bomb is what led Tamelyn (fem!Riddle) to pursue horcruxes over other methods of immortality. Other methods would have kept her from dying of age, but horcruxes allowed her to live even if her body was blasted to pieces.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.
