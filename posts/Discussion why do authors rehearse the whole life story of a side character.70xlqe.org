Often I see in when the perspective changes that the author tells the whole life story.

I find this so annoying. I don't need the happenings retold five times from different characters perspectives, or told the story of Luna Lovegood.

Show, don't tell.


** Adds words to the story, so it seems like there is a decent amount of content, but it's just fluff material.

** It depends. It worked really well in Nightmares of future past. Like everything else, it must bring something to the story. Either a different perspective, or a shift in the characterization of some characters.\\
Also, I hardly see having some fleshed out secondary characters getting some light as necessary a bad thing.

*** Agreed. A difference in perspective is always nice--provided the writer is able to actually give the impression the point of view is different. That Character B sees the world in a different way than Character A.

NoFP is a good example--several of Harry's friends get attention to their point of view, and even some of the grown-ups, including Molly Weasley.

**** Yep. Not anybody write as well as S'tarkan though, unfortunately.

** I do this at the beginning of an Alternate Universe/Reality fics or Out of Character-izations to explain the differences between Canon. Why they made that choice, said this thing, feels this way, etc.
