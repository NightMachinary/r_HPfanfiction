:END:
From what I remember it started with the Doctor snapping at Jack about the headache he causes him by existing. John and Sherlock where also in it, teaming up against Moriarty. Murders where involved. John was either a Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor. The Doctor and Jack where likely Gryffindors too. Moriarty was of course a Slytherin. I don't remember if Harry was in it.


** I cant think of any that fit your description but Hermione's song is a good Dr Who Harry Potter crossover. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7102418/1/Hermione-s-Song][Hermione's song]]
