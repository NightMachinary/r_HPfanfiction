** Of the top of my head, Conlaodh's Song by enembee. But it is a very minor role. A really good read nonetheless. linkffn(5971274)

** I don't think he was an actual Death Eater, but he betrays them in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][The Sacrifices Arc]].

*** as in he pretends to be on the Death Eaters side, but never really believed in their ideals? or he betrays the good guys for the pure-blood, Death Eater, side, but doesn't join their ranks?

I am certainly interested in stories where Sirius really is Dark or a Death Eater.

**** He definitely wasn't really dark and didn't believe in Voldemort's message, but I can't remember exactly how he got roped into it. I don't want to say too much to avoid spoiling it, but Sirius was a bad guy in this one. Give it a try, even if it doesn't sound like exactly what you want, it's very good.

** In *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), Sirius Black had been Voldemort's 'right-hand man' most of the time. [[/spoiler][12 Grimmauld Place was V's HQ and he found the Slytherin's Locket there]]

*** My god. This fuckin fic was one of the BEST I've ever read. It is not, at all, a serious fic, but It was amazing. I highly recommend it.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

**** Yeah, I guess. But only very very minor. Sirius only plays an extremely small part in the overall story.
