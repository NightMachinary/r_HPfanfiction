** Unless for some potentials misguided Muggleborns, the Magical World has absolutely no reason to drop the Statute of Secrecy.

In Canon, Wizards are not the equal of Muggles, but are superior as a whole (the best example of this relations is "The other Minister" chapter of HBP where in most of their interaction, the Minister for Magic seem to keep the Muggle one in touch of what's happening more as a courtesy than anything else (they don't have any expectation for him and even take the trouble to put in place some protection). Also, Wizards have can easily access to any Muggle item they might want/ need (as the Knight Bus) while the contrary is not true.

So, if the Statute of Secrecy was to be dropped, here's what would probably happen :

- While Wizards don't really need anything from Muggles, Muggles would probably bother wizards to deal with their problem. Like could Wizards make all these wastes disapear, can't they also clean the pollution, and while they are at it can they deal with this famine?
- A lot of people would hate these Wizards:

  - /Why do they only appear now, and not 6 monthes ago when my wife was dying?/
  - /Why do they have magic and I don't?/
  - /God say these monster are the work of the Devil !/

- Some people would also probably try to use these wizards as a scapegoat :

  - /The economy is not recovering because wizards cursed it/
  - /It's not my fault I did a bad thing (abused my power, accepted a bribe, been unfaithfull, make your choice), a wizard bewitched me!/

- A lot of other little troubles like children bothering any kid who used accidental magic, rich people trying to recruit the service of a wizard, some potential secret experiment on captured magical to find the "source of magic" . . .

The troubles brought by revealing the existence of Magic largely outweight any potential gain they would make (the ability to cast a spell anytime and anywhere?).

*** True but while I'm all in favor of the right to self-autonomy, the statue also limits wizards' choices. They can't cast magic in front of muggles or choose to help muggles. Yes, it would be wrong for muggles to demand magic as a solution to their problems. But it's also wrong to force wizards to stand by and watch muggles suffer. Of course, their are also the societal and government conflicts to consider. There are many more ramifications to be considered. However, I think the issue is far more complex than you make it out to be and it's one where there isn't an outright answer.

**** The answer is NO, because Muggles are much more numerous and humans have a history of just taking what they want, so they would probably dissect wizards, or try to kill them due to religion, or try to use them. Wizards have nothing to gain or minimal gain in revealing themselves to the Muggles.

I see no problem in a Wizard saving a muggle if he has the opportunity(maybe he can do it covertly or just obliviate the guy) , but as a society it would just be stupid.

Look at our society how would the people that have power react when they discover there's a secret society of people who can warp reality and do a whole lot of things(erase memories, travel time, teleport) out of their control.

I can bet you they would do their utmost to control them, and while Wizards can defend themselves I doubt it would take much until people start bombing houses and shooting wizards, and then it's war and it would be bad for everyone.

Wizards have NO reason whatsoever to reveal themselves, the risk is too great and the reward too little, they are not morally superior to the muggles since they too can be prejudiced and bigoted, but that doesn't mean they have to sacrifice their society that would receive Zero improvement from the muggle one, simply because they both are still formed by humans(mostly) and humans are crap at culture clash.

** It's a fun ethical debate that's actually pretty complex.

On one hand, wizards would be annoyed by muggles. There would probably be conflicts between the two societies and their respective governments. From a wizarding perspective of their greater good, it's a bad move.

On the other hand, charitable wizards would now be allowed to work with muggles, something banned under the statute of secrecy. Also the end of oblivation. For muggles and wizards of higher morals, it's a good thing.

**** When it suddenly appears out of nowhere? There are cameras EVERYWHERE nowadays. The aversion field or whatever potentially only covers a set distance. Get far enough away, and other cameras could see it. That would mystify the cops to no end, a bus that cameras that are only outside of a set distance can see.

Or when it does its characteristic BANG! That would trigger the shotspotter sensors. My dad set off that one with a powder actuated nailer last month.

** In the long run, the magical world has a severe issue of underpopulation. They don't have a lot of people, which means not a lot of smart people, so barely any research happens and very little progress occurs. They're still only doing maybe 0.1% of what's possible with magic.

Muggles on the other hand have a lot of smart people inventing new things, but we're operating much closer to the theoretical limit of what's possible, and we have to constantly find new workarounds to do new things.

There's two possible futures that are stable in the long term:

One where wizards are extremely isolationist to keep their existence a secret in the age of AI, satellites, cameras everywhere and data moving so fast that any photo taken can be on a server on the other side of the world before you can say Obliviate. Not much progress happens in either world, as the wizards don't have the manpower and the muggles are at the limit of what's physically possible.

Then there's a second possibility where wizards and muggles work together. A relatively simple piece of magic that is not limited by conservation of energy, coupled with a complex piece of technology created by hundreds of engineers and software developers, and you have a basic approach for almost any technological problem. Within maybe fifty years of development you could have a society like in Star Trek, with interstellar starships flying around and all material needs being met by the computer controlled magic replicator machine. The cultural clash would be immense, but the rewards could well be worth it.

** I'd agree with [[/u/vercalos][u/vercalos]] in saying that the Statute of Secrecy would be practically impossible to enforce. For the best fictional example, go with the fall of the Statute of Secrecy in linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy), which is the last of the Arithmancer series, set during early postwar.

It's not just the existence and increasingly widespread use of surveillance cameras and camera phones, it's the nature of internet viral videos and how quickly they can be spread. You can Obliviate a hundred muggles at a site and destroy their camcorders' data, but you can't Obliviate an internet server or thousands of Muggles watching a viral video. At a certain point, the Streissand Effect will take over. The wizarding world should do their best to manage a peaceful transition to a world without a Statute of Secrecy instead of having the muggles find out on their own.

** Well one problem is that if you keep the Statute of Secrecy then you are stating that you're perfectly fine with mundane's being routinely assaulted. In the simplest case by witnessing magic cast by an unaware magical and then being assaulted by being obliviated by the magical government (whose members may or may not be talented at performing that charm). Or at worst case being assaulted by a magical as they commit a crime against you and then being assaulted a second time by the government when they remove the memory of that crime and the mundane never receiving justice.

So I'm much more interested in reading fics that try to explore how the magical and mundane worlds can be better integrated while avoiding the magicals enslaving the mundane or the mundane enslaving the magicals.

So I vote for the Statute of Secrecy to "go" but it probably needs to be done in a way that the "revelation of magic" doesn't "backfire".
