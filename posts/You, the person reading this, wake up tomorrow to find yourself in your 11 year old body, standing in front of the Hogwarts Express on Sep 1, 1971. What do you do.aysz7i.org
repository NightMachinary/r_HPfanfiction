In addition: you have on your person a wand that is a near-perfect match for you (I suggest going to Pottermore to find out what your wand is if you haven't already done so); along with a steamer trunk filled with everything a First Year student could possibly need, and money bag with the equivalent of 1,000 Galleons worth in all three coin types. Also, you instinctively know that you will be considered a Muggleborn should the question ever come up among your peers.

Edit: Reminder, you're being sent back to the *70's*; where you're in the same year as James, Lily, et al. Please adjust any plans you have accordingly.

Edit 2: I must admit I'm a little disappointed that everyone has had mostly the same idea on what they would do, and that nobody is willing to do a 'screw history' type thing like seducing Lily Evans before she falls for James Potter.

This is because the dreamer does not recognize they are dreaming and accepts things as they are.

As most people reading this are right now, they're reading it for the information it conveys. They aren't doing so mindfully with the thought that this is to verify their current state of consciousness.

When you read for a reality check, that is something you keep in mind. You're using your eyes for more than just obtaining the information contained within the text. This is a bad lucid dreaming technique though because it will very likely cause you to wake up and ruin the dream.

The fact that I would be able to crack open a book and see each letter and obtain knowledge I did not already have, while keeping in mind that this is a reality check, would be proof that I am not dreaming.

I've read signs, and books in dreams as well, whether they were gibberesh, or not does not matter, because in that instance I did read them, and processed it as such. When I lucid dream it may be different, but that does not matter in that instance. We can only be certain of one thing in life, I think therefore I am, everything else after that is pure speculation.

Hmm. Good luck with that. You think very highly of your memory of the past and how you will be able to predict the changes that you cause.

Liquid luck is apparently horrendously expensive, and time-turners are strictly controlled by the government. Also, given how things seemed to be presented for Harry when he was going to get expelled, I sort of doubt that you'll even be welcome in the magical world as a non-educated pseudo-muggle.

****** In 1991, Harry Potter is told to give an owl a knut in return for the Daily Prophet. It's not fair to assume that the Daily Prophet costs the same as a normal paper, but it's one of the few common purchases between the worlds that I can use to draw a comparison.

So. In 1991, Harry Potter purchases a newspaper for a Knut.

I'm finding it difficult to find a historical basis for how much newspaper costs. I found a source that says in the 1800s, a newspaper cost 1d (ESD). That's probably not comparable. But a [[https://www.ocregister.com/2012/12/13/what-it-costs-to-buy-a-newspaper/][source from 2012]] shows that a newspaper is worth anywhere from $0.50 to $5 in the US.

I'm going to assume the Daily Prophet is going to be on the lower end of things if for no other reason than ease of production. So we'll say $0.50 USD. In 1991, $0.50 USD would have been about £1. Give or take the time of the year.

So we have a tentative assumption that 1 Knut is approximately equal to £1.

One Galleon is worth 493 Knuts or £493 (1991). Meaning, as the prompt has suggested, if you have 1,000 Galleons, you'd be in 1991 with £493,000. Give or take.

With inflation, just to give you perspective of how much that is, in 2019, that would be worth £917,791.86. Nearly a million dollars.

NOT a lot to shake a stick at, obviously, but just /knowing/ about Apple and Microsoft and Google and Amazon and Facebook and... you get the picture.

They have infinite supply of most things. The currency is there for convienience. Sure you can transfigure yourself a pretty nice table, or you can give a shopowner who has better transfiguration skills a few sickles to do it for you. Very little things in Wizarding world have any real value. The textbooks and brooms and rarer potion materials are the only things I cam think off and that's only because duplicating them is not really gonna work long-run. You don't want your book to go bad in the middle of the year, or your broom failling you mid-match. For example of their purchasing power you could use book two. The Weaseleys managed to buy all of the school supplies(bar wands, of course) for 5 of their kids for only a single galleon.

******* Because there's actually fundamental quantum randomness in real-life physics.

Prepare the world in the same quantum state, time evolve that state four years and measure things on it and you will measure different things on each try.

This randomness multiplies up, so that small-scale randomness causes large-scale randomness; and quickly.

Edit: Due to the downvote I imagine that this isn't much of an explanation, so, in physics things are said to be in quantum states, which are superpositions of an 'actual state', so if a photon has been prepared in a state which is a superposition of spin up and spin down, if you measure its spin in directions other than the spin-up-spin-down direction, then you will measure a random spin. These superpositions change with time in what is called time evolution. You can imagine a huge region containing the earth as a quantum system and imagine time-evolving it and then doing measurements on it, and it being thrown into different states each time you measure it.

****** Strongly encourage clean energy, use magic to help it along if I can, hopefully prevent the war on drugs and the war on terror, provide disaster relief, save lives, extend a life, colonize the moon with a vanishing cabinet, frown apon nuclear war, cure the common cold and influenza; and likely get rich as a side effect...

As for Why? Well, why not? Evil only wins if good men do nothing, and the economic collapse of the muggles from war, famine, pestilence and death (incidentally, that wasn't intended) is generally Bad, and bad is just a lesser evil. Besides, wizards regularly hit 150, so, if I'm 11 in 1971, I was born in 1960, so I'll be 150 in 2110. And a LOT of bad is scheduled to happen before then. I'd like to strike Just One Thing from that list.

How would You do that with 50 years foreknowledge, a bit of money, and magic?

******** All I could do is try my best, and hope it's enough. Global warming, prison earth, no more fossil fuels, a terrorist with a single nuke in a capital city, an actual War, to much nuclear waste, 9/11 and the war on terror, the race debate, an emp and no more internet, a solar flare and no more electricity, and a super bug is the list of Bad off the top of my head that would be a problem before 2100. And I'd live through it all. All I want is to prevent one of them, that alone would extend millions of lives.

I'd have to prevent them all to save the world though...

I'm not saying the world is going to end, thankfully as a muggle I'm not going to see about 2/3 of that. But I will live through some of them already. That's the concern of future-Sef, though.

** Go to school. Just having been seen at the station could lead to major changes, so it's already too late for me to just fade away and let canon happen.

/Not Slytherin/, /Not Slytherin/, /Not Slytherin/, /Anywhere but Slytherin/. Fuck that.

Talk to Dumbledore and tell him everything that I know. If just information doesn't work, then the diadem in the room of requirement should be more than enough to get him to take me seriously.

I'm basically gonna stick my head in the sand and try to enjoy learning magic. Despite the shit the fandom gives Dumbledore sometimes, he's supposed to be a brilliant and highly capable man. He also knows /waaaay/ more about the world there than I do. I'm just passing the info on and leaving it to him.

Depending on how Dumbledore seems, I might try and trade for the information. See if I can get him to pull some strings and talk to my guardians (orphanage? foster home?), move me to a school out of Britain. If I can't, then it's not the end of the world. Hogwarts was safe IIRC. Also, I really want a house elf. Trying to get one in exchange for critical war information sounds just a little bit scummy though.

If I'm stuck at Hogwarts, I might try and do a few minor things. If I run into Snape before the Sorting, I might try and convince him that Slytherin won't be awesome. If I get sorted into Gryffindor I'd inevitably try and tone down the marauders. Not sure about anything else. When I graduate, I get the hell out of dodge. Good luck, Britain.

Living as a wizard should be pretty easy, and I probably won't have a hard time getting wealthy off of some investments. If I later hear that Voldemort is the new King of Magical Britain, I'll wait to see if any other nation is doing anything about it, and if they are then I'll anonymously give them all the information that I can remember.

** Step 0: Do everything I can think of to verify I'm not dreaming. Can I feel pain? Can I do calculus? Etc.

Step 1: Go through my stuff and try to figure out who I am. I'm in my 11-year-old body, but do I have the same name? Am I a muggle-born? Am I part of a known magical family? For the prompt, I'll assume I'm a muggle-born with the same parents.

Step 2: Find all the characters I know and say hi. Nothing fancier than that for now. Just break the ice.

Note A: Get Sorted. I'm pretty confident I'll be in Ravenclaw, so I'll assume that. The Sorting Hat won't change its mind based on scheming I did in the past 12 hours as it does in too many fanfics.

Step 3 (may be before or after the Sorting): As soon as I can get some privacy, write down everything I can think of about the war, known characters, and Voldemort. Maybe start keeping a diary in general.

Step 4: Learn magic! Immerse myself in the culture. Work to not look like a 21st century impostor from a parallel universe. Do my best to act 11 and not 29. Try to befriend known characters, especially Lily Evans (and Severus Snape through her). Try to steer them in the right direction without forcing anything or acting suspicious.

Note B: Write Mom and Dad and tell them to invest in tech stocks. Also to be on the lookout for anti-muggle persecution (without scaring them too much).

Note C: Re-learn French (see below).

Step 5: Fake being a Seer using my knowledge of future events. Early second year: /"The American President will win his power anew, but he soon will be brought low by his own hubris! --/Huh? Did someone say something?"

Step 6: If successful, as the war ramps up, try to drop a few "prophecies" around Dumbledore to steer him in the right direction.

Step 7: If Dumbledore fails to beat Voldemort by seventh year, strongly suggest to Mom and Dad that we move to France immediately after graduation.

** Oh boy. Well there's a lot of right then and there things to consider, and some down the road ramifications:

1. I board the train. Don't question, don't falter, don't let myself be exposed as fraudulent in anyway until I get on that train.

2. Make a friend or two. To some people this might not seem terribly urgent but you need to create some sort of support system for yourself. I'm not from the UK so in 1971 kind of hard to reach out to my family (we'll get to that). I need people I can start to trust and will trust me.

3. Remember to emphatically tell the hat not to put me in Slytherin. Sorry, but there is just no way in hell I want to be a muggleborn in Slytherin.

4. Work on my backstory. I get it, I'll be able to call myself a Muggleborn which most people will be foreign to. But I'm a Mexican-American kid, with an American accent. Gonna be a few questions. One thing might be to subtly try and figure out how I got my Hogwarts letter. Because if Minerva or whoever is delivering letters in 1971 doesn't remember me actually getting a letter, more questions will be raised. Maybe they can help me understand things a bit more.

Most important down-the-road thing to check on:

1. My family. In 1971, my parents are also 11 years old and had just met each other or were soon meeting back in the U.S. so I'd want to check that they exist in the reality I'm in and that everyone is okay. And would I want to change anything? One of the worst things I can think of is my uncle dying in Vietnam, but that had already happened in 1971 so I think I gotta keep my distance and not screw up the timeline that created me (not sure how ripple effect really works but I better not chance it).

2. I have to get in on the right side of things, I'm sorry, but my fandom just wouldn't allow any different. I'm starting the same year as Lily and James and Sirius and Remus. Maybe I can't work my way into being a Marauder (wish I could somehow stab Peter in the back and replace him but that might just lead them to hating me), but maybe I can be a close friend of theirs still. Remus and Lily would probably be the easiest ones to befriend. I have a feeling I'd be slated for Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff over Gryffindor and Slytherin, so I couldn't be best friends with them, but still friends.

3. I'd have to weigh how I'd want to be utilized. Trying to get close to the Order and Dumbledore, what would happen if he used legilimency on me? All the stories of self-inserts like this where someone pops up in the universe, they somehow avoid legilimens or learn occlumency as like a 3rd-year student, I don't find that realistic. Do I let myself be discovered for who I really am? Greater good might not work in my favor there... Lay low from Dumbledore and try to learn occlumency in my later Hogwarts years? I could but not sure how I could learn such a tricky branch of magic without a legilimens somehow learning what I know.

4. I have to take advantage of my adult abilities. I know how to manage money, I assume I keep those wits somewhat. Meet with the Goblins and determine what their investment options are like. Figure out if my money would be better invested in the Wizarding world or Muggle world (not sure what Voldemort's war does to Wizarding economy but it can't be good). Build up what money I can for myself and for the order. Also, spend my summers getting a job. I already had a childhood, I don't need to do another.

5. Speaking of summer, figure out where the hell I can live. Preferably rent free with hopefully a friend or two I made, but if not, then somewhere near Diagon Alley (hence why I need a job).

Early 1970's, get invested in gold. Buy Disney in the early 1980's. And clearly tech in the 90's, but have to be wary of the 2000 crash. Avoid the hell away of airline stocks. I don't know how PANAM stock did in the 70's, but it would likely be a good short. Maybe bet on the success of Queen or Star Wars (hint: Success)

Try to find a way to use the knowledge of the end of the Vietnam War, Iran Contra, the Air Traffic Controller strike of 81, 9/11... to do something? I don't know. Ideally you could convince the world to take AIDS seriously, but probably too young to make a difference there.

​

Oh, and figure out if I'm still a US Citizen. That is important. Number one rule: Don't piss off the IRS.

Oh, and on the magical side: Figure out how to magic-proof a gun, what kind of protection you can buy for magical whammies (don't want to get mind-blasted), and get a team of scientists trying to understand the nature of magic. It'd be important to find a confidant. I wouldn't give two pence for the Statute of Secrecy, but you don't want to step into something you can't handle. Would need some advisers from the magical and non-magical world. Certainly not going to allow the world to keep sliding into environmental mess if you have the ability to literally create energy out of mid-air.

Hell, maybe find a spell that makes it so conception requires both parents to affirmatively try for a kid? Block a whole lot of human misery and a good stab toward fixing some of the overpopulation problem.

Or hell, looking for other magical solutions to problems, maybe some sort of magical protection against nuclear weapons? Find some way to invest in magical physics and help create new and interesting components, no reason we can't have a space elevator a hundred years early.

Honestly, it would kinda suck to be stuck in the 1970's. The world has made a lot of progress since then, so a top priority would speed up as many of those advances as possible. I wouldn't want to live without my computer, or without many of the painfully won social advances that came about over that time period. So do whatever you can to get those to happen quicker. Since it should be easy to become filthy rich with a bit of foreknowledge, get yourself set up in an area and basically enforce modern standards on it. None of this period sexism allowed.

It would be pretty awkward to begin planning for the book version of events if I'm actually in the the HPMOR universe, or something. Ask a few more details to see if any of my own unsupported headcanons are true, which would be even more awesome.

Get on the train (obviously). Once at school, tell McGonagall I need to see Dumbledore as soon as possible, and that it has to do with You-Know-Who. To prove we actually know what we're talking about, namedrop the Order of the Phoenix, Tom Riddle, and a few other choice tidbits like that.

Once I've found Dumbledore, tell him all about the Horcruxes and Pettigrew's potential corruption and any other relevant tidbits.

Where we go from there, exactly, is something I shouldn't be the one planning for; Dumbledore knows way more about what is and isn't possible than I do. I feel pretty confident we'd win the War, though.

But unfortunately getting Sirius out of Azkaban, getting Barty Crouch rearrested, and a bunch of other things are super high risk.

** Go to Hogwarts, get an education while attempting to befriend Frank or Alice. Study everything I need to become an auror and accomplished potioneer

After Hogwarts join the auror service. Once accepted into the program aquire a muggle property and resume my Muggle identity so I can have a way out if needs be at this point I would also buy a jack regards terrier and train it to kill rats. Start brewing polyjuice potion, use the potion to assume the identity of a random muggle to acquire a pistol. Practice a lot with it. By now it should be late 1979 early 1980 so time to take action. Aquire an invisibility cloak in secret and begin to take the cloak and Jake Russel everywhere. Start following Peter everywhere, as soon as Sirius confronts him (post voldys death) disarm Peter from under the cloak. If Sirius doesn't kill him then shot him in the head with the pistol. If he turns into his animagus release the terrier.

Quickly inform Mad Eye Moody of what's about to happen to Frank and Alice's. Wait at there place under the cloak. When Barty, Bellatrix and Rodolphus show up, disarm Bellatrix and shoot her in the head. If I can manage it also shoot Barty and Rodolphus. Quit the aurors and leave the magical world for my Muggle identity. Brew some more polyjuice potion and use it to become a Muggle policeman. Plant evidence that Vernon Dursley is molesting Harry and get him arrested and imprisoned (confound the jury if needed). Assume a fake Muggle identity and disguise myself via transfiguration so I can start a relationship with Petunia and make sure Harry has a good start to life. Once I'm sure Harry will be ok fake my own death and return to the magical world. Tell Mad Eye and Dumbledore everything I know and leave the rest up to them.

** Should I either inform Dumbledore or other magical authorities to fix the Potterverse, or should I try to fix the muggle world?

First the reality check. Am I dreaming or is this real, and is it the main Potterverse or a fanfic or something entirely different. Houses: Just convince the hat, that you are an antifascist and strongly opposed to racism and bigotry while having a huge desire for knowledge. Any house which is not Slytherin would work, and I doubt, that the hat would put me to Slytherin.

Informing Dumbledore about my future knowledge would safe the Potterverse but severely restrict my ability to help the world and rescue it from capitalism, climate change and injustice. The Potterverse is able to defeat its local pathetic fascists (and if the situation becomes to bad for the Order, some future knowledge could probably help them regaining ground, also theoretical knowledge about guerilla warfare from the muggle world could greatly help their cause (but I lack that knowledge and experience) ). The muggle world has at that point almost 3,8 billion humans, magicians are a small minority.

Magic gives enough possibilities to solve many problems of our world. But magic in the wrong hands could bring tyranny. But in the long term it is unethical to deny humanity the ability to cure most diseases and replace capitalism with a magical based post scarcity economy.

Either we should establish a responsible, democratic government for the wizarding world, which is able to responsibly peacefully revoke the statute of secrecy, or me in the past has to develop solution on their own. A peaceful coexistence between magics and non-magics is impossible if the statute of secrecy fails due to an accident. The more time passes, the higher the world population and the population of magics, the higher the probability for such an accident. A peaceful reunification of both groups, with the magics willing to help the non-magics while not being paternalistic should be the ideal.

In any case, I have a huge responsibility. Spending several weeks or the entire first year for plans seems necessary. I need to identify the most important problems, and the problems which require urgent action. Which problems could be easily solved with magic? Which problems require physical action? Getting a pensieve to secure my future knowledge would be helpful but could be difficult to obtain.

Transfiguration and theoretical knowledge are important fields of knowledge. It is probably necessary to buy the most recent physics books (and I don't know enough about physics). Don't play with time turners or any other time travel! Mind magic is unethical, and should be avoided against others. The history of the magical societies would be interesting. Muggle social theories (like Marxism, or modern sociology) are interesting and important, but fail to predict things, if we add magic and a magical population.

The most important problems are probably reversing entropy and solve creating a Perpetuum Mobile. Entropy is a danger to all sentient live living in our universe in the really really really long term. A Perpetuum Mobile could solve most energy and resource problems. Both could easily be archived with magic and would help sentient life to survive in the incredible long term. Knowledge to build both needs to be secured for eternity or at least a very very long time.

Already in the first year, I have to send a letter to Salvador Allende, informing him with some future knowledge to rescue him and give "Project Cybersyn" a chance.

I have to stop Thatcherism and Reaganism in the next decade to reduce human suffering and weaken our modern Neoliberalism. Let's hope that the Soviet Union collapses as peacefully as in our timeline without any nukes exploding. But I need to be creative to prevent the genocide in Ruanda and the civil war in Jugoslavia. It is probably impossible to stop every problem and war and suffering. At the beginning it is impossible to change most events, and after several years, the butterfly effect would severely reduce my ability to predict events.

I need to develop a solution for climate change. Something which permanently transfigures Co2 into something else could reduce the problem. I shouldn't implement my magical solution to climate change before the world becomes aware about the problem of climate change and sustainability, because I don't want to kill renewable energy research and other new technologies. (is it possible to transfigure CO2 into Oxygen?)

I need a backup copy of my knowledge and my ideas sent to a responsible person in case of my death. To prevent accidents, avoid getting to much attention in the magic and muggle world. Become a good student but nothing spectacular. Maybe most plans should be implemented only after finishing Hogwarts. It is probably easier to escape from the supervision of Muggle Authorities after finishing school, and then my character has enough magical knowledge to do stuff.

I lack the knowledge to invest in the right companies in the 70ies, and later on butterflies will make choosing the right companies difficult, while computer and internet companies are still a great chance.

Starting a company which secretly uses magic to become efficient would be a good way to change the world. Transfiguration would make creating valuable goods relatively easy, but you still need some way to sell these. My character needs to emigrate to a country, which has a weak magical government, but a relatively good muggle government which will protect myself and is considered progressive. (Therefore none of the Great Powers of the 70ies, maybe if Allende survives in Chile, or a small nation somewhere else). My company should slowly gain more and more power, and should create enough pressure to replace capitalism with a magical post scarcity economy. (Using magic on an industrial scale would kill capitalism). But how to secure such a project from magical governments, which want to enforce the unethical Statue of Secrecy?

I don't now, how to improve the noble movements of feminism, anti-racism, queer rights, disability rights and neurodiversity with magic, but several years of thinking could probably give some ideas, how to dismantle the patriarchy with magic.

Another fun project would be to help creating magical enhanced rockets, which could make the colonization of the solar system a possibility in a few decades.

** Once I realize that not only am I in the HP universe, but in a very critical time period during it -- the /Marauder-era/ -- I essentially have 2 choices:

- Do everything in my power to turn the war in favour of the Light

  - DO NOT GO INTO SLYTHERIN. The thought of getting acquaintanced with a young Severus does hold some appeal to me, but he's just as likely to refuse any attempts at friendship (alternatively, use Lily Evans as a "backdoor" to befriending Severus who is far more likely to work in my favour). And for some reason I can't imagine Mulciber or Avery being happy pleasant people with a Muggleborn like me... Gryffindor is only marginally better, since I can't stand school bullies, unless I want to risk isolation by trying to badger the Marauders into not harassing Slytherins.
  - Go to Dumbledore and give him full disclosure of everything I know. He may not always have everyone's best interest at heart, but his intentions are always good, and he's by far my best bet at getting the ball rolling with future knowledge.
  - School bullying needs to die. I don't know how bad the Marauders were (A Prince's Tale is biased), but harassments of Slytherins from them, and harassments of Muggleborn students from some of the Slytherins, is toxic and has potential to ruin lives (Sev is the obvious one that comes to mind, but it's unlikely that he's the only one)
  - I might be tempted to meddle with "future" relationships, but no matter how satisfying it would be to prevent what was meant to be, they really are none of my business. Or worse -- hopefully I can avoid the awkward implications of someone who was "meant" to get together with someone else instead getting interested in /me/, or vice versa.

- Keep my head down and try to keep things going as they went in canon

  - If I choose to do the latter, I must not mess with the Marauders or Severus (/especially/ not his interaction, and eventual fall-out, with Lily) -- no matter how hard it would be to knowingly let everything unfold -- if I try to temper down the Marauder bullying, or prevent Snape's youthful mistakes, I'd be jeopardizing events leading up to October 31 1981.

Make sure to provide evidence of the things I tell them; so this could take a while, I'd probably have to observe certain characters before hand.

2: Repeat the process, and try to live a quiet life at Hogwarts as a student; hoping that things change, if I see no real process being made, I will then proceed to make myself known to someone; perhaps Amelia Bones, as she seemed fair enough in the few snippets we saw her in, and try and get her to change the future; if changes haven't been made yet, by the end of my first year

** Hmmm this is hard. By Pottermore standards I'll be in Gryffindor, but if I choose I'll be in Hufflepuff. First I would see if I actually have magical abilities. Being a Muggleborn I would try to conceal that information as much as possible---family living in the states, living with my relatives in the UK whatever is necessary (more on that later).

Depending on who I befriend Harry may not even be born, so everything is dependent on how far my version takes the story off track. If my version doesn't deviate from canon, except for my personal knowledge of events, I'd keep my head down but still want to help (especially since I'm a Hufflepuff on the inside). I'm not strategic enough to outright tell Dumbledore about Pettigrew or the Horcruxes (unless I'm in Gryffindor and befriend Lily & the Marauders), but maybe later in life if/whenI join the Order. I honestly wouldn't befriend James because I never befriended cocky jocks when I was in school. The closet to the Marauders I would get is either Lily because she's smart or Remus because he's so reserved... well maybe Sirius because I'm outgoing but that's only once you get to know me.

I'd want to learn as much magic as humanly possible (I'm talking Hermione and Time Turner humanly possible): DADA and charms for protection, potions so I can be a healer to some degree, history of magic and ancient runes so I can better understand magic, divination for the hell of it, CoMC so I can handle and care for them. Most importantly I'd want to learn Occlumency and Legilimency for my own safety, but mainly occlumency since I am a Muggleborn.

If I have any free time I'd want to join the Frog Choir because I like to sing, but my animal companion would be a cat for sure. Oh, and if possible I'd want to become an animagus so I could fly the hell out of magical Britain when the time comes. I don't see me being the best on a broom (hence why I would try and be an animagus), so Quidditch is out of the question. If my lives cross paths with notable people I'd want to help as much as I could. Maybe not secret keeper but maybe smuggling more Muggleborns out of the country and exchanging information.

** It's game time.

Assumptions:

- I am indeed actually magical, and this isn't some sort of freak mistake\\
- this is the canon universe, and not a fanfic or AU-verse
- I still have all my knowledge of the universe\\
- I still have all my skills/abilities (especially my maths and language skills)

​

Step 1: Spend the train ride going over everything I know about the universe, paying specific attention to stuff that will be relevant in this time period as a way of indicating that I know a lot more than I'm supposed to, and brushing up on my French and Latin.

Step 2: Approach McGonagall (or whoever is proctoring the Sorting process in 1971) and use my knowledge of things that I shouldn't to convince her to call out my name as an obscure French pureblood name (probably Millefeuille, since that's the easiest) so that I can infiltrate Slytherin and deconstruct Riddle's initiative.

Step 3: Get sorted into Slytherin posing as a French pureblood. Begin my subversion campaign using my knowledge regarding the circumstances of Riddle's birth, acting as though it ought to be "common knowledge."

Step 4: Lobby to get into Arithmancy and Divination as a first year. I can use my future knowledge to fake being a seer, which will help me cover up any slip-ups, and there's no way I'm going to go two years without maths.

Step 5: Throw myself into the social scene, try and get myself involved with one of the pureblood heiresses in Slytherin (Narcissa Black? Emma Vanity?) so that I can cement myself as part of British pureblood society.

Step 6: Ingratiate myself with the Marauders (help them prank Slytherins? befriend Remus through his academic side?) so that when they find out about Remus I can become an animagus, since it would be a useful skill to have. Gradually supplant Peter, even though he hasn't done anything wrong in this universe, because I'm petty.

Step 7: Learn as much as I possibly can about magic, and spend as much time as I can working on learning new spells and mastering the more esoteric skills (Occlumency/Legilimency, wandless/wordless magic, etc.).

Step 8: Gun for the Head Boy position, use it to get close to Dumbledore and learn more magic from him. Pass my N.E.W.T.s with flying colours.

Step 9: Get into the Ministry in some capacity using my connections with the British pureblood coalition, try to climb that ladder as much as possible. In the meantime, if Riddle isn't already dead or otherwise entirely disenfranchised, I take him out of the game and use his death to make my first Horcrux, which I will make out of an ordinary rock and hide at the bottom of the Mediterranean sea.

Step 10: Take a covert trip to France to deal with any outstanding Millefeuilles before my name gets too big, using their deaths to make my second Horcrux, which I will make into a very traditional phylactery and embed inside of me. Lay claim to their wealth via Imperius and modifying their wills for good measure.

Step 11: At that point it doesn't really matter, I have wealth, connections, knowledge, power (magical and political), and am functionally immortal. I play politics for a while, then leave the scene to my descendants to study magic more in depth, inventing new spells and studying esoteric magics like soul magic and alchemy. I explain my longevity away as having created a Philosopher's Stone.

** EDIT: Oh my god I misread 1971 as 1991! :( Never mind then, screw my plan because I'm not even born yet?

But if I'm not born yet then I don't even have a home to go back to? So how does that work? My mother would only be 9 years old, according to my math...Weird. I guess in THAT case, I'd talk to her and watch her, and maybe see what might have happened in HER life to make her make mine terrible? Maybe I could change that for her, and make her better? Normal? I don't know. I would try to befriend her, show her magic. Try and understand her. But maybe at that early point there'd be nothing to really understand, because whatever made her how she was hadn't happened yet? If it was a made thing, not a born thing.

Anyway that's muggle world stuff. On the magic front I would go to Hogwarts and make friends and go to classes, and I would also write an anonymous letter telling Dumbledore exactly where and what the Horcruxes are, as well as all the events to come so he can decide how to handle them and I wouldn't have to worry about it! :)

My life would be pretty much the same, except with magic and a whole magical world to explore! :) Also I would probably take after my fanfic characters and try to befriend and help nonhuman people if I could. I would like to maybe find a nice person to be a girlfriend too, or maybe marry later too. :) Like a centauress or a goblin lady! Or maybe a giant lady. :)

At age 17, I'm heading back to the states and keeping one foot in the Muggle world and a few well-placed dollars in the Muggle stock market.

** Go through Hogwarts trying to get the very best grades possible.

Become friends with the Marauders even though I'm a Hufflepuff. (I believe in fair play more then I have courage)

Tell Albus everything. Then try to get a job as the Muggle Studies professor.

** I'd probably just put all my focus into learning as much magic as I could and becoming as powerful as possible. I'd probably be sorted into Slytherin due to this ambition but I imagine I'd be able to avoid them outside of classes by using the room of requirement and Hogwarts kitchens. The ones in my classes are unlikely to be that problematic as they will also be 11 yo kids. But yeah my Hogwarts years would mostly be spent focusing on magic. Afterwards, I would mostly likely ignore the war and probably travel and try to learn as much magic as possible. I would also definitely try to become immortal as it is proven to be possible through at least a couple of methods in the hp universe however I don't think I would go the horcrux route. Idk what I would do past that.

** 1. Be simultaneously confused and excited, but board the train, no way I'm passing up the opportunity to be a wizard.

2. Reality sets in and I realize I'm in a foreign country (which is in the middle of a war and one side targets me and people like me). Realize that though some of the members of my family who are dead now are alive then, I still can't exactly go see them, my sister and I haven't been born yet, and my parents haven't met yet.

3. Be depressed, and also realize I need a plan, at least to explain why I have an American accent, also need to figure out where I live/am going to live.

4. Get sorted probably into Hufflepuff, if not, then maybe Ravenclaw.

5. Focus hard on learning magic so that I can make a living.

6. As far as my knowledge of the future goes, the sorting hat might take this out of my hands, but I would intend to ignore it. There is no guarantee that things will happen the same way as in canon. If I ignore what I know of the future, then either I have no effect on the future and everything works out in the end, or, my mere presence in the past changes things despite my best efforts. If I try and help canon along, it's pretty inevitable that I change things, and eventually, I don't know any more about the future of the magical world than anyone else.

7. Either transfer to Ilvermorny (or if there is another magical school in the US, go there) or move to the US after I graduate Hogwats.

Also somewhere in all this I'd probably need therapy and/or obliviation in order to come to terms with a) all this time travel rigmarole, including the fact that I'd be starting out in my 11 almost 12-year-old body, but with the mind of a 28-year-old, and b) with the whole, can't see the family I knew my whole life, including the the people who are dead now.

** I would have way too much fun messing with people, pretending to be a seer and giving out cryptic hints at everything that's going to happen.

If I ended up in Slytherin, I'd definitely try to befriend Sev. If I ended up in Ravenclaw. . . I'd probably still try. I love figuring out magic systems, and having an actual spell inventor around to discuss everything with would be great. So basically try to tag along with Sev and Lily however it goes.

I'd like to say I'd stand up to James or whatever, but I'm really quite a non-confrontational coward most of the time, so I'd pretty much stay in the background until he messed with someone I cared about. At which point I'd probably either get violent or go off on a rant. Which means I'd almost certainly end up in conflict with the Marauders sooner or later. Oh, well. Unavoidable really.

With regards to the wider conflict, I'd do my best to stay out of it. Become a shield researcher or develop new healing potions or something in the background. And try my utmost to steer Sev in that direction if I'm with him in Slytherin. If not, he won't listen to Lily, he's almost certainly not going to listen to a random Ravenclaw even if I did manage to insinuate myself into their clique. Mmm, I might even end up in conflict with _Lily_ if I seem eager to continue researching spells indiscriminately while she thinks I've been a bad influence. Heh.

Between that and dropping clues about the future, I'd say the timeline is pretty well and truly annihilated. There's no way I'd manage to get through seven years without making some proclamations about Peter's eventual betrayal. So I'd be sure to, cryptically and only to teachers (don't want to get myself assassinated or anything) start mentioning things about the seven-part soul and the various places and artifacts I knew or suspected of being horcruxes. If I hint enough, Dumbledore should be able to pick up the idea and run with it.

Harry won't exist either way, the exact timing of events will be thrown off way too far, and it's up to us (them?) to finish this in our generation.

I'd spend a lot of time in the library, bemoaning the lack of computers, and forced to live a social existence. In between serious and non-sirius predictions, spell research, hanging out with other students, and doing homework for the first time in my life, I'd continue writing fiction. Very messily, with no undo button and terrible handwriting.

Bringing a bizarre amalgam of future concepts and fictional ideas that haven't been written yet, I have a very unique viewpoint from which to write. Everything that was generic and cliche in my time will be revolutionary in this one. Which makes me feel a little guilty, but then there probably isn't much crossover between wizarding and nomaj fiction. So I spend my free time absorbing the unique vocabulary of the time, then write fantasy for the Hogwarts crowd.

​

Also, since I'd come of age in the year Star Wars comes out, I'd take my gap year apparating across the US to watch it in every theatre I could find.

** Sorry, OP. I was thinking about writing a short story or whatever about that first day on the train, but I wanted to figure out my wand, and I got sucked into a huge rabbit hole of wandlore and canon wands and making wands for different characters because I was too lazy to make a Pottermore account or recall my old account to do the quiz

That's ADHD for you.

** Well, first of I would start talking to everyone trying to find out as much as I can. Maybe during the train ride I run across little James and little lilly, and start making friends. When at Hogwarts I would pray to whatever god is up there that I won't go to Slytherin, and probably be put in Ravenclaw. Afterwards I would make study session as Ravenclaws are sorta neutral, so make as many allies in as many houses as possible. My first few years would probably be boring, but not surprising. During my third year I would probably start working to screw with the future, probably by trying to get Snape and lilly together, or getting snape to become friends with James. I will most likely help Remus be more confidence because “your so smart!” And “Who cares if you grow a little fur every mouth?”

Probably depending on how that went, in my last year I would gather the Horcruxes and explain how “No, I'm not really who I am and from the future and I'm so sorry”

Then I would Fiendfyre the Horcruxes and be happy because I have magic and I can do magical stuff
