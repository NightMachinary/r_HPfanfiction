I can see it happening like this, Harry Potter keeps getting told there's no such thing as magic, and that it's freakish and wrong... and sets out to learn magic because anything the Dursley's say should be taken with a grain of salt, but all he finds is how to do card tricks and slight of hand.

If not, I think it'd be a fantastic idea, hint hint to the better writers out there watching hpfanfiction for ideas, come on, there must be a couple of you.

Maybe even make muggle magic the power-he-knows-not, using slight of hand to conceal the sorcerer's stone after threatening to make it vanish, the unneeded palming of the basilisk fang just so we can see the comical "huh" face on Tom Riddle who is astounded, third year... I imagine they use some sedatives on the rabbits they pull out of hats- have him drug Scabbers and pull him out of a hat, forth year... Fuck man, I don't know, but you get the idea.

Edit: Potions class, palming ingredients and putting them in while appearing not to- driving Snape crazy, how is the potion getting made, the boy isn't adding ingredients!- he's rejected the muggle world as far as I know so might not know of muggle magic either.

Edit 2: Okay, I've been convinced that if you want something done right, you should do it yourself. Don't know how right it is, but introducing... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025986/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Sub-Rosa][Harry Potter and The Sub Rosa]] linkffn(13025986) where Harry indeed learns muggle magic tricks after Vernon kicks him out, though just how much they'll be of use... well, that's up to the muse.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

** Not a fic rec, but try "The Magicians" book series by Lev Grossman. The main character does card tricks all his life before finding out he's actually doing real magic. It's a greats series for HP fans.

*** Thanks though I actually have read them, always surprised me that no Harry Potter fanfic writers have (at least that I've seen) used the idea presented of secret muggleborn safe houses, strings of portals between them, where they learn magic not from schools but from trading spells, favors, money and the like, full of disinfranchied muggleborns, those with creature heritage, or that were expelled or declined their hogwarts invite and later rediscovered magic after being mindwiped/core bound.

I could see Harry Potter running away in the Summer of third year or whenever and stumbling upon such a secret- perhaps recognizing a rune or something of the sort, and learning a little and hanging out more in them- perhaps later utilizing them to get further training once Voldyshorts is back or even as the safe houses they were meant to be in the Hocrux hunt (after some character slaps the back of his head about his desire to protect them by staying away)

Edit: You know what, this is a good idea, I'm going to give it a whirl, and have them teach him muggle magic tricks as well if I can work it in, because why not.

***** Just finishing up editing and adjusting an epilogue for my first book after what I'm determined no matter how crap is the final one, don't like abandoning it when I'm so close. I've stalled enough.

Still, I've written down the basic premise I want to try going with (though I might abandon it for another), so far I'm thinking he runs away before Hogwarts and sees glowing runes and takes a chance and gets raised by a sort of Sub Rosa. Not sure if I should go with another name or not.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025986/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Sub-Rosa][First chapter's up in "Harry Potter and The Sub Rosa]], more of a prologue than anything, no Sub Rosa yet- I'm writing that now. Might change the beginning a bit- seems too independent for a kid. Then again, it's humor, might just say fuck it. .

** I was thinking about this recently, I've read one or two short fics from the marvel multiverse, AUs where Loki is a magician (real magic or not) and really liked the idea. I'd love to read something like - muggles discovered wizards and eradicated them a long time ago so they hide from society and some play magic tricks to earn a living, and our young hero gets discovered by a underground wizards society who want to fight against muggles to regain a place in the society/create their own. Could be really fun ! (One of the many prompts I have in mind for when I may want to write something and not quit after two chapters)

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but I still think you would like to take a stab and linkffn(Almost a squib) . It's about squib Harry who goes into Hogwarts and instead of magic he uses muggle solutions to help him get through life. Things like chemicals, crossbows and logic. There are no muggle magic tricks, but it's still very funny.

Also linkffn(Insane Asylum Escapees) Here Harry doesn't believe in magic and thinks Hogwarts is one big asylum. Again, no rabbits pulled out of a hat, but I still think you would enjoy it.

*** Both great fics, thanks though more muggle know-how and the truth respectively- hogwarts is nuts.

Actually Almost A Squib probably partly gave me the idea- they use magic for everything, kinda sad really, almost a squib is one of the few books where they don't- other than the martial arts harry ones.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt.
