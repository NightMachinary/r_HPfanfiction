As the title says, I'm looking for fics that have Harry with a sibling, but they actually have a good relationship. FemHarry, DarkHarry, WBWL/GWL are all ok. I would like completed fics but I'm also happy to read in-progress ones as long as they are still updating.

Thank you all in advance!

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister. Harry/Ginny, Rose/Cedric

** *Potters Stand United* linkffn(11979142)\\
WBWL with a twist, parents survive and sidestep Dumbledore. The parents discover the plot themselves and have a parents' group that does the horcrux hunt. And some drama. The one part I really liked was (paraphrasing) "Why didn't you tell us? You are acting like Dumbledore... My family has a spell that can do that..."

It's not the best WBWL fic there is, but it's certainly not the worst.

#+begin_quote
  Completely AU. A fierce Lily protects her twins from a meddling Headmaster. This time the adults take action. A different WBWL fic. Good Potters. Powerful Harry and twin. Goes through 4th year. Very minor bashing, kind of, sort of, well read A/N in first chapter. Some romance towards the middle, when the boys are older. OC (Gary Potter)/Susan Bones.

(P.S. I have the next chapter 90% edited and will be posting it later today.)

(P.P.S. Also the bot's a little out-of-date with its cached description. It's longer than the bot says).

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

The boys get along. It's not a 10 by any stretch. But it is one of my guilty pleasure rereads. The story is complete. But the sequel mentioned in the final chapter does not exist. Well it does, but it's one chapter. I'd ignore it.
