Back in the day, I used to be a huge fan of reading Harry betrayed by everyone fanfics. As I grew, I realized that many were sub-par.

Are there any where:

- Harry's friends know he's innocent and they're trying to free him

- He becomes insane or weaker inside Azkaban, instead of all of a sudden power surge.

- If his friends did believe Harry was guilty, than Harry either doesn't forgive them, or if he does, then it takes a LONG while to?

Am fine with het/slash/Femslash. Asexual/Bisexual, Etc


** I can't think of any titles off the top of my head, but most of the ones I've read fall into that last category. I'm not sure any of them involve Harry ever forgiving the people who believed he was guilty.
