Hoping you can help me find these, as I have accidentally mislaid them:

1) Hermione and Snape are on a train going East across Europe because of problems in the UK (?) At one stop they make they visit a library. They are not in a relationship.

2) Hermione is Snape's slave/servant after Voldemort wins. She is also spying for what is left of the Order (I think Luna recruits her). She and Snape become close, I think at one point he takes her to the Opera. She finds out Lupin is in a detention facility and visits him there.

3) I think this is a Hermione/Snape, but the only thing I remember is that Harry's body (and possibly Ron's) are strung up in the hall of the Ministry of Magic?

I don't even like Hermione/Snape, so it's odd I want to find these fics. I found the worlds interesting.

4) Okay, this one is super vague. There are trials for the Death Eaters after the war that kind of become a witch hunt. At one point they are even talking about having Minerva "questioned" because she very casually spoke to Riddle when they were at Hogwarts. Harry ends up rescuing Malfoy (he's in a tent or something, awaiting trial) and Harry puts him in a small boat so he can leave England.

Thanks in advance!
