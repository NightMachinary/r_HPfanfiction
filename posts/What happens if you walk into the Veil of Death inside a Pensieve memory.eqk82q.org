** It's just a memory, nothing happens to you. The image of the Veil of Death doesn't become a Veil of Death...

** Uh. I'd say that since the memory's owner probably didn't go in there, you will not actually be able to do anything but move through it without effect.

** There are no memories of that since any who enters the veil of death, well, dies.

*** No I mean what if you view the memory of someone looking at it, and then the avatar of you goes through there

**** I dont think anything will happen? It's just memory, same as if you jumped in lava or something. I only saw the movies so I dont know if there is any difference between books.

**** Nothing serious will happen since there is no memory of what would happen if you crossed the veil.

At most, I see that if you cross the veil in the memory you would: bounce back, pass through it as if it doesn't exist or exit the memory since you crossed the border of it

** I envision pensive memories as you being there like a ghost. If you went through the veil, you'd pass to the other side of the arch as you aren't actually interacting with the memory, just observing

i agree that the veil doesn't do anything in a pensieve. but what if a literal ghost went through it in real life?

**** Interesting, I'm going to say that since ghosts can't cross over, the veil would be an impermeable solid barrier for them, and act as the only proper wall in the world to ghosts
