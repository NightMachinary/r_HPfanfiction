It seems to me that a real, horrifying completely disgusting portrayal of horcruxes should be a super trope.

The matter in which they are created, or maybe Harry's realistic and terrified reaction to the discovery of his scar horcrux. But time and time again I read fan fiction that fails to produce that horrifying visceral gut feeling when the subject of them comes up. This is after all supposed to be the blackest most foul magic ever yet they are narrated as “very dark magic oh no! Oh well, must destroy them all”

Honestly I can only remember one fic where the creation on a horcrux involves not only the murder of an innocent but the ritualistic consumption of the innocent's heart. Followed that was the revelation that Albus (I believe it was him) had examined Lily's corpse and found her heart missing.

That's what I'm looking for, real horror at something so inhuman so corrupt that just sticks with you. After all something such as horcruxes must be that, was intended to be that.

If anyone know a fic or wants to give it a try go ahead.


** Wait.. How would Lily's heart even be missing? Wasn't Voldemort more or less disembodied almost immediately after killing her when he attempted to kill Harry?

*** Yeah, if anything the plan would be to take Harry's heart, Lily might have been spared.

There's a detailed fan theory about having to sacrifice your own body parts as part of the process, hence the lack of nose and unnatural skin

*** Lily did a ritual where she gave her heart (love) to save Harry and voldy broke a magical oath when he did spare lily like he promised Snape and a bunch of other convoluted stuff that made the perfect storm for an unintentional horcrux. Tbh I remember reading it and being so horrified because it was a whole arc of Snape refusing to accept the fact that Harry was a horcrux, getting the facts about the heart stuff that had to happen and him (and I) being so certain that there was no way and then for Albus to say he basically checked to see if a dead woman still had her organs. I kept dreaming about heartless corpses for days, I didn't think much about how little sense it made just that it was horrifying

I mean, aurors are cops. I find it extremely unlikely law enforcement encounters horcruxes, much less regularly enough that an auror on the force for... 2-3 (?) years would see them.

And as for Sirius, people ignore that he ran away from home when he was a kid. So unless 9 year old Sirius was hiding away, reading up on dark rituals, it's pretty farfetched also.

How? By osmosis? I don't deny the fact that it is very possible that he knows a lot of dark stuff by virtue of his upbringing, but I seriously think that even walburga would teach his 11- yo kid about horcruxes, you can bet my left kidney that after he gets gryffindored up and refuses to be dark she wouldn't even mention something like that to him. If I were her i would not give my child knowledge that he could use to hurt the rest of the family. Regulus finding out about them? Yes totally, Sirius? Not really.

******** He hated his mother and his father, he hated his family's legacy, he didn't hate all of them, he loved his Uncle Alphard and liked Andromeda for example.

And Hermione found a reference to Horcruxes on the Hogwart's Library, so I imagine what the Black Library would have.

Walburga was crazy, as in, crazy, crazy, so I don't think she would have any sense at all.

We don't know his backstory, we don't know exactly when he started hating everything in his family, he might have liked combat magic, his idea of dark magic may be different.

Heck in a fanfic we can change what we want, so maybe his pastime was hiding in the library because his mother would leave him alone thinking he was studying dark magic, and maybe one day he came across a reference on a book or something.

And don't forget that before Dumbledore purged it, Tom Riddle found enough info on Horcruxes in Hogwart's Library that it allowed him to track down how to make one.

And tbh he loved the “black sheep” of his family, a man unconcerned with “expanding the legacy of the most ancient and noble house of black” who was not dark and never even married, and a girl who had the sufficient character to elope and consequences be dammed. He hates his mom, his dad, never forgave his slytherin and later death eater brother, he hated his cousin bella and disliked Narcisa and malfoy so much that he disdained Draco Without ever knowing the guy (not defending but it is prejudiced all the same) Those are all his family. His family is the house of black and their traditions were those of house of black. I don't think I'm going out on limb here saying he hated his family, and what it meant to be a black: to be like those people.

Plus I always believed that walburga wasn't always bat shit insane, she was unstable and a horror for sure but she was pushed to all out crazy when her whole family, her whole legacy died. That can do it, specially if she was already unstable and grieving.

** Not of Horcruxes, but I remember reading some fics that gave you that vile gut feeling.

One of them was of how Voldemort managed to gain that grotesque infant form in GoF (before the ritual where Harry's blood was taken).

So, you get a pregnant woman, and force feed her unicorn blood mixed with as strong as a poison you can find (the stronger the venom, the stronger the form). Then you do some disgusting soul stuff (I don't really remember) so that the fetus in the woman dies and Voldemort wakes up in the woman's womb. The fic went into quite a bit of detail on how he convulsed and twisted to turn into some eldritch thing that took the resemblance of a child. Then, he was cut out by a follower, covered in blood and other stuff. It goes into quite a lot of detail, and just thinking of how the pregnant woman's life was cursed just makes me gag (and sad)

​

Another went into a tiny bit of detail on a horrific AU, where Voldemort realised his horcruxes had all been hunted. No horcruxes were left. And any more soul splits would lead to Voldemort's soul just dissolving into little peices. So after the impressive achievement of seizing all of Hogwarts and britain with a tight fist, he goes into a room in the department of mysteries (with the veil), and did some horrible ritual, sacrificing each persons life. A long line of people waiting outside, anxiously awaiting thier deaths - because no-one who's entered has ever come back out.

My favourite fic also has some /really/ horrific things in it. The horcruxes are */nothing/* compared to what was happening to the main character (Ron).

It's called Fate by TheTrueSpartan, although the horrific elements are only one part of the story, it is one significant part, and it does it well. Oh, this was the story with the pregnant woman ritual I was describing.

And I feel some fics just whitewash him and it just doesn't feel as high stakes, you feel? But that thing with the homunculus? Sick. Magical genocide by veil? Twisted. That's a Voldemort I can fear. Otherwise it makes a bunch of the magical folk seem silly and easily scared. Like yeah terrorist and murderer dark lord is bad, but something that realistically shouldn't be too hard for aurors and hit wizards and Albus. If you characterize him as the ultimate evil and then pit Harry against him then the situation feels just SO much more.

** There was a fic a read that basically said that Harry's ScR wasn't a true Horcrux and more of Soul Splinter of sorts. It basically said that making a horcrux requires you to bathe the vessel in the blood of innocents. Which makes sense if you consider the fact that to make a horcrux you have to kill, which is all we are told, so I assume that killing just creates a perforated line in your soul, making it easier to remove part of it. Then there's the hidden ritual to actually remove the fragment and put it in storage.
