Looking for fics where there are other wizards of Albus's cunning, ability, etc. (i.e. Grindelwald)

Preferably AU + action/adventure


** The Accidental Animagus and its sequel have multiple characters that are fairly explicitly the equivalent of Dumbledore or Voldemort in their part of the world. linkffn(9863146)

*** White Squirrel tends to have a habit of taking Harry Potter fanfiction cliches and writing them as competently and fascinatingly as possible; this one has 'Grangers adopt Harry', 'Harry is a natural animagus', 'Harry learns wandless magic', 'Harry does politics', etc, and aside from some slight awkwardness in the beginning, does it REALLY, REALLY well.

On Harry's side, aside from Dumbledore there's Edward Grayson playing a major role, while on Voldemort's side, an Aztec priestess called La Pantera is helping him (and is dangerous enough to warrant ICW intervention).

They only really start to come in in the later parts of the fic, though, and in its sequel, Animagus At War. You'll also want to see The World of The Accidental Animagus, which does a bit of worldbuilding you might like.

**** There's also a few others in the story as well. I can remember Old Coyote and some African Dark Lord I forgot the name of on the top of my head.

Loved the world-building in this story and its sequel.

** linkffn(8288341), A True Daughter of the Black by Ynyr. It fits all of your criteria, but either the bot isn't working or I don't know how to use it properly. It's also got quite a few twists and original concepts, or at least they were original to me.
