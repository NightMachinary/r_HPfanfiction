Ok I've tried everything to find this dracoxhermione fanfic and I can't remember the name. But it starts off with hermione running from death eaters and Draco while wearing a mask helps her get away. He is voldemorts right hand man in this but he hates it and tries to help the order but will only talk with hermione. Now also this story has alternate povs in every chapter. If you know the name of this fanfic PLEASE let me know. Thank you soooo much!


** Is it called "Turncoat?"
