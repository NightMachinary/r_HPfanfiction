** Based on the reviews I received for a fictional group stage of the 1994 World Cup, people liked it when you:

- Write the commentary, only use the character viewpoint to put emphasis on a couple scenes (use radio commentary for football as an example)

- Keep things simple. Even if you make the Quidditch pitch 200 yards long, the players will cross it in a couple seconds. A firebolt can do nearly 300 kph.

- Stick to known terminology. No one will know what an Takeshi play is supposed to be, but terms like cross, pass or shot are well known.

- Write multiple shorter (1k words) matches instead of one long one. Things get repetitive otherwise.

- Try to give each team an individual character. One might have excellent team work but is lacking on the technical side, the next one has a superb keeper but otherwise mediocre players, one might have perfect offensive plays but suck at defending and so on. Also think how these would interact with the opposing team.

** Several fics show Harry in a different position, usually chaser (ex. HP and the Prince of Slytherin).

Other fics toy with the rules of quidditch (ex. The Quidditch World Cup, Vitam Paramus, The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy), including seekers being more involved or beaters being able to contact other people.

The reason quidditch is often boring is because in canon the actual matches are ways of setting up /other/ plot points. In PS, making it appear like Snape is cursing Harry's broom (red herring #1). In CS, Harry's arm is broken so he can spend the night in the hospital wing where he speaks to Dobby for further exposition and sees the next petrified person.

The point is, quidditch seems to be best when it is serving to advance another part of the story.

*** You can also use it for World building (at least the World Cup) or have Harry watch professional matches for inspiration and pointers to use at Hogwarts. Just keep in mind that Hogwarts House matches are way below international levels.

**** I agree. The trick to Quidditch though is you need something else going on, whether it be world building or political shenanigans.

** It needs interesting characters and the quidditch has to not be the main plot.

** I like reading about it to be honest. I've read some fics that brought more tactics into it, that was always interesting. Or like a terrifying chase for the snitch to keep you on edge.

** A story about backup seeker for the Gryffindor team called Alex Moran... and basically give quidditch the BMS treatment.

*** What's BMS? And is this a prompt or a reference to an existing fic?

**** BMS is Blue Mountain State, a tv-series about a fictional University football team. The main character is Alex Moran. It has everything (sex, binge drinking, drugs, wild partying, hazing etc etc) to make a boring sport like American Football (or quidditch) interesting.

** I personally don't think any sport translates to text particularly well. Quidditch in particular is as much a spectacle as is it a sporting event. For something to be interesting we need to care about it, it needs to be made important to us. There needs to be stakes. Why should we care about the result of a quidditch match? I don't think its possible to capture the atmosphere of a live match in text form. Quidditch is quidditch I don't think the rules need changing but I struggle to think of a story that features sport as anything other than a plot device.

** If the focus is on the quidditch match itself and not other elements happening during the match (the players, the crowd, politics, etc.) then I think you need to change the snitch scoring. I personally cannot get invested in the intricacies of quaffle play knowing that it all comes down to the snitch anyway. So in canon its either an over 150 point blowout and the snitch doesn't matter or everything that comes before the snitch catch is essentially irrelevant. You could argue that a team trying to stay within 150 points matters, but in that case you could still lower snitch points and achieve the same result without the massive imbalance. Unless of course you are trying to show that Harry or whoever is basically carrying the team to victory by themselves.

The other way I've seen to avoid this is a heavier emphasis placed on total scoring in terms of league position and goal differential. So teams are still working for every goal because it might affect their seeding or toward the House Cup at school. The problem is this becomes a little dry for fanfiction readers many of whom I'm guessing aren't big sports fanatics. There's a bit in the books about Harry only catching the snitch when they're up by a certain number of points but that's as detailed as it gets.
