I'm not sure if I'm simply just unable to find them, or if they aren't there, but anyone know of a fic focused on plot (like, where the plot is different from HP) where the main pairing is F/F?

Obviously, it makes sense that there's a huge deal more M/M and M/F due to Harry being /male/, and I'd prefer it to not be a Fem!Harry story, but I just can't find /any/.

Examples: The Second String is (amazing) about time-travel and dementor souls and Squibs and...a lot, really, but it /also/ has Harry/Gideon (I think, I'm not checking this...sorry) as the main pairing while not being /focused/ on the pairing. Face Death in the Hope, a classic, while unfinished (and I'm 98% sure nothing has happened between them yet but...still), is another example of a plot-focused story with a pairing. And "long."

But basically: when I go through my bookmarks/favorites, /none/ of them are F/F. Lots of them /include/ F/F pairings, but they're always just /mentioned/, not the main characters. (There's also a disturbing majority of Drarry when I don't ship the two due to...obvious reasons like "racist asshole" but there are /some/ stories that write it well enough the guy isn't justified so I guess I won't kill my past-self?)

Going into my history, there's F/F main pairing stories, yet they're pretty much all one-shots, in the 10k range, or (and) completely focused on the pairing itself. I love Linny, yet it's always just side-charactered in Drarry stories (ack, hypocrite me) or romance-centered.

Even, does anyone have non-Fem!Harry but female-focused /non-romance/ stories? I highly enjoy stories that completely lack pairings (obviously things like...parents of characters being the parents of characters or two OCs don't count), and are 100% plot-centered, but they're always either male, Fem!Harry, or F/M. (I've said this before and will again: I've read and watched too much hetero stuff to look for it.) I don't mind Ginny/Harry in Ginny-centric fics, as long as it's focused on the plot and not too much...Ginny/Harry. I've never read a Hermione-centric fic with Romione but I like the pairing, so if anyone has an example of one of those I'd be happy to read it, too! (Huh, I don't think I've ever read a Romione story at all--as in focused on the romance part. Or just as main characters, which would be preferable.)

So...yeah. I'd love recommendations of simply female-focused works, even if it isn't F/F, where it's a nicely long fic. Since I don't exactly believe that exists, past the occasionally Ginny during the occupation fic.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990/chapters/5726924][Crazy Little Things]] is a romance focuses post war Hermione/Luna story. It is completed as well (which is sometimes like finding a unicorn), and is quite well written, though it may not have the level of plot you are looking for.

Another option is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30873761/chapters/76229945][The Watcher, The Lancer and the Starlight Dance]], which is another Herminone/Luna, where a bad future Hermione and Luna time travel back to try to fix things. There is a caveat here that I want to bring up. It looks like between when I last looked in on it and now, the author removed the story and started posting a rewrite (currently only 25k words up when it was 250ish k words). Story rewrites always make me nervous, because they often times come immediately before the author gives up and just stops writing it, but this one is at least currently updating.

  Harry Potter never returned from beyond the grave during the Battle for Hogwarts, and the magical world was thrown into turmoil after his death. Hermione and her friends fought for ten years as underground resistance fighters, but the blood on her hands eventually became too much for her to handle. She decides to go back in time to fix it all, taking with her the last person in their group that anyone had expected.This is the tale of Hermione Granger's return to her lost childhood, and her subsequent rise to meet the Dark Lord. She has a lifetime's worth of knowledge and experience, plus the help of Luna Lovegood's unusually accurate foresight, but will it be enough for her to rewrite history? Or is she doomed to repeat it?

******* Ah, no, it's not like that at all! Blood magic has been more associated with women because historically women have had less social power and have been hunted and burned as witches by Muggles, so they've had less access to materials and have needed to be more discreet. But they're not the only ones physically capable of doing blood magic.

That's actually a pretty big theme, grappling with the legacy of this women's space they've inherited (they discover a long-lost ruin of a medieval nunnery where the women were secretly practicing blood magic) and whether/how to start accepting men and boys as well.

** For Plotty Femslash Fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28159545][Hermione Granger: Tomb Raider]] is a Fleur x Hermione Indiana Jones AU. It is fun, action-packed, and awesome. It is pre-femslash so the focus is really on the plot as they aren't even past the crushes stage yet. Pretty good world-building too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26917306][Our Minds Work in Mysterious Ways (But We Like It Like That)]] is the first installment of a Fleur x Hermione Naturals AU. It is a really well-plotted psychological thriller. The romance is most prominent there, but definitely not the focus.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28771998][Our Minds Work in Odd Ways (But We Like It Like That)]] is the second installment of the same series as above. Both are complete while a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30960401][third]] is ongoing. The romances is very mild and pretty background to the plot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28363113][Scars Run Deep]] is another Fleur x Hermione Percy Jackson AU that I'm recommending with reservations. The plot is pretty decent, and the romance is background to that, but it also has mild Ron-bashing. Ron ends up as a hero despite this though, so it might be alright? It's YMMV.

​

For Plotty Female-focused fic:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There is a List for That]] by GatherYourStrength is a very recently completed Hermione-centric fic. It is a time travel fic to a few months after the end of the Voldemort War. She goes on a hunt for the Horcruxes and finds (or rather recruits) a couple of tag-alongs along the way.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12340905][Death's Gambit]] by MagdaTheMagpie is on the shorter side (slightly above 20k words), but it is Hermione-centric and has her hunting for the Deathly Hallows on the request of Death.

  Hermione strikes a deal with Death: she collects his Hallows for him and he puts her back with the living, where she belongs. If she'd known it meant a whole lot of time-travel, robbery, lies and fights with Grindelwald himself, she might have reconsidered his offer.

*** Thank you! I haven't heard of the other two, but I'll check them out, and I'm going to go search for Bellatrix/Hermione fics. I faintly remember seeing some where they seem like the type of fics I'm mentioning (since they're pretty much always time travel and have plot + being longish), though I haven't actually read one yet. Hopefully, searching specifically for the pairing will lead to some successes on finding a completed fic.

** linkao3(coven by naidhe). It's fully female focused and about female friendships. Pansy and Hermione accidentally create a coven bond when they inadvertently swap blood during a fight. The boost in power it gives them leads them to do it again and they end up becoming friends after lots of fighting and solidifying it into a coven bond and deciding to add more to the coven in order to increase their power and create a new side to the war.

The author writes from several POVs and the added women to their group are the best OCs I've ever read- Charity is a Hufflepuff who feels like a side character and Garcia is an Arithmancy lover with OCD (which is incredibly well written).

There's the Hermione/Theo tag but at the point the story got left at it hasn't been realised, although there have been some Hermione/Pansy scenes.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”
