Basically the title, I'm up for anything. Only requirements are that it's long-ish and decently written. I'm into Draco/Ginny right now (please I cannot deal with any ship bashing right now) so it would be amazing if it is the central or at least one of the main pairings. I have read a lot of the older fics, but still recommend them because we never know. Any genre is welcome.

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU. COMPLETE.

** Linkao3(The Sacred 28 by kcthekat)

I haven't finished this one so far. Got distracted. But read about 20 chapter. It's postwar Voldemort won AU. I think the romance has very sweet moments and also redemption arc for Malfoy. The writing is very good. Feels a lot more like a “book”. She's changes who lives and died. I have read Draco/Hermione post war and Voldemort won AU. It's not quite as dark as some of the Voldemort won D/H ones I've read. It does show the differences in their houses a lot in the way they handle problems which I always love in Gryffindor/Slytherin relationship fics. Ginny does not get sexually assaulted but there are mentions of it happening to another character

  In a dwindling post-war society, pureblood prisoners are being released into the care of Death Eaters for "rehabilitation." And because life is quite unfair, Draco Malfoy has been entrusted with one very angry, very vengeful Ginny Weasley.
