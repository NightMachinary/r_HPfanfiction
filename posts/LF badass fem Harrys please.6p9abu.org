Don't mind if they're a little twisted, or amoral, as long as they are talented and ambitious! Please and thank you!!!!!

obviously, I am a female not interested in reading about unintelligent or uninspriingly written characters. At least, not in a FemHarry story. I can forgive a regular male harry a lot of arrogance and ignorance and stupidity...but females don't get the same leeway :P Because I am a female...so help! Double-standards all the way!


** Your aggressive fem!Harry megapack: linkffn(the Pureblood Pretense; Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool; Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches; the Long Game by inwardtransience; Call Me Moriarty by UncleScrooge; Moratorium by Darkpetal16; Holly Evans)

Special mention: linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) - first in a series with 4 complete so far, it covers the similar life of an American witch with a hidden past going through her own coming-of-age in the same universe but with almost no reference to the plot of the books. The only caveat is that Alex suffers from that arrogance that you felt was unworthy of a female lead character. Worth the read, nonetheless.

Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

**** The idea is sound, but maybe you could look into getting a beta or head over to DLP's WbA?

The dialogue needs work, and the characters seem one-dimensional and flat. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you fix a few things here and there--smooth out the flow of dialogue, flesh out characters, and maybe a little less jumpy in the telling of the story, it would be a great read.
