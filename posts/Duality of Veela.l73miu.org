I am unsure if I ever get to actually writing a fic, but I have a lot of notes and some of them could make a nice prompt, so I decided to share.

Veela have their non-human part of nature and sentience. I am aware that it doesn't feel right for some, but to each their own. Fleur in particular has a big problem with her veela side. You see, veela-Fleur is a bit boy crazy, but human-Fleur likes girls, ony girls and both of her sides are making her life really irritating, to say the least.

Mind you, this was thought as a pararell to having incompatible sexual and romantic orientation, not as an opening for multi-pairing.


** Well, considering Fleur is a quarter Veela only and that side is attracted to guys, and she is three quarter human and that side is attracted to girls, she is probably into butches. She is quite suitable to be a femme considering how feminine her features are described in the books.

*** As far as I know the quarter Veela thing is not only fanon (canon doesn't directly states it) but also only one version of fanon. I do like your interpretation tho.

**** Yeah it's canon. She says her grandma was a Veela during the weighing of the wands ceremony in GoF.

***** It only means she is AT LEAST a quarter Veela, not that she is just A quarter Veela.

You see the difference?

****** I wouldn't know since JK doesn't go into detail, but from the folklore on which Veela are based, they can only be female and she says "grandmother", not "grandmothers" so I suppose quarter is a reasonable assumption for me.

******* I can see why, I just like to see that you either are a Veela or you are not, there is no middle ground. Well that part is free for interpretation, I suppose.

******** If my folklore recollection is correct, I believe Veela are spirits of women who had died just before marriage and they gain their power from seducing men lost in the woods at night. A Veela and a man can have a child but the whole spirit-of-the-forest essence gets quite lost. Quite like in Hagrid's case, where he is very big, he is in essence still a human (he doesn't even display the savage tendencies of Giants), so is Fleur... very beautiful but otherwise human.

Funny now that I think of it... Veela are kind of like the opposite of Dementors. Dementors feed on human despair based on their sorrow while Veela feed on human despair based on their attraction for them. What if Dementors are spirits of men that died violent deaths or lost their soul somehow? After all, according to Pottermore, Azkaban used to be the fortress of a dark wizard who lured sailors and then he'd torture and experiment on them.

That's a pretty neat headcanon. Thanks!
