I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a long time ago.

It's about Harry Potter receiving training from the Ministry of Magic with the Aurors / Unspeakable (I can not remember which), and discovers the ability to Walk in the Shadows and one of his training team member explains that Shadow Walkers are very rare nowadays because to become one, you have to lock the child in a dark room for the first few years of life, and everyone on the team is worried with his past.


** I'd like to nominate this for the award of "Least Useful Title"

*** I was going to say that this is the correct place to search for people who know fanfics about Harry Potter....

​

But I don't actually recognize that scene.

**** The thread is fine, the title just tells you nothing, given the reddit it is on.

​

Something like "Fanfic Search - Unspeakable Shadow Walker Harry" would have been loads better

**** Yeah but a harry potter fic that contains harry potter is at least 50% of all harry potter fics. So it doesn't really narrow it down much.

** I definitely remember reading something exactly like this. I also remember I found a fic in the community forums on ffnet. I think it was - Independent or Dark Hp or definitely the first five. I remember I quit reading that after a few chapters though.
