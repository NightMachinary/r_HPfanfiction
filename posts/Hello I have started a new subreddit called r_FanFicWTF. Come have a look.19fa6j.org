Hallo all! I am here to promote my new subreddit!

Here it is:

[1] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/FanFicWTF][www.reddit.com/r/FanFicWTF]]

It's a reddit made to share the most messed up and mind scarring fanfics you've ever read. Whether they're wtf worthy because of how badly written it is, or because of the strange material in it (Like the Redwall Abbey mice vs the Futurama crew or something), or because there's some rather wtf worthy sexual matches made, it's all welcome! I've already posted a couple stories to get it going, and plan to post more! Come give it a look! :)


** ohhh...This gives me a chance to scour the interwebs for things worse than My Immortal. I need to find the one with Hermione/Giant Squid. Or was it Hermione/Sorting Hat. Cant recall.

I've read some weird shit ones before. This is exciting.

******* I don't believe that adding a link to a NSFW community "contaminates" the original community. However, I've added a "NSFW" tag next to the link, so those under-age aren't blindsided if they unknowingly click on the link.

******* dude, don't be rude. This is the internet, not the play ground, you can't just push people around however you like. I messaged the mods, and they'll decide what to do in their own subreddit. Calm your tits.
