What it says on the title. What I'm looking for is a fic where MC uses legilimency all the time. For example, MC uses it to sift through the government officers head to gain access to the codes of nuclear warheads and uses it to get rid of the purebloods. Just an example :D

What I hate it in the fics I could find is that the MC uses it once or twice in the entire fic and promptly forgets that he/she even has access to this skill. Problems that could be easily solved in few minutes of sifting through your victim's head turns to entire arcs of angst.


** So many fics do this with every skill Harry learns. It drives me crazy. What's worse is when Harry never even uses the damn skill. He spends months learning legilimency and then uses it never.

** The problem with giving Harry skills in legilimency is similar to the problem with making him a metamorphmagus.

Both are extremely useful and powerful; they can pretty easily solve or skip past a lot of obstacles would otherwise be extremely problematic. Additionally, they are both abilities that Harry - unless he's a saint, and he's really not - would realistically be using /near constantly/.

Sure you can make the argument that legilimency is an invasion of privacy and shouldn't be used that much.. but I think resisting the impulse to "surface skim" people's thoughts would be really, really hard to resist. Nevermind that in any serious situation where the stakes are high or against Death Eaters and Death Eater Juniors that argument goes out the window.

That means the author needs to work the ability into a /lot/ of their scenes. And the author needs to design the protagonist's challenges and obstacles with the powerful ability in mind.

So basically, authors want Harry to have legilimency because it's super cool and powerful, but they don't want to figure out how to work it into their fic.

Mentor!Snape, better than most such stories. Legilimency plays a bigger part than usual here - if I remember correctly Harry tries to use it to attack Voldemort at first (fails) and then uses it to facilitate Bella's murder.

**** Yeah. I re-read it yesterday - it still stands pretty well, even if characterization is bit strange. But I liked the extrapolation on Leglimency a lot - I paid more attention to it this time. Especially the whole part with sending dreams, and how it's easier to perform on people who have developed Legilemency, because their minds have been "opened" by practicing it.
