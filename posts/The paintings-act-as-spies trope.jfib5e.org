You probably encountered the trope of the Hogwarts paintings, ghosts and even elves act as a spy network for Dumbledore. It's always presented as this sinister informant network that keeps tabs on the students 24/7 for the sole purpose of Dumbledore controlling them (somehow). And Harry always makes it a point to find safeplaces with no paintings and to put wards on the rooms, and such.

But I was thinking about this trope yesterday, and not only I don't think it's anything sinister about the paintings and ghosts keeping an eye on students, but it's absolutely normal and to be expected. Hogwarts is absolutely huge. Multiple towers, buildings, courtyards, bridges, untold numbers of rooms, and this is without the actual grounds surrounding it. And living inside of it are a bunch of teenagers with almost zero adult supervision, and at least since Riddle started making waves, there was great animosity between students.

It makes sense for the staff to have a way to be constantly sure that no one is hurt, or is hurting themselves, or is simply lost, etc etc. Even simply looking for a student must be a nightmare unless it's after curfew (and even then, that's no rule). Realistically, I would expect the wards to be what some would consider 'intrusive' too, as in, if a spell is cast in the hallways by students, an Elf is immediately alerted, and stuff like that. Or if it's an Unforgivable or the Obliviate, directly the Headmaster.

I really don't see this system as the Hogwarts NSA, as pretty much every author describes it as.

Thoughts?

*** Nah it's more like this

Ravenclaw girl : He's so bloody fit. I think I love him

The Grey Lady materializes

The Grey Lady : Everything we know and love is reducible to the absurd acts of chemicals and there is therefore no intrinsic value in this material universe!

I imagine she would be fairly bitter about romance given how she died and only speak in order to "help" students avoid making the mistakes she did

******* That's happened to me several times. Apparently my brain thinks "a few days ago" is the same as "months ago" when it comes to remembering how long ago I read something.

** In your scenario it's not a problem because it contains no evil Dumbledore.

** I'm not sure what your point is. It seems pretty clear that the "sinisterness" of the trope is entirely dependent on the interpretation of Dumbles. Evil Dumbles? Creepy spy network. Good Dumbles? Unintrusive security measure.

** Likely... I mean Myrtle is the one to warn everyone when Harry almost kills Draco. Even Peeves tells on students, although that's debatable whether that's because he cares about school rules or because he wants to cause trouble. For headmasters, it's known that they use the former headmasters portraits to send messages or to spy (Dumbledore sends portraits to St Mungo and the Ministry and Snape uses Phineas Nigellus to spy on the trio). However, just like NSA, probably Dumbledore accepts that kids will be kids and doesn't really care about every small transgression of the rules, but he will respond once something really bad happens.
