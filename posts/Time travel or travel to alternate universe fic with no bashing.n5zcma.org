Harry centric preferably. I don't really care about whether it has relationships or not. I just enjoy reading time travel fics but a lot of the decent ones frustratingly have bashing of characters I like and even characters I don't like that just make it cringe and ruin the story for me.


** Lesser Sadness has a time traveling Harry, my personal fave when it comes to OP!Harry fics. Does in 30k words what others need 300k to do. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness]])

Anticlockwise is Harry-centric and features a time traveling Harry but from Hermione's POV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022207/1/Anticlockwise]])

Eternal Return is Harry-centric and Harry goes back in time but in a different body. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return]])

A Question of When has Romilda Vane traveling back in time in the hopes that she could woo Harry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil. Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806]]) This one is a gen fic called Princeps by Lomonaaeren. The summary should give you a good overview, sequels are also finished. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] one of my fav Gen fics. This is a bit complicated because while there is no "true" bashing so to say some characters obviously differ from their counterparts (and make some bad choices) and Harry rather resents most of them because they summoned them to their universe and so you might not enjoy it.

Summary Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

  “Should it still be spinning like that?” Malfoy asks weakly. Definitely not, Harry thinks. At this rate, it would send them back to the beginning of bloody time. “Malfoy, we have to slow it down!” Harry yells over the growing racket of the time turner. Harry's not sure how, exactly, they're going to do that, but they have to try. Malfoy looks at him wildly, and hesitates for only a second before grabbing his arm. The time turner only seems to grow stronger. A bright light begins to glow out from the center of the device, reaching its edges over to Harry and Malfoy. Fuck. The last thing Harry sees is Malfoy's worried face, and then darkness.---featuring: Harry meeting the marauders, a healthy dose of Drarry and Wolfstar pining, and the James and Harry friendship you never knew you needed.

  “Louis,” Niall said in a warning tone but Louis wasn't having any of it.“I mean it Niall. He may be famous but that doesn't give him to right to be such a dick,” he argued and then turned around to face Niall only to see that Mr. Superstar was standing right next to the Irish boy, eyebrows furrowed.“Wow I didn't think that you'd have some dickhead friends,” Liam said, voice low and his expression hard as he eyed Louis from head to toe.Louis thought about apologizing at first because damn he had just insulted an apparently worldwide superstar and he had definitely made a fool of himself but then again this guy had just called him dickhead so why should he apologize then?“Really?” he questioned instead, voice threatening, “You finally show up after twenty minutes and yet decide to call me a dickhead?”ORLouis meets Superstar Liam Payne through his best friend Niall. Both Boys dislike each other right from the beginning only to figure out that the other boy isn't so bad after all.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.
