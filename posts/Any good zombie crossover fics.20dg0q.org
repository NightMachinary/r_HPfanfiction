** I don't know that you're going to find a better one out there than Incorruptible, unfortunately. That's a pretty untapped region in fanfiction at the moment

** I have access to a deleted Snape/Hermione fanfic involving zombies. I forget how long it is, but it was an awesome read! Rated R for violence and graphic sexy times. PM me if you want the PDF!
