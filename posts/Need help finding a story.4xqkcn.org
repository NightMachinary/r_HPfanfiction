I am looking for a story where harry dies and meets death. He is given a choice of powers and he chose one that allowed him to steal a certain ability if he killed(Might have been dementor like soul effect). I can't for the life of me find this story. It's also a Time Travel fic and he's sent back to before Hogwarts I believe... Please if any story seems like it matches this let me know <3 I believe he only gained the power if he killed multiple but I could be wrong


** I'm about 90% sure it's Xerosis. He meets death, is given the 'powers' of a dementor (wherein if he takes the souls of individuals he gains abilities -- more complex abilities require multiple souls to be taken), and then I think his mind is sent back to his infant self. Can't remember much more -- it's been a while since I read it, so it might be completely awful and/or the wrong fic entirely.

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots
