Reading "What We're Fighting For" where Lavender and Parvati have been practicing on each other before "training" up their boyfriends (haven't read further to know if Hermione joined them) and I would love to read something like this. Where the girls pratice on each other before having sex with their boyfriends. As long as Hermione is in it I don't mind which other girls are in it. The writing has to be good, no too cliche, and at least 20k wording.

And can you guys please point me towards other femslash? At least 50k wording there. And updated/finished in the last 3 years. But please no Luna/Black sisters or Ginny. No next gen And absolutely no fem Harry!

Thanks!! :)


** Are you absolutely sure you don't want any next gen fics? The only good femslash fic I know is next gen. It's Lily Luna/OC Draco's Daughter

** You know, looking at this a bit later, I think you might be a bit too restrictive with your tastes. I'm not sure you'll find a lot of stories that fit for everything you listed.
