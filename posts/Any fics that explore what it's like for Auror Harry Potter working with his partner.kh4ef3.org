I'm mainly looking for a good genfic that explores Harry interacting with his Auror partner during work or after.

For his partner, I'd prefer that they be Draco, Blaise, or Theo but not Ron or an OC. Anyone else you can think of is fine. I don't really care if they end up dating or anything, but I just want a fic detailing life as an Auror and getting used to a partnership with someone. No smut, please.

No angst, either.

** The Aurors is pretty good. It talks about Harry as an auror and some idolizing trainee.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
