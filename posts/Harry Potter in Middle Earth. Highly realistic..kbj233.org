Harry Potter had been a dark wizard hunter for a long time, and he knew how to hunt them down. Needless to say he ran into horcruxes more than a few times and figured out how to recognize those dark objects quite easily.

One day he was transported to some medieval world, granted, he lived in the Wizarding World so the technology of this world wasn't very far behind what he saw used on a daily basis. There were many similarities, like the existence of Dragons and Wizards, as he heard utterances of, but many differences as well.

Despite what people think, Harry did not need the adventure, and being thrown into this world pissed him off to no end.

He wandered around the foreign land, foraging for food fairly easily with his magic until he found a town called Bree and a tavern called The Prancing Pony.

He decided that getting wasted was a great coping mechanism, and he was having a grand time until a few midgets came in, introducing themselves as 'Hobbits,' whatever the hell those were.

He saw that one of them had suddenly gone invisible. Obviously curious about what gave the midget something similar to his cloak, he followed as the midget met a dude who wanted to act mysterious but was failing miserably. He observed as they set up fake pillows for some reason and decided he would investigate the invisibility device the next day.

As the midgets and the man set out on their journey, Harry called out to to them before bodybinding all 5 of them. He walked up the the midget who could turn invisible and found a ring. Casting the normal spells, he found it was a horcrux.

He let the 5 out of their binding.

"Do you know what kind of /bloody idiots/ you have to be to use this as an invisibility device? What the /fuck/ is wrong with you?!" Harry demanded.

All of them gaped at Harry before unleashing a maelstrom of questions at him. They followed this by charging at him, weapons drawn.

"/Incarcerous,/" he cast, tying them all up.

"Maybe you should learn that charging someone who asks a question and can easily defeat you all isn't good for your long term health."

"Anyways, I'm going to deal with this shit now, so no more dumbasses like you have to deal with it."

"/Fiendfyre/"

And with that Sauron's ring was no more.

"Bye dumbasses"

He dispelled the bindings on them before turning to go back to the village.

The five simply gaped as he walked away.

He re-entered The Prancing Pony.

"Hey bartender, I'm angry and I need alcohol. This better come in pints."

I disliked this part. I mean... letting a potentially hostile group, after ambushung them, which was carrying a horcrux, free just to rant at them and then barely reapplying the binds when they predictably attempt to give him a steel injection?

Kinda breaks my SoD if this was supposed to be a Harry who had experience dealing with horcruxes (and thus the protections around such).
