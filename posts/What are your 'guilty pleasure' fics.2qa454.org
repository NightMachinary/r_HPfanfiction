**** !!! I know, right?

It's a pretty important book for me too. Before I read it I had this . . . /appalling/ fanfiction idea, sure - some bits were good, but the majority was a load of tosh with /Griphook Potter accounts/ this and /Harry is automatically a smooth speaker/ that.

That was largely due to me having shitty unpolished ideas and remiss technical skills, but from /Evil Be Thou My Good/ I got into horror, and from there I read H.P. Lovecraft's works and absolutely fell in love with his writing; how descriptive and enticing the prose was, and how easy it was to read with a lax mind, too.

It's been only weeks since then, and I've scrapped 60,000-odd words I'd "polished" from before and completely restarted writing, only this time: not shitty.

In a way it's that fanfic indirectly led me to putting far more serious weight to my writing thoughts.

That said, I /do/ have to disagree with the idea that TAB or TLVTC are the cream of the crop.

**** Thanks, I'll take a read. I'm a little hesitant as it looks from the author's notes like it might just be a canon only retelling with nothing new but soul bond* feels. Not exactly my cup of tea, and one of the reasons I prefer the wildly AU fics.

I lose all suspension of disbelief when things somehow fall into place exactly the same way after Harry's been stapled to three girls, Ron's been turned into a Veela, and Draco's been reduced to component atoms in a suspicious potions accident. For instance. Please advise if I'm totally off base on that regarding this fic.

** I really like the Black family because it's so large and had (distant) members on both sides of the war. For whatever reason I really like when Harry's surname switches to Black, or just has Black tacked on to Potter. Although, I find myself hating the Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-EveryDamnName fanfics.

Also, about a year ago I found myself reading a lot of the next-gen fanfics where all the kids go back in time, usually to around Harry's trial for under-aged magic, and I failed to find one that was complete and done well. But, I did find one where the kids of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass went back in time to the beginning of their third year. I really like that fanfic, despite the relatively bad writing, because it was different.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

Not sure if you've read it (I often forget the screen names of people who've talked to me about it), but it solves one of the problems you noticed, and more of that is planned including wildly diverging storylines.

The key feature of this fic is a de-powered Harry arriving back in time almost unable to use magic (though with the mind of a thirty-year-old) and the "powering up" of the world in general. Some of the themes are intentionally outrageous (though not crack-y), I love ending chapters on cliffhangers, and it is a WIP, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But it might be yours.

Seventh Horcrux is extremely crackish with absurd Voldemort characterisation. It works to make you laugh but it means the fic lacks character-depth.

Hit the Ground Running has pacing issues, being about 90% beginning, 9% middle and 1% end.

A story can make me laugh uproariously but if you take the humour element out of the fic and the remains lack substance then I'm not going to consider it a good story.

In many ways it's easy to get cheap laughs by going the absurdist parody route. What's really impressive is getting laughs within a serious story (e.g. Terry Pratchet's Discworld series).

**** No this is the one where it's Ron and Hermione centric. The weasley children and their wives have a sex party every year [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=6573&index=1]]

** Ill do the unoriginal thing and say that HP:MOR is probably my favourite piece of fiction ever (aside from Evil by Jan Guillou), a stance that doesnt seem to popular on this sub.

That being said, I absolutely adore almost any Harry FleurRomance, especially if it features soulbonds, harry turning into a stupid dragon animagus or the Veelas themselves being evil and/or scheming.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10486840/1/Young-Princes][Young Princes]] by Little.Miss.Xanda =|

I didn't believe in guilty pleasures until I read this fic, I thought if you enjoyed it, it was a good fic. But then I read this one..... So ashamed of the unbelievable way this plot is executed, my suspension of disbelief almost broke, but it's just so satisfying..... I alternate between cringing and squeezing my stuffed animal to death in delight. I wish there were more chapters...

** To be honest, I love a dose of sappy Harry/Hermione once in a while... most of which isn't even very poorly written. Some examples: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/3024][Hack. Snort. Cough. Sneeze.]] Anything of [[http://parkergray.livejournal.com/][Parkergray's]]. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6773][Life N.E.W.T.S.]]

In other words, about three-quarters of portkey and livejournal.
