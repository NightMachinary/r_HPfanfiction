Canon makes it clear that an Animagus in animal form cannot be infected by werewolf bites. However, it doesn't explore the many other questions that could arise, such as:

- What happens to Animagus abilities if the wizard is bitten while in human form? Do they lose their Animagus powers? Is their prior Animagus form replaced with the wolf? Do the two magics ignore each other and both work normally?
- What happens if a werewolf attempts to gain an Animagus form? Is it possible? Do they automatically get a wolf form?
- If a werewolf Animagus automatically gets a wolf form, does it affect the relationship between their human and wolf minds? Could they gain increased self control during the full moon, by getting in touch with their wolf during the month? Conversely, could the wolf bleed through and reduce their sanity/control at other times?
- If a werewolf can still have a regular Animagus form, what happens if they are in animal form when the moon rises?

What do people think?


** I remember going through these kinds of questions when I was writing one of my recentish fics, where Harry has an animagus form and is fighting a werewolf in the founder's era. It happens in chapter 3 of linkffn(12120450). I think essentially I went with something like the skill to transform into an animagus requires you to be so in tune with your body that it's able to prevent lycanthropy from taking hold.

** presumably fenrir would use a wolf form to attack people if he could.
