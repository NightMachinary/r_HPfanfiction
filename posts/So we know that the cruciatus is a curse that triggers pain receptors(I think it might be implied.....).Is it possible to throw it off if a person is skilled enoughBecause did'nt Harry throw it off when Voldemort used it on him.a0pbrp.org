#+TITLE: So we know that the cruciatus is a curse that triggers pain receptors(I think it might be implied.....?).Is it possible to throw it off if a person is skilled enough?Because did'nt Harry throw it off when Voldemort used it on him?

** Harry threw off Voldemort's Imperius Curse, not his Cruciatus. The former can be thrown off because the user has to dominate the victim's willpower.

**** I agree with [[/u/AutumnSouls]] ,there is no reason to think that the Cruciatus can be thrown off. The Imperious curse can be thrown off, but that is not an inherent trait of the Unforgivable Curses since the Killing Curse can (obviously) not be thrown off. We have directly witnessed Harry throwing off the Imperious, but there is no canon instance of the Cruciatus being thrown off (when it was cast correctly).

Except for when Harry did that... twice.

*** I'd say no. We know the Killing Curse doesn't kill in any way that can be identified scientifically, for example, so I don't think the Cruciatus Curse uses a part of your body to make you feel pain. It just does what it's meant to, because fuck you, I guess.
