**** Plot armor: Kirsty was very nearly taken anyway by Pinhead despite holding to their agreement. She managed to send them back in time. Barely.

Edit: in the later films and expanded universe, her experiences still twisted and broke her to the point where she willingly opened the Lament Configuration a decade or two later. She replaced Pinhead and became a cenobite. So, yeah.

Pinhead didn't need to take Joey back to Hell: Hell was pretty much coming to Earth. If his human half hadn't intervened, it's likely Joey would've ended up, ah, let's just say /violated/ in mind, body, and spirit and leave it at that. Heck, she was even chained up, helpless at one point.

I read the comics where that happens. It was less because of her being twisted, and more a 'galaxy brain /s' move on here part.

She tried to pull some Realpolitik to destroy Hell, and she got bit in the ass for it.

** So I like everyone who jumps straight to hellraiser, but imagine instead, hundreds of voices echoing across the battlefield, shouting a battlecry that still strikes terror into the wizarding world today: “I'm mr meeseeks! Look at me!”

And hundreds of blue figures charge forward in an unstoppable tide.
