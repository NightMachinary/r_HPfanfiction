Ok, so I love me some Slytherins and some deep dives into Wizarding Culture and all that jazz, but I'm getting really burnt out on all these stories that basically victim blame muggleborns for not integrating into wizarding society and put such a huge emphasis on family magic and bloodlines and all that shit. I want Slytherins as kids raised by racist families and dealing with the same things that so many people are dealing with right now - growing up, interacting with the world, and realizing just how /fucking appalling/ the ideas they were raised on are. I want muggleborn Slytherins and their journey through navigating the culture they're surrounded in that doesn't end with them assimilating 100% to the wizarding world. I want a world where, honestly, the societal difference between wizards and muggleborns isn't actually more different than, say, British and Bulgarian societies. What've yall got?

Exile by bennybear is this story. It's a very well done, a realistic story of dealing with trauma and overcoming being raised with extremely toxic ideas.

Draco and Narcissa are punished with a five year ban from magic for their crimes in the war and their Manor and most of their wealth is seized by the Ministry (personally, I find this a very fitting punishment). Draco ends up finding a bunch of Muggle money that his grandfather had hidden and runs away to the Muggle world rather than marry an ugly, rich pureblood girl. Slowly he sees how much of what he was told as a child about Muggles was bullshit, he learns to cope with the trauma of the war, and he finds a place for himself in the Muggle world. He's no tragic, romantic anti-hero, just a rather weak willed young man from a toxic family struggling with his own mediocrity. There is no Malfoy or Death Eater apologism.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** I started reading that one and it just seemed to drone on and on about all the injustices that Draco had to deal with and it seemed to be such a pity party that I stopped after 25 chapters... I'm usually fairly forgiving of most fanfics, but it just made me irritated about how much it just kept on going. I understand the SoS and how it's supposed to work, but after reading into it, I just couldn't stay interested in it...

**** That's fair, the story is slow and very character driven instead of plot driven. Draco is true to canon and therefore a whiny brat, especially at the beginning. It's certainly not for everyone, I just think it's the best example of a supremacist character having a realistic redemption story in the fandom. And the way it happens makes it very comparable to real stories of people leaving behind their parents' bigotry. Draco doesn't heroically join the light.

** I'd be interested in them too. Often it appears that these stories follow the justification of 'my traditions are being stamped out because other people follow their own, therefore Slytherin's are victims.'

You see this all the time, where I am - people who would swear they don't mind immigrants as long as they 'integrate', yet the second it turns out other families don't have a roast every Sunday, they've concluded that Christmas is on course to be banned and their jobs are being 'stolen'.

These fics often stress the idea that muggleborns are diluting traditions or getting traditions 'banned', despite them actually being benign. While this perfectly matches up with xenophobia, logically speaking it's a construct of their prejudice. The ministry and it's legal system is strongly influenced and controlled by purebloods - to suggest that muggleborns are strongly influencing laws doesn't match up with what we know.

'Dark' purebloods, broadly speaking aren't oppressed because they run the legal system/are essentially the ruling class. They feel oppressed because their attempts to murder or remove muggleborns from the wizarding world have some marginal limits.

Muggleborns shouldn't need to completely assimilate, as though their culture means nothing at all. Yet, at the same time, no effort is made to teach the children about different cultures. It would make sense to have a class - Religious Studies/Philosophy and Ethics analogues or something akin to the muggle 'British values' classes. (Yes, tolerance of other faiths and cultures is a British value, as per the curriculum.)

  When kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape's own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions-- it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.When Quirrell shouted “troll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,” and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)-- he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.

** Not an answer per se, just agreement from me. I find /interesting/ stories that take the 'what if' thought experiment of the idea that muggleborns are refusing to integrate and learn about that side of their heritage. I /don't/ know if there's properly basis in canon for that reading - JKR unfortunately gives us too few muggleborn characters to judge, iirc only Hermione, Colin and Dennis, Justin, Lily, and Myrtle (?!). And I find uncmfortable to an extent stories that don't just treat it as a thought experiment, but more of an actual 'outsiders must be assimilated or be forever spurned' belief that the author themself has and is just applying to this world.

** I think that this story meets your criteria:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]

Also, it sounds like you are tired of stories that white-wash pure blood supremacy and you want them to be portrayed as deplorables? Understandable. The way some authors applaud the pureblood movement is disgusting.

In general though, I think that a large part of the appeal of pureblood stories is that it shows that the contempt and microagressions of characters on the "light side" like by Hagrid to entire demographics has backlash and consequences that has many real world parallels. Especially because it seems like the ideals held by the purebloods have lost their cultural significance. These ideals due to fear of losing cultural power have morphed into the utter hatred and contempt that gave raise to the voldemort movement. So while the traditionalists may have valid grievances, the voldemort solution is NOT the right one. And the muggleborns are basically innocent bystanders inbetween the power struggles of two sects.

I feel like on his way to greatness, as far as I remember, explore these themes well. It doesn't justify the actions of the dark but it makes it more human.

​

Well ,at least, I think this is why I like these kind of stories....

*** I think I get what you're saying, and there's definitely something to be said about how the "light" side seems pretty set in reckless hate towards everything "traditionally" pureblood. And I definitely love stories about how the various old traditions are there for a reason - House Proud by Astolat remains one of my favorite fics ever, and Evitative by vivchan is absolutely wonderful. I also just recently read a story that does it very, very well - Never Plant a Wishbone by ShanaStoryteller. That one hits the mark, making the traditions important for magical reasons while at the same time not feeling like the story is making excuses for supremacism.

However, a /lot/ of these stories sound like my relatives. Imma tl;dr this because it's not the place, but every time I read a story that hand wrings over ultimately inconsequential things like muggleborns lacking manners because they don't use "Madame" for a married lady or offer to shake hands when /of course/ wizards bow instead, I hear my 92 year old great Aunt who still calls the civil war "the War of Northern Aggression". In the wizarding world it /can/ be different, and we've both offered examples of tradition without victim blaming, but all too often I see it as "well magic says we must do this" looking suspiciously like a justification for why ultimately xenophobic and bigoted practices are really all ok in the end. You dig me?

**** I kind of went off topic. 🙄

Just last night I was reading a fic called Eviatative and the way the author white washed Draco and Pansy made my skin crawl. apparantly the reason why Draco and Pansy are dispicable to everyone outside of Slytherin is to deter people from picking on them.

It was a Drarry fic, but reading it reminded me of why I hate pairing Draco with anyone..

***** Same, I wasn't a fan of Eviatative either. I really wish someone had explained the flaw in that reasoning to them (not even the moral Golden Rule approach that Harry argued, but the practical "if you pick on a loser like Neville, you don't look like you're too tough to fuck with, you just look like a dick").

Also, I hate fics that make Ron so unreasonable. I think first year Ron having beef with Slytherin Harry is probably accurate to his character, but fifth year Ron abandoning him just because Harry was acting sneaky?

(Not to hate on first year Neville, of course, but I think most people did think of him as a loser.)

****** Well, tbh, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are unpopular dorks, who bonded over being outcasts, and then they later bonded with Luna and Neville, who are like the untouchables in the school.

The main cast being losers is supposed to make them more relatable, I think, and to contrast the cast with the antagonists who are often privelaged or have a position of authority within the world.

This kind of falls flat though because JK can't stop giving superficial accolades to the cast to make them special. Like Harry being Bwl and a sports star, the weasleys actually being extremeley impressive despite the wizarding world's opinion of them being painfully mediocre and Hermione "being the brightest witch of her age" who consistently shows up the Slimey Slytherins by being top of the class.

** So, Innocent by MarauderLover7 on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], it's kinda old and unfortunately, it seems that the story came to an end by the 4th book, BUT it's really interesting how she develops Draco's character. For starters, he's not an only child, he has a brother and is obviously raised to be a blood supremacist, but with everything going on on the wizarding world (such as Harry being raised by Sirius - who wasn't considered innocent), they, Lucius and Narcisa decided that one of their kids should be a friends with Harry. Although Draco doesn't interact with the muggle world, giving all the circumstances he was under, he ended up learning that there's no such thing as mudblood. Not to give even more away, but he has to face his family and their conflicting beliefs. It's really nice, though the plot is slow during the first part. Really recommend it though, to see a totally new face of Draco's character.

** I do understand your argument. The Pureblood vs Mugglesborns is involving two questions that are valid in even our real world. 1. The danger of losing his identity for the host of the massive immigration. Assimilation versus Integration. Or even phobia of the cultural meeting, because a cultural meeting will lead to one culture being deemed right and the other sentenced to disappear. 2. The eternal struggle between Traditions and Change. The contestation of the Traditions in favour of the mouvement of Change, and the contestation of the past as being assimilated as a weight for the futures generation. The research of evolution for the sake of evolution (not progress because progress is a positive evolution). The contestation of Traditions for the sake of the will to forget our roots. Jonah Goldberg once said that « Cultures grow on the wine of Tradition ». The fear of the unknown that is within the idea of Change. And yet the inevitability of Change brought by Immigration or muggleborns. Despite Dolores Ombrage being the most hated character in the book, she expressed very well the dichotomy and comprise needed : “Evolution for the sake of Evolution must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.” A balance must be sought. It is a philosophical and existential debate. I do think that the purebloods do have a legitimate claim to fear muggleborns. And muggleborns have also a legitimate claim of being ostracised by being associated with muggleborns like Hermione Granger who may very well be the Icon for changing Wizarding Culture towards more likeness to muggle culture. A fine example of that may very well be the case of house-elves and the assimilation of a symbiotic relationship to slavery.

That is why I do believe those fanfiction you do not like have the right idea but It may be also interesting to see the struggle of the characters in their morale dilemma between the morale obligation to preserve traditions and the necessity of progress. But yet again a balance must be found.

P.S : I do think my opinion is consensual so please fell free to argument against me than downvote.

** Exactly we need more fics about how the Ministry of Magic is manipulating sets of pawns on both sides. The extremists are being used and the Muggleborn community is being used to keep the supremacists angry and the light side fighting the good fight.

*** Meh, that's a little too apologetic of the Death Eaters. Also, the Ministry in canon is being manipulated by the pureblood extremists, like Malfoy and Yaxley, not the other way around.

You can make individual Sytherins who are breaking away from the pureblood ideology sympathetic without painting the movement as at all sympathetic. The purebloods are bigots with power who fear outsiders. That's a song history has sung many, many, many times before. You don't need any sympathetic portrayals to make it realistic. People do horrific things on the simple basis of deeply indoctrinated in group/out group bias literally always. It really doesn't need to be much deeper than that, because in reality the justifications are also very shallow and unsympathetic. It's irrational fear and hatred of "the other" and it's an unfortunately common human tendency.

**** Even without Malfoy's influence it's /still/ wildly biased against Muggleborns. The underage magic law effectively ONLY applies to Muggleborn and Muggle raised kids - some families like the Weasleys make their kids follow the law anyway, but if there's at least one magical adult in the home, it runs entirely on honor system. If Ron does magic at home outside of school, his mother yells at him; if Harry or Hermione do, they risk expulsion. Squibs don't even get registered by the Ministry of Magic and can't get an education or a job. People like Arthur Weasley get passed up for promotions and raises because they're not racist enough.

Malfoy, Voldemort, and the other Death Eaters were a symptom, not the disease.

***** Agreed, even the "muggle friendly" Minister Fudge accuses Arthur of having no "pureblood pride". And the Weasleys might respect muggleborns and not want muggles harmed but still clearly have a degree of belief in the superiority of wizards.

Their society is clearly set up to enable pureblood supremacy, which is why the "poor pureblood traditionalist" storylines get on my nerves so much. It's a completely toxic culture.
