Hey guys

I am looking for that kind of fanfiction where there is a single change and everything changes. I really don't know what it is called. (Maybe ripple effect or something)

Harry centric and no slash

thank you


** "Petrification Proliferation", linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk more seriously, and.... Just enjoy the ripple effects!

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Alright, so you want point of departure fics? The singly best executed version is linkffn(Forging the Sword). One single change at the end of CoS changes things. The changes all make sense, and certain events still happen, because the event either doesn't affect them, or barely changes a detail.

Also check out linkffn(What You Leave Behind) which has three major points of departure. linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) is one during DH. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) is one post-CoS where Harry... had trouble processing the events in the Chamber. And for a... darker version is linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress).

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

In particular, I would recommend Weasley Girl (linkffn(8202739)) and its sequel-in-progress; it features...female Ron Weasley, who's bad at chess but gets along great with animals.

I don't know how to describe it, so just give it a read, I guess.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
