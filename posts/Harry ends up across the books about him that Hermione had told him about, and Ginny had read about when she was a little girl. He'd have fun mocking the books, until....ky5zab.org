What happens in the obviously made up books about him? What makes him annoyed at what's inside? That's up to you!


** I'd imagine the endings would really bother him. Imagine little Harry going on adventures, defeating minor monsters. Then going home to a family who loves him, wants to hear about his life, feeds him homecooked meals before he goes to sleep in his bedroom in a turret (adventure kids books always have weird bedrooms). I think that would break his heart, seeing the life he should have had but didn't

It could be adult Harry fighting dragons, being like Indiana Jones, etc. The books were fictional, something that little kid Ginny was a fan of. So I imagine something grand/interesting in the books.

*** First book in the series; Harry Potter and his stalwart friends solve a series of dangerous puzzles and Harry does away with the Dark Lord and his evil but bumbling apprentice.

Second book in the series; Harry Potter and his friend go into the hidden dungeon to save the fair maiden. Betrayal most foul, and Harry is forced to face the evil beast and it's Dark Master alone.

And so on, with Harry's life being almost perfectly predicted in print. The books are highly metaphorical, as is the hallmark of Divination. For example, one book depicts him taking to the high ground to avoid a monstrous beast; this serves as a metaphor for the incident where Ripper chased Harry up a tree.

** I actually made up the titles of 14 of the books - 1 every year between the ages of 2 and 16 - for a story I'm writing. Harry escaped Britain and didn't grow up there, but found the books anyway and owns a complete set of them. The thing that he finds the most disturbing is the fact that the author has his appearance correct, down to the scar. This Harry wasn't seen by anyone before he was 6 years old, so that means whoever is writing them either knew his parents and helped condemn him to the Dursleys or helped to murder his parents.

** The part about him being a big great hero with a chest of medals at the tender age of 6 or 7. Not only does Harry despise the spotlight with something approaching fanatical hatred, but he's never actually been rewarded for the things he's actually done. The Special Award for Services to the School was little more than a Band-Aid on a gushing artery in terms of an appropriate reward for saving the school, rescuing the fair maiden, and dispatching both a giant snake and the undead shade of a terrorist.

**** I mean, Harry hates being the Boy Who Lived because he only holds that status due to his mother having died for him; it's something that he hasn't earned. On the other hand, he, not anyone else, was down there killing a basilisk, nearly dying, and dispatching the shade of Voldemort to save Ginny. Before that, he stopped Voldemort from stealing the Philospher's Stone and returning from the dead, again nearly dying in the attempt. He may not like the spotlight, but he also doesn't like that his achievements and actual bravery are ignored and swept under the table.

** I'm working on a story where Harry is no longer living in England, and along the way, he learns about a popular children's book series and radio show called "The Adventures of Jamie Walker, Boy Wizard." They are loosely based on the British books based on him; the reason he hadn't heard of them until he left England is that they are banned in Britain because of accusations of plagiarism/copyright issues. But they are quite popular in Europe, Australia, MacUSA, etc.

Characters include Jamie, of course; his best mate, the teenage werewolf Alfie; the clever halfblood witch Tamsin; a centaur who he has ridden to battle; and the Evil Overlord (with corresponding mob) he fights in about half the episodes. Interesting enough, a few have made their way to Britain despite the ban and may be the source of the phrase "The Golden Trio."

Harry hates both series.

I doubt I will develop them much further as it's not an important part of the story; just a bit of color, so to speak.

** I mean, why would these books be overly different to fanfics? Aside from not being able to write about the events of the canon books, of course. And I suppose Dumbledore was too popular for any Dumbledore bashing fics.

I think it'd be the time travel ones where he solves the first wizarding war that'd get him. Much of the rest he'd just be deeply uncomfortable with, but these wouldn't go down well.
