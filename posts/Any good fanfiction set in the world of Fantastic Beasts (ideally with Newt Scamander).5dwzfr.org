I just watched the movie and LOVED it and I'm not quite ready to leave the universe. I know it's early, but any fanfics in progress that take place (canon compliant)?


** The HP fandom is amazing. I was curious and found some pretty cute Newt/Tina fics yesterday. Any real meaty fic will probably take some time to plot out for authors. At least good ones.

**** That doesn't shock me so much (I remember reading fanfics in the days after the HP releases when most people were still reading) but I am shocked that these ones are actually good and show a pretty deft understanding of the characters.

***** Hmmmm I really disagree. I've read one shots with better writing and character development than a lot of novel length fics.

Tho I have also accepted that my fanfic tastes go against what this sub likes.
