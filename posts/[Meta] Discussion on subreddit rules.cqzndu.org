I didn't used to notice this but I've been seeing a lot of recent posts where the entire thread is nuked for some reason.

Have there been mod changes or rule changes I'm unaware of?

I had always thought rule 9 to only be against bashing someone for the prompt but it's being used to completely remove any sort of discussion.

I feel like already the community is not as big as it used to be so if a few people do an impromptu fanfic session in a request thread or a discussion that doesn't bash the OP, what's the harm?


** Hi guys!

We talked this over as mods, and we see what you guys are saying.

We've decided to try and do something that is a compromise and works best for all.

*We are leaving up Rule 9, but will be revising the language*

The purpose of Rule 9 and 99% of its utilization is done to prevent and remove comments that come into a request thread to shame OP for their request. We do not want to stifle positive discussion, and we apologize if that is how the rule has come across or been used as such previously.

You guys made some great points and we wholeheartedly agree. However, we do want to give the option for people to request that no discussion occurs on their post. In those cases, OP must mark in their request thread [No Discussion], and we will remove any comments in violation.

Going forward, moderators will only be removing comments on request threads that are negative commentary about the topic requested. Other discussion may continue as long as OP has not requested specifically that there be no discussion.

Rule 9:

- No Request thread bashing. Do not utilize a request thread to make negative commentary on the subject or linked fics. Note: If the requestor has marked the request thread [No Discussion], all comments besides links to fics will be removed.

** Rule 9 is stupid, but I get why its there. I haven't experienced the mods being to harsh on it though, but I would hope that they would be relaxed on enforcing it if the discussion is positive or at least productive.

My rule of thumb is to add my 2 cents on the request along with a recommendation. I've never had a post removed with that strategy.

When the rules get in the way of productive, sincere and honest discussion then maybe it's time to consider a tweak in wording.

All else failing, is it too much to ask that they are moderated to the spirit of the law rather than the letter?

  Request threads are for fic requests, not opinions on the requested item. Do not bash the requests people make. Instead, make a discussion post if you wish to discuss the style of fic requested.
#+end_quote

Technically, writing a short and/or humorous fic in the comments is indeed fulfilling the request. You're not bashing or giving an opinion - you're just posting a fic that theoretically meets OP's standards here instead of on ff.net or ao3.

**** I have this annoying habit of cracking jokes at the slightest of things and so when I commented "No Deatheater washing" after seeing the OP's typo, I thought people would have a chuckle and move on - I never thought it would create a hilarious thread on its own. Even though the OP was very supportive and took the jokes in stride, I can understand, because I have been in the same boat myself, how frustrating it can be when you make a fic request and people are more interested in a discussion than responding to the actual request. The recent Fleur post, for example, had some amazing discussion threads, but ultimately only one fic was rec'ed IIRC.

That being said, I'll have to say this - this sub is far more supportive and welcoming to discussions and contrary opinions than the mother sub. I have stopped visiting that sub now and bother only when something heartwarming (or really, really interesting) pops up from that sub on my home feed. Because it's like a hivemind over there. My contrary opinion is that Severus deserves a bit more respect and empathy than what Potterheads generally tend to give him (and should be NOT be treated like some lusty, evil creep) but you have to prepare for war if you want to comment something like that there. Initially, for the first few times, I tried to tell people my side of things and why I felt that way, but I soon gave up because inevitably, I'd be inundated with angry, snarky replies and a barrage of downvotes. And every post that has something even remotely to do with Snape *must* have a comment denouncing him and his "evil" ways, followed by a long thread of concurring replies, so it becomes irritating after a point. Here, on the other hand, probably because fanfiction "liberates" your mind, people don't give a damn - although, a certain redditor is very, very touchy on the subject of the possibility of Draco's redemption because he swears by the Geneva Convention (I was once given a massive lecture on the treaty in one of his replies ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚).

Thanks for archiving the whole thing, btw.

I do disagree somewhat with your opinion about Snape personally, at least with book canon (he's a male wizard Petunia). However, on a request fic, militantly defending that view shouldn't be the first thing done. I think rule 9 might not be the best way to dissuade the situation.

** I've always maintained that rule 9 is a poor rule.

1. If it's about preventing rudeness towards the request or requesting party, then rule 3 (and general mod discretion) is already sufficient for that purpose ("No personal attacks or insults. Purposefully inciting arguments, personal attacks and threats will not be tolerated.")

2. Since the mods insist of keeping rule 9, then presumably its purpose is not to prevent rudeness but something else. That "something else" appears to be preventing people from having discussions in request threads. This is an odd rule for all sorts of reasons:

3. It gives OP an unusual special status to dictate the conversation. Normally when you have a conversation with a group of people, you can raise a topic, but you can't then dictate how the group's conversation will progress.

4. It gives the OP an unusual soapbox. Many people making requests use their OP to make arguments about the request. Essentially they are creating threads which are in content 99% discussion and 1% request. Then they (mis)flair the thread "request" and suddenly their arguments are immune from response. If Rule 9 is kept, it should be accompanied by a rule against mis-flairing your thread.

5. Ultimately, the rules should be designed to promote activity which adds value to the community. Most request threads do not add value. They consist of one person asking the community to do work for them for free. Often the OP has clearly made no effort to perform basic searches for themselves. Often the OP does not supply recommendations of their own as examples of the kind of fic they're looking for. Often the OP's request is so generic that it would return tens of thousands of fics.

6. It is odd that the rules currently protect such a valueless activity while punishing interesting and creative discussion, something which actually makes the community one that people wish to engage in. Honestly I don't think this community would lose much if request threads were eliminated altogether.

7. The idea of creating parallel discussion threads is just patently absurd. I did it as a form of malicious compliance [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6xofg/free_use_experience_by_furyserenity_discussion/][here]] for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6x5c3/lf_fanfiction_in_ffn_or_ao3_similar_to_free_use/][this]] request, but you can see how silly it is to create an entire thread just to make a single off-hand comment.

8. In reality, the rule that you should make a separate discussion thread just stamps out discussion. My comment [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cqzndu/meta_discussion_on_subreddit_rules/ex190tg/][here]] expands on this. You will also note how, in my "malicious compliance" example, the original request thread still had /no replies./ Shifting discussion out of request threads does not result in more recommendations being made. If anything, it just makes the request thread die quicker because of a lack of content.

9. In the final analysis, all rule 9 actually seems to do is bureaucratically enforce an organisational scheme (accurate flairing) with no real benefit to the community.

Recently some guy just wanted to find a very old fic from 2005 again after it disappeared from the net a long time ago. And he mentioned that he maybe remembered something about mpreg being a theme in it. Only replies after a few hours were about that, and not in the form of a nice discussion if you get my drift.

So I would prefer if Rule 9 was simply changed to allow discussions but still prohibits bashing/shaming.

Even with this rule in place, people will still downvote threads topics they dislike into oblivion. Namely threads with "unsavory" ships, like Drarry, Snamione, and slash.

****** As I understand it, the spirit of Rule 9 was to make the users of this sub feel more comfortable posting threads and making requests for specific fics, without feeling attacked, harassed, or threatened by people who criticize or shame them for their preferences. This allows people to request, for example, gay pairings without being told "Harry can't be gay!!!" in the comments.

If Rule 9 is supposed to put a stopper on users "othering" users who have alternative lifestyles, identities, and preferences, then it's not wholly effective when part of the "othering" effect is done through downvote spamming, so that certain threads drop into invisibility within a few hours of being posted. Users who request gay!Harry fics are made to feel unwelcome due to the implicit disapproval in downvoting a thread that obeys all the subreddit topic and content rules.

The toxic comments aren't the main problem. They're a symptom of the culture of this subreddit, which produces posts like this:

#+begin_quote
  I'd've thought that people who keep getting downvoted for posting certain things in a sub would take the lesson that it's not wanted there. But they don't take the lesson, and then people start threads to complain, which I've seen happen a few times aside from this one.

** The rule can stay, but the mods need to be much less strict about enforcing it, or to be precise - more in line with the extended wording of the rule. They should stomp bashing attempts, or responses whose only purpose is to maliciously criticise the fic/pairing/whatever thing that was requested, but let stuff like discussion about the topic, spontaneous self-prompts or opinions about the rec'd fics pass.

Self-prompts are kinda self-explanatory, having one arise organically is likely to result in something at least half-decent and is in no way harmful to the OP of the request.

Discussion that arises organically is the best type of discussion, and some of the requests are so nieche or bizzare that it's unlikely someone would come up with discussion thread on his own about such topic.

And opinions and reviews are kinda self-explanatory - i'd rather appreciate someone's opinion on the rec'd fic before i start reading it, and this sub has proved rather thrustworthy and reliable in its opinions.

** just a (mostly) lurker here to say I'm not a fan of Rule 9 either.

As some others have touched on, it seems like discussion does take place, but is only allowed if it is in favour of the OPs request. If no discussion is truly desired then at least /enforce the rule/ "Request threads are for fic requests, not opinions on the requested item" NOTE: Any opinion. It later uses bashing as an example, but that is not what the rule says. Make it so strictly only bot links or direct hyper links are allowed.

Of course, I think this is a terrible idea, and a detriment to the sub, but in my view that is already the case with the rule shutting out 3/4 of thought.

I don't even really understand how we got here. Frankly before the bot (as cool as it is) requests were mostly "discussion". There was almost always reasons for the recommendation even it was very brief. Then the bot came and it became largely lists, with occasional remarks. And from this I think spawned the idea of there being a separation between recs/links and discussion where there was none before. And that lead into discussion being seen as secondary or even superfluous and unnecessary. And it's only from this view it seems that the idea of discussion being unwelcome has formed. ie. Because the differing opinion is "unnecessary" then it's avoidable harm ("Bashing"). Basically just don't say mean things/ rain on OP's parade.

I think this is a mistake. Mainly because that isn't the purpose of the large majority of discussion, or for that matter disagreement. It isn't there to bring down. Quite frequently from what I see it's like someone has arrived at a point (ex. a pairing, Core lover/hater etc.), and the others aren't situated to make sense of the coordinates, and so they don't see how PersonA could end up there. And they might never, but then again they may, and in either case that doesn't make the discussion worthless, quite the opposite. Discussion and Request are, if no longer conjoined, still closely related to one another.

Unwelcome discussion also seems to stem from it being blamed for distracting, detracting, or denying OP of their requests(or opinion/desires) via disagreement, off-topic conversation, or other thoughts.

First, I don't think it's true that discussion deters/stops recommendations being made. In a minority of cases this may happen, but I think in general it is more likely that if not for the discussion(s) then little to nothing would be said at all. ie. there would be no additional recommendations. There might even be fewer as the post would die all the quicker.

Secondly, contributing to the idea of discussion being unwelcome is that of of negativity towards OP. Not being for doesn't mean against, and it is necessary to delineate the "bashing" that may take place. The rules say no personal attacks, and "not opinions of the suggested item" / "Do not bash the requests people make". What exactly does this mean? (There have been plenty of comments, such as Harry Selwyn, which don't seem to break those rules) In any case we have the OP, the OPs specific request, the OPs pairing, the fics OP mentions, recommends, or hates, the OPs ideas, reasoning, opinion, even their formatting or the readability of their thoughts, and so on. These are not one in the same. I recognize comments touching on any of that may be unwelcome, but it doesn't follows that they should be disallowed, or labelled "bashing".

And I think its this last that has created the sticking point and the rule. I don't think this sub is unwelcoming, or excluding, or hateful, or a disagreeable lot by in large, but inevitably we will disagree. I think it is a mistake to see such disagreement (ie opinions, thoughts, and discussion) as worsening the sub or creating an unwelcoming atmosphere. To my mind the discussion, and variety of opinion therein, is the primary reason I'm here.

I simply don't see an answer that pleases everyone. Either allow discussion or not. The latter is antithesis of this sub and site IMO. And it seems to me that in an effort to ensure some are heard in their requests it is dampening the voices of others (and no, new discussion thread crosslinking to comments etc. is not a workable or useful answer). Its really as simple as letting us talk, and encouraging that should be first and foremost in priority IMO.

*** Once more: If a topic is interesting, a discussion thread can be started. That^{s} what discussion threads are for. Request threads are for requests.

I find the claim that a topic is only interesting when one can spam a request thread with discussions, that one has to be able to discuss a request, rather questionable - a transparent attempt to be allowed to shit on posters and their requests.

Or maybe it's just an obscure discussion topic, in which very few people have the background knowledge to participate.

Example being, "Harry listening to retro synth wave music" request turning into a discussion about what kinds of music wizards would listen to, as a cultural offshoot of mainstream British society, diverged back when baroque was the fad of the day.

It doesn't necessarily have to be bashing.

This could apply to other obscure topics eg, primary and secondary student certifications in the 1990's, or the state of London's public transit in 1991, because Hagrid got on the Underground with Harry in book 1. Of course they sound like interesting subjects to read about in a thread, but only a tiny number of people with personal experience with the subject matter could contribute relevant discussion.

Rule 9 : "Instead, make a discussion post if you wish to discuss the style of fic requested."

An OP wants some fics rec and instead everyone is going blah blah blah which is not the point of a rec thread. You can make a discussion thread so this is not censorship, just proper classification / forcing you genuises to staying on topic since you're unable to de so unmonitored.

I was reading the thread about Fleur's treatment and couldn't believe my eyes. Everyone was doing everything except recommandations.

I don't know if you've ever actually tried doing this, but every time I've done it I've been ridiculed for bringing up a topic from another thread just to pontificate. Meanwhile, most times I've ever responded to a request thread directly there's at least some back and forth discussion.

You don't need to be so confrontational just because you disagree. I have absolutely followed through in the manner you've suggested and it hasn't worked.

There's nothing stopping somebody from leaving a recommendation while heavy discussion is occurring. I've seen it a million times. Some requests inspire a lot of discussion /because/ the subject matter is so rare.

I got into writing because I was annoyed by the lack of certain fics. And pretty much all fics came/come from this. Obviously, not everyone can write, hell, my English (foreign language) teacher trashed my creative writing pretty badly back at school. Even my early works were pretty bad before I went through four or five edits. But guess what, practice is the only way to get good.

**** But it's still a travesty of the original purpose of a thread which was supposed to be about getting recommandations. Imo it's disrespectful toward the OP to divert their thread like that, most often than not to tell them that their subject is bad or something like that.

So your attemp to create a discussion thread failed but it's only an isolated exemple and doesn't justify ruining someone's thread.

***** I get your point. You're right. I still disagree at the heart of the matter.

It's not like we're in a crowded room and everyone's shouting is drowning out the speaker discussing something unrelated (effectively de-platforming the intended speaker). This subreddit will never approach the reply limit for reddit threads, so side discussions within a request thread don't inhibit recommendations in a meaningful way.

The primary purpose of the rule is stated clearly.

#+begin_quote
  /Do not bash the requests people make/
#+end_quote

I absolutely support this statement and the spirit in which the rule was created, and I think most of the others who agree with OP support it as well.

It's very important that people feel they can express their requests without facing personal attacks or attacks on their requests.

It's much less important, I'd even say unnecessary, for people to be protected from tangential discussions within request threads forcing them to spend a couple extra minutes to filter out recommendations.

Just create a new thread, if there are people willing to discuss the heck out a rec post in the original thread I can't see what's preventing them from doing so in a second, dedicated discussion thread unless they just wanted to be adversarial toward the OP.

******* Does anybody even search for old discussion threads?

Nothing is preventing them from creating a new thread, but that's not the point. Something /is/ preventing them from commenting in the existing thread. Fluid discussion is spontaneous, and often requires context.

In my experience trying to create a new thread comes off as artificial, and hasn't worked. I know you said that my experience doesn't matter here, but I think it does. You're talking from a purely hypothetical standpoint. I've actually tried it.

I think this argument is probably going to be academic in the long run, because knowing the mods, they are unlikely to change the rule, which is fine. I'll continue as I have been. It's kind of annoying, but no more annoying then having someone fill your request thread up with discussion comments.

As has been noted elsewhere in this thread, in reality the effect of this is just to stamp out discussion. It's well known by product and website designers that adding extra steps to a process significantly reduces the number of people who follow that process.

If you place barriers in a person's way to something, obviously those barriers are going to end up stopping a lot of people.

The most obvious way to see the absurdity of this rule is to ask: what if people actually complied with it?

The subreddit would be filled with pointless discussion threads, each one consisting of one comment about a request thread and (maybe) some replies. Given the number of request threads, this would quickly become an overwhelming wave of spam and the rule would have to be changed.

So the continued existence of the rule depends on people not actually following it. It /relies/ on the fact that making separate threads for discussion deters people from having a discussion at all.
