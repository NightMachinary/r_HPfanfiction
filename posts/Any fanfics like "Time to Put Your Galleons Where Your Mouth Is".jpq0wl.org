** Linka03( C'est La Vie by cywscross) is a fic I remember having a similar vibe. Long abandoned, but what there is of it is great.

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

  The ritual brings the Order a light wizard who'd already sacrificed all he had to the cause. When asked again, Harry can't bring himself to make the same choice.

  "Make no mistake", hot breath against his ear, a whisper resembling a scream in the eerie silence of the mountains, "your pain, your blood, your life are mine. I will be the one to make you beg for death, just as I will be the one to end your pathetic existence. What pleasure will await me, as I watch your worthless lungs draw their final breath, your weak heart struggle to keep you alive, as you succumb to pain and nothingness. Your end is near, Harry."A not so typical Do-Over Fic.
