So couple years back I came across a lemon juice which basically concerned Hermione and Ron giving their kids a sexual education talk. The name was a word play on The birds and the bees with one word being Bicorns. Someone I know recently reminded me of it and I searched for it but couldn't find it. Could any one help? Also don't shitpost about degeneracy and whatnot. Thanks
