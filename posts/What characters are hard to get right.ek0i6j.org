This is inspired by my difficulty in writing Dumbledore, because fanon!Dumbledore has ruined him. He's been eternally reduced to a twinkly-eyed, lemon-drop-eating manipulative cardboard villain, and whatever dialogue I come up with feels as OOC as any indy!Harry Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Merlin harem power fantasy fic.

Hell, does Dumbledore even offer anyone lemon drops in the book apart from Chapter One, or are people confusing it with the famous “have a biscuit, Potter” scene? Is there actually a bowl of lemon drops in his office, or has fanon been lying to us this whole time, /just like Dumbledore/?

What other characters do you have difficulty writing, or notice authors having difficulty writing?

**** She does not work as a main character because canon Luna is borderline insane. She genuinely believes stuff like Fudge eating Goblins or the Ministry having some obscure creature army. Kryptozoology is one thing, but all the conspiracy theories as well as the way she sees certain things prevent her from being a good main character. It's quirky and fun in the background, but not if she's in every other scene.

You can fix those issues by making her realise that her father is a nut job, but that takes away her unique nature, the very thing which distinguishes her.

*** That's because she a bit character that people fell in love with and make way more important than she was. I'd estimate she's in 10 scenes. She makes an impression in those scenes, but it's only an impression. So when people write her they don't have enough to go on to make her true to character, but not so little that she's blank slate like Daphne or Blaise. So writers can't match readers impression of what she should be like in their heads. It leads to her being repetitive as they constantly rehash what little we know about her, or OOC as they move beyond what's written and try to flesh her out some.

*** I agree with this, but add Sirius at any age. He's all over the map in fanon.

I've seen people write Sirius alternatively as:

A womanizer who can't follow a conversation without getting distracted by a pair of tits. (Goes hand and hand with an exhibitionist streak that is surprisingly common in fics for reasons I cannot follow?)

Completely, hopelessly, madly in love with "Re" and unequivocally, fully, definitely, not straight.

An absolutely bat shit insane, damaged wreck post-Azkaban who can't make it a day without lashing out, sobbing or both.

An absolutely bat shit insane, damaged wreck PRE-Azkaban who can't make it a day without lashing out, sobbing or both.

The most cunning Lord who will manipulate this political system and get back at you all /shakes fist at heavens/

A brooder.

A non-stop laugh party and jokester.

Lazy af. Nevermind the whole swimming from Azkaban/walking to Surrey then Scotland/Dumbledore's characterization as "energetic." He's a sloth, okay.

And somehow ALL of the above, and the rampant contradictions, are at least somewhat common characterizations for him in fanon.

Fanon Sirius took over and to write a canon Sirius without that influence is hard as hell.

You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.”/
#+end_quote

The main objective of Dumbledore was to have Harry survive his childhood. His secondary objective was for Harry to a "normal child", and not some pampered Prince with the same mindset that say Draco Malfoy (or even worse considering how he would be treated by everyone, and not only his family).\\
Most people seem to forget that, if not for the Dursley, Harry had like 90% of chance to be killed by some Death Eater remnant. And even after the most loyals went to jail and he was "safe", he may have ended up as some Minister Poster child, groomed as a future Dark Lord, as arrogant as his bahed brother in most WBWL fics, or as paranoïd as Moody, none of these situations seem really good for him.

***** Given Dumbledore's philosophy of prioritizing the greater good and his belief that Harry's advantage over Voldemort would be the power of love, it is a bit surprising that he allowed Harry to grow up in a loveless home. Given what was at stake I would have expected him to either pay or Imperio or selectively memory charm the Dursleys into treating Harry better, but it is what it is.

Harry's closest living relatives after the Dursleys would be the Blacks, meaning Sirius (imprisoned), Andromeda (cast from the family), Bellatrix (/obviously/ not an option), or Narcissa. The logical alternative to the Dursleys -- in the eyes of the Wizarding authorities, at least -- would therefore be the Malfoys, and /that/ would have been a disaster of massive proportions so I can see Dumbledore rationalizing a little abuse as acceptable to avoid that.

***** No, that's not true, given Harry is able to survive at the Weasley's, Grimmauld Place, Tonks' house, Hogwarts, etc.

But even if it were right, Harry living there does not mean he should be allowed to be abused. He had Figg nearby to report to him, Harry had an inheritance, just offering a stipend to take care of Harry would have gone a long way once they realized how bad they were treating Harry. If that didn't work, Dumbledore is perfectly capable of threatening them to make them treat Harry like decent human beings. He just didn't care.

Real people who grow up treated the way the Dursleys treated Harry would not be expected to come out as well as Harry.

According to Dumbledore, )who could lie in one of his mustache twitsting moment but I'd rather consider him to be truthfull and trying his best for Harry), for the protection to work, 2 conditions are needed :

- Harry must consider the house of his blood relative as "home".
- He needs to live for some time (around a month) in said home every year in order to recharge the protections.

I know a lot of fanfics said that "Hogwarts is his home", but the point remain he is returning home every summer, a home where he is not happy but a home nonetheless. He can (and do) go to some other place around the middle of every summer, but Dumbledore did say that, as long as he spend one month at Privet Drive, he is protected even while away (that's why he did love burn Quirellmort in PS for example).

As for the "solutions" you mentioned, not only am I not convinced Dumbledore would be satisfied by them (an abandonned house, filed by Dark Magic where the protections are so strong that your only human contacts are either people in hiding like you or people member of a secret organization seem to be a great place to raise a child, but also appeared way later in the serie that during "Harry's childhood". Before the end of PoA, Grimault Place was supposed to be the house of Voldemort right hand man who would love to kill Harry if given the chance, and the Weasleys were a very banal family. Not to mention, welcoming the best friend of one of your son for a month, who you know is not happy with his family, is different than "raising a child celebrity even though you already have 7 children at home and is not rich". And why would the Weasleys take care of Harry before Harry's friendship with Ron, there would be a lot of family "more suited" (less children, more money) for the role should it be considered, a lot presenting risk of baby dark lord, poster child, or mortal "accident".

Finally, for the "abuses", I don't think it's usefull to talk about it (people have their set opinion, don't think I either saw someone change his mind about it), but the Dursley are not "that" bad. Sure, they are not great with Harry, and do not do any effort for him, but I'm pretty sure you could find hundreds, thousands or familly in the world like that today, and (with the exception of the closet which is very bad), I doubt social service would accept to be involved in that kind of case today, not to mention 30 years ago where the standard of happiness were they lower for raising a child.\\
People seem to think that any family not perfect should not be able to raise a child (which make me wonder if they had all perfect childhood or forgot most of it), but a lot of them seem to take everything out of proportion : "Petunia swung a pan to Harry's head, she could have killed him if it connected, she need to be arrested for attended manslaughter!!" (my mom tried to hit me with what she had in her hand when I was misbehaving as a child, she also sometimes threw things like a shoe when I was out of reach, could have killed me if it connected, should I call the police? Wait, it did connect sometimes, it was not full power swing but just a little annoyance tap, gave nothing more than a bump in worst case, nothing in most. Should have she it? Probably not? Does it count as attempted murder or bad enough to justify social service? Hell no.)

Well, actually that's fanon too. The only canon hint we have of Sirius's supposed lewdness is him having pictures of girls up in his room, which could be interpreted as him just trying to piss his parents off or as album covers etc. There's no womanising from him in the books or in his backstory and he's never even mentioned having a romantic interest at all.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Not just me, but others have hard time writing them too: Dumbledore, Snape, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Luna and interestingly enough Harry himself.

So many fanfics have twisted how the characters are actually written in the stories.

Hermione: I blame the movies in all honesty. Hermione is NOT perfect, she's not some goddess that's just amazing. I think people get Emma Watson and Hermione confused, intertwining them together.

Ron: Ron pretty much had the same grades as Harry, with just like one or two differences, but with some fanfics, you'd think he was a complete idiot, who drooled while he talked, wanted Harry's money, and was uncaring.

Ginny: She's not seem evil person who wants Harry for his money and fame, she once saw him as the famous Boy Who Lived, but after hanging out with him, realized he was so much more.

Draco: Draco was a coward who did things his father asked him, yet in a lot of stories you'd think that Ron was Satan and Draco was a Saint, even though it was Draco that called Hermione a Mudblood, not Ron.

Luna: Luna was a very strange girl, that had a child like wonder to her, change that around and make her a Seer? I'm sorry, what?!

Harry: He was pretty impassive really, he didn't try to learn more then what was needed, only started the DA because Umbridge was an awful teacher, and person. He only learned the bare necessitates, but you'd think he was the next Merlin himself, with some stories. People also tend to write him as angsty and/or having a saving people problem, often forgetting that he was also very sarcastic as well.

Side note: Sirius. Sirius cared about Harry. He was impulsive, reckless, cruel, but he was also kind, considerate, smart, he's so complex, and yet he's written as a womanizer, and who's stupid. He makes stupid mistakes, impulses, but doesn't make him as a person stupid, in classes or other stuff.

Dumbledore might be manipulative, but he's not as manipulative as in the fanfics.

Snape is either eventually written even worse then he was in canon (somehow, possible!), or written redeemed to the point where it's unbelievable. I can see Snape possibly changing his mind about things, but his overall attitude wouldn't change much, even if things changed from canon.

** Canon Dumbledore is honestly incoherent. Leaving Harry with the Dursleys with little enough supervision for his childhood to turn out the way it did was unconscionable. But he claims to care about Harry and is generally believed. Not investigating Sirius Black, a supposed order member, for 13 years was HORRIBLE. And obviously, for the plots of books 1-6...actually any of them to make any sense require him to be incredibly irresponsible/shortsighted/foolish as the person responsible for the safety of his students. But he CAN'T be that stupid because he's well respected, including by the people we trust in the story, and hasn't been fired or anything.

If you want your story to make sense you either have to come up with individual explanations for these things that don't contradict canon or you can use "Dumbledore is a manipulative villain" as a relatively simple model that explains everything.

Chop off the villain, and you have canon Dumbledore. Sorry, Sherbet Lemons, not lemon drops.

​

I'm sorry Canon Dumbledore comes off as a bipolar meglomaniac with trust issues that wants to save the world HIS way. If you objectively look at Dumbledore, he does indeed look that way. And some people try to be polite and say he made /mistakes/. Mistakes does not get half the population dead.

Dumbledore is Sisyphus. Except he already knows the position he's in. He dropped the stone that is Tom off the hill and then repeatedly tries to push it back up the hill in more and more brilliantly stupid ways. And then he tries to con three kids into pushing it for him. The moral of the story? Don't dump kids in abusive situations. Ask for goddamn help from trained professionals.

He also did the same thing with Voldemort. Left him in a less than friendly orphanage. During WW2. When did he check in on Harry? Also, note how he left Harry at the Dursely's. He dumped him on the doorstep with a note.

No, no he isn't. He's a headmaster. A Chief Mugwump. Chief Warlock. He's Harry's guardian. He did none of those jobs correctly. If at all. He did the bare minimum. Or delegated.

Horcuxes? Doesn't the ministry have a whole department dedicated to esoteric research? Isn't he the chief warlock? Yeah. Thought so.

Anywho, the whole point of that comment was that he held everything to his chest. Didn't let anyone help. Because only HE could get it done right.

What??? No he didn't. Dumbledore had nothing to do with Riddle being left in an orphanage. And as for after they met when /Riddle was 11/, Dumbledore was just a teacher.

Why are you acting like Dumbledore is some god who must intervene everywhere? There was no reason for him to intervene there. He's not responsible for all the orphan children of the world. At least with Harry he was being hunted by Death Eaters and Voldemort. Riddle was just some random kid.

There is literally /zero/ canon evidence that the Department of Mysteries could do anything regarding Horcruxes. And there is no evidence that Dumbledore didn't try.

/And again/, keeping Horcruxes secret was incredibly important. If he tells the wrong person, they lose the war.
