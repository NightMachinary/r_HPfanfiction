  Some distance across the grounds, a still-dripping Ginevra said, "We will be!"

  I shivered. This was beginning to remind me uncomfortably of the Bellatrix situation.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
