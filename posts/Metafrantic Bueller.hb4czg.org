Since Cipher and AFF.net are apparently dead, anybody know where I can read Metafrantic's Harry's Seventh Year? It's times like these that I need something completely wild and sensational because escapism. TIA!


** linkaff([[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544207001]]) Harry Potter and the Talking to, or part one of Harry's Seventh Year, still exists on Metafrantic's page there. The site is a bit broken, but all fourteen parts of the story are still posted.
