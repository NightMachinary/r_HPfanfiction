Randomly thought of this alternate scenario and was wondering if a fanfic has covered this.


** Would have to be very AU or else Harry would show up, then be captured by Death Eaters and executed.

** Linkffn(Hermione's Plan) is pretty good. Get's kinda weird with the whole "guess what, the Granger's are nudists" thing. But it's pretty entertaining. It was written pre-DH

** Linkffn(The one he feared) has a Harry who stays at Hogwarts I think although I haven't read it recently.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
