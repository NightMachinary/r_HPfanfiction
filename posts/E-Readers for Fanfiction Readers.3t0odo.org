Was wondering what some of you who use e-readers are using. Also what do you do about fanfictions that are still in progress and need updated, do you just have to reconvert and transfer the fanfiction for each new chapter?


** Kindle, in conjunction with Calibre. I have a calibre plugin that downloads stuff from FFN and AO3 etc, so i can just do that again when a fic updates. You can email stuff from calibre to a kindle easily, and if a fic is completed I can make it look pretty and keep it. I love my kindle, but my brother does the same using the kindle app on his phone.

**** When I worked at Amazon in the Kindle department, I fell in love so hard with the Paperwhites. They're matte, but they can /light up/. Coolest thing ever for night owl readers like myself.

*** You use Calibre too? I use it when I need to make something big (like the anthology of all of the Alexandra Quick books I made), but in general I use [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][this converter]] for all of my MOBI files.

** Kindle, the regular cheap one. And yeah, pretty much, although I mostly read complete or abandoned fics so that's not an issue.

I love E-Ink, it's so much easier on the eyes. If only there was a laptop with this type of screen. I'd only need it for office / text work, so grayscale and slowness is not an issue.

** I use codex reader, you can just update the fic and it will download any new chapters. Only works with A few sites but ffn and ao3 work so that's good enough for me.

I have made a few ePubs on my computer and emailed em over, they can do endless scroll/pageless view, I like that

** Usually I just use the MoonReader app on my phone. I have a Note II, so the screen's large enough to prop up on a table or on the treadmill.

When I'm on a plane, I upload several fics/books to my Kindle Paperwhite before the trip. I had an issue though where I tried to open a really large fic on my Paperwhite and it would cause the thing to crash, but opening the same file on my phone wasn't an issue.

If the story is in-progress, if I like it enough I usually add it to my follow list. When a new chapter comes in, I don't bother converting it since it's only one chapter.

*** The large fic that caused your paperwhite to crash--was that a single chapter fic or multi? If it was multi, where the chapters long in length? I'm just curious, because I pre-format all my fics before converting to epub and I find that after about 35,000 words/40 A4 pages it automatically splits the html parts that make up the epub, which can cause problems when I put it on my tablet to read. I just wondered if a similar issue might have caused your crash.

**** 23 chapters, 170k words, downloaded through ao3, no changes. I found it weird because i have several much longer ebooks on it with no problems.

I can't remember though if I added it through calibre, or if I just added it to the folder directly.
