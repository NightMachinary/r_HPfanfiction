It seems unrealistic that Lily is the only witch in history to have willingly sacrificed herself to save her child from an AK. So I'm looking for fics where she has done more - some obscure spell or ritual. Would like a longer fic, and complete if possible.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][She did a ritual in this one]] and appears later in the fic. Though be warned it's a Harry/ Multi pairing and some people don't enjoy it.

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** I don't remember which fic in this series it comes up, but Lily does a ritual in this series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464][The Definition of Normal]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/BrilliantLady/pseuds/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady]])

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell][LullabyKnell]]) Lily did...something. Still being updated, but Lily has a lot of knowledge on the killing curse and it's heavily implied but not yet revealed last I check what she did.

One of my favorite fics. By this point though it's pretty far from cannon, and it's also a fem!creature!Harry, but I love it nonetheless.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
