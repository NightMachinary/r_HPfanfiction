I am looking for fics that have a comedic side similar to "A Black Comedy" by nonjon. I would much prefer more mature+ oriented fics full of debauchery, action, adventure, violence, smut, whatever... Point is, more mature and not "teen" or little kid comedy.

*** Well thats helpful lol. Although tbh I am a bit disappointed in the suggestions on that thread, because apart from a couple of them, most are not really like "A Black Comedy" at all, or not that great (ive read a couple of those).

Thanks though, it did provide a few. I hope there are some additional suggestions in this thread though.

**** The only one that I'd really recommend is linkffn(6849022) it definitely matches a few requirements on your list (debauchery, action, adventure, etc)

***** I've tried to get through this one twice now, and just couldn't, from a technical writing aspect it is definitely not on a level with ABC.

  Harry meets Bella and Sirius during the Azkaban Prologue... He comes out a little brassed off, and a whole lot apathetic... Then there was the Goblet and the Tournament... By fifth year he's a whole different animal... Heh well, the world wants its Hero...

** *Lord of Caer Azkaban*, linkffn(2107570): just read it, and I think it's hilarious, despite all the tropes.

*** The shitty cliches aren't so bad because of it's age. The issue with the story is the shite grammar. If it wasn't so replete with that, it'd be the one of the best trashy stories.

**** A bit late to reply, but that's a recurrent thing with Rorshach's Blot: good to great ideas, good to great execution, grammar that just begs to be put out of its misery.

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.
