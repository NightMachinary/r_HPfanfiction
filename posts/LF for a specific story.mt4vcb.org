:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In it Ron is really sick. He has a terminal illness caused by dark magic. The main part of the story is about Harry and Ginny. It's years after the war and Harry has left for some time. He and Ginny are reunited.

In this story Bill, his son, Ron, and Ginny all live together in a flat. Bill lives there because Fleur has died.

It is possible this story was removed for some reason. It was on fanfiction.net

Hope someone can help me find it.
