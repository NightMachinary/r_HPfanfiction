** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time To Spare]]

Summary: Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

Harry and Draco both get sent back in time and work together to stop Voldemort. Not exactly what you're looking for, but I remember it being a fairly good read. NOT slash.

Just a couple that I found that might be interesting, I think long ago I read What If but my memory is hazy at best.

Both are HPDM slash so be warned.

Summary: AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]

I haven't gotten very far into it yet, but the start looks good.

** The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48618][Rewritten in Time]] series is pretty decent. I've only read the first one but it's promising so far. The first part sticks a little bit closely to the first book (although the author did say they realized it was a problem and takes steps to change that in the later chapters), and there's an OC that I don't quite like, but she's generally taken out of the picture after the first few chapters. I'd definitely recommend it, at least "Regrets Collect Like Old Friends".
