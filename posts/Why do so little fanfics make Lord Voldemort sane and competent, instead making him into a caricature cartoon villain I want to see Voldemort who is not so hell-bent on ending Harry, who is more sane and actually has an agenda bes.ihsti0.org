#+TITLE: Why do so little fanfics make Lord Voldemort sane and competent, instead making him into a caricature cartoon villain? I want to see Voldemort who is not so hell-bent on ending Harry, who is more sane and actually has an agenda besides torturing muggles and muggleborns. What can you recommend?

** I believe I have the answer to your first question. It's because it's difficult to write about a genius without being one too, and give that character justice. There is also the minor matter of either 'Voldemort wins instantly' or 'Shounen Powerup Cold War'.

Even in canon, with all the disadvantages, Voldemort managed to be a worthy foe for the plucky boy hero.

If given access to both the experience of his older self and the cautiousness, charisma and intelligence of his youth, it would be hard to give him meaningful opposition without turning the entire thing into a high powered slugfest.

I mean, it's doable, but requires more work than most people are willing to put into a fanfic.

** Because that'd be terrifying. Lol He's insanely over powered. In the world of Harry Potter there is no limiter to power except your own ambition and scruples, and it was proven that he had far too much, and none respectfully.

** Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]] Prince of the dark kingdom does an amazing job with his character. Its an AU where Voldemort won the first war and Harry is not known as a boy who lived. Voldemort is still somewhat of a villain, but he is also sane and a great leader. I love how the fic explores Voldemort as a master manipulator with a vision without making him over the top evil. Harrys character is also great in that he still keeps his canon personality and morals without ever turning dark or evil like many fics that make Harry Voldemorts apprentice.

This fic is both ridiculously long and incomplete though.

**** You are probably right in that they just burnt out, the amount of words that fic has is completely ridiculous. Considering even people who get paid to write sometimes stop wanting to continue (GRRM as one notable example), its not very surprising for a volunteer fanfiction writer to quit.

Sometimes I do wonder what happened to them though. The author has so much talent and skill at capturing characters, writing dialogue and creating original scenes. They are someone I could imagine successfully making writing their career.

** Making him a cartoon villain is easy, for various reasons. If you really want a somewhat competent Tom Riddle, try stories set in the marauder's era.

** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches has both of fem!Harry's opponents, Voldemort and Dumbledore, as scarily intelligent and absolutely overpowered. Every single one of Voldemort's plots is well-thought out and successful, including one bit that I've often thought of, but never seen elsewhere - The Potters went under the fidelius again when Voldemort returned. Voldemort just found out the general area and burned it all with fiendfyre

Dumbledore is also portrayed as a powerful leader and a master manipulator. When his petty plots fail, he starts pulling better and better plots - even when his whole reputation is in tatters, he manages to salvage the situation and keeps working towards his image of the greater good. The only character I'd say gets actually bashed in the series is James Potter - and even he is shown as an extremely competent adult who just can't admit he made a mistake.

Mind you, the series is /fucked up/. The author himself felt sick after writing some parts of it, and a lot of it is of the sort where you read it, keep reading and the implications only hit you a couple minutes later. Although I'd say it's less fucked then the majority of dark!Harry fics.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well-Groomed Mind]] by Lady Khali. Harry needs help, and asks the fake Moody. This leads to becoming the ward of Voldemort's civilian persona. A good story, but unfinished, with no updates in almost three years.

** 1. It's difficult to write a genius if you yourself aren't a little genius.

2. Having an insane super powered dark lord evens the odds a bit for Harry because he can use said insanity against him.

3. It makes sense to have an insane Voldemort. He delved into the dark arts further than anyone and if we can look at all those proficient at the dark arts in Harry Potter, well, they aren't exactly emotionally and intellectually stable either.

Voldemort created 7 horcruxes. I don't think that splitting your own soul even once will have no negative consequences. Also, don't forget he spent 10 years as less than a ghost then another in the back of someone's head and the next two as a creepy baby homonculus.

The only sane (intellectually fully stable) Voldemort I envision is one that didn't yet split his soul.
