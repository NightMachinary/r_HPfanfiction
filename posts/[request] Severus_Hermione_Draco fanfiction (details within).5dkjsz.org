Last night I just got done reading the most amazing fanfic I have EVER read, called Teaching Miss Granger (in the Ashwinder Sycophant Hex archive). In it were a few instances in which the Severus/Hermione sex scenes were expanded to include Draco... and boy, was that REALLY HOT.

So now I've got an itch, and it's Severus/Hermione/Draco fanfiction.

EDIT: This is the most important part, I really do NOT want to read any incomplete fics. An exception could be made for a fic with a juicy plot that has a lot of chapters up already and that the author is actively working on writing.

No abandoned fics, please, that is the worst thing in the world.

A few particulars: I don't want PWP, heavy angst, terribly sad endings, or anything with a ton of detailed blood-and-gore.

EDIT 2: I do not want fics where any of the main characters die.

I DO want romance, a good plot, and sex. The kinkier the better!

(Good grief I wish I would have written everything the first time around) EDIT 3: I am not a fan of one-shots. I prefer fics with 20+ chapters. But if it's REALLY good I might read a fic with less chapters.

This might be worth checking into...I'm a big fan.

Hasn't been updated since October but she's usually very good about updating each of her fics.

Pretty filthy though, FYI.
