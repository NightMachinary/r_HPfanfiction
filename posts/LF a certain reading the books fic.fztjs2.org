:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know they've got a bad rap but I remember this one fic that involve lily and James coming back to life some time after the war. Harry's got some senior position in the magical government, most likely the aurors. He shows them what all went down after they died via pensieve. There's a very minor subplot where all the light side's casualties come back to life. Dudley and Petunia are there too for some reason. They're all canon couples by the way. This has been driving me nuts. Will someone please help?
