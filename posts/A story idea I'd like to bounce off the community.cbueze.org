** Would all the Harrys have a scar? If so, perhaps you can give each Harry a different Voldemort trait. For example, one Harry is a parselmouth, one is a charismatic manipulator, one can control animals (like how Riddle made a rabbit hang itself), one is a legilimens, one can fly without brooms, etc.

  I'm not sure about the sixth or seventh if there even is seven just yet, maybe Hagrid or dumbledore lost one?
#+end_quote

The Longbottoms would be a likely candidate. Both parents were aurors and members of the Order. Them being tortured into insanity could be avoided if they too go into hiding after getting a Harry.

To contrast with the Dursleys, a loving muggle family could find a Harry in the rubble (the charms on the Potters' home broke after their deaths) before Hagrid arrives.

**** Make sure some of these Voldemort traits be negative. Maybe they each still look at each other as “the same person” at the base and help each other in that vein. Maybe make each good at certain subjects and they help the others and can't figure out why the other isn't that good at the subject.

*** Since Parseltongue is canon as being from Voldemort this would work really well. A little modification to make the magical abilities include non inherent ones like parseltongue gives you natural legilimancy, animal control, parseltongue, flight, transfiguration talents, dark magic talents (as a possibility) and charming aura for all seven. Keeping the "gifts" as abilities rather than an effect on personality like manipulation

** I think this would be especially funny if Dumbledore wasn't the one who found them. I'm not sure how it would work, but maybe through accidental magic, the baby potters scatter themselves throughout the house. Maybe some of them hide under invisibility cloak. Every time someone comes into the house, they find a baby potter.

So there's the one Dumbledore finds, which goes to the Dursleys. Maybe butterfly affect means that Sirius comes a little later, and something convinces him to take the baby and hide (maybe the scar for this one is a bad omen in the Wizarding World, or the baby is injured somehow). Maybe the ministry has one. One gets found by the muggle Child services. Maybe McGonagall goes back after Privet Drive and finds another one, and thinks accidental magic brought the baby back somehow. Maybe the potter's house elf finds one and takes him to the Longbottoms. I could go on, but you get the gist.

Everyone disguises their Harry, either on purpose or accidentally until things come out. Bonus points if two of them interact before Hogwarts by accident.

Six goes to the Longbottoms, Bellatrix and company use him as a hostage to escape capture, he grows up on the run being bombarded by pureblood propaganda (as they believe him to be Neville, who had been much quieter and went unnoticed).

Seven is adopted by Crouch as a PR move, fast-tracking the paperwork without Dumbledore's knowledge. When Crouch, Jr. gets found out, he doubles down on raising Harry with zero pity for Dark wizards, though Madam Bones tries to be an ameliorating presence in his life when possible.

Maybe he toddles out of the closet Frank and Alice hid he and Neville in, trying to save Mommy and Daddy, and a Death Eater reflexively curses him, leaving a smudge or birthmark-style burn right over the scar? Or maybe the Longbottoms hid the scar on purpose with magic, so nobody would know that Neville's 'twin' was a Potter.

** You could also consider the ramifications of having your soul split into seven different pieces too; IE Voldemort. Perhaps you could make each one of them "passably good" at one aspect of magic and yet horrendous at all of the others.

** First of all. Absolutely genius idea I think. Going off of the other comments, I would say that Crouch Harry would probably be the best for six, giving some interesting ripple effects on canon.

The Longbottoms would be interesting for the ripple effect of keeping them from insanity possibly, but doesnt make for a significantly different version of Harry from Andromeda Harry. I think either would work great though. (Side thought, I've read a number of fics where Harry's regrowing his hair was a sign of latent metamorphmagus abilities. You could have those abilities be something that needs encouragement at a young age to develop properly and only Andromedas Harry gets them)

I think the best bet for another unique perspective on Harry would be to have him grow up in the home of one of his muggleborn classmates. This would give another perspective on muggle raised Harry and give him a connection to another classmate that would be interesting to read. Easily justified as wanting to hide Harry somewhere completely out of the magical world for now and with no connections like the Dursleys, while still giving him some connection come Hogwarts time.

Or you could have the Lestranges approach Malfoy just before Hogwarts, having kept their Harry a secret till then and have him take in their Harry since he was officially pardoned. Have him do some political maneuvering to prevent the good guys from taking him back.

**** It depends on what genre you want to stick to, but having Dumbledore conduct a ritual or something to put them back together at age 11 (when magic matures, settles, whatever) would be great for a competent Harry without Dumbledore bashing. On the other hand, seven Harry's could be very comedic for Voldie. Also, there was a fic where the killing curse divides Harry into 14 and they all have to live with the Dursleys who struggle financially to feed them all and Dudley is super scared because they gang up on him if he tries to bully them.
