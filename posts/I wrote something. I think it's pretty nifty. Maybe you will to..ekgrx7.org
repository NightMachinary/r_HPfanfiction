** I mean, you could do with a beta to pick up on the grammar and spelling mistakes, but otherwise that was nifty indeed. I'd enjoy a continuation, should you do one.

**** Ffnet has a function for finding betas in your fandom. It's the last option on the top bar (Browse, Just In, etc), but it's done by fandom type and not specific fandom, so you might have to poke around to find a Harry Potter or Lovecraft-interested one. I expect the former would be easier than the latter.
