Please do not kill me, I am not looking for bestiality. I just think centaurs are very interesting and I am a sucker for weirdly super intelligent beings finding love.

In other fantasy books, I always prefer the intercultural romances, between for example elves and dwarfes, something like this in the HP universe would be very interesting to me.

I am also open to other intercultural pairings, wizards/giants? elves/wizards? vampires/werewolves? Just post whatever comes into your mind unless it is crack or pwithoutp.

** I swear I read one a long while back that involved Harry and a centaur girl from the Forbidden Forest. IIRC, she had some stereotypical mystic name like Calypso or something. Probably one of those “six or seven chapters and then put on hiatus” stories.

**** Ha, I guess I remembered that one better than I thought! Got the name right, at least.

Not that bad for an Indy!Harry story. Shame it wasn't finished, even if it wasn't too original.

*** Sodomy? In German "Sodomie" is nowadays almost exclusively used to describe sex with animals. I just used the translation, my apologies if I got it wrong, English is not my mother tongue.
