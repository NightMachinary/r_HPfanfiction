A lot of the threads being posted here these days are "Looking for" threads, so I thought I might do something of a public service and try to increase their quality.

So here are some tips:

- *Do a search*. We've had twelve femHarry search threads, ten of them in the last year. TWELVE.

- Put the details of your request in the title of the thread. Don't just post a vague title like "Looking for some fics". People are more likely to help you if you help them.

- Be specific. "Looking for good stories", "Looking for novel-length stories"... this is basically a request for all fanfiction. Not only is the FF.Net browse feature the more appropriate vehicle for such a general search, we've already had dozens of threads where people post their favourites in general.

** I have a suggestion for people who try to help: Please include at least a reason for your fic recommendation. A list of links is hardly any better than whatever I can find with fanfiction.net atrocious search system.

** I want to point out that duplicate requests aren't verboten, but do please at least look to make sure the same thread wasn't posted /last week/.

It would also be helpful for me if the title of your post is very clearly a request. Often when I'm flairing posts I can't tell without looking at the body of the post whether it's a request or a discussion.

** Are there any decent sites to make lists like goodreads book lists, where anyone can add/vote on books on public lists and the books are ranked by number of votes? That way, we could make a list of whatever subgenres--pairings, eras, modern AUs of Voldemort in clown school--whatever people like, and have consolidated lists of recs by most popular that don't require constant maintenance.

*** The fanfic linking bot should do this. Like, have a site where we can search for fics by keywords in the original thread. So searching for "fem harry" would bring up all the fics the bot linked to in any thread containing the keywords "fem harry".

It could also have a "if you enjoyed that, you might also like..." and bring up a list of other fics that are often linked too in the same threads as the fic in question.

It could also have lists of most-linked fics, most-upvoted links, and so on.

Lastly, it could give you a list of all the links it made on behalf of a particular poster, if you enjoy someone's tastes and want to see what other recs they've given.

**** We will consider this. However, as it stands now, it is unlikely to be added.

If you really want your proposal to be added, please, add an [[http://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/issues/][issue]] or better, make a [[http://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/pulls/][pull request]], so we will have a more permanent reminder on this issue.

***** I was just brainstorming really. To make that happen, you'd have to have a website, and web server, and so on, and it'd get really complicated. It's probably not worth making an issue, unless a website was something you already had plans to build.

****** Fun fact, we actually do have a server. And I do have knowledge to make a webservice happen. Problem is, thats not the direction we intend the bot to go. For [[/u/tusing]], it's about allowing mobile users to access story data and linking stories more easily. For me it's just the convenience of not having to go to each site.

******* Do you store the kind of data I was talking about at all? IE, how many times each fic gets linked, what threads it gets linked in, and so on? If so, perhaps you could maybe just provide an API to get that info, or do a data-dump of it every so often, and let someone else do the bits you're not interested in? I know from experience there's nothing worse than writing code you don't care about, so it'd be nice if we could get those features while you avoid doing that as much as possible.

******* I'm fine with this. Half the reason I made this was mobile, as I stated earlier; the other half was convenience.

We could also sort and rank fics by 'likes' and source our keywords from the OP, with the title having higher-value keywords. The ranking system shouldn't be terribly difficult, actually. Would just require a bit of thinking. At a glance we could probably use a PQ linked to each word with Story objects in the PQ but that sounds terribly inefficient.

In the future, we can look into Scryer as an alternative, and perhaps as a source of also grabbing DLP ratings for each fic.

******** Important is that we get some sort of statistics. To do that we have to change our way of storing data. See [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/issues/79][#79]] for ideas on that topic.
