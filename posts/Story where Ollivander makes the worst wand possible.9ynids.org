I recall reading a fic in which Harry is too powerful for a normal wand, so Ollivander needs to make a custom wand from the worst materials to channel magic through. (IIRC, the author thought staffs would only make a wizard more powerful). Harry ends up getting a wand made of iron and wants it sharpened to a point (despite Ollivanders protests that that would make it a better wand). In transfiguration? class, he takes his wand out and McGonagall mistakes it for a knife.

Thought it was an interesting idea and wanted to reread, but I'm having trouble finding it. Thanks for any help you can provide.

This is the scene

#+begin_quote
  "Mr. Potter!" she exclaimed in what had to be her sternest voice. "What did you do?" She then paused, and just before he could answer that he just attempted the spell she had demonstrated, she proved his earlier assumption about the maximum severity someone's tone could reach incorrect as she asked, "And why do you have a dagger?"
#+end_quote

This caused Harry, along with the rest of the class, to look down at his wand. It was only then that it really dawned on him that none of the teachers had seen his wand before. He normally kept it within one of the concealed storage seals tattooed onto his right palm, which allowed him to release or re-seal it with barely more than a thought, just like the rest of his weaponry.

And because he was so used to carrying around all kinds of various sharp metallic objects, one more hadn't really seemed unusual to him. He had known that most wands were wooden from his experience with Ollivander, but he hadn't really considered that the professors might object to him doing magic with a piece of metal sharpened to a needle sharp point. Wands were weapons already, so what was the difference?

"Ah...I think the technical term is 'stiletto'." He held up his wand to allow a more careful examination. "See? No actual blade, just the point, so it isn't really a dagger." He gave a shrug while very carefully concealing his own amusement at Professor McGonagall's expression of shocked outrage.

**** Fics that have cracky premises played straight can be great, lol.

IIRC, that fic was pretty decent. Old and obviously OP Naruto inserted as Harry. It's worth checking out, if that sort of thing appeals to you. It's short and dead though.

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

***** It is, by the looks of it, abandoned. It's also a fic where the main character is extremely overpowered. But the writing and characterization is good, and a manipulative Dumbledore is done well. So if you don't mind the first part and like the second, I would say yes, it's worth a read.

** Garrick cackled and rubbed his hands together, he loved it when fools with too much money and too little sense demanded special custom wands. Suddenly wood that on any other wand would be a cosmetic defect is now a one of it's kind creation. Cores that are out of fashion and forgotten overstock find use again, and the truly pretentious want crystals and beads strung along the dowels. Every rich fop who struts through his door is the secret to his family fortunes and the real reason why his shop has survived through the centuries.

** I'm not sure but I think it was (or at least a similar fic) a crossover with Naruto where Naruto had his soul possess Harry Potter as a baby to prevent the bijuus from escaping or something.
