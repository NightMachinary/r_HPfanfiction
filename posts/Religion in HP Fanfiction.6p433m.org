It bemuses me. I am not religious myself, so when an author hipchecks their own faith into a story it makes me do a pretty big double-take.

The divide between the words written against witchcraft in the Bible and the lifestyle of witches and wizards is usually never addressed. If it were, the addition might feel organic. As it is... most of it comes across as being preached to and manipulated by someone who isn't very good at preaching or manipulating.

Do any of you have any experience reading fics of this nature? Did you enjoy the way they went about it if so?

** Personally, I hate religion in fics. I especially hate the whole "pagan" religion, because 99% of the time it comes off as somehow inherently superior to Christianity (or whatever mainstream religion) and thus super pretentious. Sometimes whatever pagan religion has some sort of ritual or holiday that allows some outrageous behavior (usually as an excuse to get two characters to sleep together in some fertility rite or some such).

But that's not to say religion can't be in a fic or done well or anything! Just that it usually isn't.

Which actually existed in most of those belief systems. They're often used in those fics to shoehorn in some OOC behavior, because of special occasions and all that, but the fact remains.

It isn't that long ago that Yule was celebrated (at least in Middle Europe) and people burnt a yule-log and got as drunk as their reserves or money allowed - all sorts of other vices included. I should know, some of those traditions (the Wild Hunt, for example), are still alive and kicking in my region of the Alps.

*** To be fair, Christianity stole 80% of it's religion from the Pagans and just relabeled it. Pagans existed thousands of years before the first writer even thought of Jesus so I see it as slight payback.

I've never enjoyed lemons in fanfiction unless I am specifically looking for smut of some kind. They add very little to the plot in most fics. I've read a few exceptions in romances but meh.

***** No, or at least in any notable form. Jesus seems to be an incredibly important member of history yet no evidence, outside of the Bible or those influenced by it, for the existence of such a person existed. It may be that someone named Jesus existed but there are plenty of people with my own name so that proves nothing.

One man, a Christian oddly enough although I do not remember his name, it may have been Timothy Freke but I am not sure, supposedly traveled the world and came back claiming that he had found proof that Jesus existed. The proof was never shown nor did said man's story line up with known history.

Another story about his tomb being found became popular quite a few years ago but Bible experts debunked the claims as the names on the tombs did not match Jesus' family and the tomb marked Jesus had the remains of a body - which according to Christianity is impossible as Jesus physically resurrected and floated off into heaven... which is in the clouds.

Even if Jesus was proven to existed it is only the first step. They must then prove that Jesus preformed miracles and that he was the son of god. Then work to identify that god to see what religion it most lines up with would need to take place. It couldn't even be the Christian god, Yahweh, as the Bible explains as that's god actions constantly negate themselves similar to me saying I have a four sided triangle.

And people are actively, RIGHT NOW, searching for evidence to show that Jesus has existed. They have been for over two thousand years yet the results have amounted to nothing.

EDIT: I found an article speaking of the "Jesus tomb" which provides many more points than I did. [[https://www.livescience.com/50434-jesus-family-tomb-geology.html]]

****** Almost no reputable contemporary historian believes Jesus did not exist---the stuff you're reading is the atheist equivalent of those embarrassing Christian tracts that suggest Darwin converted to young-earth creationism on his deathbed. There's a very [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus][well-sourced Wikipedia article]] about it---in short, while the Christ Myth theory was a viewpoint that received some academic support 50-100 years ago, it is now very uncommon among scholars regardless of their religious beliefs. (The tomb stuff is mostly the hobby of near-east archeologists who would like to make themselves a lot of money; textual evidence is much more important, and disputed by much more mainstream figures.)

Obviously this makes no difference as to whether you believe he was god or not---I believe Joseph Smith and Muhammad existed, but not that they were prophets. And it could be that the Christ Myth people are right. However, that would mean that basically all historical methods accepted to determine the history of all ancient events and people need to be reevaluated, because they all point to a historical Jesus.

(This is extremely off-topic and probably not a discussion worth continuing here---that is, whether Jesus likely exists or not has been demonstrated to have no impact on whether some people were Christian in the UK in the early 90s, and absolutely has no impact on whether /wizards/ were Christian in the UK in the early 90s---but I'm happy to have it elsewhere if you'd like.)

Not believing in a religion (or whatever level of dislike one can have regarding one) is not the same thing as rejecting historical work regarding the existence of the preachers that were at his inception (I would say said rejection is very much an article of faith, a pillar of a creed, more than the result of a logical criticism)

************ *Josephus on Jesus*

The extant manuscripts of the writings of the 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus include references to Jesus and the origins of Christianity. Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, written around 93--94 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus Christ in Books 18 and 20 and a reference to John the Baptist in Book 18.

Scholarly opinion varies on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the Antiquities, a passage that states that Jesus the Messiah was a wise teacher who was crucified by Pilate, usually called the Testimonium Flavianum. The general scholarly view is that while the Testimonium Flavianum is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian expansion/alteration.

--------------

*Historicity of Jesus*

The historicity of Jesus concerns the degree to which sources show Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure. It concerns the issue of "what really happened", based upon the context of the time and place, and also the issue of how modern observers can come to know "what really happened". A second issue is closely tied to historical research practices and methodologies for analyzing the reliability of primary sources and other historical evidence. It also considers the question of whether he was a Nazirite.

************* You realize that my first answer to you, i quote myself "The existence of a jewish preacher named Jesus in first century Palestina", means exactly that? That there was a preacher named Jesus (not an uncommon name), with followers (some of them wrote about him), and a few events we know about (and an exceptional knowledge at that given the time, place and circumstances of his birth).

Whatever you believe further than the few historical facts we are able to deduce with a very high probability (his dying crucified, a cruel and, especially, degrading, method of execution; his baptism by John, which came to be a theological problem for christianity; his birth, ditto, for not really following the jewish prophecies that a messiah should have; his opposition to parts of the jewish priesthood), not my problem; but denying that these facts are issued from serious historical research just because ... well, I don't know, because you don't like christianism? Funnily enough, while some protestant sects are quite fond of it (denying knowledge), the catholic church had a history in debating not science and history and knowledge, but their impact upon faith.

***** I believe there are two main reasons for historians to be relatively certain of the existence of a jewish preacher named Jesus having lived :\\
* the word of Josephus (which is not totaly his, his work was edited in parts): he speaks, twice, about Jesus, and once about John the Baptist; as a jewish in Roma in the first century, his sources were probably rich jewish living in Roma at the time\\
* the hoops in which the different accounts of Jesus life in the Bible has to go to make his life coincide with the jewish prophecies concerning the Messiah; such work was necessary because they tried to make his life coincide with the prophecies by bending both, where a fictional person would have, by design, followed the prophecies

What were his teaching, without the filter of the apostles? What theological truth does his life implicates? That are questions that only faith can answer. But we have more proof of his existence that of anyone bar the highest nobility for 1st century Palestina.

** There is a (very slowly updating) fanfic with A (see below) Jewish character struggling with that.

Below:

If one actually reads the original Hebrew of the Bible, and cross-references with the surrounding cultures of the time, all of the terms there used that are translated into English (and other languages) as 'witchcraft' and stuff like that are actually very specific practices, all of them involving either necromancy or human sacrifice, for fertility rituals (for crops) and divining information (about the future, present, or various pagan deities).

So, of all the canon HP magics, the only ones that would be problematic (from those prohibitions) would be... maybe the bone/flesh/blood ritual.

Murder is forbidden anyway (except under the obvious exceptions), so AK and stuff is basically the same as using any deadly weapon...

If one is a practicing Jew, basically all canon potions are possibly forbidden for consumption, as they contain forbidden (i.e. non-kosher) ingredients.

However, there are two grounds for allowing them, anyway:

1) For purposes of healing, for life-saving or significant quality-of-life cases, every other prohibition is ignored. 2) The taste and texture and substance end-result potion seems to have no real connection to the ingredients - the ingredients all completely lose their form and taste (because magic). This is already grounds to allow them for general use, unless there is a just-as-convenient alternative (see for example the permitting of pig-hoof-derived gelatin in ice cream until the last few decades, when superior/just as good artificial substitutes were adopted anyway). Even if the latter is true, in a case of even minor need (i.e. headache) when the alternative is not available... still ok.

TL;DR - only problem according to actual original text is if you're summoning up the dead to force them to tell you things, or human sacrifice.

So don't use the Ressurection Stone or murder people, and you're good!

** I don't see it very often, but I like it if it's done well. I'm a Catholic, and personally, proof of the existence of supernatural forces and an afterlife would make me /more/ religious, not less religious. Some wizards are muggleborn, many muggles are religious---well, it just doesn't strike me as odd. It would be weird if there /weren't/ religious people at Hogwarts.

Having rolled my eyes out of my head about a chapter into Methods of Rationality, I understand how a completely different worldview being imported into a story in place of the one you opened the fanfic to read about can wreck a fanfic. If I weren't religious I'd probably skip stories where it played a big role, though in my experience there are so few that it would hardly come up. (I don't read crossovers, either.)

But wizarding culture as depicted in the books owes at least as much to Christian and post-Christian Britain as it does pagan Europe---western culture marinated in and developed from Christianity for ~1500 years, conservatively, and JK Rowling is not a pagan European from an uncontacted tribe of druids, so it's hard to avoid. There's a Yule Ball, but the characters all celebrate Christmas. Western conceptions of sacrificial love (and love in general) owe a lot, though certainly not everything, to early Christian doctrine. The real Nicolas Flamel was a very pious Catholic. You don't have to pull the string on any of that back to Christianity to write a good fanfic, just like JKR didn't need to do it to write a good book, but I certainly don't come away from the series thinking "Man, what a pagan worldview---it would be very out of place if one person in a fanfic were a Christian."

I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to read a fic that takes this stuff seriously and handles it well, but your suggestion---dealing with the presence of witches &c in the Bible, especially the Old Testament---would certainly be part of my ideal one. Maybe there are lots of Catholic wizards torn between the importance of maintaining secrecy and setting the record straight about the compatibility of witchcraft and the faith; every time their parish priest condemns a Ouija board or insists tarot is a direct line to demons they feel almost personally attacked, but for them there's no getting around the truth of both magic and the church. (This is basically the Hermione science vs. magic trope, isn't it?) (There's a strange Anglican writer from the 40s named Charles Williams who wrote several very creepy, metaphysical novels; I'd probably crib from him, too. Characters in his books find themselves trailed by their doppelgänger, or walking the streets of London as a ghost, or in the palace of a man who has discovered the secret of immortality in Africa and plans to use it to invade Europe.)

I'm not really looking for it to dominate a fanfic like Yudkowskyism dominates MoR, though; that would be a little too much for me. In general I read fanfic because I like the canon tone and universe; I'm not into big AUs or stories that end up being fanfic-in-name-only. But if a writer is a serious Christian (or Muslim or rationalist, for that matter) it's natural that their idea of what is true and good will be influenced by what they believe to be the fundamental fact of the universe. And if they want to make one of the characters religious so as to better dramatize that, or just because it's their fanfic---well, it's no more of a stretch than Harry being Dark, or a gamer, or the insatiable man at the center of a massive harem, or a hard-boiled Raymond Chandler detective, or an anime character, or any of the thousand other hobbyhorses people ride into their own stories.

But the Inquisition did not handle witchcraft nor was it ever charged to, though it did kill some people who were found guilty of killing babies. Early Church documents reveal that far from trying to kill witches, the Church hierarchy decided that they should NOT be killed because it was just superstition.

******* A pity you are being downvoted for delivering the truth.

But when debating the validity of a person's world view, logical thought is not a behavior on can expect. I think the idea of nature vs. nature is really important here. A person's beliefs are not inherently there from birth, but rather nurtured by those the people the person looks up too and is influenced by when they lack the ability to come to their own conclusions.

It's such ingrained in their conscious that convincing religious people of the validity of scientific thought is a futile effort when it comes to the existence of deities.

While I do not like this fact, I do accept it. Nurtured beliefs and behavior are not ones to be easily dislodged. It goes for not just religion, but beliefs and ideas as a whole. As such, while I'll never agree that a deity exists, or even /might/ exist, I do understand /why/ people have practiced faith throughout human history.

Even in the bible the Apostle Paul strait up says "12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 15 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 19 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied."

This means that every other religion, which don't believe Jesus was the reincarnation of Christ, are wrong and will go to hell for being wrong.

The problem being of course that people are almost always (99% of the time) whatever religion their parents were, except in modern post industrial societies where atheism is growing rapidly.

** I always imagined that it would be some of the following.

- Wizarding Christianity. I mean, the holy book is absolute... but not really. There is a good chance wizardkind has adapted the word of Christ/Allah/Jehova/... for their own purposes.

- Wizards are traditionally speaking, pagans.

- Magic is itself a religion in some ways.

My favorite way of thinking about it is to mix the first and second thought. There are people like the Weasleys and Dumbledore who propagate or actively act after a wizarding form of christianity. However, that is a rather new phenomenon stemming from dark wizards often following a paganist belief system and therefore giving it a bad name as "dark". Families like the Greengrasses or Malfoys, but also Bones and Diggory still celebrate Yule and Samhain, praying to a wide variety of gods and spirits. The cultural divide of wizarding Britain is as much between pureblood-supremacists and equalists as it is between pagans and christians.

** I think most magic-born wizards (purebloods and halfbloods) are vague theists who don't subscribe to any specific religions but do somewhat believe in a benevolent God responsible for the existence of magic (some wizards would also believe that Magic /is/ God, ala the Force in /Star Wars/).

As for Muggleborns, I find White Squirrel's handling of them in the /Animagus/ series quite tasteful: if they have grown up in a given religion, some will retain their beliefs, and there are communities/organizations of such Muggleborns believers who dedicate themselves to helping newfound Muggleborns get over their crisis of faith. Some very religious people are mentioned to have gone through magical studies for the sake of not becoming Obscurials (or otherwise causing damage through accidental magic), but decided to destory their wands and leave the magical world once their studies were complete.

In the main characters' case... I think James and Lily were some kind of Christians (judging from the Bible quotation on their tombstone), and Harry probably identifies as one too even if he's not a very scrupulous practicioner. I want to think Hermione comes from an agonisticist family (plausible enough for medical doctors like the dentist Grangers), but judging from Rowling saying she based Hermione on herself, she's probably intended to be a Christian as well. I think the Weasleys don't buy into much of anything, though if pressed they'd probably agree with the "there's some kind of benevolent higher power" idea. If Voldemort believes in anything at all other than himself, it must be the "Magic /is/ the higher power" idea. And I think the Malfoys /pretend/ to be whatever religions suits their political needs at the moment, but are, in truth, cynical atheists (or at least, Lucius is; Narcissa may not be).

**** Correct me if I'm wrong, because it's been a while since I reread Dark Kingdom, but isn't paganism confined to the werewolves, Voldemort and Harry? I distinctly remember them being outliers, with the wizarding community at large following some modified form of Christianity.

To be honest, Dark Kingdom is the only fic where I like how paganism in the wizarding world has been handled. At least going off real world history, there were 1000 years between when England became at least nominally Christian and when the Statute of Secrecy was signed. I, at least, find it highly unrealistic that the wizarding community was openly practicing paganism while they were living alongside muggles, and the reality in England was that even families who converted in name only forgot their religious practices within a few generations, hence the transformation of a religion into folklore. Sure, there were isolated cases of "crypto-Jews" in Portugal who did manage to retain their religious beliefs, but the vast majority just because Christian families who had weird traditions about not eating pork.

The wizarding world's full split from the muggle world coincides with the Glorious Revolution and the Act of Toleration, so individuals openly practicing a seperate Protestant denomination wouldn't have been too out of the question at that time. And then you have a couple hundred years for their own particular catechism to get ironed out.

I really liked that when I read it in Patron. I wish I saw it more often in fanfics.

** Religion in the Potterverse probably just adopts from modern theistic religions (and possibly polytheistic and Pagan religions). The word Witchcraft is pretty interesting, as Hogwarts seems to make a distinction between the two (Witchcraft and Wizardry). There's also the fact that the Bible's original copy has never been found, it could have been taken by Wizards as there is something in there that exposes their people.

** Unfortunately, the religious aspect in fanfiction is frequently the author just inserting his own religion, without exploring the impacts.\\
Among the interesting works, /Patron/ explores a little a society where a civic religion (a little in the Roman model) was re/built following the Status; /the Untitled Tome/ has an interesting approach, with a society large enough that several religious movements ( some of them with maybe? proofs?) can coexist (somewhat, and not without frictions); and I'm waiting to see how /the Prince of Slytherin/ broach the topic, though we may have to wait until 6th year.

The interesting thing is that HP canon universe has points upon which it is possible to build upon when speaking about religion: the existence of the soul, the hinted possibility to reach the dead (with the mythical resurection stone; with the priori incantatem phenomenom), Dumbledore's /next great adventure/ which has to come from somewhere.

Finally, Harry, should his story be told second hand (by Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Hagrid, from what they lived), could fit very well as a messianic figure

** If we look at when the Statute of Secrecy was passed, we'd expect most English wizards to be somewhat Anglican influenced. It's the religion they had then, but they've since probably had much less interaction with the Muggle world, and thus, with the Anglican Church. Combine that with the typical longevity of wizards and some awkwardness about witches, and you've probably got a society that follows some archaic Anglican traditions but mostly isn't super devout.

One of the issues I imagine could be a big deal is how to relate to religious authority. This is maybe less of an issue with Protestants, but is there a Wizarding Catholic Church? Or an Eastern Orthodox one? Or are they members of the same church as muggles? How well can wizards relate to muggle clergy? Is there magical clergy?

I would definitely expect there to be some sort of pagan revival religion, but I'm not sure what the popular perception would be of it.

I detest preachy fics, but there are some that genuinely explore their characters beliefs, and that can be fascinating.

*** I could probably happily spend months researching and drafting out ideas to tackle the questions in your second paragraph. Of course, then it would probably only get a passing mention in any fic I wrote, because I also don't see any appeal in preachy fics, and detailed discussions of theology rarely come up in casual conversation.

Right now, however, my brain is hung up on the idea of magical clergy, and what that could potentially mean for transubstantiation.

** I am very anti-theist but when I go into fanfiction I want to read. As long as the religion isn't too idiotic and take up the plot (unless it IS the plot in which case why am I reading it) I don't care. I like it when some Pagan traditions are shown as well or hints. I see religion as the result of the ignorance of humanity and yearn for the day when people grow up and stop believing in fairy tales so if it persists to a large degree or becomes a common theme then I'm out. Even just reading this thread makes me want to go into a rant about how worshiping a god created by middle eastern desert people who didn't know even the most basic facts about reality is utterly ridiculous.

Luckily for me, I've learned to do what most never do - separate fun and my ideals. Outside of fanfic, my respect for someone drops immensely by learning that they are theistic but within it... Meh.

Furthermore, your responses betray a serious lack of knowledge of the subject matter, e.g. the time Jesus supposedly lived, Josephus, Christian theology and the diversity therein. If you expect to be taken seriously in a discussion you should remedy that and drop the antagonistic tone. And, as I said before, do it somewhere else.

** I think it depends on why religion is in the story.

If it's because the author feels the need to insert their own faith...then no thank you.

However, if it's a central part of a character (I'm thinking Muggleborn), then that might make an interesting story plot. Especially if are forced to grapple with their own ideologies in a world with magic. I'm currently writing a story about Lily Evans. She's Christian (goes to church with her family), but it's not really important to the story. It's just part of how I see her character. Also, when I lived in the UK for a few months, I loved visiting the churches. There is so much history there along with the beautiful architecture. I'm not religious, but there is something poetic about churches. /shrug/

*** I used a similar idea in my story "Patron". Next to the mainstream religion - a "pagan faith" "reconstructed", aka "mostly made up" after 1692, there were two sects. One was composed of those actually taking the religion seriously - the faithful. Those who did more than do the celebrations a few times a year, like the majority of modern Europeans, but actually prayed and went to the church/temple. And the others were a sect who believed that magic was not meant for casual use, but should be reserved for truly important things. They were considerd weird and seen as a sort of amish among the other wizards and witches, who, in this AU, used magic for everything, constantly.

** The only time it bothers me is when it comes out of nowhere, or is quite clearly shoehorned in. I eventually gave up reading a HP/Sherlock crossover when the Dr. Watson stand in started spending more and more time at their bible study, more and more Christian parables started being inserted into the story, and the overall theme of the fic started to heavily deviate into religious motifs.

On the other hand it's sometimes very helpful in fleshing out a character as a faith they were raised in can inform much about them. As long as it doesn't devolve into tokenism there usually isn't a problem.
