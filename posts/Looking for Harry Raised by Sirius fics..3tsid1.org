Hey guys. I am looking for fics that feature Harry raised by sirius. Idc if he is not the BWL, or if he is in slytherin or gryffendor, or what house. I dont care about the pairings (As long as it not slash. Just not in the mood for slash). I just want a Harry raised by Sirius fic. preferably one that is over 60k and complete (or consistently updated). Thanks

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** The best one I've read is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]], by sam_storyteller / copperbadge. In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

It does have Sirius/Remus slash, but it's skippable and not the focus.

Starts after third year, instead of Sirius raising Harry from childhood. Still in progress, but quite long even in its current state.

(Let's see if I summon the bot properly.)
