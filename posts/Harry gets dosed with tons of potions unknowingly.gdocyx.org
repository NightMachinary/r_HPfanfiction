I remember that Harry gets tested because he either collapses or something happens. They find out that Hermione has been dosing him with study help potions and everyone else has been with all sorts of stuff like love and loyalty potions and he eventually just built up a really big immunity. If anyone knows or remembers the name I really want to re-read it.


** /Hermione/ being the potion doser? This I gotta see!

*** IKR right? Usually, Hermione's there to say “X [usually Ginny, Molly, and/or Dumbledore] has been slipping you potions?!?!? Listen Harry, how about I now fuck you senseless while we realise all along we were meant for each other before you pop into Gringotts to soul-bond me and formalise our titles with the über-friendly goblins as Lord and Lady Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Pendragon-Merlin-Le Fey-Gaunt-Riddle-Peverell-Black-Potter. Sound like a plan?”

I agree, this is something that sounds interesting.

** I can just imagine Poppy getting a list with a dozen different potions and when she flushes them Harry is a very different person because his personality was a result of all the potions interacting.
