I am trying to think of ways to make the Death Eater cause more justifiable. Let's say to cast magic, you need mana or some elixir. The quantity of elixir is constant. The power to cast elixir is passed down in Wizarding families. But sometimes a Muggleborn is born who somehow gets that ability. Since the number of wizards are constant, that would mean for every Muggleborn born there will be a squib if the numbers go over the constant number of wizards in Wizarding families


** Ignoring the use of "elixer" that is exactly what the Death Eaters are unjustly accusing the muggleborn of in Deathly Hallows. Stealing magic from Wizards and causing squibs.

The question must be asked of why you are trying to make the Death Eater cause more justifiable. If you want a fic where they are the good guys, you're already going full AU and blood purity might as well be discarded. If you are trying to suggest a theory or explanation to "justify" their canon actions you will come across as supporting their racism every time.

Even if the number of wizards in the world was a set value it wouldn't justify racism against those, who through uncontrollable circumstances of birth, were born with the gift that others were denied. It could explain some bitterness on the parts of squibs and families of squibs, but it wouldn't justify bigotry.

Nothing justifies bigotry.

*** It's easier to write a decent story If you write humans realistically. And even racism has a reasons behind it and generally ones that are more than just blatant make believe.

Even racism or bigotry is supported by facts, statistics and scientific studies. But the reason why those "facts" don't matter is often obscure enough, that those hold up to basic scrutiny.

So, If OP simply wants to give blood purist more than two braincells, he would need a better argument.

**** Racism and bigotry are founded in power, hate, oppression, and ignorance.

The bigotry of purebloods is already "justified" in that sense by canon. Incoming muggleborn with ideas about equality and society from the muggle world are a threat to the power held by the wealthy and established families. So the narrative of mudbloods is spun and the ignorant masses are fed the hatred, which latches on. The ignorant that gain power perpetuate the bigotry out of their hatred. The cycle builds over generations and oppression reigns.

***** No it's not justified in that sense. Outside of conspiracy theorists, people are generally able to discern the nonsensical. Which is why they will search for anything remotely factual to support their agenda.

In canon this entire thing is glossed over, which is fine. There's enough hints to imply certain things, but that's it.

My actual point was that this "narrative" fed by the wealthy must have some rationale behind it, one we have yet to see.

Yes, upbringing, Family and peer pressure, group forming psychology, cognitive dissonace are all things. Not the point however.

** If you want to make the issue complex, you can make it a debate over immigration, shifting culture, and what determines citizenry in wizarding britain. Some limited elixir would seem contrived and probably be indicative of a poorly thought-out story.

*** That's not really a complex issue, either. When two cultures clash, then it's either something stupid and unimportant, like what kind of food you like or how you dress, which is something only a racist scumbag would get up in arms about, or it's something important - like acceptance of LBGT people, women's rights, democracy, human rights etc. And it's really, really hard to create a culture clash over something important, like human rights, that results in the "different, but equally valid" reaction and not "this cannot stand!" from people who respect human rights. It's really hard to find arguments that aren't obviously stupid for why girls shouldn't be allowed to determine their own fate, why gay people shouldn't be allowed to live or everyone should worship the same god.

Not that every reader will understand that. I've had people defend an aristocracy in comments to one of my stories just because the Protagonist was an aristocrat defending the system.

** The way that I see it (and use in my fic and probably most future fics) is that the wizarding community has a great reason to fear muggleborns because of their families, rather than them being wizards. Every muggleborn, simply by virtue of existing, is a potentially enormous breach of the Statute of Secrecy. Given that wizards have spent a minimum of hundreds of years in the past being persecuted by fanatical and violent muggles, this would couch the 'muggleborn problem' as one that has a factual fear at its root.

Canon instead chooses to use some silly conspiracy theory about how muggleborns are stealing magic. Yawn.

Look at the worst prejudices in the world right now - all of them expound on an external threat from an 'other' (whether it is jewish people, people with different color skin, gypsies, people practicing different religions, etc.).

** I once read a fic where ‘family magics' was a thing. The idea was that people pass their talents on to their children. Potter's are good at protection magic, Longbottom's do herbology, Black's do dark magic. Muggleborns are not weak, but are not able to have any natural talents for magic, and if they breed with Pure-Blood's their children would lose the family magic. So wizards choose people with similar Magic's to make talented children. All of the above is very problematic if you think about it. As is any fic that start with “okay how do we make eugenics sympathetic and true?” Besides it tends to lead to those political story's where people start throwing around things like “All Potter's through history have been carbon copies of James or Harry, All Longbottom's are just like Neville, etc. Leading to dark and light families, were you get registered as evil on the day that you are born. It denies the characters agency and individuality when you start to bring eugenics into the mix.

*** Apart from that, this idea also doesn't hold up upon closer scrutiny. How did those talents come into being in the first place? And how do talents react when two talent lines mix?

But above all, that's just a fucked up racist ideology.

** I read a fic once that explained it as muggle born witches and wizards corrupting the ministry. The Ministry, as I recall, isn't really meant to govern so much as it's supposed to keep the existence of magic a secret. They have laws, but they're there to codify the statute of secrecy and every department is supposed to do this. The ministry has obliviators to erase the memories of Muggles who catch wind of magic. It has a department of magical sports to organize events where Muggles can't see them. A department for the regulation of magical creature to keep Muggles from finding out about mermaids and centaurs and stuff. And it has Aurors to catch people who violate the laws.

You get the gist.

It basically paints this picture of the magical world as a community of magic practitioners, all of whom are independent, because if you're magical, you're pretty much self sufficient. You can build a home, run a farm and enchant whatever tools you need with magic. All you need is the skill and knowledge to do it. The fact that not everyone can possibly learn everything there is to know about magic is probably the only thing that necessitates an economy.

But this isn't how things are in the muggle world. A ministry here is a government that tells people what to do. So imagine if you will, that you are a talented wizard, you come from a rich family, and have just finished your magical education. The rest of your life will be spent trying to advance your knowledge of magic, or pursuing some magical art. There's nothing to hold you back from just exploring the world. Except there's a muggleborn witch or wizard who doesn't understand this. They're convinced that a government should govern. When they see you practicing the dark arts, they don't see a wizard exercising their right to explore the many and varied facets of magic. They see a dark wizard that the government hasn't arrested because it's so incompetent. Nevermind that you wouldn't use your dark knowledge to hurt anyone. It's all magic in the end. Why is this spell good but that one isn't? And this muggleborn idiot, who doesn't understand your culture or traditions, who never grew up in your world gets to come in here and decide for you and your family and your friends how you get to use your magic? Not to mention they're the children of Muggles, the people who forced your brethren into hiding in the first place. They're the reason you need the ministry at all, and why you can't play a friendly quidditch match out in the open.

It kinda makes sense if you look at it in that light. It's a culture clash more than anything.

*** In order for that to actually work out, you'd need a huge number of muggleborns. Otherwise, they cannot dominate the Ministry or even attempt to. And if the number of muggleborns is that huge, then the culture of Wizarding Britain would have adapted long ago.
