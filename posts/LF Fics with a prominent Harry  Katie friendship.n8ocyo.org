** I have nothing for you here, but I was debating making this post myself for the same reason. And honestly - any of the chasers qualify. Fun fact: there is one series of tagged with an Angelina friendship, and one single fic with Katie on AO3. And that makes me sad.

As a consolation prize, they're close in the Child Protection Movement series and eventually become a couple. Note that the series is left open for a sequel, but can be considered complete as is.

  What happens if Hermione notices signs of abuse in Harry during first year? The Wizarding World may not have laws against it, but the Muggle World certainly does...

** I'll say Cadmean Victory before anyone else does, but that's the only one I can think of.

I've always wished there were more fics where Harry was close with his Quidditch team.

*** Quidditch Tales on Fanfiction.net has a Katie romance. It's pretty good, though I personally skip over the smut, there's rather a lot.

****** That's still one of those stories that I mentally add ten years to every character's age and think of Hogwarts as a college. It's the only way to get through that story for me, and I enjoyed it for the most part with those changes.

******* Yeah. Agreed. I tend to skip over the smut, but some of the stuff it introduced was rather much for teens.

I like the concept of the huge trunks. It reminds me of that animal park of Newt's.

** linkffn(Paging dr bell) is a well-written fic that has a great Katie and Harry friendship, despite the mediocre Manipulative! Dumbledore that show up later in the story.
