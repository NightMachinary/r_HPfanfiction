Preferably long and well written.

As stated in the title, I am looking for some post-war fics which feature Harry and George heavily (although not slash). If Harry decided he wanted to persue Quidditch then all the better!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): George, not Ron, is the first to join Harry in vigilante killings of Death Eaters who escaped justice again after the war. This is a very popular fic on this sub, often recommended by me and others.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
