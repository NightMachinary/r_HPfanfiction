Would she or he die or become a magical creature? I'm quite sure this could turn out to be a dark and dreary story but if we kept things whimsical at first it might be fun to explore the possibility of them getting the ability to see the magical world but really not have magic (like squibs) before the ministry sends someone Iike McNair to put down the dangerous creature. But what if they are able to escape? What kind of adventures could they get into?


** yes muggles can become werewolves, but they are less likely to survive a werwolf attack than wizards because they are more likely to bleed to death. And the ministry doesent kill people because they are werewolves. The ministry only wants werewolves to lock themself up during nights of the full moon. Werwolves are also only classified as magical creature when they are in wolf form. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/werewolves]]

** This would actually be a good idea for a fanfic. Now for your question, I'd say become a werewolf but the real question would be what the Ministry would do.

Personally i don't see them offering much help and would hope he/she dies. Maybe the werewolf (that isn't a dark wizard) that bite them helps out of guilt.
