hello All, i recently read Camerado by MillieJoan. it's a war fic set in the last two year of hogwarts, following canon as much as possible while introducing a snape-hermione romance. the writing is amazing, character growth and perspective are masterful, so, beside strongly recommend it, I would like to know if there is anything else from the same author.

there are other 2 fic on fanfiction dot net, but she is so good that i would not be surprised if she was a published author, I would read anything by her, even non HP!

any info is very welcome!

** Sounds like that's something better addressed towards the author herself?
