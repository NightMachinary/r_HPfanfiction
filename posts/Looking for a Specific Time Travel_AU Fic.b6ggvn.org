**** Is Harry an animagus? What is it? I read a couple of stories like that so I tend to differentiate it based on animagus. Though I don't remember anything with tonks bandana thing .. So I either hadn't read it or I dropped the fic before it became relevant. (I don't remember reading one that Harry isn't an animagus. So if he wasn't. I probably haven't read it) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13035363/1/I-m-back]] (this has tonks bandana but it's a rose Potter alternate not an iris)
