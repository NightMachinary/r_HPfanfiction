** That depends, if you go with the actual Final Destination lore (at least as established past part 2) then none of it matters because everyone dies anyway.

*** I don't even understand how you can come to that conclusion. Does your mother matter just because she'll die? Is having a dog pointless because it will die in two decades at most? You're forgetting the juicy bits in between that actually gives it meaning. Even if we know how the book ends before we even open it, we can enjoy the journey to how it gets there.

**** Except there are no juicy bits, no one interacts in the world in any meaningful way in between the overly sadistic deaths so the only thing the visionary (the term used for the FD protagonist) accomplishes is usually to set up people for an even more drawn out and an painful death.

It's like saving your friends from Michael Myers only for them to get taken by Pinhead, you had good intentions but your friends are way worse off.

***** Ah, so you didn't even read what I said. Let me use another example. Anime. We all know that Goku is going to win. We all knew that Naruto was going to prevail. We all knew Harry was going to defeat Voldemort.

So you're saying these series are worthless due to that? That there is nothing in them? I'm reading my favorite book series for the fifth time. I know every plot point, and I still love the journey. I've read Harry Potter many more times (The series is shorter, and I've had it for more than one year.) I still love it because I like the journey and reading about the interactions I knew were going to happen.

My brother and I share a lot of the same interests. We both quote entire paragraph from series while we're rewatching or listening to them via audiobook. The journey is far more important than the destination otherwise books would simply be a single page.

"A boy was almost killed by someone as a baby causing the killer to almost die. The boy then completely killed the killer later. The End.

****** Name something that anyone in the FD series does that isn't dieting, talking about dieng or trying not to die. The only way to compare this to Harry Potter is if everyone on both sides was living in complete isolation and it ends with England getting nuked.

******* It doesn't matter if they inevitably die. It's the journey they take to actually dying that makes it interesting. I haven't even watched the series in maybe a decade.

******** THERE IS NO JOURNEY. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING NOT RELATED TO DYING IN HORRIBLE WAYS. I HAVE SAID THIS THREE FUCKING TIMES NOW.

********* And dying in horrible ways is part of the journey. The methods they use to avoid death is also part of the journey. The inevitable conclusion to living is that you die, but that doesn't mean your time spent alive is meaningless and can't be enjoyed.

You have said it three times, and you've been just as wrong everytime you've said it. I've also explained why you're wrong each time.
