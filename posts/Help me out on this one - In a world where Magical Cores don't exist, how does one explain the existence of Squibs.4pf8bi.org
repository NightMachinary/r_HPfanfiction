** Well you know: MAGIC

Magic in HP isnt meant to be some hidden science with perfect laws and rules. Yes there is some magical theory, but its not absolute, intent trumps mechanics.

Most of the time, magic does things because. Squibs dont need to be explained, they are a thing that just happens, no reason nor logic to it. Making it some breeding or genetic thing undermines HP's message that we are defined by choices not birth.

*** That doesn't make any sense. If anything, magic is a dominant genetic trait, within squibs it has become recessive due to the most likely culprit of inbreeding. If we go by your logic of choice, then Petunia could have chosen to be a witch or squibs could make that choice too. Some things aren't choices, but our choices make us who we are as a person to the world, can you see that difference?

*** This. Filch was still able to see Hogwarts, Dementors, and use owls as a postal service. If a Muggle ever tried to use an owl to send a letter to grandma, they'd probably be scratched all over from a very angry bird.

Makes you curious about the Kwikspell course though. Filch never succeeded at the course. But does that mean there's people with more magic than a squib but less than a wizard to the point Hogwarts doesn't accept them? Or would this course be for late bloomers (who probably fall into that category anyway)?

**** Some people theorise that only the (supposed) elite go to Hogwarts and many witches and wizards learn from one another rather than go to schools, so Kwikspell could also be useful to those because if you learn from people who aren't technically teachers you might get someone who doesn't really know how to teach you well enough.

And before anyone tries to counter it with the Weasleys being too poor and stuff, they are one of the “Sacred Twenty-Eight” which could void that argument (or could not, but point is that we don't know).

***** I don't think the Weasleys were that poor at all. They had seven kids so money would obviously be tight during the summer right before the school year. Also, Bill and Charlie were already out of school by 1991, so the point where they would have had the most fiscal trouble would be in the summer of 1992, since that's when they had 5 kids going to Hogwarts. 1993 would have been bad as well, but they won the lottery and managed to deal with it.

But Bill was a curse breaker for Gringotts and must've been making boatloads of cash to wear dragon hide boots all the time. Percy was really high up in the Ministry and still lived at home; he probably was supporting his family at the time. Arthur was still a head for a reasonably important but looked down upon department; he probably had a decent paycheck to support 9 people + Harry without complaints.

Hand-me-downs don't necessarily mean poor. Used is just cheaper than new. From Harry's, Malfoy's, and Hermione's POV, Ron looks broke AF because the former two are filthy rich and Hermione is reasonably well off (two dentists can make some good money). Ron still had enough money to buy Harry decent Christmas and birthday presents.

**** Like [[/u/Kazeto]] said, I am of the opinion that Hogwarts is a school for those above average in magical ability. In my mind, there is a sliding scale of magical power, from most to least: Sorcerers, Mages, Wizards, Hedgewitches, and, of course, Squibs. It's possible (thought certainly not canon) that Kwikspell was for hedgewitches and weak wizards who couldn't afford proper education.

** Squibs have as much magic as muggles. The reason why squibs like Filch can enter Hogwarts is because he's not /considered/ a muggle and magic hides Hogwarts from muggles, not squibs. Language is important here, because as we know, HP is based on concepts. For example, James and Lily weren't hidden from Voldemort because their house was hidden. What was hidden was the /information/ that Potters lived in that particular house. So, the information was hidden by the Fidelius, not the location.

Edit: magical cores are entirely fanon. While I'm not a proponent of slavish devotion to canon, the cores are, imo, one of those bad fanon ideas that should never have been invented.

************ Yes, the fact that the Trace can't distinguish underage wizards from adults is precisely what I was alluding to by using the CoS example, not arguing against it.

Okay, a recap.

1. Trace can't tell who casts a spell, only where (roughly) and when.

2. Trace is supposed to be geared towards underage magic only, yet it reacts to house-elf produced magic.

3. Trace is not on the wand.

4. Trace is most likely not on the person.

5. 3 & 4 would suggest that the Trace is some kind of radar spell.

6. No one gets a letter for casting magic aboard the Hogwarts Express, which is technically "outside of school".

There may be more to the Trace than we know. Perhaps it's capable of more than we see from Harry's POV, but not every case warrants an intervention by the Ministry.

I speculated that Voldemort's Taboo was actually based on the Trace, or was the Trace itself repurposed, because their functions and area of effect seem similar.

Nothing suggests that Unforgivables would be detected if cast by over-seventeens. Harry cast the Cruciatus /in the Ministry/ but as far as we know, he didn't get a letter for that.

************* You make good points and I absolutely agree now that a radar like/area monitoring enchantment is most likely.

The ministry probably gets a ping and then cross check that ping with the muggleborn registry. If there is a muggleborn nearby, but no wizard homes then a letter would get sent out. If there was a wizard home nearby it's probably discarded.

My point now is that because the trace cannot differentiate between wizard and elf, most likely it cannot determine between adult and minor.

Therefore all magic is monitored and it's a gap in canon that the ministry doesn't monitor those logs for unforgivable curses and send an auror response team. Voldemort's taboo shows that some words can be tracked and used as transportation coordinates.

*** Magical cores are fanon, but at the end of the day a book world needs to have lore behind it. Sadly unlike Tolkien, and certain other authors, JK Rowling did not put a ton of thought into the lore. As such, people have invented their own.

So heres the question. Squibs have a much magic as muggles. Magicals have more obviously. But where does that magic come from? Is it intertwined with their souls, is it part of their mind, part of their being, in a seperate core, is it drawn from the world around them, and so on and so forth.

You could always go with the "its just magic" answer but that doesn't help explain deeper questions.

Edit: just to clarify, not critiquing your answer so much as pointing out that canon is seriously lacking in this area, and because there is no actual answer given, you have to create one to allow for deeper exploration of the lore. Unfortunately, creating one also affects what you see/discover later.

***** Fair enough, again I was not critiquing your answer but JK Rowlings "background" and "lore" for HP is extremely lacking. There is a reason so much of fanon is confused for canon.

As for questions I have, it would take a full paper to fully list them all and why, and that would only be covering maybe 10% of possibles. My main issue has and always will be the background of magic and magical history itself. Most of the lore is corrupted now by fanon, because JK gave VERY little background in the stories themselves (and even less outside them), focusing mainly on character development. But if your looking for a more specific interest outside the bounds of the major structure of the story, a question as simple as why certain types of magical study are taught and others not and all that entails would be another such question of great ponderance.

Dont get me wrong, I love people in FF altering anything and everything to create amazing new stories, but I would prefer it if there was a baseline so that there would be less fights about canon and fanon if you will.

If they are magical-born muggles, then there might be only a single gene for magic and it wasn't passed on or its expression was suppressed by some other gene(s).

If they are half-way, then there may be multiple genes for magic (or one gene for magic and others that contribute to it) and squibs didn't get them all or something else suppresed them.

Or alternatively, it could be that muggles get one variation of the gene, wizards get another, and squibs get a faulty gene that is neither of those and thus can't do that wizards can but technically aren't muggles either. It's a long shot, but considering that the mechanics of the existence of squibs seem to be similar to those of certain genetic mishaps that do work this way (existing due to faulty genes), it's a possibility.

** Specific expression "magical core" aside, I think that Squibs are actually evidence /against/ some sort of a magical power level, unrelated to general intelligence, knowledge, emotional disposition, and just plain practice.

Consider, that if there were something like that, then we'd expect to see a /spectrum/: we'd see squibs, we'd see your typical Hogwarts student, and we'd see everything in between, including near-squibs, who would be intellectually and emotionally normal, but would only be able to do magic a little bit. We don't see that.

Instead, we see a pretty good correlation between a wizard's magical capabilities and their general intelligence and studiousness (Goyle and Crabbe on one extreme, Hogwarts Professors, Dumbledore, and Riddle on the other) and a pretty good correlation between magical capabilities and emotional disposition, including drive, desire for control, and resilience (early-canon Neville on one extreme, late-canon Neville, Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Riddle on the other). We also see limitations and signature spells that reflect a wizard's personality, with the most clear examples of that being Lockart's shallowness and lust for fame driving his talent for magic that affects others' opinions of him and nothing else, but also Harry's indomitable stubbornness and emotional directness giving him a powerful Patronus and resistance to the Imperius, but making him incapable of taking advice, controlling himself before Umbridge and, arguably, crippling his Occlumency [1].

What we don't see is any good counterexamples (if my memory isn't deceiving me): characters with low intelligence and/or lacking confidence but having powerful magic, or wizards or witches with high or even average intelligence and average emotional disposition but whose magic is just plain weak.

Coming back to squibs, the evidence that they are distinct from Muggles as far as inborn magic is concerned is highly circumstantial. When I was reading the OotP trial scene for the first time, I remember getting a distinct impression that Dumbledore had just made up the "fact" that squibs could see on the spot so that Figg could testify in Harry's defense: who's going to contradict Dumbledore on a obscure factoid like that? Squibs who stay in magical society can probably be accommodated, perhaps similarly to parents of Muggleborns when they shop in Diagon Alley, and, given how magic seems to work, I can see a form of acclimatization as well: Filch has grown up with magic all around him, and he /knows/ Hogwarts is not ruins, so why shouldn't he be able to see it?

[1] Arguably. I don't want to get into that argument on this thread.

*** It is an interesting theory, but I think there is a large problem with it, namely Ravenclaw students. Ravenclaws, famed for their intelligence, do not seem to over represent those with the greatest magical power. In your theory, as they are 'smart' (for however you define that) they must also be emotionally unstable for this to be the case. And as Ravenclaws are roughly 1/4 the population that doesn't really work out.... Sure, we don't see a lot of Ravenclaw students, but if your theory is correct we should have, as they would be important to the plot with such magical power.

**** Firstly, what makes you think that a typical Ravenclaw is that much smarter than a typical non-Ravenclaw? Would Salazar have let Rowena get away with that? The division is not over raw intelligence (however measured) but over what one does with it: one may have intellect used to acquire knowledge for knowledge's sake and satisfying general curiosity (Ravenclaw), intellect used to help oneself and one's own (even if it hurts others) (Slytherin), and intellect used to help others or fix the world's problems (whether the world wants it or not) (Gryffindor). In other words, while Ravenclaw might exclude people with low intelligence, it might not actually get the smartest people in a given year.

Secondly, perhaps I should have been more clear. Intelligence in and of itself seems to be a requirement for doing powerful or complex magic (because most of what is often called "magical training" is better described as "studying"), but it's not sufficient: one must actually take the time to learn and practice it and the confidence and the drive and the emotional disposition to cast it (which was the other factor I had described), and, for that matter, to get involved in conflicts rather than just keeping one's head down or fleeing. Having high intelligence seems to make it easier, but if one is a very laid-back person who spends one's time at Hogwarts doing the minimum necessary to pass classes while being fascinated with history of magical beverages or Muggle clocks or Astronomy, one might have fairly limited capacity to influence events when war breaks out --- and Ravenclaws would be particularly prone to do just that.

#+end_quote

To distill your argument down: /Everyone is born with equal magic, but magical training and mental fortitude are required to be powerful./

So, it is not /caused/ by intelligence (correlation is not causation), but just like intelligence there are many variables that affect it (which also affect intelligence itself). However, unlike intelligence, one factor is /not/ genetic predispositions, other factors such as learning environment (especially when very young), drive, opportunities etc. are more important to how 'magical' someone is. It is /not/ a fixed innate capacity, a genetic gift, or as it were in Harry Potter, due to blood or /core/.

This theory I think fits the theme of the books well. Is that what you were getting at?

****** Nature vs. Nurture debates aside, I generally agree.

My thinking is that it's easier for smarter people to learn new magic and perform magic better (just as it's easier for them to learn new mundane things and perform most mundane cognitive tasks better), and a certain amount of general intelligence might be necessary for understanding some of the more complex magic well enough to cast it. So, other things such as personality type, self-confidence, and time investment being equal, a person endowed with a higher IQ (for lack of a better metric) would be better at magic. It's causal in that respect.

The main point I was trying to make, though, is that how well one does at what magic appears to depend on traits that are not in, and of themselves, magical and, critically, if there were some continuously varying magical power level separate from those traits, that distinguished Muggles from Squibs from Wizards and made some Wizards more or less powerful than others (i.e., the Magical Core mechanic) we would have expected to see some wizards whose magical capabilities were decoupled from their intellect and personality. We don't, so Squibs don't add to evidence for such a power level: you either have magic (Wizard or Witch) or you don't (Muggle or Squib).

** This is purely my head cannon but it might help you out. Magic is an energy/force that permeates the world. Every single person in the world has a connection to this magic. Think of it as a pipe/thread/bond or whatever makes sense for you. Somewhere in the middle of that pipe/thread/bond, with a human on one end and magic on the other, is a valve. The position of that valve affects how much magic flows through the pipe/thread/bond to that individual.

- Valve closed: the person is a non-magical.

- Valve partially open: the person is a squib, able to perceive magic but unable to use it.

- Valve is open: the person is a magical.

** I always assumed that the presence of magical ability was basically a gene mutation. It's the benign kind so it doesn't affect health but since it's a mutation, it can randomly occur (muggle-born wizards), it can be passed on in families (it appears from canon that the vast majority of children born to wizards and witches are magical and the vast majority of children born to muggles are non-magical, we know wizards can be born from mixed marriages but we don't know in what proportion mixed marriages produce muggles/squibs.) I don't know enough about genes to know if they can un-mutate/mutate back into the normal form or whether the actual mutated version is passed on or just a /tendency/ to mutate (so for squibs, something would prevent the gene from mutating or it would just not mutate for some reason despite this inherited tendency.)

Functionally I've always assumed that muggles and squibs are identical, it's just that most muggles don't know about the existence of magic so are blissfully ignorant and squibs are unfortunate enough to have that knowledge because they are born into that world. The reason squibs aren't called muggles would probably be because of anti-muggle feeling, because in the past (and the present with some wizarding families) who you were born to was almost more important than your own heritage - and perhaps because it's not always clear with little children whether they have magical ability or not - Neville mentioned that his family thought he was a squib for a long time, whereas Harry was doing accidental magic all through his primary schooling. (Though this could be argued this was because he was going through extremely stressful experiences, perhaps not all magical children have accidents). I think if a squib was brought up with muggles (e.g. if Tom Riddle had been a squib) they would be considered a muggle.

As far as ability goes, I have always seen magical ability as being similar to whether or not a person has good physical co-ordination or has a "math brain" or finds it easy to pick up languages or how creative they are, basically, a mixture of innate skill and training, whereas the ability to produce magic or not is more of a binary - you either can or you can't, and the "kwikspell" type courses are a cruel kind of scam.

** There is no background on WHERE magic comes from in the lore. JK Rowling never gives us one. She gives us lots of little leads, but often they lead in different directions.

Ive always gone with the concept that Magic is likely similar to "the force". A genetic mutation that tends to run in families (but occasionally does not happen), that allows you to tap into an energy force ever present in the universe, and through manipulation of that force through words, intentions, and movements (with a wand helping to further focus such movements) to achieve your goals.

As such, a Squib is simply one without the mutation. A rarity, and basically the opposite of muggle borns, but even less likely to happen due to the gene having a MUCH higher chance of being passed on from people already with it.

** There are several ways you can explain it, based on what the premise is you are looking for:

IF magic is genetic and squibs arise because of excessive inbreeding, it can be genetic/neural damage.

IF the above prepositions aren't established, it can be explained away by the nature of the magical connection in humans-magic arises in certain individuals who then go on to procreate. Being mystical in nature, magic is not necessarily tied to genetics so much as family connections-if you are born of two magical beings, it is their conviction and nurture that helps develop the newborn's magical potential rather than genetics. However, magic also happens to be fleeting-the longer it is present in a single family line, the more likely it is to, for want of a better word, regress in capability. And while nurture & conviction can help improve the odds, they never completely negate the possibility of someone being born with a connection to magic but without the means to exercise it.

Another idea would be simply that wizards have their magic flowing from point at to point b with the wizard or witch being the connector between the two points. Squibs, on the other hand, are caught in a feedback loop-magic flows in from point a, but a biological/mystical/metaphysical quirk in their body catches it in a feedback loop and discharges it back down to point a rather than allowing it to flow through to point b. They have all the benefits wizards have-longevity, the ability to perceive more than the accepted standards of reality, maybe even a way to actually perform magic if such a thing were to be discovered, but they would never be able to use a wand or express their magic the normal way.

They can also act as magical regulators, attracting and smoothing out any magical surges that may occur in magic-saturated environments, which neatly explains the reasons behind Filch's continued employment at a school with an army of house elves at its disposal. I cribbed that idea off a fanfic somewhere, but I cannot remember which one...

If you are looking for a theory on how magic works given that it does have metaphysically measurable phenomenae occurring in nature (magical beasts, leylines, ghosts and so on), you can explain it by saying that magic is conducted through the human nervous system. This helps explain how accidental magic occurs and allows for the differences in power one can see in the books/films/plays-the greater the brain's connection to the magic flowing through it, the more effective the wizard or witch is at learning/using/researching it. I say connection to magic rather than intelligence because some of the ideas the characters come up with is enough to me to label even the most powerful among them as dumber than bricks (especially enchanted ones, given magic's penchant to grant sapience to inactive objects).

Whatever the reason may be, I do not really believe squibs are an aberration. Rather, they are a mutation that randomly occurs within the magical population-some variables that determine how they interact with magic are changed by either chance or destiny and, while 99.99% of them end up disconnected from magic, it is my belief that that 0.01% that successfully changes the way the affected party interacts with magic in a positive manner is evidence of evolution in action. As that one one hundredth of a percent continue to reproduce and spread the new connection to magic, over a couple of millenia those pseudo-squibs could end up breaking off from the mainstream human race altogether. Indeed, the fact that goblins and dwarves exist indicates that this may well have happened in the past.

Is that helpful?

** In one of my fics that went nowhere, I delved into the matter of magic and how it comes to be. Magic, as a force in the HP universe, is symbol, need, desire becoming matter and energy. There are several origin stories for magic in the fandom, but my favorites are always those that don't try to explain magic, because it simply cannot be explained in a way our senses and brain can grasp.

It can be narrowed down - framed, if you will. People find boundaries, but we also see that these boundaries are not as strict as someone like Hermione wants us to believe. The Avada Kedavra is always deadly, cannot be blocked - Not always, though. Rules are established; wand-movements, incantations, recipes and timings, but those rules only tell us about the frame of magic, not whats within it.

Or, like Aurora says to Hermione in my fic: "Magic is all and everything, anything you want and nothing if you don't believe it. Logic has no place with magic. Magic doesn't do the science with you - it defies it, mocks it and changes just to spite the researcher who tries to shackle it down and define it."

So, the answer given to your question was quite accurate. "Lol dunno" is probably how the wizarding world has dealt with the matter for the entirety of its existence.

But to give you an inspiration, here is how one of the books in the mentioned fic describes it:

/Magic as a force establishes itself in a sentient being by giving it the potential ability to distort current realities. Its will shall be done by its will alone. Magic is nature, and above it and more beyond it. Those who wield it are beyond nature and at the same time, deeper within it; masters and servants, Kings and peasants at the same time./

/Those without magic are independent and suffer for it. Nature punishes those with the potential to free themselves from it. Disease, early death, lethal wounds, frail bodies are but a few things deadlier to those without magic, without nature within them. Instead of the singularity of nature which the magical beings are part of, those without magic live in duality with it./

/The ones in the middle, the wolfs and owls and monkeys, with the squibs representing our own, the human, live in limbo between the outside and inside. They are aware of their exile from the singularity of nature, almost teased by it - mocked as the odd one out by granting them just enough access to see their outsider life for what it is. Pity them for they see the Lethifold hunting them, but not the weapon that would be their saving grace./

** My personal theory doesn't involve magical cores, but "veins" in the body that allow a person to channel magic through themselves - Muggles never evolved to have these "veins", whereas Squibs, from genetic unluckiness or from inbreeding, tend to have them but they're too closed in, leaving it virtually impossible for them to channel magic for more complex spells.

They can still sense latent magic and the like, having the smallest of capabilities, but they're simply unable to draw magic into themselves and cast with it.

** ..... Magical veins? lol.

Consider the difference between having the magical ability, and being able to channel that magic outward (into a wand etc). Also, I guess it depends on if you're arguing that magic is something the wizards possess innately or whether it's something they draw in from the outside every time they cast.

As long as you have a solid explanation backing yourself up, readers will take anything you make up :) ... or if it sounds complicated enough that no one understands any of it, I guess they would accept that too. XD
