Harry is stupidly popular with girls which is unsurprising considering his kind nature and fame, with witches from all four houses vying for his affection.

But due to his lack of knowledge in regards to love and his desire to not hurt anyone if he can help it he inadvertently spurns their affections repeatedly.

Tensions grow as the girls after his heart grow more competitive with each other (Not at all helped by the Twins stoking the flames and running a betting pool on who wins), and Harry fears at this point that should he ever make a choice that the girls would lose their minds and burn down the school.

"Maybe I should just tell them I'm dating a Muggle?" Harry says to Ron.

"Luna would see right through it, Hermione would demand proof, and the rest of them would probably go nuts and burn down the school anyways" the Weasley replies, not even looking up from his Chess Game with Dobby.

"I should have let the Basilisk eat me during Second Year" Harry Groans.

"But then Ginny would have died" Ron Replies.

"Well obviously I'd save her before it ate me!" Harry snaps back.


** "Well obviously I'd save her before it ate me!" Harry snaps back.

Brilliant.

*** Ginny, the hipster Harry fangirl, is in the background trying to wrangle the herd eavesdropping on them. "Yeah, hear that? I was falling all over myself in love with him so much that it almost released Voldemort's soul into the world again before it was cool. All you bandwagon-jumpers can sod off back to Cedric."

I think it would be funny if Ginny - who's been following Hermione's advice to try to have a life independent of Harry - winds up as his confidante, the one girl who's willing to give him a head's up when the other girls are planning stuff and being a platonic friend.

** And then Harry travels back in time to prevent it from happening, but since he can't just change his personality or let people die when he can prevent it the result is him juggling his love-life the best he can (not particularly well).

Eventually Voldemort (whom Harry had completely forgot about) gets so feed up that Harry is just ignoring all his plots to kill him (He was working hard to destroy his Nemesis! the minimum the damn brat could do is notice it! Sometimes he feels like he is the only one trying in this relationship) that he uses their link to pick up on Harry's oddly specific fear that his admirers will eventually burn down Hogwarts and promptly doses all Gran-Britain's population with Armotenia and broadcast on wireless that Harry would only date the person who manages to burn down Hogwarts.
