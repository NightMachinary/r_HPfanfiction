Basically the hat was on Harry's head, and the sorting hat said something along the lines of 'well, bring the next person' even though Harry was there already, and had the hat on his head.

Sadly that's all I can remember. I don't know if it was, because he knew Occulmency or anything. All I remember is that one particular scene.

Thanks in advance, Warryn.

*** Thanks. I just got finished with that part in a business course where you had to address a letter, and I guess it carried over.

With regards, Warryn.
