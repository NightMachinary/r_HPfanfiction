I've read fanfiction where Voldemort didn't lose the first war but I haven't read any where Grindelwald kept his stranglehold on Europe. It could be due to Dumbledore refusing to confront him or losing the battle when he does. Would Grindelwald let Dumbledore live subsequently though? It'd be really interesting to read an AU with the Fantastic Beast characters and the effects a victory would have had on Voldemort. Any recommendations?


** Linkffn(the skitterleap) I think? Been a long time since I've read it.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Greater Good) is perfect for this. It's virtually abandoned, but it's well worth the read for what it is.

  Dumbledore and Grindelwald combined forces and carved out an empire for "the greater good". Now, Harry must enter this confusing world and decide for himself what the Greater Good truly is. AU. Grey!Harry.

** linkffn(6663972) is very AU and a gen fic. Grindelwald and Dumbledore had different effects on the British Wizarding World. The plot is interesting mainly due to the details of the alternate universe. And there is no romance whatsoever in this fic.

  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
