#+TITLE: If someone has a way for me to read "Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past" other than on fanficauthors, then I'd be really grateful. I, for some reason, cannot validate an account nor can I download and read it due to all of the files corrupting.

** None of the hosted versions has chapter 43; you need the PDF/ebook version. However, you don't need to PM anyone. It's at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

It has all 43 chapters, cover art, two authorised one-shots by other authors, and it fixes lots of typos (Disclosure: I'm a contributor to it).
