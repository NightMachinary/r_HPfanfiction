So, I've read a lot of Harry Potter Fanfiction. And I've just plain read a lot. I've always written short stories for various characters and settings and such, but never published anything before. While I would like to think that my grammar is at a reasonable standard, and that my butchery of the Queens English is kept to a minimum, the sad truth is that reviewing your own work is difficult and mistakes end up slipping past. So, I am both hoping for a bit of feedback on the story itself, and perhaps some kind and patient (read: bored) soul to point out my inevitable mistakes.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12967743/1/The-Reluctant-Wizard]])


** I only see a few grammar mistakes, and I guess the story is alright if that's the sort of thing you go for. It definitely suffers from writing-children-as-adults syndrome. But plenty of people like writing 11-year-olds as political masterminds, so I guess pretending 5-yr-olds aren't dumb as fuck and are into "careful observation and comparison" and that it would be possible to make even an abused kid actually do all of those chores has got to appeal to /someone/.

I'd maybe take out a few of the canon descriptions. Your audience already knows this information about the characters, such as Harry is dressed badly and Vernon working at Grunnings- that's the beauty of fanfiction. Only share that stuff if it contributes to plot action and some other character needs to know it.

I'd also break up the initial paragraphs a lot more and go for impact statements to get you audience hooked quickly. Your mobile readers will just see a giant wall of text because the initial paragraph is too big.

It picks up the last couple of paragraphs when you introduce the new teacher, but I'm not sure how realistic a three-week course on the Great War is for 5-yr-olds either. Or even the more mundane stuff such as announcing who the top students in class are. I just don't think that's done at that age.

All-in-all, the description sounds a bit intriguing (Harry has built a life of hard work for himself and so is reluctant to go to Hogwarts?) but based on this chapter alone, I wouldn't continue reading if i'd just stumbled on this. Sorry to give such a harsh review- you could certainly make something of this with some re-writing.

*** I appreciate the review, I am glad you took the time to give it a read and respond.

You have several very valid points. I do have trouble writing children as children. I'm well into middle age (over the hill as we say), and childhood is a very distant thing for me, and my childhood was very different from most. In addition I chose early in life to not have children, so I've little experience with them. I'm afraid my version of Harry Potter will always be a bit older than he really ought to be.

I considered writing an authors note, detailing the AU/Divergence points, but felt that was taking the easy way out, and worse, assuming everyone's head-canon is the same as my own.

As an aside, as a child growing up on a farm with a family who deeply loved and cared for my twin and I, I can assure you that Harry's list of chores isn't particularly onerous.

I completely disregarded what this would look like on a mobile device, I'll try to split it up a bit more.

I know this story won't be for everyone, in fact if the most popular stories are any indication of the reader base, I expect a very small percentage of people will read and enjoy it. The story is more of a cathartic release from the many points in the Harry Potter story that irritate and annoy me.

At any rate, again, I appreciate you taking the time, and the advice. And I'm glad the grammar wasn't so terrible as to make the story unreadable.

/Edit - Cavelioness.... are you perhaps an Auel fan?

**** I appreciate your taking the time to write a story for us to read!

I thought about it, and a lot of your problems could be solved by aging your kids up 2 or 3 years. A five-year-old is only a couple of years off being a toddler, and while your list of chores might be fine for an 8-yr-old, the problem with really little kids is that you just can't keep them doing things they don't like for very long by themselves, even if you beat them. They simply don't have the attention span.

I wrote a whole bunch more here about what they can and can't do, but erased it- the simple fact is, your kids don't come off as anywhere near realistic, but if you aged them up to about seven or eight it would be, not perfect, but closer to all right. If you persist in keeping them five, I recommend watching a couple of youtube videos on developmental milestones for that age to get a better feel for it, because currently it is distracting and impedes suspension of disbelief, drawing the reader out of the story.

The story is very readable as far as grammar, all I saw were a few random capitalization and punctuation errors. No one will be dropping it due to poor technical writing, so don't worry about that.

Definitely try to grab people more in the first little bit. Your beginning should dramatic, if possible- picture an announcer reading it aloud in a deep voice and do a paragraph break wherever he would pause for maximum tension, even if this is every sentence or two. Your first sentence, "Harry Potter was five years old when he realized that life was inherently unfair," is a stand-alone, for instance.

As for your edit, you've got me pegged- I was a big Auel fan from ages 12-14, and the name has kinda stuck with me through various online sites throughout the years.

***** I knew it!

Growing up my parent's didn't allow my twin and I to watch television, but did allow us to read anything we wished from both our home and local library. In retrospect they perhaps ought to have been a touch more restrictive, but it did serve to develop a deep and lasting love of reading. I read the first three books in the Earth's Children series (Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of the Horses, and The Mammoth Hunters) during my seventh and eighth years. I was terribly enamored of the wilderness survival aspects of the books, and a bit too young to really be concerned about the fact that towards the end of Valley of the Horses and all through The Mammoth Hunters, that it was effectively smut. Something I was quite aware of when I read Plains of Passage when it was released as I was thirteen by that time.

I'd considered aging the characters up from the beginning, as I have planned for Harry to work hard enough to get into a Public school on scholarship before the arrival of his Hogwarts letter. Sadly, Rowling had her students enter Hogwarts at eleven, as is the normal path for those entering a Comprehensive. I would have Hogwarts begin at thirteen, as do most of the notable Public schools, but while I have designated this story as AU/Divergence, my intention is to alter Harry, and not the world itself (Although obviously his actions will impact others, and through that the world).

</edit>

Alright, you made a very compelling argument, I have written both chapters to accurately reflect the age change, and shoved poor Phil Carmichael up a few years as well. I was stretching it as it was to have him sub 90. I appreciate the time you took to go over this. If I might suggest you have another gander, I have broken things up and done a bit of revision as well. As Stephen King said, "To write is human, to edit is divine".

  AU/Divergence. Harry realizes at an early age that life isn't fair, and learns to overcome the challenges in his life through hard work and dedication to his dreams. Those dreams are horribly derailed by the arrival of an invitation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the discovery that there is world beyond the one he knows, which is apparently just as unfair...

** You need smaller paragraphs, currently it's hard to read, especially on mobile.

To thow some cliches at you. You need to "show not tell" and "be concise". As it stands you infodump Harry's early status at us at the beginning and it's just incredibly boring. Starting just before Hogwarts and throwing some info or flashbacks about how it used to not be that way is one option. Flashing through scenes that show Harry's progressively changing situation is another.

Apeaking of cliches, while I understand that it may serve a purpose here, but checking out all the usual boxes of the "bump abuse level from canon" cliche is annoying.

As it currently stands I would probably pass the fic by while scrolling through FF - the description isn't captivating. And if I actually started the fic, I would drop it after this chapter. There is nothing happening, but cliches are already present.

*** Thank you for the advice, both you and Cavelioness are quite right on the mobile reading bit - after both of you mentioning it, I opened the browser on my phone (for the first time as it turns out, which shows how much of a luddite I am), and dear god. Yes. Wall of text. And I've a pixel 2xl, which has a rather large screen.

I agree the info dump is a bit much, but I ~loathe~ flashbacks. I recognize their validity and purpose as a literary device, however I have a very linear mind, and switching time frames can be an irritant unless done very well, and to be quite frank I don't trust myself to do it well. Hopefully the info dump will help anyone who reads it to align their headcanon with the au/divergence points in the story.

As far as the abuse goes, that single instance is the only time in the story that Vernon will have damaged Harry beyond a spanking. Vernon isn't evil or stupid, just passionate and opinionated. He had a very bad experience with wizards when me met Lily and James, and unjustly carried that over to Harry, as the letter Dumbledore left clearly indicated Harry would be a wizard as well. He got out of control once, and he won't let it happen again. Expect to see a strict, mostly disinterested Vernon.

It sounds like this won't be your cup of tea, but I do thank you for taking the time to read it and provide feedback.

Then use the second option. Jump between scenes. Have readers see what's happening to Harry instead of being told. You could easily cut down that part of the introduction to 1.5-2k words that way, making it more bearable.

I don't mean only that.

See:

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.
#+end_quote

Or

#+begin_quote
  By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera
#+end_quote

Showing that it's being grounded, expect Harry's room is a cupboard. Or:

#+begin_quote
  And you,' he snarled at Harry, ‘you stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  It sounds like this won't be your cup of tea
#+end_quote

Well, it sort of isn't. I prefer muggle aspects of the fic to be minimal. But if the fic is good, I can read stuff outside of my preferred themes and genres.

***** I definitely appreciate you helping make the story more readable, and I've done a bit of revision.

As the story continues, both Harry and the Dursleys will change and see new sides of each other. While Petunia will always resent Harry a bit for being magical, and all that it entails, as Harry changes, she'll soften a bit. Vernon won't ever forget or forgive James and Sirius, and he knows perfectly well that Harry is a wizard. Still, with Harry's changes Vernon will become more lenient in his treatment of him. The biggest change will be Dudley's attitude towards his cousin, which will influence both his parents.

While Harry won't have the warmest, or most loving family, he won't be the attention starved waif from canon. He'll even have his own bedroom soon.

So yeah, the negative aspects of living with the Dursleys will all but disappear.

As much as I'd love to have your continued input as I write or revise, I can totally understand that this isn't likely to be a story you'll enjoy. As the title suggests, I fully plan on having Harry reject (or at least try to reject) the Wizarding world.

Still, I appreciate that you read it and provided excellent feedback and suggestions. Alongside Cavelioness, you have certainly helped me with this endeavor and I am grateful.

*** Thank you for reading the story, and coming back to give me some feedback on it. I know that time is the most valuable thing each of us owns, and I appreciate you spending yours helping me.

When I was young, a family friend (akin to a second father, really) told me that "Specificity is the cornerstone of all communication". I was six years old at the time, and I had to look up specificity and cornerstone in the dictionary. That impactful lesson has only been reinforced over the years I've spent in the IT industry, and the truth is I will always provide rather detailed descriptions.

The conversation issue is something I'm aware of, and am working on. I'm glad you called it to my attention as it is something I struggle with. I tend to write conversations as lectures, rather than back and forth interactions. I'll continue to work with that.

I hope to flesh out Amanda Langham a bit, as she will be relevant to the story for quite some time, as well as Mr. Carmichael as he will appear several more times before Hogwarts, and Harry is quite taken with him.

Again, thank you for taking the time to read it over and provide feedback.
