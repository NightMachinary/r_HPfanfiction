I'm yet to read the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter]] series but I'm already looking for more. I don't know if more like it exists, but essentially what I'm looking for is full on books (like James Potter) which stay true to the original, it can be about anyone in the Harry Potter universe really.\\
I highly doubt anymore people actually wrote entire books but I figured if anyone knows it's probably [[/r/hpfanfiction]], I'm not too familiar with fanfiction myself and wouldn't know where to look.


** See the collected works (80 so far) of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]].

The author only does canon-compatible stories, and they are well worth a look. As it says in his profile, "I appear to be writing several stories. In fact, I'm only writing one."

*** Yeah that's what I'm talking about. However, skimming quickly through it, it doesn't really look like there is a single bigger story to it although he does have a few stories with a lot of chapters, I'll probably read those then maybe later read the other stuff.\\
I'm most definitely looking for longer stories not just a single chapter.\\
Edit: Can you download the stories in PDF format or something from that website?

**** He [[https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&q=northumbrian+harry+potter][cross-posts]] to archiveofourown.org, harrypotterfanfiction.com, thequidditchpitch.org, mugglenet and his own livejournal

I'd say start with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and then, once you're hooked like it's opium, explore the smaller but complete and related stories.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1857084][Hunters and Prey]] is good if you insist on starting with a completed story.

** The collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. Some of it was written before some canon revelations, so it's not perfectly compliant, but it's among my favorites. (I'm working my way through Northumbrian now.)

** I recommend you consider checking out the collected works of [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=473][St. Margarets]]. She has several novel-length stories that are largely canon-compliant (though extend the canon world delightfully) as well as a number of shorter stories. All are of very high quality (for fanfiction).
