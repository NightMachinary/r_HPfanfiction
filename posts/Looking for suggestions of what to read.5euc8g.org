I know there's so much more out there! I do like the longer stories 150k+ M rating preferred but not completely needed I like the pairings of H/Daphne H/Fleur H/Tonks H/Hermione H/Susan H/Multi

So pretty much most of them as long as the story is good! I don't care if the story is cliche or something different I just want it to be a good one!

I know I have the search option but the summaries are not always the best and I know I've read some great stories with summaries that didn't originally get me interested.

Please let me know of any that you think would be good!


** So, I can't give you any specific recommendations (I read mostly slash) but I can give you a tip on finding them. I've found that authors tend to read the same types of stories that they write. I've found this especially true of the more unusual pairings. So if you look through the favorited stories of some of the authors you've read in the past, you're likely to find some good fics :-)

Hope that helps.

*** I second this suggestion. Whether or not a story is "good" is completely subjective and OP's other criteria are entirely too broad (as well as not being what I like to read at all.)

Basically, you've asked for Harry/any darned female you can dig up and long.

** Not sure what you mean by "good" given that you're happy with cliches and harems. In the apparent absence of any kind of standards I will therefore simply link you fics that meet your basic requirements.

Seriously though, you seem to be super well-read in FF. Is there, if you don't mind me asking, objectively good Harry/Fleur? Euphoria isn't good, and I could never get into Dagger and Rose. Most everything else seems to be true trash.

** Are you OK with no pairings? I've got a few I've enjoyed that I can link if so. They're all complete and very long, a couple are over 800k.

linkffn(8045114) is H/Hermione but is rated T.\\
linkffn(8897431) has no explicit pairing but will most likely in the WIP sequel.\\
linkffn(8975202) I believe the pairing is H/OC but is a very minor part in the story

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
