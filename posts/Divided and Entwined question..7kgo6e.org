** There's a definite bias towards Hermione, towards plot over-representation and lack of flaws.

**** You make me smile. I like you. That's just a perfect way to describe it. Don't get me wrong I like his writing, but that is one of the larger issues I have with it. (Along with being needlessly long 600k words??!? Oof)

** It has a lot of Hermione especially at the start but it is Harry/Ron/Hermione as the main characters mostly. [[/u/Starfox5]] wrote it and is on here a lot. Is a big fan of Hermione as a character. It really is an exceptional story I'd definitely reccommend it.

** The trio and Dumbledore are the main characters, but there are several other POV characters.
