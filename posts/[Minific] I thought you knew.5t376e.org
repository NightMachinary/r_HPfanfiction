"Goldstein used Wit-Sharpening-Potion for the exam? That's cheating!", Hermione exclaimed exasperatedly in the Gryffindor common room. Neville and Hermione were the last two students remaining, everyone else was already in their beds.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "What do you mean, cheating?", Neville asked. "That's relatively standard for the 'claws." Hermione looked at him with a look that clearly asked 'Are you stupid?'\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "But it's an unfair advantage!", Hermione said. "Using magic to cheat on the exams." Now, it was Neville's turn to look at Hermione like she was an alien.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "You mean you don't know?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "I don't know /what/?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ Neville shrunk back into his sofa. "I thought you knew." He searched for words, and after a few seconds of silence, he found them. " Hermione, when you grew up, did you notice there was something /different/ about you?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Of course! I had bursts of magic, like everyone. ..."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Besides that?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Well, I was always smart for my age, but that's hardly special."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Yes, it is. I don't know how to tell you, but you probably unconsciously used magic all your life to make you smarter, you see?", Neville said calmly. Hermione's eyes widened.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Am I really? Are you serious? Are others doing that too?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Hermione, to a degree everyone is doing that.", Neville said.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "What about Crabbe and Goyle? They don't seem especially smart. ..."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Well...", Neville snorted, "they don't have much control over their magic to begin with. Ever seen them cast a good spell?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "But can magic really make you more intelligent? I mean, all the time, not just for a potion. ..."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "We had Bowtruckles in care of magical creatures a month ago. Brain the size of a pea, easily intelligent more intelligent than a dog. It's the same with a wizard body's strength, by the way.", he explained. "Have you actually /seen/ a Quidditch match? Bludgers would regularly kill Muggles. ..." Hermione paled at that. "Honestly, I thought you knew. Besides the usual advantages, everyone has his own brand of special inherent magic."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Examples?", said Hermione, almost whispering.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Look at Harry. He is extremely strong-willed, despite everything that has happened to him. Whole school hated him, still did his best against the dragon. He shook of the Imperious, with ease! His magic did that, and adds some good Quidditch skills I suppose. You are obviously making yourself smarter. Probably helping to organize your thoughts with mind-arts. That's why I think your hair all bushy, all the magic in your head." Hermione blushed at that. "Ron obviously uses it for chess, for example. I use it to get a feel for plants, I think. I think the Muggles would call it 'Green thumb', no?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ Hermione was silent, letting the new information sink in.\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Is that why... where all the prejudice comes from?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Partially.", Neville admitted. "Wizards /are/ superior, in some ways." Hermione opened her mouth to defend them. "That does not mean that Muggles are worthless, or we should rule about them. But it's why when Voldemort claimed that Muggleborns steal magic people stood up to fight - stealing the magic of a wizard would be the worst for them! Imagine living without your intelligence. ..."\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "But you don't believe that, do you?"\\
‌‌ ‌‌ "Of course not! Honestly, I thought you knew!"


** I had this idea when I was reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5qt9a9/are_11_year_olds_actually_this_smart_or_was_i/][this thread]] ("Are 11 year olds actually this smart or was I just retarded 11 year old?").

The general consensus was that while 11-year olds can be smart, they are made smarter for books and even more so for fanfiction. So I wanted a nice explanation. And of course, the explanation was easy in the HP universe.

/Magic./

(By the way, I'm very open to any feedback to this fic, be it content, style or grammar)

*** It's certainly an intriguing premise. I do remember seeing another story where the only detail I remember is that Hermione did some accidental magic that rewired her brain and improved it.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** I like that mechanic. You could argue that Crabbe and Goyle have a more physical internal magic, making them stronger and more intimidating.

** It adds an additional layer of horror to those fanfics where someone's magic is destroyed, by bad magical oath or draining machine or whatever.

...Actually, come to think of it, PS 238 has a point where, when someone's superpower is temporarily disabled, their immune system is critically compromised, to the point that they're nearly killed by a common cold. De-magicking someone whose body is used to depending on it could have consequences a lot worse than a drop in IQ.

On a different note: I think I've seen a concept similar to this 'magicals inherently use their magic' before; it was to do with Neville's apparent lack of display of accidental magic, and something about flashy external displays and more subtle internal effects.
