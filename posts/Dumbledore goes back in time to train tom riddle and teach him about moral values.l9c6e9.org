We always see Harry or someother character going back in time ,so why not Dumbledore and a good tom riddle is quite intriguing.


** There is a collection of short stories with sort of like that prompt: "There's Nothing to Fear"

Not time-travel but alternate history in which Tom ends up in Gryffindor and has Dumbledore as a mentor trying to teach him values. He still becomes a radical terrorist though but now he fights for the rights of those oppressed by the Pureblood families.
