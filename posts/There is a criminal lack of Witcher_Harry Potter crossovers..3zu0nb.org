The ones on fanfiction.net are all rather short and the best one is only one friggin chapter. Sorry, I just got witcher 3 and now I really want a good Harry/Cirri fic. I wish I could write.


** Well, I'm currently working on an HP/Witcher crossover, but it takes place some 200 years before the Witcher books/games, meaning no Geralt or Yennefer, let alone Ciri (though people such as Vesemir and Philippa Eilhart make cameos). That, and the fic is more or less done in the vein of The Last Wish/The Sword of Destiny, in that each chapter is really a self-contained short story. Which means it's currently nowhere near release, but I can keep you updated for when I finally finish it, if you'd like.

** Harry/Cirri.. damn you. The worlds don't mesh all that well, Witcher is so very middle ages and Potter so Victorian. But dat pairing..

*** Thought about that one, too - hell, I'd think any sorceress you drop into Harry's world would probably be fascinated (and some, like say Keira Metz (who loves cities, doesn't like the outdoors, being on the road etc.) would probably love it, as our world is much cleaner than the one of the middle ages - our cities don't stink of horse-manure etc. anymore oh and our sewers don't produce mutants either!)

You can't say that and then not give the title / link it!

** Ciri is a dimension jumper, you could easily have scenario where she jumps to hogwarts and then have the story continue from there.

** I dwelled on this after finishing Witcher 3 and reading all the books.

Thought up a few plot ideas but I'm too lazy to put it on paper :(

** Indeed - I have half a mind to write my own (sad thing is: I am not convinced I can pull it off and I don't have a high opinion of myself as a writer), maybe someone wants to adopt my plot-bunny?

Well here's what I thought:

Most crossovers work by dropping Harry into another world (and that's fine, I've read some truly great ones over the years), but how about "we" go at it the other way round - as in:

Drop a character (a sorceress to be precise!) into Harry's world!

Pairing would be Harry/Sorceress (she helps him with his Voldemort problem and he's the one who finds her after she arrives - I thought that an unstable portal (that would explain why some people step into portals an never arrive at their destinations in the witcher world) would be what drops her off)...

Thing is: I'd love to use one of the established sorceresses - making up an OC might work, too (but I myself would probably end up producing a Marry Sue, so I'd rather use an established character...Triss for example works well, as she's unattached (unless your game-canon pairs her off with Geralt - I mean mine does, because I just don't like Yennefer as her relationship with Geralt is a TOXIC one (he's so resigned/whipped when dealing with her and she treats him like a mix of hired muscle, pet and child (meaning she's condescending/treats him like she's superior, bosses him around, doesn't think much of him and his abilities etc. and treats him like he'd be nothing without her) - not to mention that she uses (dangerous - as in possibly fatal!) magic against him in anger (when she portals him into the river when he annoys her, despite being right: After all his infidelity happened in part because he lost his memories (note: I am not saying Geralt is the most faithful bloke ever - far from it, but she ain't the most faithfull woman either!) and it's partly her fault, too because instead of helping him get his memories back she avoided him for years like the god-damned plague!))...still, most people probably chose her, so Triss would be "available"

Keira Metz would work, too (she would probably love the modern muggle world: So CLEAN (she hates the outdoors and doesn't like being in forests etc.) and tidy...she loves cities (and modern ones are cleaner than witcher-cities...no stench of horse-manure etc.))

ps: Sadly most of the existing crossovers have Harry become a witcher - why? I don't know, I mean in their world he'd probably be a source so he's prime material for magical training (in a way it would be a waste making him a witcher!)...hell, their kind of magic (which more or less makes their magic-users immortal and beautiful and doesn't make them depend on wands! - Not that they don't use magical trinkets (swords, amulets, daggers etc.), but they don't really need to!) might heal all the damage his body has accumulated (like stunted growth because of the Dursleys) etc. so no need for mutations
