Looking for Well Written OCs but with conditions

I know that ocs get a bad rap but I was wondering if there were any well written ocs that were believable as characters?

I have some conditions if there are any.

The oc can't be related to anyone in the story. Not unless it's like a Aunt/Uncle or a cousin. It can't be a sister or brother. And the oc can't be a long lost relative.

The OC can't be a part of the Marauder's if it's set in the Marauder's Era. There were only four Marauders, James, Remus, Sirius and Peter. I don't want a fifth oc as a member of the Marauders. They can be friends with the Marauder's, but not a part of the actual Marauder group.

I don't want an oc to have black hair and green eyes like Harry, I'd also rather not have the oc have red hair like the Weasley's. Now the oc can have black hair, I'd just rather not see the oc have black hair along with green eyes, not cool. I also don't want the oc to have crazy hair color like pink, blue, green or whatever. Not believable.

I don't want the oc to have a really weird/random/out there/long name. Something that would fit in the Wizarding World or Muggle world is fine, but not a super long name.

If the oc is paired with anyone I want to see them getting along with people, arguing with people they don't agree with, I want the oc to not see the person that they're paired with as perfect because that's not believable.


** Totally cheating, but...

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** You seem to be mostly describing "main character"-style OCs, but I have quite a lot of miscellaneous OCs as secondary characters in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). They include a new Defence Professor, called Alexander Max; a Boggart-pretending-to-be-human called Maximilian; a snaked called Nettle; and the entire Fudge family (including Cornelius's brother Clifford, his wife Amaryllis, his daughter Clementine, and Clifford's wife Gwen).
