...but /doesn't/ wind up meeting Hermione?

Seems like he can't even stop by the store without running into her...


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), meets your request nicely. Harry never entered magical world, never went to Hogwarts, and never met Hermione personally, [[/spoiler][although Hermione led Dumbledore's Horcrux Hunting team and later defected to Harry's empire.]]

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I don't recall Hermione having much of a role in linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them), but then, while he's hanging around the muggle world /technically/, he's not really remaining a part of muggle society either.

*** Yeah, I don't think any female would get close to that Harry.. not showering unless its raining can give someone an intereting scent.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
