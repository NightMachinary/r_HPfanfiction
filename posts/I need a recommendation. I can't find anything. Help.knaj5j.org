:END:
So, what I want is a fanfiction that goes around Harry's year (3 yrs of difference max) or in his parents years at Hogwarts maybe.

A male oc/reader, but non-binary or not specified I don't mind. Just none that is female. I don't mind if the mc is reborn in someone already in (like Harry, Ron, Hermione, draco, etc) but not any adult ones (snape, Lockhart,etc). It can also just pop out of nowhere like in the train or something.

A fanfiction that isn't abandoned ( or hasn't been updated for years), if finished has at least 50 chapters of decent sized and if still is updating, a least a chapter a week.

Grammatical errors, I don't mind, as long as it doesn't look like a fifth grader wrote it. R-18 or teen rated.

The timeline has to be the same than the books and the movies (no innocent Pettigrew and truly guilty Sirius, etc).

I hope you all have the information necessary, if not just ask. ( also i don't care about the website as long as it's free and safe)
