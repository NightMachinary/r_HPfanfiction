Hey guys, so this is my first post here.

I'm looking for, as the title might suggest, wizard(or witch)/muggle romance fanfics. I'm not particularly stressed about who the characters are, I just want the build up of a wizard/witch and muggle navigating a relationship together.

Nothing less than 40k words please, although I'd prefer 60k+. It doesn't have to be complete, but nothing abandoned either. I need closure.

I've read a few already, Grow Young With Me, Asking for Trouble and a few others that I can't recall the names of, but don't hold back. I welcome any and all suggestions. Thanks!


** Well, Grow Young With Me is probably the first fic that everyone will jump at the bit to recommend, but you've already read it, so the only other one that comes to mind is linkffn(5244417)

** If you're alright with crossovers and slash, there's a really good Sherlock Holmes/John Watson fic where John is Muggleborn and tries to hide it from Sherlock who's a Muggle. ~36000 words across three parts.

  Sometimes, only sometimes, when Sherlock is very far away and absolutely guaranteed not to return for at least three hours, John sits on the sofa and lets the tea make itself. In which John is (reluctantly) a wizard, Mycroft is (apparently) omniscient, and Sherlock is (surprisingly) oblivious.
