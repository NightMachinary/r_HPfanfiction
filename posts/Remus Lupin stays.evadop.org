Remus Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the Harry Potter universe as he was IMO frankly the only good defense teacher and a flawed, but good person and I am sure that this is not such a controversial opinion.

Yet weirdly enough I can't seem to find fics, that either feature him as a protagonist or a secondary character, where the former Marauder somehow manages to defy the Curse placed on his job and stays as a supportive figure for Harry, while the plot of Year 4 and onwards takes place.

Does such a story exist that you would also recommend?


** You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]? After his canon death in DH, Remus gets sent back five years, armed with the knowledge of horcruxes and all the deaths to come. Not completed, but updates are regular.

*** Thank you so much for that link! I thought I recognised the author's name and went to check. Jackpot, this author wrote one of my fav marauder's fics ever: "Darkness Dying". I'd read that in about 2002, lost my bookmarks in August 2003 and have been looking for it ever since. You just made my day.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.

*** I enjoyed that one in the beginning (I read around 11 Chapters), but doesn't he resign anyway like in Canon?

Still, thanks for the recommendation!

** In linkao3(14078862) he works around the curse by not teaching DADA but History of Magic (and teaching duelling to Harry and Hermione, who siblings, Harry has been adopted, on the side).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** I initially thought you meant that he stayed in Harry's life during his time with the Dursleys, and thought about this one-shot (Chapter 2): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784029/1/Two-Tales-The-Seventh-Son-and-The-Wolfmother]]).

I vaguely remember a handful of fics in which he sticks around, but it's usually alongside exonerated!Sirius. Is that something you would be interested in?

  Two short stories of Harry Potter with one question: what if a witch had instead been born a wizard, or vice versa? Male Ginny and Female Remus each star in their own story of a single change and the difference it makes. Canon compliant soft AU, with a single character changing sex and gender in each story.
