:END:
This was an complete work where Harry did not get his Hogwarts letter but received an invitation to a Squib Trade School. The Headmaster there was involved with butterflies, and when each kid joined, they were given a butterfly pendant to help mitigate their magical outbursts.\\
Ron was there but as a girl, and so was Hermione. It ended with them helping the Flamels but turning the stone into a baby whom they gave the Weasley family name to hide her.


** I think you want 'What's that fic?' rather than 'Request'
