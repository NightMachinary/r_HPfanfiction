There is a certain group of hogwarts students that think Harry and Draco would go wel together. Harry, upon hearing about this, goes out of his way to hint at something going on between them and flirt with him (“if that doesn't work out for ya hit me up, Draco”) despite the fact that they hate each other.

This drives Draco insane, because not only does it fuel the fan girls, it's incredibly embarrassing, since Harry *has* to do it in public.
