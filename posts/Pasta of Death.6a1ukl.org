/"I am about to die."/

The snitch clicked open. A tiny little cracked stone fell out and hit the grass.

/The Resurrection Stone,/ Harry thought.

He bent down to pick it up, when a strange cool feeling rippled through him.

/What's going on?/ he thought confusedly. He tried to pick up the stone again, but his hand didn't seem to be obeying him, it was pulling back, moving back to his chest...

Wait. Harry looked closer. His /arm/ was /shrinking/. Both of his arms were disappearing into his body. And the ground was...getting further away?

"Ssserioussly, what'ss going on?" he asked out loud to nobody in particular. At the edge of the forest, one of the dementors turned and looked at the odd voice.

Harry clapped his hands to his mouth...or tried to; his hands were missing, as were his entire arms, and his attempt at movement caused him to only succeed in swaying a little.

VRRRIP!!

/My trousers?!/ Harry thought as he looked down at his.../the heck happened to my legs?/

Like his arms, Harry's legs had...well, they hadn't vanished into his body, to say; rather, they had fused together, and were now elongating, pushing the rest of Harry off the ground as they formed a big, thick, scaly green tail...

Harry blinked, or tried to; his eyelids had apparently taken a holiday.

/No arms, no legs, a big tail...green scales.../ he twisted around with a bit of difficulty, /I'm a giant snake! Did Voldemort trap the Stone somehow?/

Then he realized, his invisibility cloak had fallen off him. And one of the dementors was coming closer to inspect him, judging by the increased chill in the air.

Reflexively, he looked up.

FWHOOPH!

For a moment, he could see the dementor out the corner of his eyes; the instant he focused on it, though, it collapsed on the grass, looking just like an empty pile of dirty grey robes.

Harry just stared at the ex-dementor for a few seconds, before he looked up again, casting his gaze over the other dementors in the forest.

There was a chorus of fwoomphs as dementor after dementor collapsed onto the ground.

Harry not-blinked, /Not a giant snake, a basilisk...huh./

Trying and failing to shrug, settling for flicking the tip of his tail, he slithered into the forest.

--------------

We shall draw a curtain over the very one-sided 'battle' that followed.

--------------

Later on, Minerva McGonagall was carefully leading a blindfolded basilisk-Harry up towards the headmaster's office, using her transfiguration skills to widen the halls and stairways as he went.

Sure, there had been a bit of consternation when a /great big basilisk/ had started slithering towards the castle, but fortunately Harry the human who could sneak snake had translated nicely into Harry the snake who could speak human.

The door to the headmaster's office opened up, and Harry slithered in, to be met by a very /brief/ chorus of cheering.

"Well done, my-oh." the portrait of Albus Dumbledore up on the wall paused and looked very sheepish, "I was /certain/ that part had been mistranslated."

The blindfolded Harry raised his head in the direction of the voice, "Professssor Dumbledore? Do you know what happened to me?"

The painted ex-headmaster sighed, "Well...am I correct in assuming that this transformation occurred when you took the Resurrection Stone out of the Snitch I left you?"

Harry nodded, "I wass jusst about to touch it."

"And at any point prior did you defeat Draco Malfoy, who previously cast the spell that disarmed me the year before?"

Harry thought, then nodded again, "In the Room of Requirement, earlier today."

Unseen to Harry, the portrait nodded, "I see...and that would make you the master of the Elder Wand. So when you were to take the Resurrection Stone without resistance, you became the...well, I'm afraid the old tale about the Deathly Hallows lost something in translation."

Harry grumbled and curled up, hissing quietly to indicate he was still listening.

"You see, the Tale of the Three Brothers, and the other legends of the Deathly Hallows written of by Beedle the Bard, were translated from Gobbledegook. The goblins do love stories about priceless treasures and arrogant wizards getting their comeupperance...but I digress. Knowing Gobbledegook, I once had the opportunity to read the tales in their original language..."

The portrait paused for a full minute, until Harry coughed in an un-serpentine fashion, "Go on, professssor?"

Dumbledore blinked, "I'm sorry, I was lost in thought. Anyway, I discovered, and I thought my Gobbledegook was rusty at the time, that in the original tale, there was no Master of Death...there was instead a Pasta of Death."

There was a deafening silence. McGonagall was silent. Harry was silent. The portraits were silent. A house-elf that had popped in to clean was silent.

Harry finally spoke up, "I'm a ssnake, not sspaghetti, professssor."

"Alas, if it were only so," Dumbledore sighed, "You see, words like pasta and noodles in the goblin tongue have long been used as slang, not for food, but to describe all manner of serpents."

"Ssso..." Harry thought about it, "I got the three Deathly Hallowss, which made me a 'Passta of Death'...and I'm a bassilisk, which iss a ssnake with a deadly gaze...and goblinss call ssnakess noodless?"

Dumbledore nodded, "Yes, Harry, you are the Pasta of Death. You are the Supreme Danger Noodle."

*** What would it be about? Harry relearning how to perform magic without hands or using his eyes?

The goblins learning one of their ancient legends turned out to be true and going to check the validity of all the other stories?

A Harry/Hermione Political!Harry story where basilisk Harry innocently helps Kingsley push through vital reforms, oblivious to the terror he creates in the Wizengamot?

A dementor-cleaning-up adventure where Harry is led around the world to destroy rogue dementors?

A tragedy where Harry laments the loss of his humanity and ability to look into Ginny's eyes (without killing her)?

Voldemort returning and attempting to possess Harry ala Quirrel?

A magical silly war where everyone is trying to capture Harry; the centaurs to fulfill their prophecies, the goblins to /avert/ their prophecies, the Veela to guard their hidden sanctum, another basilisk for a mate, the house-elves to protect Harry from everyone else...?
