So literally yesterday I was on some author's page on AO3 and I swear I saw an interesting Charlus/Charles Potter fanfic and I can't remember it anymore. I remember it being new and the summary was saying smth along the lines of Charles waking up (maybe a coma? surviving Dragon Pox?idk) and being disappointed in the events that happened. I think the main thing was that he was going to take Harry Potter and raise him (yk since he's his grandfather) but i literally cannot remember the name of the fanfic or the author. I know it was on AO3 and it is relatively new. Help?

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
