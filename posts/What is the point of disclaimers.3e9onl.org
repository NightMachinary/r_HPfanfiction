I see disclaimers all the time, and I can't help to think: why are there disclaimers saying that Harry Potter isn't the author's work, yadayadaya..., if it is on a site for *fan*fiction? I mean, obviously you're not JKRowling.

I just never understood the point.


** It's a relic of the old days, back when HP was still being published. We weren't really sure Rowling/Publishers would be okay with it, and in fact some sites/stories were shut down. On top of that, several stories were 'leaked' as the real deal on various torrent/fileshare sites, so it got confusing. The authors who wanted to show more respect to JKR posted detailed disclaimers. Over a decade later we all know it's just fanfiction, and it's not really necessary to disclaim, especially since JKR has given her tacit approval. FFNet required it at first, and iirc still does, but back then there was risk that lawyers would take them down if it wasn't enforced. Now there's next to zero chance of that, so few care any more. Most who do are newer writers who see one or two others do it and don't know the history behind it.

*** Honestly, I don't see anyone doing it any more except for on FFNet- I'm reading a lot of fanfic right now scattered all over the place at FFNet, AOE3, SpaceBattles, SufficientVelocity, etc. and the only time I see a disclaimer is FFNet.

**** If you forgo a disclaimer over at HPFFA it adds a standard one automatically /shrug

** It used to be a rudimentary precaution against someone insane that says you are claiming to be JKR and they try to have your story and account removed. These days its not really needed but people still use them either by habit or because of that one in a billion chance that not having it would get you in trouble.

** People might be still stuck in their ways. Or just really cautious. But yea, for people who've been reading/writing fanfiction for a decade probably just keep doing it

** People use it as an amulet against litigation -- as if Levine Books is going to sue you in particular for five thousand words of Tom Riddle/basilisk smut that you posted on usenet.

It's pointless. Most fanfiction is outright, or at least arguably-with-smart-money-on-the-publisher, illegal -- you need a license to use published characters, settings, etc that aren't from the real world or history or a work that's out of copyright. Harry Potter fanfiction /might/ be legal, since Rowling gave her approval, but it's kind of a grey area. Adding in two lines about how you don't intend to violate anyone's copyright doesn't affect the legality. It /might/ help you avoid heavier damages that you would be liable for if they could prove that you willfully and deliberately violated their copyright, but it's pretty flimsy for that.

(Copyright is interesting in that it can cover both an actual work and the worldbuilding within that work. Generally you can get away with copying someone's entire world but renaming everything, though, as long as you're not copying text.)

Also, when you see someone saying they own the parts they came up with? I'd not be so certain about that. From what I've read about with the US copyright system, you don't have any copyright for an infringing work. That means if you write HP fanfiction, then I take it and change all the names to produce a non-infringing version, you would have a hell of a time trying to extract damages from me.

I would argue that this isn't true. Fanfiction is dubious in the US, yes, but the vast majority of fanfiction out there pretty convincingly constitutes fair use -- meaning it's not for profit, it doesn't deprive the creator of income, they're not intended to substitute the original, and they actually offer what amounts to free advertising for the original. Where it gets sticky is when people try to make money off their fanfiction, that's when it's pretty clear that it's infringement unless you can successfully argue that it is parody or criticism.

Outside the US, a lot of countries are more lenient -- I'm pretty sure fanfiction is straight up legal in the UK. Even in the US, though, the vast majority of fanfiction authors could not be successfully sued, even if the original creators wanted to, which most do not. The ones who do have problems with fanfiction take it up with the sites themselves, and I don't think there's a ff site out there that hasn't taken down works at a creator's request, which protects them. The only people who get successfully sued are the people who try to publish their fanfiction.

** It's a protection against legal repercussions the owners could try to bring against writers by claiming they were claiming to be the writers. I may be wrong, but I think ff.net and some other sites require that there be a disclaimer.
