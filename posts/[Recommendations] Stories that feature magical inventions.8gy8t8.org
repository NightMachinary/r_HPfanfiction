For example how Fred and George came up with the Wheezes

Or perhaps how the new generation of witches and wizards are able to make gadgets work inside highly magical areas

Even something like Percy creating a new type of cauldron based on all his research about cauldron bottoms thickness

I'll start off by posting this story of how a smartphone equivalent was developed based on Sirius' communication mirrors:

  The Mirrorphone, the latest advance in Wizarding communications. Now, of course, everyone seems to own one. The kids seem to be incapable of living without the device. How did it happen? Who was responsible for the design? To find out we must return to the year 2000.

** In my current story, Lily and Remus invented those communication mirrors and they were put on the market after the first war to become basically cell phones with an Unbreakable Charm on them. Haven't named them in the story yet, but considering calling them LGs, or Looking Glasses. Figured Lily, being a Muggleborn, and to a lesser extent Remus as a half-blood might get a laugh out of making a reference to a Muggle story about a magical world.

Also, Moody invented magical rods to track nearby Apparition/Disapparition points, which Dumbledore coined the "Dumble-Dowsers".
