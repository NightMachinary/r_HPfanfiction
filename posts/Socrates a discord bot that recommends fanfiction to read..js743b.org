I've made a bot that reads favourites from your profile on fanfiction.net and recommends stuff for you to read.

Features:

- long recommendation lists scrollable with emoji
- can read full profile while creating recommendations(past 500 favs limit)
- can ignore fandoms and fics and hide them from stuff recommended to you
- has a mode to show fresh recommendations instead of top ones
- can roll random fics from recommendations for you to read
- can limit wordcount of displayed fics, filter out dead fics and show only completed ones
- can show recommendations from exact fandoms and crossovers you want

You can check the bot in #botspam on [[https://discord.gg/dpAnunJ][my discord server]] or invite it to yours with this [[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742050608235937916&permissions=337984&scope=bot][link]].

To start the bot on your server:

- issue !permit on the channel you want it to answer on (you need to be an owner or an admin),
- issue !prefix new_prefix to set a prefix you want the bot to use. So for example if you want the bot to answer to commands starting with ~ instead of ! you will need to say /!prefix ~/

The rest of the commands you can see with !help. (obviously with the chosen prefix instead of !)

If you have problems with the bot, ping me on my discord server from the link above.


** Nice bot :D\\
I just tried it out and found a few good fanfics!\\
The help "menu" is also really good explained, found everything really easy to understand.\\
Thanks for the work!

*** If you favourite them now, remember to user !recs >refresh ID

This will regenerate the recommendation list with more fics. The effect of refresh is bigger the smaller your favourites list is.

***** !fresh isn't quite the same as >refresh :) see the command that the bot suggested to you above the list. !fresh just changes the sorting, it doesn't update recommendations

** Just a heads up: to whoever used "!prefix new_prefix" literally, you're supposed to replace /new_prefix/ with something that you want to use instead of !. if you don't just say /new_prefix !/ and it will revert back to !.

** Just tried this out and I have to say I'm impressed.

OP hasn't just posted a list of fics which are considered good for the fandom you follow most. It actually recd me fics which I downloaded/read but never got around to marking as favorites.

The menu is quite simple to use and OP is available if still there's any issues.

all in all great place to search for fics instead of sifting through muck.

** Good work. Messed around with it a bit. Should probably add more favorite fics on ffn to mark things I like so I can get more recommendations, though :P

*** No, this is a /discord/ bot that recommends fanfics. You need to either join my discord server through the link in the OP to use it , or invite it to your own discord server.
