Hey guys,

I'm having a really, really hard time this holiday season and I was looking for some fanfiction to make things easier on me. I love fics like "harry potter and the boy who lived", where harry takes a slow, hard road to being great wizard and unlock the secrets of magic. The problem is that many (most?) Of these fics, including the above, the ectomancer, forging the sword, the forest of valbone, etc etc etc get abandoned just at the point where harry comes into his own. Any fics that use this device, do it well and are completed? To be clear, I want where harry studies and earns his powers, not where he is gifted them for some reason. Also, I say harry here, but one if my favorite " in process" fics so if there are fics where hermione, Ron, Ginny, etc etc does this and we follow them, that'd be fine.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Emperor) is one of my favorite reads. Not necessarily unlocking the secrets of an academic sense, but all of his achievements are earned, and it really is an amazing read.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** The story isn't "complete", but the first two arcs or so are. Go ahead and read it, think of it like reading two books in a series still being written. It's /really good/.

*** Harry is literally able to transform into a Bone-Wyrm and fight against powers beyond mortal comprehension within the first 8 or so chapters.... That doesn't sound like a long slow road to power.

**** He gets his ass kicked though. He learns more magic and gains more power as time goes on, such as the Words of Power.
