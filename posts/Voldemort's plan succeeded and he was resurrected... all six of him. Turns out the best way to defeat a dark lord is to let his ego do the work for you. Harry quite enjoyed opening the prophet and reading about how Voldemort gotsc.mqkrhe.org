** Ooh I went this route in my series. This and Riddle sort of went mad by it being a ghoul double of Harry instead of the real Harry in the graveyard thanks to my oc. (In my story ghoul blood in potions lead to insanity and my oc set him up to lose his mind)

***** The use of the word "your" is too confusing. The first one I easily autocorrected in my head to "her" but the following "your"s is just confusing.

#+begin_quote
  One night, every one of Voldemort's horcruxes suddenly become human, and none of them know why. Not knowing whether they're still immortal or not, they seek each other out and try to find out what exactly happened, whilst in the meantime casually dominating the wizarding world and being very weird.
