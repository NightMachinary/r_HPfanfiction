What the title says

Right now I'm using Mary as a placeholder, though I'm leaning towards Heather.


** Chocolandra Cole - Make her black to get a million reviews calling you racist.

Cherry Cole - "Hello, my name is Cherry Cole, a... " to get that sick sponsor cash!

Chrystal Cole - Make her a retired stripper or same as before. This time make her super old and have her tell people that if they drink her juices(made by her personally, wink, wink) they are gonna get sick. That related youtube video of the guy drinking ass old crystal cola and projectile vomiting can be your inside joke. Encode that youtube link into her first monologue!

*** I HAVE OPINIONS ON THIS

...

GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES TO FORMULATE SAID OPINIONS

--------------

EDIT: After mulling over said opinions, I have to go for Doris. It's a good, solid name.

**** I could see her as a Mary. Something unglamorous but respectable. Or maybe that's just because I feel as though Mrs. Cole could have been Catholic.

***** She could have been, and Mary is a safe, solid name for any era. She could also be an Edith. I could see Edith.

****** The more I think about it the more I think her being catholic (and possibly having a catholic name) kind of makes sense. She runs an orphanage and even though she's not a nun, they tended to be more closely associated with Catholicism. She's tough, sharp, and strict, and she takes charge in a no-nonsense sort of way.

******* This is true. No matter what name she gets, it would have to be befitting her firmness of character.

God, Mrs. Cole was so robbed.

******** Yeah, sorry about that. ;)

Though she didn't do too badly for a muggle character who only appears in one scene.
