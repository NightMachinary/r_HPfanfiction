Idk how many soccer/football fans there are in the sub, but West Ham United are incredibly competitive in the Premiership for the first time in a looong time and are competing for fourth place and a Champion's League spot. I'd love to see a funny little bit about Dean talking the ear off his kids or his Hogwarts friends about this but all of them being very confused.


** Reminds me of this scrap of mine

--------------

The first Saturday after the first full week of classes, Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the common room after breakfast to find Dean Thomas standing in front of a television and couch, not unlike the Dursley's den. An olive drab box was beside the television, and on it Harry noticed an electrical outlet, which Dean then connected the television to.

Ron asked "What is that thing?"

Dean said "It's a television. It's, um, what muggles use to see moving pictures. I'm trying to get it to work so I can watch football."

Ron's eyes went wide, "You can watch sports on it?"

"Yeah, and I've been missing out for two years! You know how mad it is to wait for results by owl?" Dean attached the antennae and with a deep breath, pressed the power button. The television came on, showing BBC Scotland on 1.

"Get in!" cheered Dean.

"That's very impressive, Dean." Said Hermione, adding, "but how did you get it to work?"

Dean said "Well, we always hear about electrical devices not working here . . . you ever think part of that is because there's no power?"

Hermione covered part of her face with a hand and sighed.

Harry was also curious, "So you've got magic electricity?"

Dean gave a half-shrug-nod, "Yeah, kind of. You remember me enchanting all those batteries last year?"

Harry did, "Oh yeah. You've got batteries in that box?"

"Yeah. The ones I made last year? I took them home, they worked all summer, no trouble. So my step-dad helped me figure out what kind of batteries the television needed and we got it all wired up. Yesterday Flitwick - did you know he knows loads about electrical engineering? - he made sure everything was proper. I used the same spells put on quidditch balls."

"That's brilliant," said Harry.

Ron was /transfixed/.

** Spurs fan here. Why would you do this to me? I get enough IRL.

Edit: Also, I would be sorely disappointed if there isn't any JLingz appreciation

*** Lol as a Man U fan I need Spurs to not make Europe so I can read about Harry Kane moving all summer only for us to buy Patrick Bamford or DCL.

P.S. JLingz appreciation is a necessary component! It's a real pity that his best position is the same one as the best player on our team, he's loads of fun to watch
