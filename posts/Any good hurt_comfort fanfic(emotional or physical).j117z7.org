I prefer non-shipping stuff. Ideally Harry, the twins, Ron, Draco, Remus, or Sirius as the mc. Thanks!


** I think these fit your criteria. This series is really good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]].

I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

  Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts after a year abroad as an exchange student at Durmstrang. He missed the Triwizard Tournament, but not Voldemort's attempt to kidnap him. After overcoming the Dark Lord once again, Harry is looking forward to getting back together with his friends (both from Hogwarts and the ones he made while at Durmstrang) and enjoying a normal year at Hogwarts. But when has anything ever been easy or normal for Harry?This is a continuation of Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor and Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang written by BrailleErin. Hegemone joins BrailleErin to write Harry's 5th year.

  Sequel to Sword of Gryffindor. Blind Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts for his fourth year but gets more than he bargained for. AU. Those who asked for a sequel, you got it!

  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.

** Well, it's not focus on those characters, but Draco is someone who will matters to the MC of the story (not the romantic way) from the second part of the story.

It's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4294544/1/Always-In-Your-Shadow-Calista-Snape-Volume-I]]

There is two others volumes, Draco will appear in the second tome, though he will not be a protagonist, but what is do with him have far more weight on the MC than any of the others characters you ideally want.

But anyway, this story is great (and i want to talk of it with someone).
