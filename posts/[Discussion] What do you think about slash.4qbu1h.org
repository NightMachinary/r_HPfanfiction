I've noticed a lot of people here ask for no slash fics. The most common reasons I see are that "Harry doesn't seem gay/bisexual to me so it's unrealistic" and "I'm not gay, so I don't want to read about a gay pairing". I also know people tend to avoid it because the general quality tends to be low and I totally understand that.

As somebody who likes slash, I was curious to get the opinions of those who don't. To those who feel slash involving Harry is unrealistic,

1) Would you read about a canonically gay character like Dumbledore?

2) Would you read about a character whose sexuality is not specified in canon like Sirius or Oliver Wood?

3) Would you read a fic where Harry or another straight character shows interest in both guys and girls?

To those who simply don't want to read it, would there be a situation where you may want to? For example, if the fic was not based around the romance and had a great plot otherwise (I know that's less common in the world of fanfiction, but as a hypothetical).

Feel free to add any other opinions you have. For the record I am a lesbian and I like fics between any genders (not saying anyone else has to, of course).

I think this is a misconception about slash and I am not sure why people have this opinion. When comparing slash to het, I think it's true that the /average/ slash quality is lower (especially the sex scenes). But I'd argue that the best slash is better than the best het - at least that I have read. I read all pairings and have read some of the "best" fics for a variety of het pairings and time and time again my favorite fics are slash. In fact, the only het fic in my all time favorites list is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404/chapters/2266336][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]].

Side note - I think there are plenty of gen fics that are better than the best slash or the best het and you will see those recommended on this sub all the time. But if we are talking ship-centric fics, the best slash is much better quality.

*** I actually think average quality is probably equal, there are just fewer slash fics, and so even the terrible ones tend to be more visible/well read than the horrible het stories.

There are also some rather (in my mind) strange tropes that seem to have flourished in the slash community, which outsiders may find diminish story quality

I will agree that some of the best stories I've read are slash however!

Oh, and can we discuss the lack of lube invovled in slash? Like, do the writers exclude it bc it's not sexy or bc they lack a general knowledge of how the anus works? At least throw in a made up lube spell or something.

** I'm queer, so I read slash ... in *other* fandoms.

For whatever reason, m/m pairings in the /Harry Potter/ fandom tend to grate on me. A large majority of them seem to be poorly written, poorly researched excuses to smash together characters the writer finds hot, very often with "the wizarding world hates gays" for extra drama, (despite there being no evidence of such a sentiment in canon). There are also a lot of yaoi cliches, to say nothing of mpreg.

Of course, the "poorly written & researched" thing could apply to f/m relationships as well in this fandom, although to a slightly lesser degree. (Since fanfiction writers largely skew female, it's little wonder that fanfiction as a whole might have more insight on f/m than m/m purely due to demographics.)

On the other hand, f/f tends to be rarer and is usually either utter fantasized trash or written with heart and knowledge, so /HP/ femmeslash is of more interest to me than slash purely because it has a better chance, percentage-wise, of not being shit.

I do find it hard to believe that Harry is flat-out gay. So, to answer your questions OP:

1) Yes, but I've read fics where Dumbledore's sexuality plays a large role and I have been largely unimpressed. So.

2) Sure, if the writing doesn't suck.

3) A bi/pansexual Harry is the only way I'd buy him being interested in dudes. Canon!Harry is too keen on ladies for me to read him as being secretly gay throughout the series. And I can't buy him finding Snape or Draco Malfoy attractive. Ever.

*tl;dr* Too many slash fics seem to be about "gay characters" instead of "characters who are gay." There is a difference.

  "Harry doesn't seem gay/bisexual to me"
#+end_quote

23 September is Bi Visibility Day. Bisexual people may not be visible on other days and are likely to be camouflaged if they are visible, making it difficult to identify them.

Harry's Invisibility Cloak is an allusion to this fact.

#+begin_quote
  To those who feel slash involving Harry is unrealistic
#+end_quote

...why is it so much less realistic to have him be queer in an AU fic than, for instance, to have him be a serial time traveler? Or a preternatural genius with Runes? Or to travel to an alternate universe and take the place of a version of himself who served as Voldemort's Dark Knight? Or Harry suddenly deciding to stop being passive/reactive after five full books of it and suddenly be proactive and studious?

It's not.

#+begin_quote
  I've noticed a lot of people here ask for no slash fics.
#+end_quote

I'm not keen on most of the options.

On the male side: Harry Potter / anyone has the problem that it includes Harry Potter. Sirius / Remus? Don't really like Sirius's style. Intergenerational? Eww. Dumbledore? I've got a start to a fic on my hard drive where he's married with children. Seamus and Dean don't interest me much for some reason. I could go for some Regulus Black / OC, or Regulus / Remus possibly. Or Oliver Wood / Percy Weasley.

Hermione / ... well, there aren't really that many female characters in the series who are that prevalent. Hermione / Ginny doesn't quite work in my mind. Hermione / Fleur is a possibility, as is Ginny / Fleur, but the age gap doesn't please me. Hermione / Luna has potential, as does Luna / Ginny. And now we're mostly out of characters with any appreciable screen time. Lavender is the next candidate, and Rowling worked to make her seem annoying.

On the adult side, we have the professors. McGonagall could have a pleasant, quiet relationship, I think, that devolves into drunken tittering, but the only candidates with any characterization are Trelawney and Bones. McGonagall / Bones is a possibility, though I think the age gap there is over a decade...they're within the half plus seven range, probably.

I should trawl through FFN and AO3 for some of these pairings.

*** I agree with the second part of what you said, about the changes in personality I see him get in many fics (esp dark Harry fics). But I'm curious as to how you arrived at the first part about the cloak. Do you think Harry feels invisible? I think he's the opposite. He doesn't like all the attention or the fact that everyone loves or hates him. Perhaps if he were written in canon to feel invisible or if he were written as bisexual, I could see it working, but as he is I'm not seeing the same thing you are.

As a reader who tends towards romance fic/ fic with a romantic sub-plot, the only stories I avoid are those where the main relationship is a lesbian one. As a straight female I think it's just because I find it very hard to see other women in a romantic/sexual capacity.

Of course, Harry and a grown up, post war Draco is fine by me, or Sirius and Remus, or Dumbledore and who ever; but the real reason I don't read much slash is because I'm a lesbian, and I like pairings to include at least one woman if I can't get two, although I'm more than willing to finish a good story that turns out to be slash.

Personally I prefer those romance fics where it is slash because Harry (or anyone else) likes another character in a regardless-of-gender way, and not because Harry is gay so goes on a hormonal craze to shag every male in sight sorta way.

**** Some people are just uncomfortable with it. For the rest of the readers though (I'm referring only to people who /really/ like reading and /really/ like Harry Potter, not the majority of random people), I do honestly think it's the writing quality that makes the difference.

For example, I'm a heterosexual female and I usually read het and male slash pairings. I don't have any particular fondness for lesbian pairings in ff and I certainly wouldn't go looking for them when I'm searching for fics - partly because I'm not inclined that way myself, I don't really understand why say Hermione would choose to go out with Pansy when Draco is readily available, and so reading about lesbian pairing romance is something I would have relatively more difficulty empathising with. This would be why when requesting for fic recommendations, it is possible that I might say "no female slash", especially because I'm such casting a wide net. However, if I were reading a fic that was /very/ well-written with a great plot that I like, and the main character just happened to be bent in that particular direction, the pairing itself would not stop me from reading the rest of such a good fic. It wouldn't be enough to convert me because I would still not like reading lesbian ff in general, but it would not stop me from *enjoying* reading that one very good fic. If I were someone who was uncomfortable with the idea of lesbian sex, then if the fic does not go into any explicit details of sex scenes, I can avoid conjuring any explicit images in my mind and probably overlook anything I am particularly uncomfortable with.

Does this make more sense at all? Of course the above is just one example, and really applies to any and all pairings. If someone only likes Harry with Ginny, then reading Harry/Hermione would probably make them also feel really uncomfortable, but if the writing and fic is good enough (and if the reader is a true reading addict) then odds are they'll keep reading the fic - this usually happens to me whenever I read a new pairing. I distinctly remember feeling really weird the first time I read LM/SS and CW/HP fics, and I won't go looking for more of those pairings, but that doesn't stop a good fic from being a good fic. Of course, that's just my personal opinion, and if someone just really doesn't like slash, then there's probably no hope of persuading them.

** I read all good fics with my favorite character in them no matter what pairing it is. For me, I don't care if it's slash or femme slash or m/f fiction. If Harry is gay or bi in fiction, it's OK, even if he isn't (or not that obvious) in canon. After all, it's fanfiction. We already have AUs and dark!Harrys fem!Harrys and many more other tags different from canon. So why can't some characters being gay?

** I just don't care about romance shit unless I specifically like the ship. It's all het ships so I wouldn't even bother looking up slash or femmeslah pairings. Maybe because I'm a straight male, I just can't emotionally connect with homosexual relationships. Moreso with canon hets turned into homosexuals to satisfy an author's wants. I can read a story with gay characters, but never if the main story thread is the slash relationship. It's not PC to say, but I will not enjoy it. I don't think even actual gay men read slash written by teenage girls. Women just have more range in stuff they enjoy. 'Straight' girls who only favorite femmeslash stories. Lesbians who write Harry having a harem. Yeah. Sometimes I wouldn't even bother with het romance if I despise the pairing like Draco/Hermione or Harry/Fleur.

** I really like femslash, but I can't stand to read slash, unless it is *firmly* in the background, even if the story is otherwise amazing.

If I've asked for "No slash", I meant "No m/m slash"; I'll make sure to qualify that from now on.

The only slash I would read is in the Harry/Hermione/Ron context.

** I'd read slash that doesn't focus on romance and doesn't ship something ridiculous like Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape and disgusting shit like that. Never found anything (that isn't marauder-era, I hate it), though, let alone something good.

**** Let me please say that if I look at the books and really take them where they are without making quantum leaps in logic, I cannot imagine Draco with Harry, (or Draco with Hermione, for that matter) but I have written both myself, so I think it's possible to be of two minds about it. I really don't think JKR got her own books wrong.

I'm afraid I won't touch Harry/Snape, but that is due to my discomfort with the power and age differential. I used to be a teacher, and I absolutely cannot go there in my head. Anyway.

But back to Harry. When I wrote him as gay, I didn't assume he'd suppressed it; rather, I made heterosexuality an unnatural trait, like innately knowing Parseltongue, that vaporized the moment Voldemort died. I confess I don't consume nearly as much as I write, (and there are probably hundreds of problems with that if I were a serious writer in training---another thread) but this loophole has to be used by others; I cannot imagine I am the only one who has done so.

****** As a Snape/Harry fan, I'd also like to point out that the impediments to the pairing, the issues surrounding it, are what make it appealing to some of us. The hostility and fucked-up history can be part of the draw. Foeyay and enemy or hero/villain ships are both terms coined to describe a narrative attraction to relationships that thrive on antagonism or "wrongness." Snape/Harry is messy and full of bad blood, and even if Snape matures enough not to be an arsehole 24/7, he's still a damaged person and he always will be. That's what makes it interesting.

As for Lily - I wrote a fic in reaction to the Lily reveal, both because I needed to figure out how to incorporate the news into my longstanding Snarry preference and because the almost incestuous tension their backstory introduces into the mix was great material for a fic. It's dramatic, is what I'm saying, and fiction thrives on that.

  Are you going to say that those fics shouldn't exist either?
#+end_quote

Unless they can convincingly explain away the problematic bits they should at least specify that it's an AU or write it as porn without much plot. I don't mind that these fics exist I just won't be reading them unless they come with some really strong recommendations.
