It was one of what-happened-in-Hogwarts-during-the-reign-of-Carrows stories, and one of the characters was Romilda Vane, who was a Gypsy/Roma (from the itinerant family). She was one of characters not the main one, but she was more or less positive character in the end, and she died in The Battle (where she was quite effective, because Roma magic was completely unexpected and incomprehensible for Death Eaters). Her family comes with their wagon and take their body with the kind resignation of “that's how it always ends when we mix with Gadjos”.


** That sounds like Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness. There was a whole bunch of clumsily handled, borderline racist ethnic magic in it, and I remember Romilda being Roma.

The author has removed his story but it's still floating about somewhere.
