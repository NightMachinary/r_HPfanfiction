Personally I never quite understood how Harry ended a (relatively speaking) well adjusted protector of the people.

Yeah, him siding with Voldemort is extremely farfetched, but with his live pre and during Hogwarts, plus him seemingly not to have anyone he cares about at the muggle world and the average mentality of teenagers I could honestly see him just ignoring Voldemort for the most part or going along for friendship obligations (like when you are friends with an activist pro-save-the-whales, you agree with the person that whales should be better protected, will go along in protests if they insist enough and you can't find a acceptable excuse, but in the end of the day this is just a fight you don't really feel that strongly about) rather than feeling he should be proactive and in the center of the fight.

For all that authors generally focus on the “save muggle(-borns)” bit of the fight revenge just seems more believable.


** Canon Harry would never allow such a sadistic genocidal monster murdering and torturing innocents at will.

And for Harry personally, it's "My name is Harry Potter. You killed my parents, prepare to die!"

*** Realistically though, cannon Harry would have absolutely no reason personally think himself responsible for stopping Voldemort though. Yeah, it sucks that a maniac genocide is slaughtering a nation, but we see it in real-life frequently and don't really feel any obligation of stopping the dictators. Harry has absolutely no real reason to bother defending the muggle-born population as a whole or the muggle world. Would make much more sense for a teenager to just not bother. The revenge reason kind of makes more sense, but then again many other people had the same reason to oppose Voldemort.

**** Harry wants to kill Voldemort as revenge for for all the evil he has done, Dumbledore literally confront him with it when Harry claims he only does it because of the prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  "But, sir," said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---"

  "Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!"

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it."
#+end_quote

He doesn't think he is responsible, he just wants to kill him.

** Can you imagine growing up with Malfoy around and not wanting to lift up muggles and muggle borns out of sheer spite?

He also idolized his mom, who was muggleborn.

He must have had one or two nice teachers and students who were nice until Dudley got to them. Or at least witnessed them being nice to each other.

Just fully recognizing muggles as human puts him ahead of even the Weasleys, who had no issue buying Ron "Martin Miggs, the mad muggle"

** I wouldn't disregard the friendship angle though - Harry is friends with Hermione and since she's muggleborn Voldemort's “agenda” affects her directly (especially after CoS, when they see the effects of TR attacking muggleborns). IMO that has to play a role in his defense of muggle(-borns) - maybe not to the extent you're talking about, but I feel like this alone would be enough to move from total indifference towards the issue and towards defending muggles and muggleborns.

** It's understandable. Voldemort is like...a crazy magical racist trying to genocide the muggleborns away. Yeah, there are always those who turn a blind eye to that sort of thing but that's not in Harry's character. Furthermore, his mom was muggleborn, Hermione is muggleborn, etc. Can you imagine a half-Jewish person not caring about the Holocaust or a Black man with white dad/black mom turning a blind eye to the KKK in his neighborhood?

*** Not ignoring, no. That's not really what I was talking about. By all means his character is one that would take offense at Voldemort's actions. What I was saying is that I don't think it is believable that he would take the fight against Voldemort as something so important on account of protecting the muggle-world (as in, if Voldemort was only really interested in screwing over muggles then Harry -based more in the real-life psychological expectations with the experiences he had during his life rather than how he does act in cannon- should realistically be rather uncaring about Voldemort (like I said at the post, while he probably would think it is wrong and wouldn't side with Voldemort it just wouldn't really be a fight he feels strongly about). Making use of your example I would say that it would be like a descent white guy hearing about KKK's actions in another city, he would know it's wrong, he wouldn't support it, maybe he would even talk against it with other people, but in the end generally he also wouldn't feel the need of going around the country hunting KKK's members, even if someone had told him that he was the only person capable of stoping the damn racists for some reason.

**** I get your point. I think "feels strongly about" is what is throwing me off. For example, Harry could feel very strongly that Voldemort was a monster, that he was committing genocide, and yet....recognize his parents gave up their life for him to live (not to die as a teenager) & that he was still a kid while far more qualified grown ups needed to step up. Therefore, he might bounce. I don't think he'd let the Dursleys bad behaivor impact how he felt about muggleborns/muggles, though.

TLDR: Basically, he'd care a lot but not necessarily feel a need to "risk his life"...esp. as no one but Figg basically checked in on him growing up.

***** Pretty much, yeah. I for example like whales and polar bears and think they should be better protected, doesn't mean I'm going to personally go around decapitating fishers/hunters that prey on them. With feel strongly what I mean is that it's something so important to the person that they just can't stand doing nothing about it or just cheering on the side-lines.

*** It wasnt Voldemort who sent him to the dursleys tho that was Dumbledore, it wasnt voldemort who imprisoned his rightful guardian without a trial, that was again dumbledore who again iirc was the chief of court at the time.

Harry was a victim of everyone, voldemort killed his parents and the ministry with Dumbledore did the rest

***** Harry was never meant to go to the dursleys tho, he was always meant to be raised by Sirius if something happened.

You can Argue it was for his own protection, but it still overrode the wishes of both james and lily.

Dumbledore had the chance to purge the ministry right after tom was 'dead', but instead he allowed it to fester without using mind magic or verataserum to verify facts.

******* 1. Not gulty untill provrn guilt
2. Grief acts diffrent for all pepole, Sirius had just seen his brother in all but blood dead, his wife and refused access to his godson. Tries to catch the person responsinle only to be caught off guard.
3. Muggles who dosent know the whole story, and a bunch of wrongly explained explotion, had Peter died there woulf be more pices than a clean cut finger to be found.
4. Dont blame Sirius, they could have had a check for the dark mark, Albus could of asked for unbreakable wows and so on.

Sirius was destroyed by the corrupt ministry that didnt even bother to give him a trial.

Dumbledore made mistakes he could of easily fixed, but hes a flawed man who only left another dark lord when rhey entered a deadly duel and Ariana died.

********* Dumbledore knew about the dark mark, it would have been easy for him to visit Sirius in prison, check his arms and then try and get questions on why a perwon who was abused by his family would turn to the sife that abused him as a child. It dosent make sense, Dumbledore should of been more vigilant.

*********** Im trying to point out that he is a flawed character that was overwhelmed, when the freakin minister dosent know about the dark mark its hard to be effective.

Bottom point is exactly, book 1-4 Dumbledore dosent fit with later books because the audience matured, so Dumbledore is a victim of inconsistent writing.
