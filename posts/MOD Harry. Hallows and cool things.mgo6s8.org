I'm really interested in a Master of Death Harry fic at the moment. I don't want it to be just a title though. If Harry collects all the Hallows and no cool shit happens I'll be very sad.

I am looking for things more along the lines of Super!Harry. Like he collects them all and Death is his buddy now, Harry can't die, he can do crazy wandless magic and just a huge assortment of wacky shit now that he's the MOD.

Even things like becoming lord peverall or lord death or something like that. It can be semi-serious or cracky, I'm fine with either.

Thank you in advance❤️

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I welcome you to my [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hhzXz1gjLoTW0QMNPqdwcpUj0QuOrZ5IdEYoyXDwtvE/edit?usp=sharing][MoD(or something like that)!Harry collection]]! Pick what you like.

First of all, I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/pseuds/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/series][The Carnivorous Muffin]]'s works. They are divine. A blessing to mankind.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321][October]], for example. Want somewhat other-worldly mod!Harry who speaks in riddles? Tom realizing that not only muggles suck but the whole humanity sucks? What about creating a new country ON MARS? It's really amazing. The prose and the plot will leave you blown away, I promise. Harry is Death.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]. A very popular and interesting fic with a gripping plot. Actually, it's the only fem!Harry fic I enjoy reading. Canon male Harry is still there - he's Death of another universe while Lily is Death of her universe. Lily often commits suicide to go chat with him on King's Cross.

Some light reading for now:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5380610][2Spooky]] - a nice little one-shot where Harry is the Grim Reaper.

Some creepy/spooky post-effects of death (I love them. I wish there were more fics with such a take on Harry's death):

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25986037][And Finished knowing--then--]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26606122/chapters/64870780][Liminality]] - He talks with the dead using the Stone a lot. It's very good. We need more fics like that. Auror!Harry is very good here. He's 23 and he's a senior auror. The department is understaffed and most of them +are stupid+ don't really know how to investigate. Harry also knows a lot about necromancy, it's his hobby (a valid hobby considering Voldemort's existence)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27309070/chapters/66723580][All Men Kill The Things They Love]] - Harry can't die. Everyone he loves is dying. The Elder Wand speaks. Everything is creepy and marvellous. There's absolutely no romance in this. It's grim and interesting. I really liked the atmosphere in this. And this Harry - determined in his mad quest and so very calm because of it. The culmination and the ending... Wow. Just wow.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  "... The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky... Some say---""It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead."---Pirates of the CaribbeanThe Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs.Or...The one story where Gellert Grindelwald takes a leaf out of Gru's book and adopts a kid despite being a former Dark Lord with no parenting skills whatsoever... And of course the kid is none other than Hadria Potter, who unintentionally drives him up the wall for all of three years. (After those three years, an increasing number of people are being driven up the wall, including Gellert, but it's totally intentional by now).
