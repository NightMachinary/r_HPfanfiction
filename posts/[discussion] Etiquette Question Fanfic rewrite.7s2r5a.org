** Why don't you ask the original author for permission first?

** I'd say the better way to learn to write is to start small - just write scenes or vignettes, and work up to longer stuff. Accept that the first ones will suck - everyone sucks at first.

** That seems very very rude and inappropriate to steal someone else's work and then just start changing it for yourself? Are you going to ask them if you can do that? If they say no, will you still do it? If you are intimidated about writing a story yourself, then don't write it at all, but leave someone else's work alone either way! Or just write your own story anyway and see how it turns out.

*** I understand that it might come off that way, which is why I wanted to inquire with the community. The goal was not to "steal" the author's work (as I indicated to the author via message, we are more than happy to not post the completed work on the internet) but to practice working together on a piece of writing with which we are both familiar.

As I posted above, I just messaged the author to ask for permission. If the author says no, we will not continue to edit the piece (and certainly won't post about it on the Internet). Obviously we want to be respectful. I interpret what we're doing as paying homage to a master of the genre by examining their work, its strengths and flaws, to learn ourselves how to create a work. But if the author responds asking us to refrain from editing their piece, we will of course not edit it further.

Even if the author says yes, we don't intend to publish the entire piece. We would simply post excerpts of the material on which we are working on Tumblr, which would make the original work identifiable. That is my primary motive for asking -- I can't imagine finding a random website picking apart my work!

**** I know I would personally be very hurt to discover someone had made a tumblr that was specifically about editing my work and ripping it to shreds. I think we all know our writing isn't perfect but to have one's nose so publicly rubbed in the failings of an unpaid labor of love would be awful.

*** well your argument can be made about fanfics in general...taking an established work and changing it even if some authors like george rr martin have spoken against it...

**** Yea, that's not wrong, but I think my case is particularly egregious because I'm not just borrowing characters and scenarios, I'm rewriting lines. My primary concern is that the author will be like, "well, I didn't ask you to beta me, this is super rude," which is totally fair. Candidly my early edits of this piece are kind of harsh and I totally don't want to be a jerk

**** That is a very good point! But yes I only write harry potter fanfictions and I heard JK Rowling say she is okay with it? :) So yes, it is okay if you have PERMISSION. :)

*** I think it's immensely rude to tell someone not to write at all just because they feel intimidated about writing. We should always feel empowered to try new things, particularly those things that might frighten us.

**** I'm sorry. :( I meant yes in the context of deciding to write and take someone's work, or not write at all.

** I think this is a great way to learn to write. Obviously, with something like fan fiction, we put our work out there hoping people won't rip it to shreds, so I think it's good that you asked for the writer's permission. But this is more or less what I've done in writing workshops with published pieces. Not a line-by-line edit, but taking apart a piece of fiction that works well in order to see /why/ it works well. Looking closely at work that you respect is a great learning strategy, particularly if you don't know where to start actually writing. If someone asked me to do this with my work, I would be honored. I would consider it a mark of how good they think my work is, that they want to learn from it. I hope the author gives you permission, and I would love to see the Tumblr about your experience if she does. :)

*** Thank you for your input! This is exactly the framework in which we had conceived the idea. I sincerely hope the author does not mind us editing their work; we both feel like it's the best way to understand what has made their story timeless and relatable to so many readers.
