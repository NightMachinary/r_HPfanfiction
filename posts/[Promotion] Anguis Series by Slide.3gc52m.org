The Anguis series is an anthology of four stories focusing on the lives of four friends in Slytherin friends(all of them OCs). The story takes place in the Canon timeline but Canon characters are often peripheral to the central story.

I normally avoid OC stories like the plague but this series had brilliant character development, is superbly paced and subverts the cliches that abound in Slytherin-centric fics. The four stories in order are:

1. Latet Anguis in Herba
2. Shade to Shade
3. Falls the Shadow(IMO the best of the series)
4. Beyond this place

For some unfathomable reason, this series gets overlooked by almost everyone. The stories are posted on HPFF(great to read, bit a pain to navigate) I'm not saying that this is the best fic that I've ever read but it's a whole lot better than some of the highly recommended fanfics. The link for the first story in this series is given below:

*** All the OCs are well developed although I must confess a partiality to Gabriel Doyle. His growth from the first story to the last is tremendous.

** They are also in fanfiction.net. This fanfic is extremelly well done and the author is a professional. It also has a next generation trilogy that acts as a sequel and is almost finished. Totally recommended.

*** Yes, they are on FF as well! For some reason, I have always associated this fic with HPFF. Thanks for the spot. For those who look up this fic on FF, don't be put off by the number of reviews.If there were a FanFiction God, he/she would interchange the number of reviews for this series and Harry Crow.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** I found this story out when I was looking for a fic with completely new OCs and it blew my mind. So much so, in fact, that I decided to check out the Stygian trilogy afterwards despite having absolutely no interest in next-gen stuff - and it's got me completely hooked.

Slide is awesome. The only fault I could find was the way she dealt with love triangles. There's only so many times I can see the "odd one out" get killed off or otherwise conveniently written out of the story just so the major characters can get together before it gets predictable. By the end I seriously just didn't want Tobias and Tanith to get together anymore, just for the sake of a plot twist.
