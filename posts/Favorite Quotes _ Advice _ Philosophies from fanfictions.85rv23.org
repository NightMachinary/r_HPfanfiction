So, has there been anything from fanfiction you've read that has, if not inspired you, then at least provided a new viewpoint on your own life?

quote the actual text if possible

PS: "/Heck Dumbledore I wanna be edgy/" is probably not the best response...


** And then............... suddenly just as I Draco kissed me passionately. Draco climbed on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree. He took of my top and I took of his clothes. I even took of my bra. Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time.

“Oh! Oh! Oh! ” I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm. We started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm. And then....

“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS!”

** Plans, plots, ideas, schemes, and so much more whirred through the mind of Albus Dumbledore. His brilliant mind dissected each item, mercilessly probing for weaknesses, for flaws, for imperfections. But never did he reject the methods. Empires would fall, regimes would change, and the world itself would burn.

People became no more than pawns, to be ruthlessly used and discarded. He would use his great knowledge of the human mind and his ability to read people to manipulate them. They would be his puppets, dancing to his bidding as he worked to his greater goal.

At the center of his web of conspiracy was the Fentons. Yes they were key. It was only because of them his goal could be accomplished.

Yes, Albus Dumbledore would be getting a pair of thick woolen socks for Christmas. And the Fentons would be the ones to give them to him.

  Danny Phantom already had to deal with the problems of two worlds, so what were more mortal problems to him? Even if they were problems of a magical nature. And Harry Potter's got even more on his plate for his fifth year at Hogwarts.

** "If a junkie could foresee what his life would be, if he could see what he would look like at his worst moment, do you think he would ever take that first hit? Knowing where it would lead him, would he ever start?"

That quote always stuck out to me. Especially considering the source (both author and character)

  The anagram. I mean to be serious Tom. The Dark Lord is a murderous dictator who tried to take over the world, slaughtering anyone who opposed him and practically enslaving half the purebloods in Europe. He would never do something as sad and juvenile as using an anagram of his given name for a title. That's like something a bad guy in a children's storybook would do. I'm eleven and even I can see that.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Since you did not specify the fandom my favorite quote is:

"After all, she'd had her facility invaded by the enemy - pretty much. She was working on improving means to kill anyone who dared to try a repeat performance.

So long as it wasn't her, Chell was okay with this"

Chell recalling what happened in the past few weeks. The other being mentioned is obviously GLaDOS.

Seven Devils chapter 12(according to fanfiction.net), 11 (according to the story)

** This is probably one of the greatest speech I ever read by Percy Weasley.

#+begin_quote
  He paused to scan their faces meaningfully. “Fear leads to a lot of things, very few of them positive. It leads to hatred, and to mistrust and to thoughtless action, all things that we as people cannot afford!” Percy slapped the podium for emphasis, and everybody jumped.

  “Fear blinds even the sides of man to the truth. And the truth that everyone is missing here is that we have rode out the worst of the storm. We have outlived the menace of tyranny---Lord Voldemort is dead.” Percy let the name roll off his tongue for the first time. “Our greatest fault was that we expected his death to be the end. It isn't. There is still much work to be done, and it will not be accomplished if we do not work together.” Another pause, another scan of the faces. “I know that nothing I can say will make you believe that everything will go back to being happy or easy. And that's because there is no simple course to take, no simple path to returning to the way it was before the war.”

  A story of reconstruction, because a world turned upside down cannot right itself in a day. Percy realizes this as he tries to deal with family, politics, and an investigation into ongoing Death Eater activities. Sequel to Proving Them Wrong.

** I've got a real head for quotes so honestly, so many. The only two I can think of verbatim (because I know where they are): - " James was crazy like it was a phase he was going through---like he'd wake up one morning merely eccentric" - "My right shoe is missing, my left smells like dragon dung, and my trousers are thoroughly scorched. Highly unlikely I would've survived a dragon attack, so that will remain a mystery. (If I did meet and escape a dragon, but am too drunk to remember it, I'll never forgive myself.) Was woken by a Muggle law man this morning. No idea what he was saying. (You'd think I would, wouldn't you, with Sirius cursing at me in French for the last seven years?) He was angry that I was sleeping on a public bench. Minor detail, but the bench was in Paris under the giant monument of Gifford Ollerton. Y'know, the one camouflaged as that tower you told me the Parisian Muggles think they made."
