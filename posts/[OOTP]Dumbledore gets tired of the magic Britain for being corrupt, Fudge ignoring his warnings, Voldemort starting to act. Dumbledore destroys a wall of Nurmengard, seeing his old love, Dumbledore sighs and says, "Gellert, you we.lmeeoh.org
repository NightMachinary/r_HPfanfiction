I just had this idea, when reading a similar fanfic. I'm super excited to start sketching the story!

â€‹

It would be fantastic to see a renewed relationship between Albus and Gellert, perhaps Dumbledore could welcome Harry as his apprentice. Anyway, there are many ideas, and I was looking forward to sharing with you all!


** I mean, this is basically the plot of linkao3(Phoenix Insurgent).

** The Walls of Nurmengard were said to be virtually unbreakable, made from solid rock cut with magic in the Egyptian method and reinforced with all manner of charms over the years. Designed to withstand days or weeks of constant bombardment from dozens of adult wizards.

They lasted twenty seconds against Dumbledore.

There was no alarm, for someone had placed sleep potion in the guard's dinner, someone that managed to slip past undetected the wards, charms and attentive patrols of the prison, those that didn`t eat, were subdued more directly, the hourly scan with Homenus Revelio didn`t show anything unusual.

And yet the fifty guards were now unconscious as the front wall blew up with a bang, arc of electricity ran through the walls showing the entire ward scheme had fallen.

There had been dozens of attempts to breach the prison over the decades, some had a hundred wizards trying to free their leader, all failed.

It only took two this time.

Albus Dumbledore walked through the prison where he had left his confidant, his friend and much more, though he avoided dwelling on these thoughts.

After blasting the final door to the highest tower, he finally reached his destination.

Gellert Grindelwald looked up with a raised eyebrow at his old friend.

He snorted, "Huh, who`s the dramatic one now, Albus?"

Dumbledore looked at his friend with a mixture of regret, guilt, and sadness, but now, there was determination.

"Well, if you had come to finish the job, all you had to do was ask the warden, so by your method, I guess you are here to...free me."

Albus sighed, "You are correct, Gellert, the situation has changed, drastically, I would daresay it has become unsustainable, and that if swift action isn't taken the consequences will be dire."

"All those flowery words to say your country's government has finally fucked up to the point that even /you/ can't keep things stable, huh?"

Dumbledore closed his eyes and nodded.

Gellert rosed from his chair, his robes were frayed, his face gaunt, but even then he exuded more power and authority than most wizards.

"Well Albus, I know you don't like hearing it, but...I told you so."

Another nod, this one with resignation.

"Well, where's your number two? Because I am sure you had help, you are not one to skulk around putting knock-out potions on people's food, they would probably hear your snapping knees from afar."

There was a chuckle, before to Gellert's shock, a teenager materialized right on Albus's side, there was no magical signature, no smell, no sound.

The latter two could be the use of charms, but the first one...

A large smile appeared on the german's face as he noticed the silvery cloth, "Ah, Albus, The Cloak, you found the Cloak, or rather found the owner," he looked expectantly at the boy, black hair, green eyes, and a scar...

"Harry Potter, pleasure meeting you Mr. Grindelwald."

Gellert looked for a few moments in the young man's eyes, and the stare was returned, before another smile spread on his face and he shook Harry's hand.

"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Potter, and you can call me Gellert, any friend of Albus is my friend."

Harry smiled back, "Harry, then, sir, I mean... Gellert."

Dumbledore was looking between the two with an amused expression.

"Well, no that the proper introductions were made, it would be for the best that we left before the ICW Warlocks arrive in force, I would think we have about ten minutes."

At Gellert's raised eyebrow, Albus explained in a most despondent voice.

"Alas, my friend, it seems their emergency portkeys have been redirected to a pleasant sky lodge in the Alps, one that happens to have rather ingenious anti-apparition and portkey charms, a most unfortunate occasion."

Harry chuckled again, making Gellert look at him.

"Now, not that I am grateful, but I wouldn't expect Harry Potter himself to be here, last I heard, you were a hero in Britain."

A dark look came upon Harry's face before it passed and was replaced by a sarcastic and rather bitter smile, he exchanged a glance with Professor Dumbledore, who was in the process of dismantling the left over wards and charms of the area so they could use a untraceable portkey.

"Ah, I think you haven't heard the latest yet, I seems now I am considered a...miscreant, troublemaker, /liar/, criminal, and...what was the last one Professor? In the same one they called you an instigator of insurrection."

"Ah, yes, Harry, I think they called you an Agent of Chaos."

Harry spread his arms, "See, Mr. Grindelwald...er Gellert, an Agent of Chaos, so that's what I am doing now, causing chaos and trouble, under the Headmaster's instigation of course."

"Former Headmaster, Harry." and there was a tone of sadness under the sarcasm.

"Not to me, Professor and most of students, /Headmaster/, not to us."

There was a genuine look of appreciation from Dumbledore, before the piece of rope he was holding glowed.

"Well, that's it, we leave in a minute, hold the rope."

"So, where are we going Albus? Some safehouse in Britain?"

"Alas, Gellert, I don't think that would be proper, in this case, we are going to France, to stay in the house of one of Harry's...friends, where some of our common allies are gathering."

"You can say girlfriend Professor, and it's her grandmother's house, and she knows Gellert."

"Oh?"

Harry turned to Grindelwald and said in convincing french with little accent.

/"Les mots sont justes mais ton accent est un crime de guerre."/

Gellert frowned as he remembered, before his eyes widened, "Oh, Aline? Now, this is going to be interesting, and you said you are dating her granddaughter?"

Harry nodded.

"Impressive, and the location couldn't be better, France is a good place to plan a revolution."

And with that they disappeared, to appear again in a villa in the outskirts of Nice, and when the harried squads of Warlocks finally arrived, there would be no trace of them or their destination, only broken walls and sleeping guards.

And soon Cornelius Fudge would rue the day he decided to wage political war with Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, for they had escalated it and changed the arena to one where he had no advantage, the international one.

** Harry looks at his mentor, who sits next to an emaciated man with strange eyes.

"So let's recap, when finally the press started to hate you, you realized that your country is terribly corrupt and needs to be repaired?" he asks, and Dumbledore nods. Harry isn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Instead, he turns to Grindelwald, which he thought he would never do.

"He was always such an idiot, or was he only in old age?"

Later, Harry conquers Great Britain with them and his friends.
