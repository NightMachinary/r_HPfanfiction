Hey guys, I've been trying to find a fanfiction that I read in the past year or so....

Harry is in Slytherin house, and he's disillusioned by Dumbledore. He is friends with/influenced by the current Slytherin king & queen. The queen is named Diane, I believe, and the king is Nemo or Niro, something like that. Harry ends up becoming godparent to their child and has to sneak out of Hogwarts to go to the godparent ceremony. Harry ends up being caught on way back into the castle afterward and is locked up (I think) after getting caught by Dumbledore and the Order. Maybe?

I usually read Archive of Our Own, so I think it's on that platform, but it could also be Fanfiction.net

Thanks in advance!
