I am looking for fics that fit the list below, it can be all or a mix of a few. (i do not want just one from the list, i like to mix things up). The only rules are, it must have at least 100k words, Completed, and well written. I DO NOT LIKE Lazy writing. Cracks are okay. Also i like chapters that are 20 or more but that is optional. NO SLASH, pairings are okay.

The list (you can pick multiple, but do NOT just pick 1, i will do 3 minimum):

-Good/goodish Tom riddle (old or young)

-Time travel/second chance/Do over/ Time loop

-Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore

-Godlike Harry

-Female Harry

-Forced marriage contract (mostly a forced marriage contract for Harry and Ginny, or Fem!Harry and Ron)

-Weasley Bashing

-Tom riddle reincarnates as Harry or Fem!Harry

-Abused Harry/Fem!Harry

​

If you can find a fic will ALL of these components YOU ARE AN OG. If you cant, understandable and just pick a few suggestions ^.^

​

Also bonus points if you find a story that starts at year 1 and progresses to year 7

  "I do wonder how the magicals of Britain will react when they discover that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is now the 'Wolf-That-Loves'." Hermione and Harry become werewolves with some surprising results. So surprising, in fact, that their world turns on its head. Takes place sixth year. Harry/Hermione, AU. I find this story hard to give a summary for...

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
