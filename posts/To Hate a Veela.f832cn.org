《TRIGGER WARNING》

The divorce of James and Lily Potter was the single UGLIEST nightmare the public had ever experienced. With poor Harry James Potter sat smack bang in the middle of it.

The fiasco technically began in 1982, when Severus Snape threw himself at his former best friends feet and begged for forgiveness for the part he played in the Dark Lord targeting her family. Lily Potter, a woman with a huge heart, forgave him and tentatively allowed him to call her his friend once again.

9 years later, James Potter walked in on his wife and Severus together in his bed... having just dropped their son (the Boy Who Lived) off at Kings Cross Station.

It wouldn't be until Christmas that Harry found out the what and why behind his parents separation. A media storm of epic proportions having distracted him from the Philosopher's Stone as Snape spent every moment he could parading (now) Lily Evans to the Daily Prophet camera's whilst his father made a spectacle of himself with curses and vitriol directed at them both.

Dealing with his snickering schoolmates and an ever-so smug Potions Master lit a fire in Harry, leading him to hunt for the truth.

A truth he stumbled upon when Snape just couldn't deny his beloved a visit from her son early into the 1992 summer.

It took him two days to surmise it was a love potion, he was able to whisk away the /'medicine'/ Snape... compelled her to take whilst they went out to a Muggle theme park. They were forced on the run for months before Snape was apprehended.

Now Harry was, again, a hero to the public. Rescuing his mother from the sick twisted machinations of former Death Eater, Severus Snape. Arrested by a very enthusiastic Sirius Black for his crimes. The status quo restored, good having triumphed once again.

Not all was well. The damage was done.

Despite it all, Lily could not be around James. The memories of her ex-husbands rage intermingled with her time with Snape... she just couldn't.

《▪︎》

The year is 1995. Harry is returning from a weekend with his mother, having rushed back at his fathers insistence.

Within his fathers small manor is a trio of blondes. A girl who could be no older than eight, a young woman he recognised from the year before and an older woman so breathtakingly beautiful he had to scoop his jaw off of the floor.

They were part-Veela of course, the Celastin family. Formerly the Delacour's before the divorce.The trio attempting to become his family through Appoline's marriage to James.

Fleur is apprehensive. The year before the Tri-Wizard tournament had occurred, where (despite her best efforts) she had not been able to have a pleasant conversation with the boy. The boy who'd glared every time she wielded her Allure.

The boy who still looked at her, and her mother, as if she were scum. A look she was getting to the bottom of.

《TL/DR: A HP fic where the Potter families brush with a love potion leads Harry to hate anything and everything that messes with the minds and emotions of others...》


** This is a great prompt. I'm imagining an Occlumency obsessed Harry frantically trying to prove to James that he's being influenced by Appoline negatively (with ambiguity on the reader's part as to whether he truly is). This would be great from a first person perspective.

**** Actually you know what would work? Make it so Harry hates the Veela because all he knows about them is their Allure mind controlling people, but he's coming from a place of anger at Snape and Ignorance about a misunderstood species.

Harry will think like most people in fanon "the allure is a passive thing that attracts people to Veela."

while Fleur eventually has to educate Harry on it by basically explaining that no it's not, A veela's natural looks and seductive dance is what causes the Allure to be a thing, yes Magic is involved but it isn't something a veela can't turn off or passively use it has to actively be used.

Hell it doesn't even have to be a ship fic. just have Harry, Fleur and Gabrielle eventually bond as siblings as they begin to understand each other, make Harry more soft towards Gabi since she's a kid and he warms up to her pretty fast, while staying wary of the other two. it'd be interesting.

Fleur is exactly the hopeless blond bimbo, who thinks too well about herself, so she enters the Triwizard Tournament, where she is dead last in all three tasks, and then she grabs a banker as an husband, because that's the only thing she could do. Lavender Brown is more action character than her (and I do love stories about action-oriented Lavender Brown by Northumbrian).

****** Since nobody is defending Fleur...

Fleur Delacour is an incredibly gifted witch. She was CHOSEN by the Goblet of Fire when she entered as the most worthy candidate of the Beauxbatons delegation. Her losing the tournament is more a testament to the skill of her competitors than any lack of skill on her part.

She bewitched a dragon (successfully) and made it fall asleep on her own. Friendly reminder dragons can take up to 10 Stupefy's before dropping and require an entire team to manage. She basically did Charlie Weasley's job on her own in the tournament. That is a feat Harry, to this day, has not matched.

Then onto her marriage with Bill. First, he's not a banker (getting the pedantic shit out of the way), he's a curse breaker. Effectively a magical archaeologist.

Fleur didn't just graduate and shack up with a rich husband. She graduated GOT A JOB and met her husband AT WORK. As far as we, the audience, are aware she still works at Gringotts.

Then during the war, she (at CONSIDERABLE risk to herself and family) harboured fugitives of the Death Eaters and helped to heal and support the likes of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Griphook, Luna AND Ollivander at a moments notice before getting up and fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Gtfo with your */WRONG/* opinion of Fleur Delacour. She literally got medals of honour from two countries Ministries for her actions during the war, she's the furthest thing from a bimbo.

#+end_quote

There is no allure. At least, there is nothing of the sort for a single veela. When a large group of veela start to sing and dance, there is something like an allure, but a single veela doesn't have anything of the sort.

Other than that, it's a sort of interesting (and by that, I mean disgusting) premise that more or less sticks to Snivellus' character. However, this is a storyline that begins on the premise of rape. That's a bad start, and it would take exceptional writing to make it work.

Of course, Lily forgiving him is extremely OOC - she didn't forgive him when she finally opened her eyes to the scum he was. She'd be more likely to kill him on the spot if she were to learn that he placed a target on her one year old's back.

*** While I do agree with the fact that the existence of any Allure was never explicitly confirmed the reactions Fleur receives are somewhat over the top, even for someone who is extremely beautiful.

And it's not like the series is particularly detailed in what is and is not magic or possible with magic.

Beyond that; it's fanfiction. If someone wants to envision a world where the Allure is a magical phenomenon, realized in their own way, who are we to say "No". Every single piece of fanfiction changes something about the canonical universe and with how out there some stories are the Allure is practically a non-issue.

More than that it's an interesting prompt with the opportunity for some really interesting character arcs: Lily and her trauma, Harry and him overcoming his biases, James and him moving past what would likely be feelings of betrayal towards Lily etc.

*** "Something like an allure"? You could split hairs by saying it's not called by that name in canon, but it's clearly there, and not just for the group as a whole at the match. A smaller group (three, I think?) cause Ron and several other wizards to stop in the middle of a life-or-death crisis and spout off ridiculous things to try to impress them. And when Fleur "turns on the charm" later, Ron shouts at her across the room to ask her to the Ball, when it wasn't even aimed at him. Yes, he's a teenage boy, but everyone recognizes it as unusual enough to suggest he was influenced.

She doesn't do anything of the sort. She's minding her own business, talking to Cedric (who doesn't act like a moron) when Ron loses it. None of the other onlookers lose it here either, and this includes Neville, Fred and George, if memory serves.

The thing with Ron is a running gag.

Besides, there's nothing like this when Fleur is by the lake in her swimsuit - you'd think it would be much worse in that scene, but it isn't.

Compare all that to the stadium scene. There is some actual magic going on as the veela dance and sing.

The veela attraction magic is a real thing, but they have sing and dance in order to make that happen. This passive allure, the one that veela have just by being veela, doesn't exist. Otherwise, Bill and Fleur's wedding would have been a little difficult with everyone and their uncle staring at all the veela around.

Not to mention what might have been the case when the Death Eaters arrived.

*** Also technically a death threat and thus illegal, the violation of personal space, physical assault by violently grabbing her by the throat, possibly even a case for unwanted advances due to pressing a wand to her stomach...

For doing that alone, Harry would be in deep legal trouble if Fleur decides to pursue it.

Though a significantly unhinged Harry from events described as above could do this, though a lesser variation. It will still do him no favours, though.

If Harry really wants to be vindictive and petty he could openly call her ugly because of the thorns beneath (her use of the Allure in this context)

And what proof? I suppose if pensieve and veritaserum counted they'd have something.

*** I am extremely intrigued by “broken characters”. Not only do they make for a better story, but they also have better character arcs all around if written well.

I'd read the hell out of this!

** How much of the first part os written. Like will the reader go through harry in hogwarts while snapes raping his mom? Or will basically all youve written be backstory and it starts off with him and his mother getting ready to visit his father and the veela whores?
