Does anyone know where to find “Other Lives and Dimensions and Finally a Love Story,” which is about the Marauders? Also looking for multi chapter Marauder era stuff. Thanks!


** most of these are wolfstar and VERY long, so be prepared:

All the Young Dudes

We Were Infinite

the lost generation

Mischief Managed

Casting Moonshadows

all can be found on AO3 except the last one, which is on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. the last two are not finished, but very close. all are amazingly well written, especially the top one. enjoy!
