I've been toying with a fic idea for a while now that needs the hollows and master of death stihck to be viable as I currently have it plotted out, though I think I may have subverted the trope enough for it to not be a complete rehash. That being said, I'd ideally like to set the fic before 7th year and the Horcrux hunt, so I've been trying to pick apart the timeline for times Harry could have gotten the three Hollows sooner.

So far the best option I've found is sometime during late 5th year, though the specifics are still iffy. Does anyone else implement the hollows earlier in the timeline in their fics? How so? Have you seen fics implement them sooner and well? Any ideas on how to implement them effectively before 7th year without it being too contrived? I'm trying to minimize how tropey they can get as best I can because I realize they tend to be cliches and overused.


** I haven't used this much, but I would imagine the earliest possible scenario would be if Harry were to run away from Voldemort instead of taking the Portkey at the end of the graveyard ritual. Assuming the Death Eaters and all decided to let him run away, Harry might have been drawn to a ruined shack near the local manor in order to escape their pursuit. Feeling an odd pull between his scar and the object beneath the floorboards, Harry might have found the Ring horcrux and sensing that it was dark and powerful, took it away wrapped in a cloth.

What happens next depends a lot on how Harry escaped the graveyard and how he gets back to Hogwarts. If he has a long journey, the horcrux in the ring might 'convince' him to keep it secret from Dumbledore.

Eventually Harry needs to find a way to destroy the horcrux part, and if Dumbledore is there to save him when it all goes wrong, Harry might be in the position where he disarms the Headmaster while controlled. At that moment he would have the Deathstick's favor, access to the Stone and probably would be carrying the Cloak.

*** I really like this explanation of possible events; I actually hadn't even considered Harry finding the ring on his own and not having Dumbledore hand it over to him. This definitely adds more variety to how things could unfold.

My biggest holdup with having Harry get the ring in 4th year would be the horocrux bit; after his experiences in 2nd year I'd like to think he'd avoid objects that talk back or effect the mind if he gets an inkling they're doing it, and the horcrux's we've seen with that ability in the series (the diary) weren't terribly subtle about comunicating. Then again Ginny gets taken by it anyway, so who knows on that front.

I'd been toying with Harry accidentally disarming Dumbledore during one of his blowouts; he nearly destroyed Dumbledore's office at one point without meaning to, so accidentally tossing a wand out of a person's hand when he's feeling angry and threatened doesn't seem like a terrible stretch by any means. If Harry has his cloak on him and possesses the ring by that point, the wand might be swayed to accept that as a defeat to be reunited with the other hollows. After all, it goes with whoever is the strongest, and a person having 2/3rds of the hollows seems like a reasonable criteria to be considered the strongest. I'm still fiddling with that bit since it's not the strongest excuse in the world for Harry to get the wand, and I'd like to make it at least someone believeable he's gained ownership however he does it.

The possession disarming also seems like a good option, but might not work with the plot I personally have outlined. I'd still love to see someone write it out though. Having Harry accidentally 'mesh' with a Horcrux the way Ginny did with the diary seems like an interesting concept, especially if he's more cogniscent of it happening. Perhaps have its effects be less strong since he's a horcrux himself to allow him more free-will and keep things interesting. it's a fun thought to poke about with.

Elaborating on my idea above, what if Voldemort (or minion) kidnapped Harry to Riddle Manor during second year, Harry escapes and finds the ring and puts it on (no curse, just slow possession like diary) because it's offering him things (knowledge, skills, etc.). Then you have /two/ horcruxes in Hogwarts possessing people, but the diary is much further along. Eventually Harry rescues Ginny and destroys the diary (fighting the compulsion of the ring at the time), realizes the ring is similar and destroys it too, but the stone survives...

***** Could work! I think Harry would be a lot more skeeved out by the ring than Ginny was by the Diary though, since a diary makes at least a little sense in being able to communicate given what's known about magical books at the time (the books in the restricted section and monster book of monsters have similarly strange traits for example). A talking ring is a little less trustworthy in that sense.

The curse on the ring is still the biggest issue it has; maybe Dumbledore somehow gets harry to hand it over once he realizes its dark, fixes it, and then hands it back because he cant trust himself with the stone? Having harry present when the curse is removed would probably waylay the excitment that blinded him into putting it on without checking in canon.

******* That seems plausible. I know the group were careful with the horocruxes they collected during the hunt, so there's no real way of knowing how a cursed horcrux would effect Harry. The closest aproximatio we have in the later series is the locket, and I can't recall if Harry ever handled that bare handed or not off the top of my head.

******** The locket was not only against his bare skin (he wore it under his shirt, and he or someone else described it as being against their heart in a creepy way), it was against other people too. This would seem like the locket didn't choose Harry not to curse him, because it didn't curse anyone else either, or Dolores Umbridge when she wore it. The ring was Riddle's first horcrux, so it's possible he was being extra careful and decided to curse only that one, but none of the others.

If you have Harry running away from the minions 4th year like someone above mentioned, he could find the ring, but before he can touch it, he can hear people coming after him. He then slams the box/container closed without touching it, then shoves it in his pocket. How you deal with the touching and cursing thing after, I'm not sure.

******** I personally like to think that horcruxes by themselves don't really have any particular effect. The objects need to be futher enchanted to actually do anything. I mean, neither the cup or the diadem did shit (though the last one didn't had a chance) and Nagini acted like a normal snake. ANd there's Harry, of course. So, even assuming that you're following canon as close as possible (which seems you are), the mechanics of a Horcrux are vague enough for you to make it up. The ring being nothing more than a cursed ring is perfectly plausible, and the curse having no effect because it recognizes another piece of Voldemorts soul sounds as possible as anything.

Then of course there's the elder wand. Remember that Harry doen't have to disarm the elder wand- He simply needs to disarm whoever owns it at the time.

** Voldemort has one of his minions kidnap Harry to Riddle Manor (for reasons); when Harry escapes (because plot) he briefly takes shelter in a nearby shack and finds a ring (which doesn't have massive protections for some reason, or maybe all you need is to be a parselmouth, or maybe Harry has some of Voldemort's memories, etc.).

Dumbledore realizes the diary is a horcrux and starts hunting the rest himself. You could have Dumbledore cursed and dying even before third year starts (or later, whenever) and he gives Harry the resurrection stone and lets Harry "defeat" him for the Elder Wand he knows Harry will need (maybe he doesn't even tell Harry that the wand is now his, but hides it for Harry to find later).

*** I feel like parts of both these options are viable; It's totally possible for harry to be abducted earlier in the series, since he wasn't really heavily guarded until Sirius escaped, and even then that was mostly by dementors, and they were there for the entire student body. Harry getting the wand by disarming Dumbledore, intentionally or not, would account for the wand, though the timing of when it happens would be crucial. Dumbledore may reason that death moves the wands ownership and not a disarming, and be convinced Harry isn't the master depending on the point in the timeline, or whatever.

I'd say Harry getting the ring on his own and not from Dumbledore probably opens up the most options in terms of when he can access it plotwise.

Thanks for sharing! It's always neat seeing how other people would construct a timeline around an idea, or interpret events to work. :)

** The earliest possible point (aside from going completely AU) is probably sometime in third year.

End of Second year Dumbledore realises the diary was a Horcrux, over summer he does all the research he can on horcruxes and voldemort. At this point he has all the information necessary to start 'training' Harry like he did in sixth year. Lessons continue but instead of the cave this time Harry goes along to help with the shack. They manage to make their way inside but once Dumbledore realises the ring is the resurrection stone he goes to put it on, Harry noticing something isn't right disarms Dumbledore and grabs the ring. Harry is now the rightful owner of all three Deathly Hallows.

Where it goes from there really depends what being 'master of death' entails. Also trying to integrate this into the existing third year storyline seems complicated.

*** That seems like a very logical series of events to me given what we kow about Dumbledore's handling of the horcruxes before he died.

I also agree it would be very complicated, but it would move a ot of things in the canon forward or make them completely redundant, like the horcrux hunt. That leaves more room after third year for things to go totally AU and have new things happen rather than a canon-rehash. So it would be hard to keep straight but if done right it would lead interesting places.

**** I've always been of the opinion that the ring only enacts the death curse once you actually wear it, but when you touch it you are /compelled/ to wear it (mainly because I see no other reason for Dumbledore to wear it, since he was full aware the stone needed to be turned three times in his hand), so maybe you could explore that idea and have the ring full on hipnotizing Dumbles, to the point where he tries to attack Harry for ttrying to take it away.

**** well, the rewrite could have each years challenge be to get another horcrux. though i think it highly unlikely he'd take harry when he's that young. if perhaps harry gained the wand at some point between the basilisk and the ring, perhaps not. since albus puts so much weight behind the hallows he might perceive harry as being more mature for owning it.

** I can think of a couple of moments:

During Harry's outburst against Dumbledore after Sirius died, he gets a little more aggressive and conquers Dumbledore's wand, opening up a wealth of knowledge for him.

Right before the horcrux hunt begins, Harry has a peek into Voldemorts mind and finds out about the Hallows then.

While Harry's possessed in the ministry, Voldemort spurs Harry on to attack Dumbledore, using Harry's resentment of the man for holding back too much information.. Harry obtains the wand somehow.

*** I think it's important to note here that Voldemort didn't know anything about the Hallows, and even Ollivander was unaware of the Deathstick's association with the Tale of the Three Brothers. The Hallows themselves are notoriously silent about their qualities. The Gaunts had the Resurrection Stone attached to their heirloom ring for generations without knowing of its powers, and Riddle made a horcrux of the ring without any indication that he sensed the stone was even enchanted.

The Elder Wand might be very intuitive at spellwork from its centuries of active use, but it gave no particular indication of where its allegiance truly rested. I can't think of a time that Harry even held it until after the final duel with Voldemort, and there wasn't a flash and pulse of happy power-jollies that came from Harry being its owner.

**** That's true. As for the first reason, Voldemort became aware of the Hallows during the summer of 1997, right after HBP. So any time after that Harry could have heard about the deathstick when he was in Voldemorts mind.

The second point is very true. But in the end, you're changing canon, aren't you? So if you change the point at which Harry comes across the Hallows, why not change Hallows themselves?

*** True, but Harry would still needs to possess the items, and Dumbledore is notorious for withholding things he doesnt think Harry needs just yet. I doubt he'd hand the Hallows over to a first years student if he had any clue what they were; and considering his life long interest in them, he would. Harry would still need to win the wand from him, and Dumbledore coveted that sone horrendously.

So while getting the three things together isn't hard, getting them all together with Harry is significntly more finicky to work out from what i'm able to work out. This does get them closer to Harry earlier though, which would make it easier for him to have them quicker.

** Eh, how about this one.

Harry kills the basilisk at the end of second year but is too late to destroy the diary. Ginnymort attempts to flee but ends up in a duel with Dumbledore on the way out. S/he disarms Albus, who pulls a spare wand to continue, but Harry gets a lucky shot in and disarms Ginnymort, acquiring both Ginny's old wand and the Elder wand. Dumbledore subdues him/her. Harry gives the Elder wand back to Dumbledore, but since Dumbledore didn't reacquire it via conquest, Harry remains its true master.

Dumbledore utilizes a combination of legilimency and veritaserum on Ginnymort to discover what the diary was. Following up, he discovers Tom planned to make more, including the resurrection stone cum Gaunt family ring. Dumbledore spends the summer preparing, scouting different locations. At the beginning of Harry's third year, he goes to the Gaunt house and fails to be cautious upon seeing the resurrection stone in person. He makes it back to Hogwarts just in time to "leak his memories" (a la Snape), and then dies, leaving the ring to Harry to destroy.

I think it still fits, but it would basically speed up the story about 3-4 years compared to canon timeline. It is also very likely to run into the "preteens who act like adults" pitfall, but...yeah. The only real way to avoid that (that I can think of off the top of my head) is with lots of filler, a massive time skip, have that sequence be a flashback, or set it up as a (partial) frame narrative.

** The earliest I could think of would be first year. or the summer between first and second. Harry has the cloak on him when he goes to rescue the Stone. Quirrelmort kidnaps Harry, after harry fails to get the stone out of the Mirror. Quirrelmort ends up torturing Harry in Riddle Manor, and Harry escapes. Harry goes to the shack by accident and hides. Voldemort tells Quirrel that its pointless, Potter will die in the shack anyway. "Hisss body will feed the enchantments on that hovel" Harry, due to having a sliver of Voldemort's magic on him from where he was tortured by the man as he possessed Quirrel, or the soul shard in his forehead, allows him to slip past all but the curse on the ring itself. He hides there, finds the ring, and takes it with him. He exits the shack and says, "Professor Dumbledore would know what to do..." Fawkes appears, cuz Plot. He fireFlashes Harry back to Hogwarts, with the ring. The wards in the school pick up the curse on the ring, Dumbledore, knowing it is cursed, doesnt pick it up but does investigate it.

Second year happens, normally, except that Harry is a bit more paranoid and vigorous in class. He never wants to suffer that torture again. Dumbledore is focusing on figuring out how to break the curse on the ring, when the chamber opens. He doesnt know what the ring is, just that it is cursed and has the hallow in it. the rest of Second year happens, and when harry gives Dumbledore the diary, it all clicks for Dumbledore. He uses the sword to destroy the Horcrux, and hands Harry the ring back, maybe spouting some ancient magical law or some garbage. Harry wears it constantly.

Third year happens. Harry puts forth even more effort since he struggled with the basilisk. Lupin helps with his studies. Dumbledore takes interest, and decides to humor his student and see how good he is/train him/harry gets pissed. Harry disarms him by pure luck.

Now, you have a Dumbledore who is aware of horcurxes around the same time as canon, and a Harry who will end up around 3x as strong as canon since he started studying vigorously two years earlier. you can also stick relatively close to canon, or branch off where needed.
