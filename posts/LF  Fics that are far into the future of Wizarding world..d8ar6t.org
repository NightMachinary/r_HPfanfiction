I like fics about the wizarding world. Hopefully two or three generations post Harry. Probably with some minor references to canon.


** This one is really good and has way too little attention:

*** Thanks for the rec. I have actually read it and it is really good. The character of tomboyish Gryffindor Ray is now one of my favorite OC.

** Rise of Wizards has a couple chapters after... But idk. By generation, do you mean all the old cast is dead, as well as their children and grandchildren?

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

** I tried writing a fanfic when I was around 15 or so about a Voldemort who had won, gained immortality, then gotten so bored that he decided to try being a good guy. It was supposed to be set in the far future. Didn't pan out- I got about 3 chapters in and stopped.

Have you read Browncoat, Green Eyes? linkffn(2857962) It definitely fits the bill for 'far future' but is way beyond two or three generations post-Harry. Not everyone's cup of tea though- it's a firefly crossover. Having attempted reading before I watched firefly, I can say that it doesn't make as much sense without having seen the show. I went back to the fic after I watched the series, and the plot/setting definitely made a lot more sense. I wish there were more/better examples that I could share.

  FutureFic. 70 years after the Fall of Voldemort the Wizrding World is peaceful - people live in a world free of injustice. But, somewhere, someone is working to destroy what Harry worked so hard for. A secret of great importance is poised to be revealed.

  The moment that muggles turn away from magic is the moment that their destiny was determined. 1100 years after the fall of Voldemort, two magical students discuss the effects that the Great Mistake and the Seeding have had upon the wizard world. Rated T for British swear words. Re-edited as of January 1, 2016 to include the Rising Tide expansion.
