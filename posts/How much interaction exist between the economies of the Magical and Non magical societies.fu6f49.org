I only ask because some stories have Harry being a multi-billionaire because he turned his wizard currency into Â£. Would this be impossible due to the amount it's not insignificant?


** I think it would be impossible to turn billions of pounds into galleons - there can't be nearly enough demand for pounds from Wizards to support that transaction.

Converting galleons into pounds sounds easier, however. Firstly because there's plenty of demand for gold in the Muggle world. Secondly because even if there's no demand for it, there's nothing to stop Wizards from using magic to alter a Muggle bank's books to create a new deposit of Muggle money (and use magic to prevent it from raising suspicion).

Given the numerous places in the world where huge amounts of money are squirreled away without anyone knowing, I doubt it would raise eyebrows even without the spells.

*** Wouldn't it be rather trivial for goblins to simply use the very large amount of pounds to purchase gold and silver to make new Galleons and Sickles?

**** So your proposal is that they give away gold in exchange for pounds so that they can... buy gold?

Might as well just keep the gold they started with.

The strategy would only make sense of Muggle gold is significantly cheaper than magical gold. Given the size and relative low value of galleons this seems unlikely.

***** We dont really know the exchange rate, the goblins could easily just give out less galleons than the muggle money is worth to make it still profitable. Its not like the person with the muggle money really has an alternative if they want to use it to purchase magical goods.

*** The typical way I've seen/pictured turning pounds into galleons would be through purchasing gold - which I think goes off the assumption that since the Philosopher's Stone explicitly calls out the creation of gold as one of its powers, that normal transfiguration can't do that (which'd explain why the only fake money we see are the leprechaun's galleons and other non-transfigurated gold).

Combine that with seeing goblins as greedy/wanting gold, and it's easy to make that make sense.

** I've read fics where Lily invested lots into microsoft, apple etc. making the Potter accounts earn a lot. Also in some Haphne fics, the Greengrass family exports and imports products in both magical and non-magical worlds making them one of the most richest in Magical Britain.
