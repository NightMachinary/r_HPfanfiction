Does anyone know of good fanfictions where a married or otherwise taken Harry is coerced or seduced by another girl? Gabrielle, Pansy, Hermione, really any person?

** No. I would not want to read a story about a weak person.

*** You may be distressed at having been downvoted so much, so let me just drop you a piece of advice --- when you don't like the subject of a prompt, just don't answer. Knowing you, you probably didn't mean any harm, but your phrasing probably felt like a deliberate insult to many people who'd like such a story, and felt you were calling them idiots for liking it.

**** I don't understand this. I did not mean to be rude! No I did not /want to/ insult anyone and I did not call them idiots. I don't understand. But also I am so so very sorry for losing so many points!

***** Oh, the points don't really matter. There's nothing to be especially "sorry" about. People on reddit, even on relatively "friendly" forums like this one, are just very quickly angered by what they think is trolling. As I said, if in the future a request doesn't seem interesting to you, ignore it instead of posting a message that says "I don't think this is good". It's sad we have to do this, but it's best for everyone.

****** Okay. Thank you. I will do that instead if it will not seem rude to people! And yes I did /think that/ the points didn't matter at first because I do not care about popularity, but then I was in this post and I saw that they made my comment invisible so they /do actually/ matter? It is not just to show how much people like you or not here? They make posts go away!

******* They don't actually make the post /disappear/, but if the points drop into the negative, the post is "collasped" --- it's invisible at first, and you have to click on the thin line of text remaining to actually read it. And yes, it's a bad system. What can I do?... If you want to ask anyone, ask reddit themselves.

******** Thank you for the very helpful information. I am glad they are not gone forever at least. I will go back to ignoring the point system then since they do not matter again.

*** The reason you were down voted is that this isn't a discussion thread, they are looking for stories not opinions. What you did is equivalent to commenting on a thread asking for cake recipes, "cakes are shit."
