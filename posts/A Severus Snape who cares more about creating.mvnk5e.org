Rather they're new spells, new potions, or whatever.

He doesn't join the Death Eaters or Voldemort, He could be sorted into Ravenclaw, or still sorted into Slytherin.


** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29469456?view_adult=true]]) sorta has that. He still joins the DE, but on raids is more focused on practicing spells

  This is the story of Lydia Bones, a perfectly normal and average person that chose to become a Death Eater over dying. ---------Lydia is called to heal Bellatrix Lestrange in the summer. She is unconscious. One arm is only hanging on by the ligaments and her chest is banded with deep scars. It would be so very, very easy to let her die. To bathe her in green light. But Lydia doesn't give a damn about a newborn boy named Neville and the most she cares about Sirius Black is to hate him. Their lives are not worth her own. The Dark Lord watches her work with glittering red eyes.---------Lydia was never a huge Harry Potter fan. She only ever watched the movies with her sister on snowy days, so she didn't realize what world she'd woken up in until her new brother went to Hogwarts when she was four. Before long, she went off to Hogwarts, where she met Sirius Black's brother (who she knows is going to die, even if she doesn't remember how) and Barty Crouch Jr (who she knows is a â€˜bad guy', even if she doesn't remember why). Now, she's graduated and Voldemort is knocking at her door and she isn't Dumbledore. She isn't brave or talented enough to tell him no.

***** Hey, I'm the author! Your comment made me lol, I loved it. I think what I meant in my summary was that she isn't a talented enough duelist or powerful enough witch to defy Voldemort. She might be good at technical bits of magic like healing and potions, but she isn't anything special when it comes to combative magic.

Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.

  As the Order knows full-well, only the pure of heart can cast a Patronus. When Snape saves Harry from the dementors and reveals his doe Patronus, the Order have reason to trust their spy. Snape knows that he could aid the war effort with his logic and ingenuity, but will the Order trust him enough to accept it? Order of the Phoenix, Snape-centric AU
