I'm wondering if any of you have Harry-centric favourites where Harry has a close but platonic relationship with a relatively in-character Snape?

I think I've read a couple like that but I'm blanking on remembering them. In fact I'm vaguely remembering one where Harry respects Snape in front of Sirius, much to Snape's surprise and Sirius's horror, but I don't know anything else about it.

I'm trying to avoid fics where Snape suddenly becomes caring or kind or fatherly or whatever. I want him to be pretty much the same snarky, bitter, antisocial asshole as always, but with a mutual respect with Harry, where they work together as somewhat-equals. Of course I'd love these to be dark-centric fics where they don't work against Voldemort, but I don't expect there to be many of those and I'll take what I can get.

A lot of fics I read, especially any do-over fics, mention a relationship like this between Harry and Snape, but don't show it. It's either memory or exposition or whatever. I'd like to actually see how it plays out on screen, with dialogue and everything.


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is known for its /excellent/ characterizations of the cast. Harry and Snape definitely have a close trusting relationship and Harry even ends up spending his summers with Snape but Snape is still a snarky, bitter jerk to Harry.

** linkffn(Stronger than Hope by Alaunatar)

Although Snape eventually does become Harry's guardian in this, he doesn't really become "fatherly". After the hatred stage, he mostly treats Harry like a wildlife rehabilitation expert would treat a wounded dangerous animal, with plenty of manipulation thrown in. Harry eventually begins to fire back.

I feel like this is my favorite fanfic characterization of Snape.

******* Yeah I was just looking at the word counts this author managed to churn out over the course of two years with horrified awe. It looks a bit dark for me, so I'm not sure when I'll get around to it. And I guess I don't mind Snape changing to be kinder over the course of thr e e mil li on wor d s.... that seems fairly believable. It's just some fics have it like a switch or a “misunderstood” type of thing and I just. What a waste.
