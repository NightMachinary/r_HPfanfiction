** You could try Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 B. C. by Aaran St. Vines

** I've written two fics which might interest you - It Started with a Wand, which centres around Sirius getting his wand at eleven and it being a sort of first step into the concept that he's different from the rest of his family, and It Ended with a Want, which centres around Regulus getting his wand a year later and basically confirms his similarity to the family and the new rift between him and Sirius that's formed since the events of the first fic. I tried hard to incorperate as much canon wandlore in both fics as possible to help the point of the stories and I'd be curious to hear if you agree with my wand choices for both boys :) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1606807]]

  The war was finally over and Harry had just started finding a life for himself away from the death and violence he'd experienced. He had a interested career, close friends and now family with Andromeda and his godson Teddy. Unfortunately his Potter luck struck and Harry finds himself in another universe, with new powers and a more established Voldemort wrecking the world. As much as Harry would love to just go home, it turns out he can't until he defeats Voldemort again...so much for retirement from war.
