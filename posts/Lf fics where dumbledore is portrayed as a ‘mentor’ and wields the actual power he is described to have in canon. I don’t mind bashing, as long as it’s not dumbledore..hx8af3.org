** "This year Harry, I have learned from my past mistakes. I am going to be completely honest and prepare you for the trials you have ahead."

"Wicked!"

"First we are going to see an old friend of mine to convince him to take a teaching position. Professor Slughorn."

"Oh? Okay... I guess..."

"Then I'll schedule some very crucial lesson with you this year..."

"Brilliant!"

"We are going to spend our time looking at memories. So you can understand Voldemort's train of thought..."

"That's training?"

"It sure is. Then you will try to convince Professor Slughorn of telling you the truth about a certain number of artifacts we need to find. It might seem inconsequential, but it is very,very,very,very important."

"If you say so..."

"And finally..."

"Yes?"

"I might as well teach you some magic in out spare time. I mean it is crucial that you know this Voldemort shit, but I guess it wouldn't hurt for you to learn some neat magic tricks. Basic stuff, like zombie-killing fire-rings, Giant statues control during wizarding duels, magic whips and strong water spheres to conceal the strongest of opponents..."

"Bloody fucking yes!"

"BY the way, Professor SLughorn is teaching Potions, not DADA. Not sure why I didn't clarify that to you earlier."

**** I really don't see strong combative magic taking that long to learn.

Cedric was animating stones to dogs by seventh year. And Hermione was casting fireballs as well.

Harry could beam fight Voldy even without brother wand effect.

I know people exaggerate, but if you train someone from 12 to 18 in combat and they dedicate themselves they are going to be pretty capable.

I don't agree with Harry roflstomping Voldemort after three months of binge training during Summer. I do see him beating a few Death Eaters.

I also see him after a few years not being useless against Voldemort if Dumbledore is around.

I see a very talented, trained a lot from 11, 17-year-old Harry beating Voldemort if he acquires the Elder Wand and the Cloak has that fandom ability to tank some spells.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
