Good characters doing dark or gray things "For the greater good"

They are not delusional. They *know* it's wrong. They know they won't be forgiven. Does a lifetime in Azkaban (or worse?) is worth it if they can make a better world for everyone?

Or for the wizards at least. Screw the Muggles.

(Not /Rise of the Wizards/ though. I read that already. Pretty good!)

Hopefully completed, and the longer the better.

If you have anything like that, I'd be very grateful.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), definitely fits your criteria. There are often situations in this fic that require Harry to commit 'necessary evils'. He has some seriously ruthless advisors and officers under his command who are egging him on, and another faction who are trying to restrain him.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
