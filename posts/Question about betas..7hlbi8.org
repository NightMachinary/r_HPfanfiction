So... I've been lurking around this site for a while, but I'm a Reddit virgin so I hope I'm doing this right... Text goes in text... right?

Okay, I've been writing a fanfic for about a year now and have been doing it alone so far, no one other than me reading it before publishing etc. Retroactively, I feel I could have definitely used another set of eyes to look over my earlier chapters but I sort of feel I'm doing alright by now? I've ignored the whole beta thing so far, but now I'm feeling a bit curious. I know people generally say that it's good to have someone read over your writing, but personally I don't really have anyone that I can ask that of. Do betas normally just check for spelling/grammar mistakes and leave it at that, or can I expect a bit more?

As I've said, I've been writing for about a year now and I'm about half way through what I wanted to write and I wouldn't mind the whole process going a bit faster. Definitely wouldn't object to the quality of the writing improving, but wondering what the positives and negatives are for getting a beta. And if it's mostly positive, can you give me any advice on how I'd go around finding one?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.

Depends on the beta, when lawyers or BigFatNo beta my stuff they also look at word-choice, plot inconsistencies, "that segment was boring", "why is he acting so stupid?", "that joke doesn't work" , "your pacing here is all wrong", "where did that desk suddenly come from?" and all that kind of stuff.

Positives:

- With a good beta, your writing /will/ improve
- The story will improve even more and faster
- You will have someone to bounce ideas of before publishing

Negatives:

- Betas are slow. They have their own obligations and don't always have time.

- You usually have to beta their story in turn, which takes time. Of course, it's also super fun, but it /does/ take pretty long if you do it properly.

- Positive and Negative:

- It's an additional hurdle. It's not only 'the readers' that are often stupid and dumb that will see what you write, no: If you write something you don't like you will also have to defend the fact that you gave the story in that form to your beta - which makes you often rethink stuff. Multiple times I cut stuff, because I couldn't justify giving it to my betas to read over it, which lead to the story getting better. On the other hand, an experiment "Let's change it from 1st to 3rd person" means that the other person has to re-beta most of it again and that doesn't feel nice to do.

In my opinion a beta is totally worth it, my writing has improved so fast thanks to lawyers and BFN. This goes especially if your beta is good and you talk with them outside of writing.

- Ask in this subreddit
- Ask in the A/Ns of your fic.

Usually you'll get a few PMs, more depending on your readership

** They'll go over what you ask them to or what they want to. It could be just the spelling and grammar, but I've had one contact me and say they'd be willing to tell me what works and what doesn't in chapters.

As to where to find them, I think ff.net has a section for it. The app does anyway.

** Autumn answered it mostly. At the minimum you want them to look over grammar/syntax/coherence.

Ideally they (in the fan fiction sense) can also discuss ideas of the chapter and how it flows though.

Let them help you shape the story.

** It's basically defined between an author and their beta, hopefully at the outset. You'd send a pm saying "I need help with [insert aspect of writing here], would you be willing to help me?"

** Betas range from not doing much, to doing almost as much as the author themselves. There's a few authors that have private groups where they post a chapter and a half dozen people pick through it, while the other end of the spectrum is having the one guy whose not really good at it, but eager to try, since it will help himself become a better writer as well. I know there's a fair amount of authors who started as editors before trying their own hand at writing. The kind of feedback you get is mostly reliant on what you're actually looking for. Communication is key.

As for me, I don't have any dedicated betas. Sometimes, if I'm looking for help (since I consider myself a mediocre to average writer at best), I'll put it over on DLP. If the story is interesting enough, then it will get a fair number of replies. Usually I just read through my own story 3-6 times before posting and then put an author's note on FFN asking for feedback on anything and hoping for the best. I don't look for perfection, since perfection is so tedious and boring.

** I've been working with my beta since I've been writing fic after OOTP came out. I reconnected with her after a long writing hiatus and she very generously agreed to pick it up again. She's super valuable for correcting my grammar (lay/lie/laid--ugh!), keeping things consistent and general HP fact checker. She doesn't do a whole lot of story advice, but I'll often bounce ideas off of her which can be very useful because I'm a "talk it out" sort of person.

In addition to my regular beta, my husband reads my chapters and he's really great for story advice. I've changed course on several things based on his advice and so far it's been for the better. If you have someone close to you who can read your writing and give you honest feedback, that would be great. I like getting constructive feedback, not just "It's good!"

Find someone on the same wavelength that you enjoy working with. Good luck to you!

** Thank you so much for all the replies. It definitely made me want to try and find one.

I looked around the beta page on the fanfiction.net website, felt really confused but in the end found a beta reader volunteer forum, where I just made a post.

Came to a realisation when I made the post, the story I'm asking people to beta for is around 270,000 words so far, so I'm wondering if the length people will have to catch up on will put them off...

I'll give it a few days and see if I get a reply. If not, I'll try one of the many helpful suggestions posted here.

** I was part of the post-beta team for Linkao3(The Debt of Time), and Shayalonnie had pages of descriptions about the things in particular that she wanted edited like the formatting of any spells used, pointed out plot holes that span a hundred and fifty chapters and many other things. I got in late in the game so I took some time to add in suggestions for things that would help bring all the scenes to life.

What the beta does for your story really depends on what you are looking for. Many betas help with plot development and can save a story from going into hiatus if you hit writer's block.

** Oh, nice to see you posting here.

The involvement of beta vary, for example for a fic I currently beta I give input on the content when I have something to comment on (that was what I was brought to there). To be more precise when I was asked to help with the project it was still in the planning doc phase, so a lot of commenting was done there, where setting and basic plotting were outlined. On the other hand I know that there are betas who only touch grammar and such.

As for where to search for betas, aside from mentioned earlier section on ffnet (profiles details for what stuff given beta does) you can also try to ask some more thoghrough reviewers. That's how I was recruited for example.
