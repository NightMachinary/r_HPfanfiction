Hey! A while back I read a really good Drarry fic, but I can't find it for the life of me! If you're willing to help, it would be much appreciated! Here is what I remember from the fic: 1. Harry is a twin 2. His twin is marked as BWL 3. James and Lilly Survive 4. Harry is pretty much neglected 5. A house elf takes it upon herself to raise and educate harry 6. Harry calls this house elf mum and she basically performs some kind of adoption ritual on him, giving him a few elven powers 7. Harry MIGHT'VE been dark, grey, and/or slytherin... Maybe even ravenclaw idk man 8. It's drarry ofc 9. I think harry might've liked the outdoors or to read? 10. Harry was pretty powerful and it was just a good read in general.


** I FINALLY found it!! After hours of searching! It's called Harry Potter: Gray Shadows Arc 1 by HouseElfMagic. It has three parts to it, and harry has elemental abilities. It's a bit corney but still an entertaining read.
