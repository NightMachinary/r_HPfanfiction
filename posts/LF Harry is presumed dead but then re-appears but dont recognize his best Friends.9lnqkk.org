So during the Battle of Hogwarts Harry dies by the AK and he possibly gets a Funeral. But after some Time a new Threat might appear and Ron and Hermione have to fight again. During this conflict, they meet Harry, but he dont remember or recognize them.

The Reasons for this can vary. Whether Harry actually survived the AK and then suffered Memory-loss post-war or Ron&Hermione are (accidently) draged into an alternate Dimension, etc.

Not necessary, but Harry might have changes in his appearance, like no glasses or a "Battlehardened" look (not scars, but physical appearance).
