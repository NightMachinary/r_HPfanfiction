Or perhaps Counselling of some kind, if you don't headcannon that he was an Alcoholic. Or just some variation of at least some of the Snape family actually seeing some professional help.

As a side note, I've checked briefly, and the NHS does cover counseling (and has existed since the late 40's), and AA is free and has been around in Britain since the early 50's, so the Snape Family being poor doesn't quite preclude this, and the timeline adds up, for those who with to take that into consideration.


** There is a fic that has a similar thing in that Snape's mum dies and he and his dad sort of get a bit closer, doing their best sort of thing. Snape goes to work at the factory and gets a bit fitter and his dad makes him go for a haircut and the stylist gives him some shampoo and possibly skin clearing potion or something. In return for his effort his dad promises not to drink as much.

It's pretty great because their relationship doesn't get better magically, they're not really compatible personalities and their lives are so different, but they try their best. But then the fic turns into a Severus/Sirius mpreg lmao

** I know I am actually not responding to your prompt but is it canon that Tobias was an alcoholic? I see this trope used in all Snape-centric fics but all I recall that he and Eileen were arguing a lot and he was a very unhappy man. Severus was not an alcoholic (from what we know) and he was a very unhappy and downright nasty man. I wouldn't be surprised if his shitty and attitude was what pushed Lily away and not necessarily the fact that he was hanging out with future Death Eaters (I mean how can you call someone that tries to defend you a very offensive name?).

*** Not cannon to my knowledge, just a somewhat common headcannon as far as I know. The prompt is mainly for the idea of "Hey, what could happen if Severus started getting a decent home life/father figure after his first year at Hogwarts?"

*** No. He was atleast verbally abusive, though. But we do not have a canon source for him being specifically alcoholic.

**** Well I, for one, really liked "A Difference in the Family" (I know I recommended that fic a lot) because the author is really good at making Snape sympathetic and expressing things from his point of view, while at the same time you know that he is a shitty human being through his actions.

****** Sure. It's actually a Snape biography from birth to death. Used to be canon compliant until Pottermore (it was finished in 2012). linkffn(7937889)

******* My only issues with the fic is how vague the friendship breakdown between him and Lily was (they remained sort-of friends after the /incident/, which is jarring to me since it strongly violates my headcanon), and how the fic sometimes goes to great lengths -- sometimes too far -- to justify Snape's behaviour, such as in the first Potions lesson with Harry.

Incidentally, IIRC, this fic is the only Snape-centric canon-compilant fic partway set in the Marauder-era where his feelings for Lily is strictly platonic from what I've seen, which I found somewhat interesting.

******** That's why I liked it so much. Because in the books it's unclear whether Snape liked Lily as a friend or whether he was obsessed with her. With Snape being so grey of a character, it would make sense that his feelings towards Lily remain unclear as well. It still makes more sense than an obsessed incel (as the sub likes to call him), because an incel's obsession would move on to someone else once the object of their affection is gone. Snape, despite being spiteful, protected her legacy to the end in canon.

********* I partially disagree. I do think his feelings for her (at least while they remained close) was romantic in nature. I do not, however, consider him an incel for it. Merely just having an unhealthy love, which is a result of being stuck in the past with unresolved regrets.

Incel implies that he blames her for the situation, which I don't believe at all. I think he just blames himself for it.

For the record, I don't consider this a fault with the fic at all, I actually like the idea of it being platonic, even if it disagrees with my headcanon. After all, while every scene we see from Harry's PoV and Snape's memories imply so, it's never explicitly stated. I could just as well see Snape happily letting Dumbledore misunderstand his feelings towards Lily, if it makes him seem more trustworthy to Dumbledore.

********** Maybe I'm thinking of it from my own perspective. When I was eight or nine I had a few friends that were girls. Over time I lost touch with them but when we reconnected I found out that some of them turned out really beautiful (and I mean really, really beautiful). Still, for whatever reason, I felt neither romantic, nor sexual attraction towards them. Snape and Lily met way before any normal child would feel romantic or sexual attraction.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
