Looking for stories where Minerva McGonagall actually does something as a teacher, maybe stopping the bullying between the Marauder's and Snape, helping Harry, Ron or Neville out or whatever.

Any rating is fine would rather it be completed but a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** Has to be linkao3(The Art of Self-Fashioning). One of the best fics in the fandom, and apathetic genius Harry done correctly.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

*** I'll give it a more thorough read after class, but I'm struggling after the first chapter. Some of the cliches happen to be ones that I find in poor taste, such as the immediately nicer (not nice, but close) Snape, twins finishing sentences (seems extreme in this one, multiple cuts in a single sentence), and is indicating Ron bashing.

For some I'm sure this is a great story, but I guess I'm a bit pessimistic and have my own tastes. Am I just making assumptions, or do these things get better/worse as the story goes on? I really do like the premise, just a matter of whether or not I'll like it enough to ignore my preferences. Thanks for the rec!

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor?
