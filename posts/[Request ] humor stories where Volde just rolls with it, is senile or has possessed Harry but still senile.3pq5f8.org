Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts.

  It's September 1993, and Lord Voldemort arrives (back) at Hogwarts to be sorted, and reflects upon her life since being reborn. Alternate Universe. Short sketch, intended to be vaguely humorous. One-shot. (typing error correction, 5th September, 2014)

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
