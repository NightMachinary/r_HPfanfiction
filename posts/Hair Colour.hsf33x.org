Is Harry's hair colour iconic to him, or can I change it. I've always thought it was the style that was iconic.


** If you do, it sometimes gets hard for readers to keep a mental note/keep track of the change. We're used to picturing messy, black-haired, green-eyed Harry.

Change it mainly if it's got some role in the plot, similar to describing clothes (only do so if necessary).

*** The colour change is quite a big part of the plot

**** If he's gone all punk, shaved his side and is now wearing his hear in a neon green mohawk, it's obviously important, if he's been blood adopted and the magic makes him look more like his new family, it's important, but if the hair is different for no apparent reason, then it's bad writing :)

**** Then go for it. You can trust the average reader to keep a mental note of the change in this case.

It's when people randomly just decide to switch up hairstyles and hair colours for no reason that readers gloss over it.
