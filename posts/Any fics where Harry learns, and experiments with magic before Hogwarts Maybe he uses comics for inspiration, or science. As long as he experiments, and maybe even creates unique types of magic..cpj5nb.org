  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

***** Not really. It's more a case of Dumbledore ignoring. Harry doesn't really care about any of the things he's supposed to, and so doesn't devote any real focus to Dumbledore's plots. Arguably it implicitly bashes Dumbledore as he bumbles along believing that Harry is a good little pawn and everything is well while actually Harry's a drug dealing, thieving little shit with a weird form of magic nobody else uses. But it's never the focus.

Essentially, Harry's a jaded, cynical, prematurely aged asshole who is constantly playing a chaotic neutral or chaotic good character, and part of that involves unnecessary swearing and the like. It sounds cringier from that description and quote than it really is.

******* I'm speaking in the more general sense, and it's not a criticism. As Harry himself thinks, he has a less strict sense of morality fit for grim cyberpunk worlds that allows for cons and grifting and crimes etc.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
