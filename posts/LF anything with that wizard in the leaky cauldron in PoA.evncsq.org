His one second of screentime is responsible for this entire category of characters:

** Honestly he's one of the most interesting charectors who isn't even one. He does wandless magic with little to no effort (unless it's an enchanted cup and/or spoon), sits in the middle of the Leaky and reads about muggle theoretical physics. Hawking actually has an entire chapter dedicated to the "arrows of time;" or explaining how time can be described as having a direction. Later on the PoA, Harry and Hermione essentially mess with the 'perception' arrow. It can be argued that they did not so much travel back in time as their past, secondary selves, "remember" the future. If the other two arrows aren't changing -- I.e; the timeline isn't really changing -- then events should occur as the charectors "remember" them, which is what happens.

Personally, I believe this man is actually an Unspeakable. Specifically, [[https://harry-potter-compendium.fandom.com/wiki/Broderick_Bode][Broderick Bode]]. He believed he was a teapot for a period of time before being murdered by Death Eaters. Also, his name means "omen"... Sort of like reading a book on theories of time foreshadowing time travel.

** I dunno of anything written about him, but fun trivia: he's played by Ian Brown, lead singer of The Stone Roses.
