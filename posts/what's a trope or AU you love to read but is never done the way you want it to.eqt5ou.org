hi there! i decided to ask this question because lately i've been way into ghost!draco AUs and all the ones i've read are great in their own way but... the resurrection scenes are very anticlimactic and just throw me off. has anything similar happened to any of y'all like this?


** I really like the "Harry is raised differently" trope, but no fic I've read keeps my interest past the few first chapters. Once you get to Hogwarts (if not earlier) you either go into the super OP Harry trope, or the repetition of canon trope, and I don't like either.

*** linkao3(Stealing Harry by Copperbadge) is IMO both the ultimate "Harry raised differently series", and the most realistic.

Then there's linkao3(the dogfather by hollimichele), and linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill by tb_ll57).

If you don't like any m/m pairings, background or foreground, linkao3(the rules of house elves by shivavixen) is pretty good.

These are all decently canon-divergent without having to make Harry OP.

I hate it when Neville is the BWL but Harry is still the in the top 5 characters who can beat Thanos without the infinity gauntlet and has sex with everyone from Mrs. Polkiss to Elphias Doge. He wasn't that OP even when he was the BWL.

Or worse, it is just canon with Neville being the BWL. This can be either Neville = Harry where they just swap names, or Harry does his thing but also Neville is there to be like "I wish you were BWL instead of me".

Though it does do a really good job of writing a coddled and celebrated bastard of a BWL, who is very arrogant and a little fuck of a human until fem!harry literally just hands him a fuck you notice and a minor redemption arc ensues.

Other than that he's mainly a primary background character.

Sadly, most of these then turn around and have them become good little lords who follow nonsensical rules and ettiquette.

Something like "Death does not judge" and having to hold his powers under control around mortals. And he has a cool scythe, of course, made purely for his entertainment.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]:

#+begin_quote
  *Post-DH AU*: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying.

  “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

  “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]]:

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

Here's a quote from "dead things":

#+begin_quote
  “We thought you were dead,” Shacklebolt says. He's an old man. They're all so /old/ , Harry thinks, and he's almost jealous stuck forever at almost-eighteen. A permanent teenager, he thinks, an absolute /nightmare/ . “It would have been better if you were,” Shacklebolt adds, and he sounds /disappointed/ . Harry scoffs.

  “Didn't you hear?” he asks, pleasantly, “I died. Several times.” The cheer drops and his smirk slides off his face, “Nobody noticed.”
#+end_quote

and another quote:

#+begin_quote
  “Hermione, I'm missing half my soul,” he says, plainly, and the words only have real meaning to about five people in the room, “The Dementors don't want me, you really think you'll think of something I /haven't already tried/ ?”

  Her face grows into one he recognises as her political Minister face, “Don't be ridiculous,” she says, “So the horcrux is gone, you're still here, aren't you? You walked away from that battle alive which is more than a lot of people, it's not an excuse, not a justification, you're /alive/ --”

  “I /DIED/ !”

** *Powerful Harry* - sadly for the most part these stories lack any merit whatsoever. For the most part they are indulgent self inserts. There are huge number of tropes related to this one. E.g. descendant of powerful witches and wizards, Goblins being a social service, Dumbledore is bad, Weasleys are after his gold, Slytherin house making him powerful, Draco Malfoy is instant best friend and Snape gives out cookies and shines rainbows, he is bonafide multi billionaire with hundreds of Wizangemot seats to his name, oh and Voldemort is simply misunderstood!

What saddens me is that "power" is almost never result of hard work, practice, research. These stories never depict the path to power, the drive, the ambition. Only destination. And even then it is mostly uber powerful wandless "Stupify" that he goes around shouting loudly. Rarely is his magical prowess displayed in any more imaginative or subtle ways.

Other than that, it messes with canon a lot, and it's basically it's own story, just with a Harry Potter veneer over the top.

In both stories they took away the moral ambiguity of the villain by making them "go too far" and start killing any purebloods instead of just death-eaters thereby making it okay for our protagonist to turn them in/kill them. Each time I really wanted to know how Auror Harry was going to deal with upholding the law against someone being chaotic good but every time the writer's solution was to just make the villain turn insane and evil.

** *Ravenclaw!Hermione* Unfortunately, authors who sort her there almost invariably make her life revolve around Harry in some form: either she's there alongside a smart!Ravenclaw!Harry who has all of Hermione's virtues and none of her flaws, or she's completely isolated and miserable until Harry enters her life. I even recall a fic that started so well, in which Hermione started Hogwarts a year early, made friends, but then what appears to be a smart!Harry showed up, and she and her friends adopted him on Hogwarts express and started teaching him spells.

*Hermione inventing and/or discovering powerful magic* This is a pretty common trope. Unfortunately, overwhelming majority of the time, said invention/discovery 1) happens only once, near the start of the story, and Hermione never does anything clever ever again; particularly because 2) its only function is to facilitate Harry's badass adventures.

*Harry not living at the Dursleys' before he turns 17* There was a /reason/ Harry needed to stay with the Dursleys in canon. And yet, how often do fics that move him out of said sanctuary even begin to consider the security measures that would be needed to give him the same level of protection? Does Harry ever have to follow additional precautions---such as not going outside without a bodyguard? How often do Harry and his guardians have to deal with assassination attempts?

**** Observe that despite being supposedly easy, none these things happened except for the Dementors. However, unlike most threats against Harry, Umbridge, when she sent the Dementors, was not acting on Voldemort's behalf, and so the sacrificial protection did not extend to her. (I.e., neither Umbridge, nor Fudge killed Harry's parents after asking them to step aside, etc..)

Dumbledore trusted Lily's sacrifice over all other options to protect Harry for 10 years. Consider: this is a wizard who knows more about magic than anyone alive, who both wants Harry to survive (out of the goodness of his heart) and /needs/ Harry to survive in case Voldemort ever returns. This wizard has a skilled militia and a literal magical castle at his command; and he can cast powerful protective magic, including Fidelius Charms. Bellatrix and some of the other most powerful Death Eaters are still at large.

Under these circumstances, this wizard determines that the safest place for Harry was with the Dursleys. If he thought that the protection didn't apply beyond Voldemort himself, he would not have done that.

When epic, once-in-a-century magic, which has stopped an unstoppable curse and slain an immortal wizard, falls into your lap, and provides you with an inviolable sanctuary against your biggest threat, you don't casually throw it away.

** Growing up with a different upbringing for Harry is something I love, but I hate the constant rehashes, and making the same friends, even though Harry should be totally different in his personality/attitude, and not be friends with Ron or Hermione.

Normally, it's him befriending Draco (Which I have a guilty pleasure for), but even then, I'm just kind of done with Harry befriending Draco. And as much as I absolutely love Hermione, I'm really done with Harry befriending Hermione.

I don't want bashing the characters or anything like that, I just want him to befriend different characters.

It's like no matter what, no matter what upbringing he has, what house he gets sorted in, he somehow ends up friends with Hermione each and every time, and I'm just like... why?

Wrong Boy Who Lived: I love the concept, but it's often brother or sister is the Wrong Boy Who Lived, and has what would have been Harry's life, even down to his friends and house, and position in Quidditch, and I'm just like why?

Plus I don't like the bashing in the Wrong Boy Who Lived stories. James and Lily would never neglect their child, and if it's the Dursley's; they wouldn't give a damn and would treat both of them the same, et cetra.
