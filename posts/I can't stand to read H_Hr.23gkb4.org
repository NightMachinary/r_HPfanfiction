Its not like I've not given it a try, especially because there are so many out there. But I've not liked the Hermione character because she just seems to railroad over Harry. I love Harry's character but where ever I've seen H/Hr Harry just doesn't shine as much. He relies too much on Hermione to do everything and can't form his own opinions and ideas.

Also, because most of the fics seem to be in the vein of "look how everything in the books would have improved if only Harry and Hermione got together, like they should have." It just gets so preachy and I'd rather see a Harry who makes his own mistakes and then learns along the way than to see him rely on Hermione to do all his thinking for him and everything goes well.

I don't mean to bash H/Hr writers but are there any Harmony fics where theres a Hermione that I could stand? Because I haven't found it yet.


** Well, it's seems the HMS Harmony is outnumbered in this thread :) But that's business as usual I suppose. As a tl;dr, I'd recommend Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori.

That said, Hermione railroads over every character. She is by far the strongest single member of the trio. It's really just the consequence of her being a Mary Sue. She'll railroad over Ron in R/Hr fanfiction as readily as Harry in H/Hr. And no, their incessant bickering and fighting that so many fanfiction writers mistake for affection and love doesn't somehow "even things out" between them if it's nearly always Hermione that comes out on top. In the days when I actively read fanfiction, finding a Ron that wasn't a dense, stubborn sitcom caricature of a man was a tall order.

But then again, we're talking about /fanfiction/, FFS. The average fanfiction writer isn't exactly of high caliber. And it's fanfiction with a deeply flawed (if not lovable) set of novels as canon. So I guess we'll all find something to hate.

*** Although Hermione is very clever and knowledgeable, I don't think she's good at quickly/easily applying her knowledge in the real world. I always thought that her penchant for rules, bossiness, and book-smart-not-street-smart kept her a believable character on level with Harry and Ron.

Thanks for the recommendation! I'll have to check it out.

*** I love Paragdim of Uncertantity, because it took canon and twisted it slightly. It had Hermione having a great love with Ron, Ron then dies and Harry and Hermione get it on.

My biggest issue with H/Hr is the continuing Ron bashing. It's so hard to find a story that doesn't have that. Often they'll start in year 4 or 5 and all of a sudden Ron is an asshole who feels he owns Hermione and that Harry is meant for Ginny and starts screaming hatful things at Harry.

My faves are when he rapes Hermione, or inexplicably starts throwing punches at Harry.

** It is almost a law that the majority of fics about the most common pairings end up being of low quality. Since these are the "safe" fics many inexperienced authors go for.

In a H/Hr story I expect to see:

- A Mary Sue Hermione.

- Weasley bashing for no reason. Extra points if usage of love potions is implied.

- The war against Voldemort being almost completely ignored.

- ...

In my experience the best stories are those with either no pairing or with weird and unusual pairings since only authors who are very confident in their abilities write stories like that.

it really saddens me because I actually like the pairing, I just wish there were more good stories about them.

** I have been an avid H/Hr shipper since the 4th book was released. I always thought they were meant to be. And I just disliked Ginny's character all around. When the movies were released, I liked her character less than I already did. The relationship with Hermione and Ron always seemed forced at best, and Harry and Ginny....well that never made sense to me at all. She loved the boy who lived, not Harry.

IN ANY CASE. You asked for a fic where you could stand Hermione. This is the best fanfic I have ever read, and the only one I have gone back and read multiple times. If this isn't a Hermione you can like, then there isn't one out there. It also keeps Ron normal, no bashing, no crazyness.

Harry Potter and the Circles End. Fucking amazing story. In my opinion, even if you don't like H/Hr, this is still an amazing book.

** Being a Ron/Hermione shipper till the day I die, I can't stand reading any fic with Harry and Hermione as a ship. Either there is Ron bashing which happens too much, or it is just not believable at all.

A shame, because I like reading soul-bond and time travel stories, and a lot of them are Harry and Hermione.

** I'm not going to say that you read the wrong H/Hr (even though you might have), but you are definitely blinded by fanon. Canon Hermione is equal parts horrible and awesome. Canon Harry is mostly horrible. “Hermione tries to make Harry a better person” is pretty much what the books are about. If you don't like that Hermione and Ron are the real heroes of the Harry Potter series, then I can't help you, but facts are facts.

Read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][this]] for a fantastic Hermione, or don't. If Harry was in any way great he'd be Luke Skywalker. He isn't, that's the point.

*** I may have read the wrong fiction - I'm not arguing. But...

I understand that Hermione is both horrible and awesome. And I know that the series couldn't have happened without Ron and Hermione. But I really think your not giving Harry enough credit here. He is not the best character at times, but really I think hes one of the best characters I've read. I just love him. I can't really say much more than that. I love Harry's character the most in the whole series. I'm probably biased, but who isn't?

***** In that spirit:

“What's up Ron?” said Harry, joining them.

“He -- er -- just asked Fleur Delacour to go the ball with him,” said Ginny. She looked as though she was fighting back a grin, but she kept punching Ron's shoulder.

“You what?” said Harry.

“I don't know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again. “What was I playing at? There were people -- all around -- I've gone mad -- everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the Entrance Hall -- she was standing there talking to Diggory -- and it sort of came over me --”

“Okay, right,” said Harry, “so, what did she say”

Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. “Yes, she said yes.”

I highly doubt it. I always figured that he just picked her because he didn't have a date yet and neither did she. He was never truly interested in either Patil twin and neither was Ron. The evening would have played out mostly the same.

** I completely agree with you. Trying not to be a basher, but I just can't see them together. I'm one of those rare people who can only read canon-compliant stories (Queen Rowling's word is law!). Plus, I spent far too many years waiting for Ron and Hermione to happen to just jump on board for any other pairing.

I absolutely LOVE the dynamic between Harry and Hermione, though. They just "click"; he's the gumption and she's the direction. They need each other in their lives, and I just melt over the idea that you can love someone endlessly and not be romantically attached. Everyone is always obsessed with pairing characters up, and I just want to sit back sometimes and enjoy the honest friendship.

So what if Ron and Hermione eventually needed marriage counseling? Tons of people do, and they still manage to make it work. That idea actually makes me love them a whole lot more! There's too much Ron bashing in H/Hr for me to be happy! You'd think that nobody loved him, and he's such an honest and believable character.

Also, and I'm probably the only person in the world that will say this, but I don't find Hermione to be a sexual character. I think so many people have forgotten the character in place of Emma Watson (not hating on her, but she will NEVER be my Hermione), and that girl is good looking enough to drive any fanfiction alone. I never felt that the Hermione from the story was looking for a sexual companion. She always shoved dating and companionship aside for better things (even when she was upset over Ron in book 6). For me, her character will always be first and foremost the "best friend driven to succeed". The romance was just the icing on the cake

*** I agree with everything here. I was also one of those people who was waiting and waiting for Ron and Hermione to get together. Also the marriage counseling- I've seen people who get married in high school or right out of high school always don't have the greatest long term relationships. The marriage counseling just makes it more realistic for me.

*** IMO, the main arguments behind H/Hr is that:

1. Harry is the main male character. Hermione is the main female character. Thus, by law of fiction, they must automatically hook up at the end of the series, preferably kissing while a huge explosion is going on in the background

2. Ginny was a horribly horribly underdeveloped character for the first 3/4 books before she did a complete 180 in personality (although she is still underdeveloped and 2 dimensional in the last 3 books). Plus the giant sign saying Oepedus Complex
