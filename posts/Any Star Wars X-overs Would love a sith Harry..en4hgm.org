Will take any but would prefer sith as I have read jedi more than once.


** I think you should give Adas Reborn a try. Harry becomes Count Dooku's apprentice. It's almost 300K long and is no where near finished. Here's a link.

** Linkffn(11765086) is pretty good, but it never seems to get recommended here.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11765086/1/][*/Sith'ari/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black][/Marquis Black/]]

#+begin_quote
  It all started with shooting stars, and would end with the rise of the Sith'ari - the perfect being of the Dark. Perfect strength. Perfect power. Perfect destiny. Imagine it? With the aid of a long-deceased Sith Lady as his mentor, Harry will become it.

**** Slowly getting sequel to Senju Naruto written. Currently only on chapter 7, need at least 12 before publishing (to ensure regular posting schedule).

And thanks for the compliment.

:D

Edit - if you enjoyed my Institute Saga, check out TWWNN's Last Son series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3228742/1/The-Last-Son-Book-One-Gatherings][Book 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3310696/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Two-Reckonings][Book 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4009890/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Three-Changes][Book 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8462837/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Four-Destinies][Book 4]]). It's got more characters, a better plot, longer chapters and is, IMHO, just written better.
