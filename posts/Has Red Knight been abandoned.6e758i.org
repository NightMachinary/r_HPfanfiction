Has Red Knight been abandoned? It hasn't updated for quite sometime.


** It's been less than two months. I wouldn't call it abandoned. If this is a year later, maybe, but not yet. Maybe the writer is just busy.

** The likelihood of this story being abandoned is very high. The author has been too ambitious and progression is too slow.

** I would've liked an explanation of what happened in the previous timelines, but other than that I didn't think it was that good of a fic. Just another mystery box story.

*** Yeah, the premise was great but it got so boring I had to dip out.

**** I got sick of Ron palling around with the Slytherin kids. It started to feel more than a bit forced to me, that interaction as if they were his peers.
