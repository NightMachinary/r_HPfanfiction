Hello all! I cannot believe this subreddit exists! I recently came back to Harry Potter fan fiction after a long hiatus. I'm searching for a fic from the early 2000s. In the story, it is revealed that Rowling is a muggle who learned about Harry. The series becomes a biography, not a fictional book.

I thought I remember reading such a story...though it was so long ago, I could be imagining it all.

Hope you guys can help!


** I don't think it's the fic you're looking for, but this is similar:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2053712/1/][A Muggle In The Magic World]] Â» It is absolutely impossible for a muggle to find her way into Diagon Alley, visit Hogsmeade, see Hogwarts and play a pivital role in the magic world without having any magical abilities. This fanfic proves it all wrong. COMPLETED. Harry Potter, K+, English, Adventure & Fantasy, chapters: 36, words: 60k+, favs: 170, follows: 45, updated: Feb 1, 2005 published: Sep 11, 2004, OC, Harry P.
