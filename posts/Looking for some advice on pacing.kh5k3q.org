I'm thinking about writing a fic that mixes Harry Potter with an element from another story, and right bow I'm planning on starting from year one and going through the events of the series in order, with more and more divergence as the story goes one. I'm sure thousands of fics like this exist; I've read more than a few myself.

What I'm wondering is, how do you write a story like this without the first few chapters just feeling like a boring, mildly altered recap of the first few books? This is a pretty common pitfall from what I've seen, and I'm wondering if anybody has tips on how to avoid it (beyond "don't write this kind of story" :P), or if they've read any fics they felt did a good job of handling that issue, I'd be interested in checking them out.

Thanks!


** This depends on how far your divergences go, and how they impact the story.

If the impact of of your divergences can be summarized in the description or the first one or two chapters you should probably simply skip the first few years.

For example: After barely surviving Quirrell, the Basilisk and Dementors Harry hoped that he fullfilled his quota of near death experiences for the rest of his Hogwarts years. All his hopes were crushed when he, and his best friends Justin, Susan and Susans aunt Amelia were target of an assassination Plot during the Quidditch World Cup.

In this case all the mayor divergences are part of the description. Harry is a Puff and Ron and Mione are substituted by Susan and Justin. The real original Plot begins after the Quidditch World Cup.

If that is not possible you should focus on writing completely original scenes, and especially avoid scenes that are in every ff that summarized the first few Hogwarts years. For example the duelling club or the first ride on the Express nearly always feels the same and extremely repetetive.

If you are repeating a canon scene think twice if it is actually adding something new to the story.

Also try to make it feel like the changes you make in the story have an actual impact. I once read a fic where Harry was literally Merlin reborn and the only two major deviations from the canon story until fith year and nearly fifty thousand words, were that Sirius got a trial and Harry was in a relationship with Daphne.

All in all it depends on the story

** You can just skip it tbh. Drop the reader into where your story starts and do flashbacks for context people or thinking back on the past. All the changes that happened in the world, how they've effected it and gotten to the place you are at will be somewhat of a mystery.

** my eyes glaze over when I read scenes in fics lifted straight from the books or movies, so what I prefer (and what i'm trying to do) is writing the in between scenes and just gesturing towards the canon scenes to keep everything straight. like on the train before third year:

#+begin_quote
  all the slytherin kids catching up (briefly write this)

  draco/crabbe/goyle go to bully harry/ron/hermione (skip this)

  draco/crabbe/goyle talk about how they DEFINITELY did not get scared away by the scruffy looking teacher in h/h/r's train car. convo quickly changes to something else and/or someone makes fun of them.
#+end_quote

so the reader knows when/where they are but it's still new to them. you'd have to choose when to explicitly write out divergences, but at the beginning, i'd err on the side of "if it can be summarized in a line of dialogue, do that."

** Just skip it. Either just start in the moment your story becomes interesting, or write your prologue, send (appropriately changed) Harry to Hogwarts, and then skip to the moment you are interested in. DO NOT include years of time which are essentially the same as the books.

** I've done just this. In the first few chapters I made sure to establish what was different and therefore any consequences of this even if they are small (ie Harry can't speak parseltongue, the Dursley's give him his Hogwarts letter, Harry and Draco's first meeting goes differently, they kill the troll in the bathroom etc). Also don't be afraid to build on these changes and you'd be surprised how interesting you can make some of the usual story beats.
