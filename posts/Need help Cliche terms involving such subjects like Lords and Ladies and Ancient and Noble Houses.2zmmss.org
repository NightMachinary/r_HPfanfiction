What is the common term used for when a character (like Harry) wants to formally protect another character (like Hermione) through means of his house?

Is it Vassal? I think I've seen that term before, but I've read so many stories that everything gets mixed up.

Edit: phrasing

***** The Malfoys no longer occupy the Muggle sphere, having chosen to focus on Ministerial power after the Statute of Secrecy. However, as far as we know, no monarch has revoked whatever title the Malfoys had at the time the Statute of Secrecy was passed (if indeed the Crown even retains enough awareness of the wizarding world to know the title exists).

If the Crown has not revoked the title then it still exists and will have been passed down the male line, which means the Malfoys are still nobility.

I actually quite like the idea that the Malfoys are rather ashamed of their title, with its implications of Muggle connections. Their family's past in the courts of the Muggle monarchs is something they try to keep quiet, so the title would be something you could use as an insult against them.

***** None of that is from canon. All we know from canon is that the Malfoys are rich (or at least the have a manor and act like they are) and that Lucius Malfoy has a lot of political power re: influencing Fudge. Nothing about houses having (or having ever had) any formal status is ever stated in canon; all we know is that the Blacks call their family "the Most Ancient and Noble house of Black". And there's nothing to say they aren't just full of themselves.

****** Actually, we know that the Malfoys were nobility from Pottermore, which stated that they were part of Queen Elizabeth's court (and other monarchs also). One of them even courted the Queen herself. You only have access to that if you're nobility.

Pottermore also tells us that they were given their land by William the Conquerer, which likely makes the title they hold that of "Baron Malfoy". (William rewarded his Barons with land after the successful invasion of England). However, they may have accumulated higher titles since that time (it's unlikely a mere Baron would have had any realistic chance at wooing Queen Elizabeth).

** 'Vassal' is more like someone who enters into service of a house, like a knight. Maybe you're looking for more of a 'ward' type of definition, if you're going for protection?

I'm basing this entirely off of Google and the first season of Game of Thrones, by the way.

**** Vassal is your word. The guy above is right, but vassals swear service in return for protection.

Ward implies more along the lines of parental guardianship. Whatever Harry's many titles, he's not Hermione's guardian.

Incidentally, a vassal would swear to a liege lord, but I don't think that term applies to any modern sovereignty (e.g. England's monarch).

While I don't know the particulars of your story, I imagine any world in which Harry's 'lordship' can formally declare protection over Hermione would treat her as a servant of the house. Especially since she's muggleborn.

** I feel like just saying she's under the protection of the house of __ might work. Or saying that she's a "favourite." That usually meant that the person had no real power, but that you had to be polite and deferential to them because they were close friends with the king/queen/etc. Or making her an advisor or something?

Vassal is more someone who's working under the Lord, it doesn't really suggest that they have special protection or that they're particularly favored by the Lord.

"Ward" kind of works with your description, but it's a little bit demeaning and makes her sound like an underage charity case. Hermione wouldn't want to go around saying "I'm a ward of the house of Potter."

*** Unless Harry's adopting Hermione to the family, saying she's a 'favorite' or 'under the protection' of a House would just mean that she currently curries the favor of said House, which is temporary.

Traditionally speaking, Lords and Ladies wouldn't just go around declaring protection without receiving something in return. Even if Harry didn't expect anything back because he's that kind of guy, officially that relationship would be established.

*** Feudalism is, at it's base, an agreement between a liege and a vassal. The vassal promises service, of whatever kind, and in return, the liege grants protection. Traditionaly, land was a large part of it as well.

**** IMHO "vassal" only works if Hermione has something fairly substantial to offer or would be basically managing people/land on Harrys behalf. Traditionally it was land and manpower. My guess from the original post was that Hermione wouldn't have much to offer Harry in exchange (other than her winning personality and her company). But I might be wrong. OP?

** I believe they could offer sanctuary? Vassals are/were usually Knights, minor houses, and cadet dynasties who were in the service of a more powerful entity, in exchange for protection, so it's not too bad a word to use, if not technically correct :)

** In feudal times, the church and lords of the land had the power to offer sanctuary (much like how nation states of today offer asylum), not sure if that's what you're going for though. I don't think it works within the story narrative, the pureblood lines seem to have merely adopted regal names, titles and attributes, they don't seem to be true nobility or feudal lords or even close to it (if they were, the Malfoys would hardly need to worry about ministry raids and the like)
