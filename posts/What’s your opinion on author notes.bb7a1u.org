I don't mind author notes, but when they start getting longer and longer. So by four or five chapters in you have more authors notes then story. (That last bit is an exaggeration) though long author notes are a plague to a good fix.


** It's acceptable as long as the A/N is relevant to the story. When your author's notes do the following, it's time to dip out for good.

- Long real world political commentary, about religious or social issues. The author of "For the Love of Magic" puts Islamophobic rants in his notes.

- Shilling for random stuff. "Vote for me in Dramione Society's Christmas Writing Competition!"

- Complaining about reader engagement or blackmailing for likes. "I won't post the next chapter unless I see 100 new reviews. If I don't see 40, I'm abandoning this fic!!!"

- Acting out weird little skits between the author and the story characters.

** depends what site you're posting on, i like ao3 because the authors notes are clearly separate and you can skip them if you want, whereas on ffnet i've seen people not separate theirs and it gets confusing, or god forbid they interrupt the fic to post an AN which is peak 2008 and embarrassing. either way you're reading someone's fic that they put time and effort and care into and they're entitled to put notes and feelings if they want.

** I love reading them, and I don't hesitate to write them. The one thing I hate is when they spoil the chapter at the start, like 'in this chapter, x character meets y character and z character finally returns from place.'

I enjoy seeing the author's thoughts, and it's fun to come to a completed fic and see a live-feed as it were of what the author thought was worth saying at the time they were writing it.

As an example from another fandom, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3975597/1/Only-Right][Only Right]] has an essay of an author's note at the start; I read the whole thing and was glad to have done so.

​

That said, there are some forms of author notes which do drive me crazy. Review responses, in which they say 'xxusername, yes I am! yyusername, You'll have to read and find out.' etc. without context, are incredibly frustrating. Attempts at bribery 'if I get eight hundred reviews, the next chapter will include z' or guilt trips 'there were only three reviews last time, no one likes my story' for reviews make me mad. And, as some have already mentioned, any time the writer is chatting or RPing with the characters is just cringey and very offputting. Make a separate story for that kinda thing if people are into it.

** Hate them. Worst ones are the ones where the author replies to reviews, often time leaving out the context. Second worst is explaining elements in the story, shit that should be explained in the story itself.

I only use them myself to give some idea of an update schedule. For example, in Euphoria, which is 23 chapters, I only had 2 author's notes. One for the first chapter and one for the last chapter.

** If it lasts more than a single small paragraph at the end of the page, then it is annoying. There isn't anything wrong with the author wanting to talk to readers, but there is something wrong with artificially inflating the word count. I can't stand it when the writer clearly put more effort into the AN than the actual story.

Author Notes tend to be the vehicle of lazy writers. Where they explain the story in the AN instead of, ya know, in the story. JK Rowling didn't write an author's note explaining what Holly and Pheonix feather wands mean nor did she talk about the twin wands within an AN either.

** "That last bit is an exaggeration" it's not actually. I remember at least two stories where the AN was far longer than the actual chapter, in every chapter. And then when I politely pointed it out to the "writer" I got a spiel about "my author's notes are really important and all my readers read them and love them".

Yeah sure, that's why they had less than 10 reviews.

Anyway, this to say that if an author needs ANs to give more information about the story then they are not writing it well enough. It's doubly worse when the ANs are smack in the middle of the story telling, completely ruining the immersion of the reader. Not to sound harsh or anything but it's quite amateurish.

As for the ANs where they are just blabbering on about personal stuff, I don't see the appeal personally but it's not as annoying as the first case.

On the other hand the smartest ANs I've ever seen was a girl with very popular stories that would write a random question at the end for the readers to answer and in that way probably doubled or tripled her review count. Very smart of her.

** My author's notes tend to average sort of longish (as I tend to write super long, verbose sentences that almost qualify as run-on despite being completely grammatically correct) so I try to put them at the end of my chapters, in bold, with the exception of the first chapter/prologue where I explain basic things like the premise or plot bunny that spawned it at the start.

Also, please refer to my prior comment about long, verbose sentences. I think that one up there approached fifty-odd words. It's actually kind of amusing.

** I utilize them personally. In my stories, I have the disclaimer at the start, and author notes at the end.

My author notes are normally consisting of, Why did this chapter drop at this time instead of any other time, What I hoped to gain from the chapter (normally in a vague question/statement) and possibly a preview into the next chapter. Honestly, those are not for the readers half as much as they are for me. My laptops die, my stories get lost, shit happens. But by reading my author note, I can understand exactly the context of the chapter, without having to reread it. I can scroll to the bottom and read it again, and understand exactly what I needed to cover in the next chapter by looking at my flow outline. (which is hard copied... no losing that) I also plan on taking every note out of my stories when I am done working on them

** I'm fine with people doing whatever they want at the end of chapters but anything besides a disclaimer at the beginning should be avoided at all costs.

Authors who write 'skits' at the beginning of each chapter set me on edge. There is a guy who runs a major video game developer who is also an amateur magician. He goes out of his way to perform magic tricks during these huge presentations about their games...basically forcing the hundreds in attendance to wait to hear about what they care about so he can indulge in his hobby for a few minutes. That is what the skits reminds me of. Entirely self indulgent and not entertaining in the least.

** This is an interesting one to be honest.

Ideally, a simple preface and/or postface would be nice, but it's not a method typically used in fanfiction. General authors notes work, but they tend to be awkward and immersion breaking, especially on fics that have already been finished, on work in progress fics it's generally less so, as the reader often has to wait days, weeks, months or even years between chapters anyway.

** The type of author note I like to see is the sort nobody ever writes. At the end of the epic graphic novel From Hell, Alan Moore has a mass of notes on almost every panel of the story. They explain details in the art or text that add extra background; go into the background of the story; offer supporting evidence for theories and so on. It adds a lot of fascinating information.

What we tend to get with most HPFF stories are details about how hard a chapter was to write. I believe there are rules on ff.net - I seem to recall Nightmare of Futures Past having long notes and then the author saying he'd been told off and had to scale them back.

But tbh the only authors notes I actively dislike are the ones that try to blackmail readers by saying they'll write another chapter when there are 100 reviews or something. Those can fuck right off.

** Some are ok, some are not. But I usually ignore them, even if they're the kind I don't mind.

Really though, my biggest problem with them is when they're hard to distinguish from the story itself. I prefer all-bold or similar formatting on it so that I can easily skip over it when I don't feel like reading it (One of the main advantages Ao3 has over FFN).

The worst offense, however, is author notes in the middle of a chapter. It gets annoying really fast and will probably just make me stop continuing to read your fic.
