** Harmony, all the way. I just don't see how Hermione would ever go with Ron, given how he treated her, for the longest time.

And while I agree, that the way Harry's relationship with Hermione was quite clearly fully platonic, in canon, there were plenty of opportunities where it could have morphed into something more.

And I honestly think, that if Rowling hadn't done such a weird u-turn with Harry's personality, in the summer, between second and third year, a relationship between her and Harry, would have been the only logical way to go.

** Maybe it's because I love the whole best friends fall in love dynamic, but I've always liked harmony.

That being said I feel like people in this sub hate harmony mainly because of the people who ship harmony. They(not all obviously) are kinda full of themselves. They have such a high regard for their ship and they look down on every other one. They hold harry and hermione on such a high pedestal and bash other favorites into the ground like the weasleys and Dumbledore.

And most of the fics aren't that good. I've only found a few gems and I basically only read harmony fics.

*** This.

Some of my favorite stories deal with Hermione. But at the same time, a lot of their writers tend to overplay it a lot. Not just write only Hemione romances, that's fine. Write what you enjoy.

But I've seen a lot of ones that go wayyy too far, basically bashing other females in the story for no reason and/or when writing a multi story, still having Hermione be the 'best'. You don't tell another woman you're supposed to be marrying that you will always love Hermione more, she's the bestest ever. That is not a good way to start a relationship or polyamorous relationship. And I've seen that /multiple/ times.

Also, I've seen them downplay Hermione's flaws in weird ways so even when she does wrong, she doesn't do wrong.

** I feel like Harmony is the only canon pairing that is actually fleshed out, while in fanon it is often just /terrible/. Bashing, trope-y, immature. A lot of Harmony fics are... well, bad.

In canon, though, it works - that's mostly because of how bad of a job JKR did with Ron/Hr and H/G. No self-respecting teenage girl would go for a guy who treated them so poorly for years on end; meanwhile, all of Ginny's character development happened off screen, so the stuff we saw felt very forced and obviously like the author was trying to shoe-horn her preferred pairings.

*** While I tend to agree with you, I think you tend to forget how far a little kindness can go for an insecure lost teenage girl... and I am writing this even though I recently wrote some posts defending Ron. Hermione might be brilliant from a theoretical stand point but she is socially awkward and is seen as a second class citizen in her world. Ron, despite being a dick at times, is the only one who shows genuine kindness and acceptance towards her and, even though he treats her badly at times, stands up for her even against Harry, something that the latter never does. And these little acts of kindness have a more powerful impact especially for those that are not really comfortable in their world... just think that most girls that end up trafficked are girls from backgrounds that warrant them second-class citizen status and most times the way traffickers seduce them is by showing them some kindness at first (good thing Ron is not that type of garbage).

Edit: hate all you want but if you read the books carefully, you'd see that Harry is most of the times shitty towards Hermione but in more subtle ways that Ron. Ron, on the other hand, can be extremely shitty or extremely kind. And while he is shitty towards her, he doesn't allow anyone else to be, even going as far as cursing himself into vomiting slugs to defend her honor.

**** The same Ron that uses a pick-up-artist handbook to try and seduce her? Hm.

I'm not sure those little acts of kindness would, to an inexperienced 17-year old with no foundation in romance to fall back on, make up for Ron ruining the Yule Ball, or almost getting her killed by a troll, or making out with her roommate in front of her (that one applies with Ginny too ðŸ˜‚), or abandoning her in the middle of the most stressful and dangerous period of her life

I'm not saying I wouldn't have acted how Ron did - teenagers are stupid, after all. But the idea that /immediately/ after it was all over he essentially turns to her and says "fancy a shag?", that Hermione would spread her legs rather than kick his teeth in makes me disgusted with all parties involved (JKR included!).

***** Regardless of stupid reactions of crushing teenagers, he is still kinder than most to her and is always ready to defend her when other people are mean to her. Also saying that he almost got her killed by a troll is seriously stretching it to fit your narrative because Ron didn't forcefully put her in a bathroom that happened to later be attacked by a troll. If we were worried that every annoyed remark we make about someone annoying could kill the other person by circumstances we could not predict then we'd have to shut up for half the time. What if your comment disagreeing with me makes me go crying in a bathroom that at a later time will be attacked by a troll? You won't even be able to come save me.

** I think it depends with Harmony. Like it really doesn't work with fics that follow canon events. The way their friendship develops in the books feels purely platonic, and trying to turn that into a romance just feels forced.

That being said, most of the AU Harmony fics I've read are actually fine. Hermione's and Harry's personalities mesh really well in my opinion. Especially with fics where the two of them meet in the Muggle world before Hogwarts, or fics where they aren't friends with Ron.

** I hated Harmony. I don't think they're well matched at all. Without Ron to balance them out, Harry and Hermione get on each other's nerves. See book 4 and 7. I mean they love each other, but they couldn't be in love. Besides I always loved the idea of having a platonic love, the idea that a man and woman could love each other as siblings and best friends is so beautiful that adding romance cheapens their relationship.

*** I agree with this. Harry and Hermione have a sibling-like relationship at best. Harry always prefers Ron's company to Hermione if he can choose, because he finds Ron fun to hang around. He needs that fun in his dark and grim life, which Hermione can't provide, but Ginny can.

** Absolutely. There is no romantic chemistry between Harry and Hermione. Just because they're friends, and we see them interact a lot more than Harry and Ginny doesn't mean they're more suitable as a couple or that they fall in love for that reason. That's usually not how falling in love works anyway.

Harry and Ginny all the way!

** I like Harry and ginny together it's my favorite pairing.

*I posted my thouhts on Harry and Hermione on another post about Harry and Hermione so I'll copy it below*

I personally don't ship Harry and Hermione because they're just too different. Hermione is way too bossy, she always has to be right and if you think she's not she'll argue with you until you tell her she is. I can't see Harry putting up with that especially since she seems like she'd want to argue about even the smallest thing.

What would they even talk about on dates they don't really have much in common.

Ron and Hermione don't seem like they'd work long term. They seem like they'd be hyped up and passionate just after the war but when things settle down they would quickly find it just didn't work. You can't have a relationship on just arguing after all and the only other thing they have in common is being friends with Harry.

But I can at least see Ron and Hermione getting together for a bit. I don't see Harry and Hermione together at all.

Honestly Hermione annoys me. But if you like the ship that's cool everybody's allowed to like whatever they want.
