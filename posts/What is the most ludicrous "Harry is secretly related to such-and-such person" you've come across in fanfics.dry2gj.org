Just wondering how out there the concept can get at times.


** Well, the most ludicrous I can think of was just that ludicrous because of the sheer number of people he was related to. I think the generic Gringotts heritage scene took like 10000 words and ended with Harry being the heir to pretty much every historic magical person ever mentioned in the fandom. Of course all written out in the classic way with excrutiating details about inherited money, investments, magical traits, properties, marriage contracts and so on. I remember checking the genre, because I could not believe that is wasn't a parody of the trope... But yea, the author seemed to be serious.

I can't remember what the fic was called though.

*** I don't get why it happens though. One of the main theme of the novel was that blood status means nothing and being a pureblood or a muggleborn makes no difference. Then we see fanfics with harry being an ultimate pureblood, heir to all wizarding families and the lordship giving him ungodly powers. Like honestly what

**** It's a power fantasy, really. For instance, the scene where Harry comes across his inheritance in canon is a big moment - when I was young, it's a magical moment. /Wow, look at all that gold he gets! Amazing!/

Some people want to recapture that feeling, with a bit more satisfying elements to it - including magical items in it, for instance. There's always been strong appeal to finding out a lost heritage or background you never knew about - fairy tales build up a fantasy of becoming (or discovering that you were) a prince or princess, for instance.

Others just like to have a powerful Harry or main character, and Wizarding Society /is/ set up to have an aristocratic element to it. It's set in the UK, where there is still explicit royalty and nobility (even if mostly ceremonial), it's got purebloods, it's got ancient houses and heirs, it plays into the tropes of inherited power (parseltongue being a mark of Slytherin for instance, or the Hallows), and so on. It's one easy way to bump up Harry's power level - politically, giving him inherited seats makes him someone that has to be reckoned with and has real power in society, without having to give much time to it. Magically, they can include powerful artifacts or secrets that are passed down within family lines, which can help power up Harry.

Basically in that case, it's a shortcut to go from "Regular Harry" to "Superpowered Independent Harry" in a short amount of time. And then if we're using that to power Harry up, that also means that inheritance can't be /wrong/, as that's the whole justification for his power boost, meaning that purebloods are right (to an extent). Also, combine it with being generally anti-Dumbledore, and Dumbledore being a fairly visible opponent of the purebloods, and you get that they were just misunderstood and that we shouldn't feel bad for Harry becoming so powerful because of those traditions.

*** It's already very odd even in a "magical" world for this kind of contract to list every person/title you are related to as well as the money you get, but I always find it ridiculous if the Master of Death title is listed on these things, like how on earth would some kind of magical potion know that. Though I habe to shamefully admit that I (used to) love these fics if they are well done but I haven't read one in a long time with that trope.

*** That has the potential to be good. Like, up to 11 he thinks he's 'just Harry' and then he finds out he's the boy who lived. Then he finds out he's the son of Freddie Mercury in the muggle world. His 'just Harry'-ness just got taken away. The next bit could just be exploring the effects on his psyche, what would change, etc.

That could be good. I'd read it.
