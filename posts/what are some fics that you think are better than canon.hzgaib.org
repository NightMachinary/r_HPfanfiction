they have very overpowered main characters but the worlds they inhabit feel extremely lived in and have wide ranges of characters who all seemingly have motivations and plans outside of what we the audience are directly witnesses too.

*** Ah, Prince of the Dark Kingdom is the story that introduced me to HP fanfiction, so it holds a special place in my heart. The writing quality is pretty rough though, it would benefit a lot from a thorough edit.

**** Honestly I'd agree, I think it just comes to the length of time it was written over. Near on a decade of writing time and no serious cleanups were done. For example that whole retcon of sirius/Remus near on a hundred chapters later is kind of silly because it's at best a few edits it's a very minor sub plot but it's retconed on page rather than through editing.

Starnlicht is also rated highly in my arbitrary system, though I can't remember it well Linkffn(8596476)

If you don't mind the style, The Changeling might also fit the bill. Linkffn(6919395)

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

#+end_quote

I'd like your opinion on the story.

I read it some time ago; before book 2 was finished, actually.

What I remember of it is being interested but bored. I remember thinking that despite Hermione's skills, stuff happened /very/ similarly to canon and that her skills weren't quite as good as the story presented them.

For example, I remember thinking that she should've been way more powerful that she actually was and getting vibes that her power/influence over events wasn't really consistent.

When I'm thinking back to the story, I get a feeling of dissatisfaction and boredom. My thoughts always circle back to Hermione not actually /doing/ anything essential to differentiate the story. I remember it as more of a canon rehash than the AU it's premise shows it to be. All bundled together with slow pacing and with a hint of lacking internal-consistency (example: Hermione being so smart but still taking so long to do things).

​

Now, as I said, it was a long time ago. Do you think I'm miss-remembering? Does it have any of the qualities I describe? I want to read it, but's it's 1.2 million words long and I don't want to commit to reading something that long only to be disappointed.

**** I understand how you could see the story that way, especially in it's early state. I agree, the early story is very much a canon rehash, but it really does continue to build until the end is wildly different from canon. It also does a great job of using everything laid down in the early story as the books go on.

The issue with consistency I think is that the author took more of a realistic approach with the characters and at the start the point is that Hermione is just a kid who is very smart and great at math. Her influence over the course of events grows and she grows as a person and I find watching that change happen to be very satisfying.

As for the length and boredom, I don't know what to say to change your opinion on that other than the fact that everything you read matters to the story in some way or another. Personally, I also really love a story that takes its time and lets us live with the characters in moments that are less action packed or strictly necessary to the story. I find a lot of character development happens there and I really love how lived-in the world feels when you get to see the more day-to-day stuff. I understand that's not everyone's cup of tea, but that's what this author seemed to be aiming for.
