:END:
Don't remember much, and I think I read to similar stories about the same time (possibly same author). Interested in title for either or both.

Lilly lives. James may also be alive? The Grangers are told about magic. Harry and Hermione grows up as friends. Potters and Grangers friends.

Lilly (and James??) takes Harry to the dentists or otherwise meet the Grangers. I think Hermione becomes "besotted" by Harry, and they start playing together. Possible Hermione shows some accidental magic.

Somehow Lilly becomes aware the cottage is under attack (wards?) and phones James. Not sure if James gets out.

Lilly explains magic to the Grangers. Harry and Hermione grows up close together, plays, and attend school.

Possible Lilly and Harry (and James?) becomes the Granger's neigbours. Babysits and raises eachother children.

I may be mixing in a third story here - if I do, I'm interested in that title too... Lilly and the Grangers meets Amelia Bones (auror-duty due to attack), and Amelia and Susan soons moves in next door. All three raises the children together. All good friends. Possibly joined back-yards. Barbeque?

Does this sound familiar to anyone? (Wheter it's being one, two or three stories ;-)

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
