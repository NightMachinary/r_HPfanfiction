I've never actually seen an abundance of fic of this trope, at least not really well-written ones. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6590337/1/Aurelian][Aurelian by BittyBlueEyes]] is one great example of this. Do you have any recs similar to this concept? I'm not really particular with any pairings, I'm always here for the plot. Actually any timeline would do. I just wanted to see someone from the future come to their timelines and not the other way around.

I actually tried to write in this concept but somehow got sidetracked. I thought about the time when Hermione obliviated her parents of her existence, and thought, what if it's her child that has done that for her? And her child is a seer, in a Luna-esque fashion, he knows what's looming in the future and that the war kept going for 7 years, he grew up in the on-going war. I wrote the prologue but I lost the drive to write it, I probably will pick it up someday. It sounded appealing to me at that time, I have the prologue up in Wattpad if anybody's interested. The book's name is Obliviate. So I'm shamefully promoting my trash out there: @inxcnti.

Also your recs are highly appreciated! Thanks!

** I read one years back and sorry that I don't remember where or the name. But maybe someone will recognize it and post the link for you.

It had a Harry's daughter come back, she's really sad about her timeline and wants to change it. Knowing that changing the time line she will no longer exist. It was really interesting.

And for a real rec:

The lesson of you is a fun story. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13867242]]

Harry likes kids. That doesn't mean he's ready for a small boy to turn up on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place insisting that Harry is his father. That was weird enough, but the child identifying Draco Malfoy as his other parent was something Harry had no bloody idea how to handle.

  Scorpius breaks his father's Time-Turner and ends up getting transported into the year 1998, when the Second Wizarding World War has already ended and where Draco Malfoy is still trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered world.With Scorpius' arrival comes shocking revelations, burning questions, and a son's image of a father Draco is sure he'll never be able to live up to.More importantly, it's Scorpius's bright brown eyes, so unlike his own, that bug Draco the most.[alternatively, a multi-chapter fic where eight-year-old Scorpius follows Draco around the castle and tries to discover the secret identity of his mother]

  Or “How Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy Used a Time-Turner and Royally Forked Up”. All Scorpius wanted was to warn his father about the future consequences of his past decisions, but this was seriously more than he bargained for. Time-Travel AU. Slow burn Scorpius/Hermione.
