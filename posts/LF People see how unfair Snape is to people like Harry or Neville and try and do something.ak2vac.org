Okay; don't get me wrong, I love Severus Snape; he's a very interesting character with a tragic backstory, he's done Fucked up things, I'm not denying it and I'm not a Snape apologist or anything of the sort, he could be a right bastard to people; especially to people like Harry or Neville.

Well... are there any stories that go on the protection squad kind of stance and actually protect their own?

Stand up to Snape, maybe even getting him to see that Harry isn't his father, or Neville isn't helpless or stupid.

Maybe even get Snape fired, who knows. (Again; I love Snape and his character, but sometimes I just want to read stuff like this).

I love it when Snape over comes his childhood and steps up and be's the better person, and all that great character development, and I'd love for stories like that, but if there's stories that get him fired or take a stand against him or whatever, I won't mind too much, just make it believable enough.

I'd rather not have character bashing in people like the Weasley's, and such.

If there isn't one, maybe someone might want to write it?

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** Sadly, usually you get "I invoke the hogwarts charter as lord Slytherin to demand satisfaction" crap all the time, not a lot of more sensible stuff. Like you could do an entire fic where McGonagal has a backbone.

​

1) She doesn't brush them off year 1 or 2 about he dangers right before they go off on their adventures and helps them take care of it. Maybe she steps in as Head of House to help Harry deal with the Tournament

2) She gets involved in protecting her students from Bullying, and dealing with the teacher issues.

3) She could, you know, run house meetings and get the kids that need counseling counseling.

​

​

Another one that was bumping through my head was having someone besides Umbridge appointed inquisitor. Maybe Amelia Bones (To get her out of the Ministers Head, to two potential opponents against each other (Amelia and Dumbledore). Or maybe appoint a Muggle or something, through some scheme to justify the anti-muggle persecution that is coming. And have it fail wildly.

For all McGonagall's worrying over leaving baby Harry at his Muggle relatives, she never checked in on him, assuming Dumbledore knew what was best, she never stepped in when people like Malfoy were giving people like Hermione a bad time; despite the fact that McGonagall seemed to hold Hermione in high regards.

If you get one of the sensible adults outside of Hogwarts banished to the Inquisitor position (like Kingsley or Bones), then you get to have the whole:

Dumbledore: Well, at least we are all on the same side. Don't worry about running around trying to do the ministry's bidding, its all a farce anyway.\\
Inquisitor: I may have not wanted an Inquisitor appointed, but if I have to do this job, I'm going to do it right.

Inquisitor starts by dealing with the problems with Potions and History of Magic, and the bullying problem, and eventually looks into the cover ups of the Chamber and Stone and Tournament incidents.

But it doesn't fit the same mold as "Petrification Proliferation" , as that is more about people in the position to do something about the mess the characters find themselves in, actually stepping up and doing their damn job, and causing all the dominos to fall early.

Like, the job description for Inquisitor is 'clean up the dysfunction at Hogwarts', so it might be intersting to read a fic about that actually happening...

I mean its basically OC once you get to the really lesser known professors, and I think most authors prefer OC Students or OC Muggles and such.

If I expressed no Student/Professor stuff than people wouldn't write that, so it would be okay to go for Harry tells minor Professor what's going on or she notices things on her own or whatever.

Madam Pomfrey was another character I was thinking as well; I mean, she is the one to most see to Harry and co when they've been hurt or whatever, it would be possible to try and get her help as well, plus she's a lot older so there'd be less chance of it turning into a Harry/Pomfrey story.

If we go with Remus in Harry's third year, he might provide some help as well. That could add to some interesting stuff as well; considering Remus was friends with Harry's father, James, and Sirius is out and everyone thinks Sirius is out to kill Harry. Asking Remus for help; without knowing he's a werewolf or used to be friends with his father or Sirius (At first) could be interesting. And get Remus to get more involved then he was in canon.

** I think Disobediance writer had one.

The problem is that even if Harry was James incarnate (and to be fair, James grew up and even when he was younger was pretty well liked outside of being a bully to Snape), Snape had no justification to treat Harry like shit and bully him as he was a grown ass man and Harry was a kid. I think that's what bugs me about a lot of the "Snape sees the light" stories, in that they seem to act like Snape hating Harry because he is James's son is some sort of justification but that he has to be made to se the light that Harry is his own person. Even if Harry was a hell raiser worse than James, George, and Fred combined, with the attitude of Draco, Snape had no justification to treat him like he did.

Ages ago, and I wish I could remember the title, I remember reading a one shot where Snape basically admits to himself that while James was a nasty bully to him, there obviously was more to him since Lily married him and others liked him, and that he himself had a role in James and Lily's death and ironically ended up doing more "wrong" to James because of that...and that by bullying children he was being far worse than his tormentors ever were.....this was after McGongall confronted him.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

*** Isn't that the fic where Harry gets in trouble because he's mad that his sister used magic on a baseball player and Hermione got blamed and nearly expelled for it?
