What impact will the play have on future fanfiction? What about the fandom?

Will any of you be going to see it? Are you excited for it?


** Idk if this makes me a horrible fan, but I kind of wish this wasn't a sequel. I just want Harry's world to be closed and leave the rest to the reader's imagination. I'd be totally fine with an encyclopedia or spin off like Fantastic Beasts, but I sort of feel like a sequel or even prequel destroys the magic a little....but that's just my opinion...

*** Yeah, I want those characters to be done. We know they're happy so leave it at that. I enjoy snippets like the quidditch World Cup but I don't want them back in the story. Obviously they'll have the lumps, bumps, and adventures that come with living but I think they should be put to pasture in favor of other characters. How cool would it be to see another time or place in the wizarding world?!

Exactly. If Rowling is so set on continuing this, why doesn't she do a damn bit of world building? Why not write something about the Founders Era, or the freaking Goblin Wars! I would read a novelization of the Goblin Wars!

** If we use Tolkien as our basis for long-term comparison, any material that comes directly from the head of JKR will by default be considered canon by the fan base. The only exception to this is if JKR specifically states it isn't and reinforces this by going on to produce new works later that specifically ignore this material.

***** Basically this.

And as someone who also writes LotR fan fiction, I take some serious liberties with Tolkien as well. I can incorporate one part of the Silmarillion and ignore another, or take a chapter of Morgoth's Ring as canon and pretend the other didn't exist. I find that that happens precisely because of long-term changes in the author's view of the legendarium.

I fell in love with the world the author wrote at one specific point in time. And while they may have moved on to see it differently, I might have moved in a different direction. And that's okay. I leave it entirely open as to which author this refers to.

***** Besides debunking the old Charles Potter X Dorea(Not confident on the name) Black, why do so many people take issue with Fleamont? I think it is a fun name, and makes some good background.

****** That's the problem. It's a /fun/ name. It's... /whimsical/. Harry is not whimsical. James is not whimsical. Fleamont most definitely sounds out of place compared to Charlus or Charles.

Not to mention Euphemia. Euphemia isn't a star, so far as I can tell, and the Black family seems to follow that theme when it comes to names, although that may just be the younger generation.

****** Fleamont and Euphemia don't seem right. They just don't fit in with the other names she used in her series-especially compared to the theorized Charlus and Dorea. I think that if she had provided more context and information on those characters, fleshed them out more, then the names would be more palatable. A Pottermore entry isn't enough to explain a name like Fleamont!

** I was thinking about the play today. I'm thinking there'll be a spike in the fandom and new fics as well. It's also another interesting dimension to canon. I'm wondering how the canon compliant authors will handle it. I know some consider canon to be books only.

I'm in the US, so I'll have to wait until DVD or it goes on tour. That means I'm not overly excited about it because it'll be some time before I see it. I wish she would ditch Pottermore and these other ventures and just write more books, or an encyclopedia. She's clearly not ready to put that world down, so I wish she would just full-ass it instead of the half-assing this is.

** I think for next gen writers it might have quite some impact.\\
For those of us who ignore the Crapilogue... not so much.

For me it'll have the same status as Pottermore drivel (Fleamont... ugh). I'll probably use parts of it if they're interesting and ignore the rest.

What I'm more interested in is Fantastic Beasts. As a prequel/spinoff series it might expand the Wizarding world outside of England a lot.

** I'm taking a Europe trip around that time, so I miiight just get to see it, if I can get tickets. I'm excited but also wary; I know how good post-canon fanfiction can be, and it'd be disappointing if her new canon weren't just as good.

I'm really interested in how "canon" it will be to the general fandom, as not many people will be able to see it, at least initially. Will these details even matter if the typical reader has never heard of them? It's all about accessibility. Which is why I also think that every year, fanon leans more toward movie canon as well and there are more new people exposed to the movies than the books.

I predict the play will spawn a subset of fanon specifically related to the play but ultimately won't change major preexisting fanon. ^{I} ^{will} ^{totally} ^{flip} ^{a} ^{table} ^{if} ^{someone} ^{tries} ^{to} ^{sass} ^{me} ^{about} ^{something} ^{~not} ^{being} ^{canon} ^{in} ^{my} ^{post-canon} ^{stuff} ^{though.}

** It won't be canon. It just isn't. It might affect the fandom's propensity for fic-writing, but it *ITSELF* is a derivative work, i.e. a work of *fanfiction*.

Well, it's fanfiction. No one's forcing you to read Harry/Ginny. And there have been many H/G fanfics since 2000-1, when HP fanfiction started coming in droves, so why are you choosing to complain now?

If anything, this will stimulate fics with the focus on the next gen's adventures, not with the focus on Harry/Ginny.

Yes, it's about them (as a family). There's no problem with that. If you hate Harry/Ginny so much, why did you even bother reading Deathly Hallows?

At least I'm not the one so closed minded as to ignore something just because it features a little thing that I dislike.
