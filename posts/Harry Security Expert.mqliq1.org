:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for this one fic. Harry is rich on the muggle side. He works breaking into places to test security. His first job had some guy on the news promising a payout to anyone who could get past his security and steal a jewel or something. Harry did it when he was like 7. This is revealed later in the fic talking about his job with other kids at Hogwarts.

I think he has a snake, but I may be mistaken .

That's like saying, "I'm rich in Germany" (unless the country you're specifying is one with a such a high poverty rate that even a modest sum is considered a lot).

He either has money, or he does not. The specific curency is not important, since it can be exchanged.

But the value/buying power of a dollar might be wildly different. The Weasleys are 'poor' yet own a massive house, car, etc. Poor people in muggleland probably aren't homeowners, for example.

It would also depend on country, no? A hundred grand might not be considered rich in some countries, while in others a hundred grand could net you a massive home and a life of luxury.
