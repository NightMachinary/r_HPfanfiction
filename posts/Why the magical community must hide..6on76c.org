  and the implication that magicals SHOULD help.
#+end_quote

Shouldn't they? If you're walking by the river and you spot a drowning child, shouldn't you rescue them, even though it may cause some inconvenience to you? It seems to me that you should help the child and you did something wrong if you just keep walking and let them die. Why is it any different if you are a wizard, the child is a muggle, and instead of drowning they are dying of a disease magic can easily cure? It seems really hard to say that magicals shouldn't help mundanes to at least some extent. Sure, it's unreasonable to demand that they be moral saints who spend every waking hour selflessly helping others, but they should be doing something.

#+end_quote

There is a difference between considering something moral and being willing to enforce it.

Yes, walking past a drowning baby would be considered morally wrong by most people. It is of course an extreme thought experiment. But that does not in and of itself justify the implementation of a socially binding duty to save others. And indeed, in common law countries such as England, the USA, Canada etc. there is no legal duty to save others, unless you have some pre-existing duty towards them (such as being their parent, teacher, doctor, etc).

The problem with making it a general rule that people have to save others is that:

a) The line of what counts as reasonable is very difficult to distinguish in many real life cases. Babies drowning in shallow water are not common. Frequently following a duty to save would involve at least not-insignificant personal danger, inconvenience, or financial loss.

b) As a society we have a strong belief in the value of liberty, and a duty to save others amounts to forced labour i.e. slavery. For example, let's say you willingly enter into a contract to clean my house in exchange for money. You then say you don't want to do this. I wave the contract in your face and take you to court. /The court will not enforce the performance of the contract/, because doing so would amount to a deprivation of your liberty. Even though you promised to do it. Instead you will owe me monetary compensation. If we don't even enforce the labour of people who freely and willingly entered into an agreement to do the work, it would be rather extreme to enforce labour on people who made no such agreement and were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time.

c) As a society we have a strong commitment to the right of people to treat their property as they wish. In our society, many people are in financial need. Indeed, the most efficient way to save people in pain and suffering would be financial contribution towards various causes. A duty to save therefore becomes a duty to use your financial resources to help others, which goes against your rights to use your property as you wish.

So: a compulsory duty to save goes against the values of liberty, property, and in any case is pragmatically difficult to determine the extent of so long as you maintain a reasonableness requirement.

Far better to have a conditional duty to save where you only owe a person a duty of care if the circumstances merit such a duty. In England and Wales, this duty arises if and only if:

- Harm is reasonably foreseeable as a result of your actions or failure to act.

- There is a relationship of proximity between you and the person you hold the duty towards.

- It is fair, just, and reasonable to hold that person responsible for the other.

** I think you forget that wizards will lash out once a certain limit is reached. I mean, does anyone think Voldemort's doctrine, Grindelwald's propaganda has seized to exist because they have been put down? Obviously not. Pureblood Doctrine will prevail and, here's how it would play out:

- Magical Society gets discovered.

- Muggles demand changes - reasonable or unreasonable, doesn't matter.

- Pureblood Dogma sees itself confirmed in its beliefs.

- They answer demands with Fiendfyre, Avada Kedavra, Imperio, Crucio,... And this time they won't be the bad guys because they have actual prove of their no longer conspiracy theories about muggles.

- "Then we nuke them!" - yeah, lol. Have fun nuking London, New York City, Tokio, Paris,... The biggest amalgamations of wizards are the biggest hotspots of muggle culture as well. They may find and nuke Hogwarts. But they won't nuke the Ministry and they won't get Diagon. In this case I can't even see many muggleborns defect to the muggles, given that they would be just as easily forced into labour for the muggles (or be burnt on the stake, depends if Labour or Tory is currently doing business).

- Wizards can survive literally anywhere. Even one semi-intelligent wizard capable of Fiendfyre or similarly destructive spells is enough to destroy human civilization on a global scale, given time. Fighting wizards would not be like fighting, lets say, ISIS. You can't beat 'em by destroying their infrastructure, hierarchy and organisation alone. The goal is total annihilation of every single wizard and witch on the planet. Even one wizard or witch, capable of apparition and Fiendfyre, is enough to set fire to every big city on the world and then continue with the villages. Fiendfyre cannot be put out by water, sand, blankets,... it only ends when it seizes to find anything to devour. It is the perfect weapon of mass destruction because you literally can't do anything against it without magic.

- Muggles either seize to exist, are driven into slave-castes or hide out in small pockets around the Earth. If at this point the necessary people aren't imperio'd or killed, they may launch a final nuclear strike. So either wizards win, or humanity as a whole is gone.

The Statutes only function is to protect muggles. Wizards, in the great scheme of things, do not need protection from them.

  People are entitled.
#+end_quote

Why should people NOT be entitled to use magical powers in order to help society? The implications of magic to eliminate disease and inequality are enormous, and the Wizarding World seems completely ignorant of them. Why is there even poverty among wizards? Magic, if it was utilized properly, would be able to alleviate human labour to an unpredecented degree. And yet, it is used by small isolated groups to preserve their aristocratic, antiquated government.

I always thought the "argument" that Hagrid uses in the first book, about muggles demanding that wizards fix their problems, is disgusting. There are millions of people suffering from ailments which magic can fix. Keeping such precious tools secret is analogous to discovering the cure for cancer and keeping it among your family members.

There would obviously be huge practical concerns in bringing the two worlds together, but I'm not aware of any reason why it shouldn't be done outside of romantic traditionalism. In other words, the means of magical production should be seized for the benefit of humanity.

It is a part of the accepted ethical system in most societies that people are entitled to retain the fruits of their labour.

Our essential disagreement is that you take historical ways of social organization, like private property and commodity exchange, as natural, even biological givens. The biggest problem with this isn't even that it's ideological, it's simply historical ignorance. The transition to the current form of social organisation was achieved through violence and state-enforced power (e.g. enclosure of the commons) and is perpetuated by both in order to quell revolt. There is nothing natural about it, that isn't also natural for collective tribal hunting.

From the anthropological perspective, so long as there have been humans, there have been societies and hierarchy. Indeed, it's likely that social organisation predates our species as it is seen in many other primates.

In any case:

1. My position does not depend in anything being natural or historical, only it being justifiable in the present. Societies that reject individual liberty are not only rebuked universally by those who inhabit them, they have not only repeatedly failed to deliver a decent quality of life, but they are also intellectually without rational or moral justification.

2. My point about natural feelings was not about any commitment to any specific social organisation but rather to the passions which give rise to the incentives that have led to those organisations. These passions are not exclusive to humans: animals fight all the time over possession of resources. All living creatures are hardcoded with instincts and passions which make them seek to further their own survival, i.e. with a certain level of selfishness that makes the concept of property attractive.

******** Fair enough. We are simply going to have to disagree about your 1st point then, but that discussion would involve large amounts of socialist theory and isn't really suited to this sub. I will simply say that I don't see a necessary equivalence between individual liberty and modern capitalism, and I don't think it's intellectually justified given contemporary technology and productive forces in general. I would probably concede that any kind of transition to a post-capitalist economy couldn't have been made in the past, as it lacked both the infrastructure of advanced capitalist economies, and perhaps more importantly, the means to rationally plan production that are available with computing.

Essentially, my position really isn't one of moral justification, as economies don't much care for such things. Social transformations are messy, violent things and often crushed by opposition, but it doesn't make historical sense to categorically oppose a revolution in my opinion. After all, even the most reactionary politics today still depends on classical liberal principles, which were fought over bitterly.

  Why is there even poverty among wizards?
#+end_quote

Probably bad worldbuilding.

Lets assume the wizards would allow to be drafted into labour for their non-magical brethren. Great. No more famine, droughts, shortage of housing,... Frankly, also no more capitalism as we know it and a the defacto elimination of several industries, including most of mining and oil. Shits cash.

But wizards are no machines. Wizards also have needs, feel happy, sad, exhausted, depressed,... And eventually one will ask: What do I get for my services?

And thats the crux of the matter.

What does the wizard get for waving his wand around? What does he get for 1 healing potion supplied?

The problem with all this is that it would play out in one of two ways:

Either the wizards remain labour machines and are practically enslaved by the muggles. Or the wizards get something for their services, which, after the elimination of material needs, is the last bit remaining: power and control, which makes the muggles end up in a position where they're completely open to the whims and wishes of the wizarding population.

There cannot be equality between mere mortals, and those few gifted who can change the makeup of reality with a swish and flick of a wooden stick. The ideas of the red revolution apply only on the assumption that every human on the globe is fundamentally the same - no place for defacto demigods.

** Grindelwald said it perfectly.

/"It is not we who are being protected from them, quite the opposite, it is them who are being protected from us"./

There are many Wizards that are capable of integrating with the Muggle world, like the News man in the first scene of Philosopher's Stone. But we can assume that for other Wizards being put into the Muggle world is like waking up in the dark and suddenly having a bright light flashed in your eyes. It's disorientating and it makes you flinch in annoyance.

We like to think Wizards are archaic compared to us, but I think quite the opposite, Wizards are so far into the future that they look to be in the past. It's made quite obvious that they've had several more industrial revolutions than Muggles, as well as riding on the back of the Muggle ones. They have televisions, radios, etc... they just like to dress weirdly and play their own sports. Sure they like to spice it up by making it dangerous, but Wizards seem like large masochists anyways, they have scars simply because they can. *Wizards operate on a different spectrum of rationalism.*

This can prove to breed conflict quite easily, and in turn, conflict breeds fighting. It wouldn't be long before the whole Muggle populace was wiped from existence with one wave of a wand.
