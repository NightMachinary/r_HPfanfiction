I think that I've just read the best fanfiction ever. And I feel like it deserves more kudos and love because holy hell. It's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15425364/chapters/35802369]] . And omg, it hasnt been completed yet but they're currently 15k+ words into chapter 16. I first went into this thinking, this is going to be rather interesting but I didnt expect much from it. It contains OC's and I'm not usually a fan of fics with them but I do NOT regret reading this. The characterizations of JK's characters have been spot on, Harry has decided to try to become an Order member and so Dumbledore, in his brilliance, decides to send him on missions with Snape. Snape is the same twat that we all know and love and is very much his normal antagonistic self towards Harry. Harry being Harry is very argumentative and sarcastic and utterly Gryffindor that it's perfect (this follows through 6th year so he is very much obsessed with finding out what Malfoy is up to). Hermione in this fic is all about muggleborn politics and we don't see much of her or Ron at the beginning as it follows Harry. But the OC's are probably the most complex and creative characters I have ever read. The main OC, Cleo, is a fully developed character and the people that she talk to aren't just some background characters that you only hear a little bit of but fully developed characters in their own right... and I'm trying so very hard not to say what happens to the characters that made me fall in love with them and it's very hard. Cleo has such a great connection with Snape because hes still an ass but he makes her actually want to do better. The characters and plot is so utterly complex and amazing and I just wish this fic gets more love because the writers deserve all of it. Please give this fic a shot! Toodles!
