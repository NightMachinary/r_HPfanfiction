Because for all the fanfic I've read so far, I don't think I've seen one where Harry or Ron or Hermione or some other main character is a bovine animagus, excluding a handful of one-shots that are just dialogue and no actual transformations.

No fics with 'milking' scenes unless they're relatively family-friendly, please.
