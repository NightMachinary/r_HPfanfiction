** I'm reading A dealer, not a Death Eater. It might fit what you're looking for.

linkao3(14046060)

Snape is a drug dealer who brews party potions as a sideline to his apprenticeship.

It starts off with a heavy focus on this with Lucius Malfoy as the master of the market and Mundungus Fletcher setting up deals. It's got very complicated with the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore fighting Voldemort and it's becoming more 'A Death Eater, not a dealer' as time goes on.

Snily AU.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

** This is another thing that canon doesn't really cover. Substance addiction.

Imagine if cigarettes IRL were actually healthy. That smoking was better for you than not smoking. Everyone would smoke a pack a day at least, adults and children.

If there were a magical cigar with no downsides but was slightly addicting nearly every wizard in existence would have a cigar on them.
