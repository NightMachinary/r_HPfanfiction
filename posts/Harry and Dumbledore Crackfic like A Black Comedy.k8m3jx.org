"Ah, my Boy, I have been waiting for you to wake of your slumber. Tell me, my friend, where exactly did you put that 56 Firewhiskey again? I just wanted to make sure it is stored away safely after our little excursion last evening." asked Dumbledore, sipping at his morning coffee, eyes twinkling.

Harry sighed. "Albus, we talked about alcohol in the morning. Don't you remember how that worked out last time?"

"Indeed I do, and I must admit I'm still puzzled how we came to wake up in that muggle amusement park but one must always remember our time is better spent worrying about the present, young Harry, not the future." answered the man in pink robes, sagely.

"I'm not going to tell you where it is." declared Harry firmly.

They looked at each other challenging.

"Get your own stash Albus. I'm tired of running out of booze all the time."

"Perhaps, I shall." responded Albus, deep in thought as he slowly made his way to the door.

"It's not in my room, so don't bother looking."

Albus slowly turned around, giving him a pleasant smile, a dangerous glint in his eyes.

"We shall see..."


** This doesn't exactly fit, but I wrote this a bit ago. And its crack, at least.

5th dimensional chess, chapter 1

Minerva sighed. She had finished the sorting, but albus had yet to show up. She was going to have to do the opening speech herself, but that was the least of her worries. He'd been in his office all week, and wouldn't let anyone in, not even for the staff meeting yesterday. Young harry was supposed to have came this year as well, but he wasn't present either. It was just like albus to have had some problem with the boy's whereabouts, and try to handle it himself.

She sighed again. "Severus, could you go check up on albus?" She asked, knowing the two men commonly had meetings together. Honestly, the man had almost more say in the school than she did!

The man in question gave her a scowl for longer than politely acceptable, before standing and leaving. He swore to Merlin, if that brat was the cause of this interference, then he would have the boy in detention all year. Just like his father, he thought as he neared the headmaster's office.

Behind the door he could hear the slight sound of papers shuffling. "Albus?" He called out as he knocked on the door. There was no response. "You're late to the sorting!" The shuffling of papers grew slightly faster.

He didn't have time for this nonsense. "I'm coming in, headmaster," he said as he opened the door. Albus sat apposed to a black haired boy. That brat-

"Not so fast, Albus! You've activated my trap card." The voice was unmistakable, as it slammed a card onto the table. Potter! The two were sitting at the desk, several hands of cards floating in the air in front of them.

"I wouldn't be so sure, my boy. For you see, you have but one card remaining, and did not incant 'uno'." said the albus, as he leaned forward.

"That was my intention all along!" The boy proclaimed. "I cast paradigm shift, and move my pawn on board 5 to board 3, 1000 rounds ago, and move it to 6a!" Severus's head swirled to view numerous chess boards floating in the corner. The mentioned pawn jumped directly onto the next board, which rapidly reversed to show the pawn taking what he assumed to be albus's king.

"No! You can't!" Albus complained, slamming a hand on the table.

"I just did, old man!"

"Very well then. You leave me no choice, harry!" The old man drew his wand, eyes gleaming with magical might, and with a wave, combined all of his remaining peices into one.

Severus couldn't take it anymore. "What the fuck is going on?" The chess monstrosity, very much confused, identified the yelling as a threat. The last thing that potion master saw before his world faded to black was a pawn with a mustache drawn on it.

Line break or something

Minerva was getting worried. It was almost time for the greeting, and Severus had yet to return. She had already delayed it slightly, and couldn't wait much longer. As she took her place near the center of the staff table, she wondered how she would explain that a random room on the 3rd floor was forbidden, why the headmaster just wasn't present, and how she was supposed to make the food disappear in the first place.

Everyone's attention suddenly went to the doors, where a shout of "Nitwit!" and "Blubber!" echoed from behind. Several students laughed, but that all stopped when the doors busted open.

In came flying the Professor they all saw leave during the feast, the old man many recognized as the headmaster, and a unsorted student. It wasn't really flying in the aspect of speed, nor was it on a broom. No, Severus snape was laying prone, floating a great many inches off the ground, while the other two stood atop him. The boy stood near the head, arms outstretched and leaning forward precariously. Albus was behind him, holding his waist as to prevent the boy from falling off. In unison, the duo leaned sideways, adjusting the aim of snape towards the head table.

The duo then leaned back, causing their mounted Snape to rear back, somehow clambering onto the table. Their was a sickening sliding noise, as the man slid through the food, and off the table. As for the two passengers, they dismounted near the center of the table.

"Oddment. Tweak! I hope you all have a wonderful year at Hogwarts, but first we have a few announcements." The clearly deranged, old man began, well, announcing. "Firstly, first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well." He looked at a random wall, his eyes finally diming, as they had been glowing the entire time.

"Secondly, I would like to announce our new defense against the dark arts professor, Professor quirrell. Oh, and I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." He then stepped off the table, and began eating the food that had been soiled by the airborne snape and his own shoes. "You are dismissed."

Nobody, save for harry who also got off the table and began eating, moved. How was one supposed to react to such insanity? Minerva was so flabbergasted that all she could do was gesture thirdly between the unsorted boy and the headmaster.

*** This is great! Now I had to write something too.

------------

Albus smirked, unable to hide the feeling of pleasure of his inevitable victory.

"You are truly a worthy opponent, my boy, alas your defeat was inevitable."

Slowly he placed down his +2 Card, eyes focused on the frozen boy in front of him.

"UNO, my Boy." spoke Dumbledore, smugly.

Albus chuckled. All had worked out perfectly, just as he had foreseen it. Blinded by his own arrogance, the boy had completely ignored the possibility of another +2 Card. The fool, it had been predestined. His victory was always predestined.

"How?" whispered Harry, horrified.

"Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design, Harry."

Contently, the old man leaned back in his seat, his smirk ever present, eyes twinkling far too much.

"I...I..." stuttered the boy.

Harry's fearful eyes went to the desk again, undoubtedly looking for a way to escape his utter defeat. Foolish boy, there was no escape, not from him.

Albus remained smiling, his hand reaching out to the pile of sweets the boy had betted. Now it was time to enjoy his victory.

A deep chuckle stopped him in his tracks, making a shiver go down the old man's spine.

Harry's head snapped up to him, his eyes almost glowing, an amused smirk now on the teens lips.

"You are a fool, Albus. For I have foreseen that you would foresee my moves."

Albus heart stopped, his eyes widening.

It...It was impossible.

"UNO, Albus." said the boy, while laying down the last +2 Card in the Deck.

Albus Chair fell back as he jumped out of it, eyes still on the Card before him, the shock written in his face.

"No..NO! HOW?!" raged the defeated Headmaster.

"Your feeble UNO skills are no match for the power of a game night with the whole Dursley family, Albus. I have been trained in the arts of UNO deception since I turned six, old man." declared the boy wile taking the back of lemon drops.

"This has been fun, lets do it again sometime."

And just like that, the door closed.

Albus screamed, his raged overwhelming all sense of rationality as he randomly trashed everything in his office.

IT felt like hours but somehow the Albus managed to regain his control, now standing among rubble and screaming portraits.

"Soon...Soon, young Harry. Soon, I shall have REVENGE!"
