As the title says, I'm looking for stories where Harry Potter discovers and reads the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling and decides to use what he has learned about himself in those books to make a better future for himself. I'm assuming it'll probably be humorous, maybe even parody, with a lot of meta and fourth-wall breaking.

I'm not actually sure this exists, but if they do, I'd like to read them.

**** It has (WIP) sequel about the second year, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473842/1/A-Sensational-Story][12473842]]). Both of them are the very best in the genre of "Heroes read books".

** Tons of those "reading the Books" fics were written back then, and most of them were deleted during the great sweep several years ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/Strawberry-Fields][Strawberry Fields]], linkffn(4940094), is different though as it does not recite any excerpts from the Books. Instead, Dr Who entered the HPverse with the Books and brought Harry to the Grangers. Things worked out mostly better, but not always.

*** It's more like Dr. Who left Harry shitty fanfiction rather than the books.
