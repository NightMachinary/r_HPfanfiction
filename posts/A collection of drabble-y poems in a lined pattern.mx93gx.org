I used to love this fanfic, but due to its generic title, I've been having trouble finding it.

It was a collection of poems, based on the relationships and dynamics of the Harry Potter characters. The poems didn't rhyme. They were based on a structured pattern: The first line was ten words, the second line was nine words, and so on until the last line, which would be a single word.

There were around thirty or forty "chapters."

There were poems about how Harry felt about Ginny, how Ron felt about Hermione, how James felt about Lily and so on.

Does anybody remember this one? It would have been on Fanfiction.net
