**** joking aside, i would suggest T*/he denarian renegade/*. the entire story is about the fact that Harry tries constantly to be a jerk and not care but in the in the end always has to jump in and save his friends.

** Maybe linkffn(World Changer) is interesting to read for you. Harry travels to an AU where the light side barely exists and purebloods dominate. He's faced with moral decisions about changing society or carving out a place for himself and a loved one. Up till the last two chapters the dilemmas you describe feature quite a bit.

*** You had me at this description but then lost when it says "A dimension travel harmony story". Seems like such a good plot though.

  Harry is a man broken and weighed down by regrets. He is past the point of caring, until one day he takes the opportunity to change his fate---blast the consequences. "I've jumped through worlds for you, Hermione. You won't be taken from me again." A Dimension travel harmony story.

If you can handle political 11-year-olds, give this a shot. Harry is in Slytherin House, constantly insists that he's cunning, coldly practical, and the epitome of everything Slytherin . . . but every time an opportunity arises to leap into danger that's exactly what he does regardless of how much trouble it causes him.

It's so canon-like in that respect that I honestly can't tell if the writer has an excellent grasp of Harry's essential nature and is tweaking the reader's noses, or if he's just Mister Magoo-ing his way to near-canon characterization.

I'd recommend it to anyone, really. It's just /fun/ in a very whimsical way that you'd never expect from a story that seems to deliberately cram as many fanon cliches as possible into the narrative /and makes them work/.

In fact, one of the biggest complaints I can make about it is that it's spending so much effort developing the side characters that Harry feels just like he did at the beginning.

EDIT: An example; the Diary Horcrux is used to possess a girl, but her consciousness remains, and in Voldemort's PoV chapters /she heckles the everloving shit out of him/ as he tries to pretend to be a girl. But even her shade grows and changes as a character as the chapters go on.
