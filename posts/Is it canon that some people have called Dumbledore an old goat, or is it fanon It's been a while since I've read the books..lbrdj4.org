** And the only connection to goats (other than the Bezoar) is whatever Aberforth did:

#+begin_quote
  “An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery...”

*** Sorta unrelated, but that “I'm not entirely sure he can read” line always cracks me up. Like, wow, Dumbledore, glad to know you think so highly of your brother.

** "Old goat" is a generic term, actually - per [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old%20goat][Merriam-Webster]]

#+begin_quote
  Definition of old goat informal ---used as an insulting way to refer to an old man She got married to some rich old goat.
#+end_quote

So mostly, it's an insulting way to refer to Dumbledore. It's also possible to be slightly related to his brother, though it's probably not the main part.

** u/ceplma:
#+begin_example
  ~@stitny$ epubgrep -i 'old goat' ~/Knihy/rowling/anglicky/**/*.epub
  ~@stitny$
#+end_example

Meaning the phrase ‘old goat' doesn't happen in all JKR books.
