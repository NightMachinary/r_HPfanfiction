Like there are so many angsty Drarry fics out there where Dracos parents are another obstical. But can't we have one fic in which Draco comes out and then his parents immediately think of Harry Potter as the most suitable partner. Or Lucius getting tired of all the complaining he has to endure from Draco (who is painfully oblivious that he is hardcore crushing on Harry) about Potter so that he takes matters into his own hands so that he finally enjoys one evening where he doesn't get firecalled from his son. Narcissa being super supportive as Harry told her that Draco was alive during the Battle or whatever. And so we have like Narcissa inviting Harry for tea and Draco being super uncomfortable while he is forced to sit there - because it's polite, Draco - but then Lucius sprinkles in some words about the latest Quidditch cup and eventually Draco and Harry have a common topic to talk about and one thing leads to the other...
