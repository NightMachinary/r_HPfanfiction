In this sub we talk a lot about the things we don't like, tropes, pairings, types of fic.

What about the things that we do like?

What are some of your favorite tropes, pairings, and/or types of fic?


** I'll start us out. I love found family and adoption fics. I love fics where Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, and Ginny all work together to accomplish something or solve a mystery. I love fics that spend time with what being in a magical school or magical world would be like. I love creative imaginings of how potions or magic works. I love fics that are cozy.

** I like the skill involved in realistically diverging from a single change, keeping everyone in character. The Innocent series is a good example, if you like Sirius as a main character (technically two points of divergence), and Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift does a good job of realistically introducing Harry/Hermione without bashing anyone (after getting upset at Ron, Hermione brings Harry to the Slug Club instead of Cormac).

I'm also rather a fan of Peggy Sue works, so long as they still do a good job of challenging the characters. The best ones, I think, focus a lot on the time traveler's relationships with their aged-down friends; Nightmares of Futures Past is a good example, where Harry has a lot of combat experience but it's not often relevant, and he's instead focused on teaching his friends skills that will help them survive. The Peace Not Promised is another, with Severus getting a second chance at life, but having to go through a lot of character development to have a chance at true happiness.

Canon divergence is definitely a skill when it's done right.

Snape reading muggle fiction

time travel

adopted Harry

powerful Harry (but without goblins, lots of names and bashing. just magically powerful)

Draco needs a hug

posh pureblood Draco

Fred lives

fics not about them, but where Seamus and Dean are together

werewolf Lavender

the teachers are best buds

lemons in prefects bathroom

Neville wank

Neville's parents heal

Umbridge gets it bad

other characters having or learning animagi

runes

parties in common rooms with games

prisoner take in, but it can't have the "I'm the boss here and you will listen to me" vibe. more of the hurt/comfort type.

edit: forgot: Harry gets his eyesight fixed by spells/potion. and any other little magic things that aren't in canon.

** my favorites are time-travel fix-it fics (because I'm still not over DH dammit) or severitus/sevitis fics, because grumpy mentor who is some flavor of asshole, but is also trying his best makes me happy.

I'm also a fan of Indy!harry and/or powerful!harry, but only if I'm in the mood. harry crow is absolutely ridiculous and I love it.

slytherin!harry is also a good one for me, especially if his choice to go to slytherin is a direct result of his upbringing.

** I like Slytherin Harry, but not evil, and not Malfoy/Snape friendly. I think its ok about Draco, he is a child and a friendship can change his bratty attitude.

I like it when authors break the idea that Slytherin and Salazar is just evil n dark and I REALLY LIKE Harry and Lily being descendants of Salazar. The trope that Harry finds a portrait, a diary, or a Salazar library and discovers these things is always good to read.

I also think it's good when Harry's grandmother is Dorea Black, and thanks to that Harry has good wizard relatives, usually great-uncle Arcuturus or great-aunt Cassiopeia, not to mention being cousin of Andromeda and Nymphadora and they are not all evil bastards like Bellatrix and Walburga... Sirius and Andromeda cannot be the only decent people born in a family with centuries and centuries of existence.

It would also be nice if Euphemia Potter had a family, but she is rarely used, so we stay with Dorea.

Love when Neville gets well deserved attention and friendship from Harry. I like there are more inter-house friendships, regardless of where Harry is sorted.

I love it when the wizarding world is really expanded and it's not just about Britain. Stories about the ancient Celtic wizards, nordics, ancient greeks, ancient rome, ancient agypt and so on. Not to mention the incredible possibility of native magic from the Americas and Africa and magic in Asia. Post-Hogwarts fics are good too.

I always like it when Harry gets rid of the Dursleys. When Dumbledore mistakes are exposed, but without all that bashing madness that turns him into a total asshole.

For shipps... My preference is always Harry/Nymphadora, but I like Harry/OC, Daphne, Susan, Tracey, Katie, Fleur or any different shipp that can be developed. I also like Hermione/Neville, Hermione/Another girl or Krum and Ron/Luna, well, I have to be sincere that I don't care much about Ron shipp, he is happy playing quidditch and talking about it with Dean and Sean.

For time travel, which I also really like, I prefer Harry/Andromeda(unfortunately I only know one...) or Harry/Narcissa and Harry/Amelia. Harry/Bellatrix is more common than her sisters in the fandom, but it needs to be very well developed.

Another shipps i like Sirius/Remus, Sirius/Amelia, Sirius/Marlene, Sirius/OC, Remus/OC, Remus/Narcissa, Neville/Tracey, Neville/Susan, Neville/Ginny...

There are probably other tropes that I like, but I'm not remember now and I've already written too much here

** My favourite HP trope is probably [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][for want of a nail]]. I didn't know this was a term until a year or two ago. I like seeing how what's seemingly a small change can lead to huge consequences - while still being realistic, of course. E.g. I think linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) does a great job at this.

Idk if this counts as a type of fic but I like fics that seem like crack but are actually really cohesive and well-plotted like linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary).

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow.
