#+begin_quote
  Let's put it this way: yes there are flaws. Yes there are fuck ups. This is biggest fucking can of worms they could have possibly opened. I cannot believe they went for time travel. It's the most commonly asked Potter question: why don't they just use the time turner to fix everything? And the answer has always, always been that time travel in Harry Potter works as a stable paradox or closed loop: whatever happened, always happened. You can't actually change the past, you can only cause it to occur as it did, thus creating a closed loop. That explanation is now dead in the water. It's now officially a mess. And for what?

Well, not entirely. Time-travel past 5 hours in the past /is/ possible, according to Pottermore, but there's a much greater chance of fuck-ups, and severe damage or death to the time-traveller. Time-Turners are charmed specifically to only go back an hour at a time.

The Ministry also previously experimented with time-travel in the 1800's, but stopped in 1899 with the "Eloise Mintumble incident". This incident is also why Time-Turners were all so hard to get a hold of, even before they were (mostly) all destroyed in /Order of the Phoenix/.

#+begin_quote
  In 1899, the Department of Mysteries conducted its last experience concerning time-travelling back in time for more than a few hours. Eloise Mintumble was sent to the year 1402, wherein she became stuck for a period of five days. When she was finally retrieved to the present, her body had aged five centuries, and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.

  Her excursion to the past provoked a great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the present so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been "un-born". Moreover, there were a few more alarming signs that time itself had been disturbed: Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours.

  The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble covering up the mishap and, since then, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those who study time travel.

It suppose it could always be upgraded, but again it is supposed to never be used or known of and they didn't make other new ones... so it seems very convenient that they found a time turner which works uniquely well for the plot.

** And here I was hoping that The Cursed Child would stand on it's on merits and leave the books alone. I suspect that JK found that she simply didn't have enough time to get the audience invested in new characters when our old favourites were still on the scene, which is a difficult transition to make. Think about how much room she has in the books as opposed to a play.

I lament that she didn't trust in the appeal of her world in general, and confused it with the appeal of Harry's story. Instead she's forced the next generation into the old story with all the grace of a walrus on dry land.

**** Eh, GoF marks where the series becomes less episodic and tries to move more toward Young Adult fiction. Darker, as you put it. It doesn't really work, in my opinion, because the foundations of the story were built on episodic, whimsy-filled Scooby Doo plots. She tries to get the reader to question things that were previously assumed, in a 'loss of innocence' kind of sense, but the things we're meant to be questioning (the ministry, Dumbledore, Sirius, etc) do not stand up to scrutiny, because they were originally formed from lol!whimsy.

Dumbledore especially. The reason he's so easy to paint as a villain (by people who will remain unnamed) is that for the first few books, his role was to basically be an omniscient and mysterious figure who would descend from on high to explain the plot at the end of each episode. Oh, and to be vague and powerful, I guess. The moment you ask 'wait, why is he criminally negligent if he's so smart?' the illusion of him having a coherent character in book 1 is broken. Because he's pretty much just there to play the old and wacky mentor who facilitates the fairy tale of an orphan left on a doorstep. There is nothing to reveal. His character does not make sense in the early books, and it was never meant to, but Rowling tries to pretend that it did in the later books. If you're not paying attention to the bait and switch, you might actually come away believing that Dumbledore was human for the duration of the series. He wasn't. He was a skeleton of a character archetype that was animated and became a real boy somewhere in HBP.

So to some extent it was 'pandering', yes, but only in the sense that the series was bootstrapped into becoming a Young Adult series as the target audience got older, and I believe this was intended. Is it pandering when it's also cynical marketing? It just turns out that Rowling likely wasn't up to the challenge, and built upon very shaky foundations, hence the very audible clunk around the beginning of OotP.

She's not very good at writing adult fiction, from what I've seen of her other books (Cormoran Shrike, Casual Vacancy), and god help us if she ever tries to write romance. The fact that Harry Potter was rejected by a bunch of publishers was sometimes brought up as a sort of 'plucky courage' thing, but honestly, it just goes to show that even Philosopher's Stone was a bit of a mess on the structural side of things. But she does fairytale whimsy really quite well, and children aren't as likely to notice the gaping holes where consistency and overall plot structure are concerned.

People will have different opinions of J.K. Rowling, and for different reasons, likely because they've been exposed to different information about her in different circumstances. It doesn't make those opinions (within their frame of reference) any less valid.

In other words, people, and the lives they lead, are different. This is why Rule 3 is useful. This is also why comments should add to the discussion. Rather than explaining why you disagree with his opinion, you just insulted him. There's something to work on.

That might just be a vicious rumor though. Like Rita Skeeter used to do.

** Damn, [[/spoiler][dead Astoria]] seems to be canon now. It's a minor thing, but it kept annoying me in next-gen fics that many of them [[/spoiler][killed Astoria off]].

Of course, that depends on if we're considering the play as canon. I think since it's approved by Rowling, it is. But I'll probably stick to AU stories for next-gen.

** Goddammit, I knew this was going to happen. I didn't think she'd go full Peeves on us and bust out the time travel but I knew we we're heading for some foundation damage as soon as this was announced.

It's too bad that she can't leave this story alone or least expand upon it with novels or really do anything that anyone actually wants with it other than off the wall shit like this and Pottermore and other basically disposable content that you never revisit. Oh well, I'll always have fanfiction and at this point half of the crazy stories just got a lot saner.

I see that there's supposed to be more and I cautiously assume that all the King's horses and all the King's men will put Harry Potter together again but I simply can't think of any reason that we had to take a barrel over the falls to do it. Whatever, go write my own magic hoopla story I guess but when I do and it changes the lives of millions of children for the better, I promise all of you that I'll treat it with a little more respect than a goddamn musical time travel play.

** [[/spoiler][I don't mind the time travel plot, personally, but the part about Scorp potentially being Voldemort's son sounds so weird, haha. I think Rowling just wanted to show how time travel is dangerous, which is why she went with this plot. That being said, why would two Slytherins go back in time to save a dude they don't even know? They could have traveled in time for so many reasons and they went for this?]]

*** [[/spoiler][because being a good Slytherin as he was, Scorpius really wanted to prove himself to be better than his Dad was at least once. Add that to the fact that he was pissed off with Harry because he decided to give him a "lame lucky blanket" at the same time he gave cool things to James and Lily... which followed a massive argument that Albus ended up confessing that he wished he wasn't Harry Potter's son - and Harry telling that he wished Albus wasn't his Son. So yeah, a pissed off teanager who wanted to be better at something - save Cedric when his Dad failed to do so.]]

*** [[/spoiler][I actually really hope they do make it so that Scorpius is Voldemort's son, leaving aside the fact that Scorpius is too young to be Voldemort's son because he's the same age as Al, because it means that A) Draco and Astoria adopted him, or B) Draco got cuckolded. And THAT would be a blow to his pride that Draco would NEVER recover from.]]

Hermione acting like Snape is kind of a cool idea though. Lol.

No offense, but /oh, dear God, no/. Not a fan of Snamione at all.
