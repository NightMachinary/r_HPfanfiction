It's canon that Harry is a great wizard, but obviously that doesn't mean he can summon magical demons to do his bidding or defeat everyone in his path with the click of his fingers. What's a perfect middle ground in your eyes?

Or make him not the central character or the conflict not be the central plot. Stupid levels of power are easier to accept if it's not about his power to fight the bad guys.

** I think the cap is pretty high because of the very nature of the "magic background" of HP. As others have said, its fairly easy to "scale up" his conflict or surroundings as needed.

If I had to put a cap on it, I would say its where Harry could be considered a "god", or strains the boundaries of "mortality". For example, Flamel is still mortal, even if hes lived for hundreds of years. Mortal simply means they can be killed in some way.

I think a good middle ground is when the power is focused in a particular area. Like political/financial power, or actual magical power, or influential power, and so on. Too much power in too many areas and it starts to become overwhelming.

*** This is all correct.. and indicative of a real issue in both fan fiction and cannon, specifically, there is a world of magic and it is not important to the plot or even relevant in the end. It is instead the devices of God that win the day. Where most powerful fics fail is in their lack of plot, an inverse relay bishop to jk's failure to fully realize the magic of her own world. Powerful Harry stories don't work because they don't have a plan other than "well the magic could be so much better".

Have a plan, a sacrifice or loss, a triumph over insurmountable odds, or even something original and thought provoking, and your powerful Harry will go down in history.

My 2 cents... NoExit hits it on the nose, conflict or a lack thereof, can make or break a story.

It is?

It's not quite that simple. The essential parts are:

- The protagonist must struggle in their main conflict.
- The protagonist must fail before they succeed.

In a story like Harry Potter, where the protagonist must defeat Voldemort, you must not make Harry so strong as to make the final confrontation seem easy. But you can accomplish that by making your Harry stronger than canon Voldemort, then making Voldemort more powerful still.

By way of example, I'm currently reading /Emperor/ by Marquis Black. Harry doesn't fail on his own merits in the first four hundred pages. It's not that he's too powerful, precisely; it's more like situations conspire in his favor. There are no "oh shit" moments where he realizes he's fucked up or that he's facing off against someone too strong for him.

I agree that while he mainly wins because stuff he needs to win (Sacrificial Protection, Sword of Gryffindor, Time-Turner, Brother Wands, Deathly Hallows) just falls in his lap; but when it does, he's very good at picking it up and making immediate use of it.

****** Still, that doesn't indicate that Harry is a great wizard. I'd expect a great wizard to be able to accomplish a few things of great magnitude, or a variety of things of well above average magnitude, or to have an unusually deep understanding of magic, or to be unusually deft with magic, or to know many more spells than pretty much anyone else, or...

Harry having an ability that only shows up in one constrained situation -- one that he can't encounter after 1998 -- seems to miss the mark of greatness by a rather large margin.

**** No. The Dark Lord "marked him as his equal". That doesn't mean that Harry actually /is/ Voldemort's equal in any particular way. Map vs. Territory, and all that.

For that matter, Harry is Voldemort's /superior/ in many ways. For example, he is not a psychopath, has a whole soul, and risks his life to saves people when he can, rather than killing them to prolong his own life.

In the context of the prophecy, it's more likely that that line was referring to either the act of Voldemort /choosing/ to treat Harry as a threat requiring his personal attention the way Dumbledore might, or the the more literal act of giving him the lightning-shaped scar. If Voldemort had chosen Neville, he would have marked Neville as his equal. Would that automatically give Neville magical power?

** currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7665632/1/Potter-s-Protector][Potter's Protector by mjimeyg]] where Harry is not only the Master of Magic, as well as The Master of Death, completely invulnerable where he looses limbs or is decapitated and is unaffected. Bonus, he has Xander as his adopted father who is Lord Hogwarts AND King of the Goblins, and lets not forget Neville who is a magical magus, a Phoenix and immortal as well. Lets just say this story is just a bit over the top...

** Depends like everyone is saying, but for a fic that means to feel close to how powerful he is in canon, then there is a line for me.

For me, his immense power was largely tied up between him and Voldemort. Lily's sacrifice no longer keeps him alive, he can't see into anyone's mind anymore, his Phoenix feather wand no longer has a mortal enemy, and he's not using the Elder Wand so that's kind of a moot point.

/But/ his wand did still absorb Voldemort's enormous power in the graveyard. /And/ Harry's wand (if your read up on phoenix feather and holly wood) is extremely loyal to him. So I wouldn't at all be surprised if his wand defended him in some way in the future in a very impressive way.

And I do think that with a match like Harry and his wand, that they /would/ grow increasingly more powerful together until he's probably as good at dueling as Dumbledore was eventually - but not at 17, and probably not at 30, but maybe at 50 years old and beyond.

But again, I don't /really/ care if it deviates from this so long as his power is a main part of the story and entertaining.

** I wouldn't go any further then Cord Threads ffn(10136172), if you're going to have an insanely OP character you gotta have some humour about it. Actually I think I normally prefer about 75% less then Core Threads since you have to get the humor right or else it just seems inane and silly. I think when an OP Harry has the insane powerful wizard trope (cough cough Dumbledore), it helps too. An uber serious OP Harry doesn't work too well unless it's around Dumbledore/Voldemort level, more then that it's a kid stepping on ants situation.

** It's canon that Harry is a wizard. Anything else is subjective there.

That said, you could make any character infinitely powerful and still not have it be stupid for as long as there was conflict (of any kind) that causes this character difficulties and requires them to put in the effort. For example, you could have an almost infinitely powerful Harry who is also immortal and tries not to be, and if you play it well you could have it be quite a gripping tale that is not at all stupid regardless of the fact that Harry would likely be able to defeat anyone without difficulties; but, in such a story “conflict” would be not about fighting but rather about becoming mortal and with /that/ Harry would struggle.

It's all about /how/ you play it, really, not about /what/ you play. So many people forget about this.

** A character's power is always relative to that of the other characters, settings, and the conflict.

For example, suppose that, in fact, Harry can "can summon magical demons to do his bidding or defeat everyone in his path with the click of his fingers".

But, in that AU, /everyone/ has demons at their command --- The Sorting Hat is actually an artifact to contact the demons' realm and help the students negotiate their first demon contract, and Diabolism is a mandatory subject at Hogwarts. Different breeds and clans of demons have different abilities and capabilities, strengths and weaknesses, and they demand different prices for their services.

Nor are they particularly benevolent, always trying to get the summoner to compromise themselves, to fail to fulfill their side of the bargain to invoke the penalty clause, to bargain away more and more, and some summoners would envy Voldemort's Horcrux-crippled afterlife when it comes to what happens to them when they die.

So, would DemonSummoner!Harry powerful? Of course. But, to paraphrase the immortal words of then-former Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, "The trouble is, the other side can summon demons too, Prime Minister."

Like he can summon the earth of his enemy but doesn't do so for silly reason.

Basically the power he has if it is setting-breaking it has to break the setting and we have to see the consequences, while not becoming boring.

One fic which kinda does it half right half wrong, but is still acceptable because of the cracky undercurrent is Core Threads. Beware of bad random CAPITALIZATION OF "IMPORTANT WORDS" and bad sentence structure.

** I'm just rereading linkffn(Harry potter and the summer of change by lorddwar) , probably one of my favourite honks fics ever, and I really like Harry's power in this one and the way it explains it. He's really magically powerful, but he has other faults, like tunnel vision, poor planning, or a lack of knowledge. Also it's not just "Harry bought a bunch of books and now can use all these really cool spells" he actually works to get better. I also really like the explanations of magic and intent, as well as the take on occulemency(sp?) and wandless magic. Anyone else have anything similar? Especially the DoM parts, I'd like to read something else like that.
