To clarify, im looking for two different type of fics. First im in the mood for fics that feature a sentient hogwarts. Preferable where she communicates with Harry. Bonus if she has a corporal avatar (RoR perhaps?)

Second im loving fics where Harry explores his Magic before Hogwarts, learns all sorts of skills and becomes powerful all before entering hogwarts. Bonus if he befriends Hermione before hogwarts.

Crossovers are welcome too. Prefer a straight Harry if pairings later on.

Edit: i am reading linkffn:(harry potter and the lightning lord) atm is a good pre-hog magic fic :)

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for.

** I've never heard of this idea before! It could be like the sentient, animated house in the movie Monster House! :o Only not malevolent! Maybe hogwarts could also talk like the sorting hat? I mean it does make sense that if magic can animate a hat to be sentient like that, it could work on a building if you got a bunch of people to work on it together! :)
