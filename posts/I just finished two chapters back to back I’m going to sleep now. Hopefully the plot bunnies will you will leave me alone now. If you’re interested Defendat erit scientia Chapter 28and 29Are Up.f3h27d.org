*** Its kinda hard to read. Good job finishing though! I think you have a great idea here, but the way you worded some stuff is...could be better. Did you use a beta? I only read to chapter 3, but it was interesting idea for sure.

***** I feel you, no one really has enough free time. I suggest getting a friend to read over it and correct some stuff. I know i have issues when i write of just assuming the meaning of passages that arent actually that clear? just have someone else read through it if you can find someone. Its alot of work to write a good story, which is why so much fanfaction is trash.
