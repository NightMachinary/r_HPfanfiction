I'm looking for anything with anti-hero type characters, rather than actual dark or evil main characters.

The sort of characters who are dishonest, and possibly not nice people, but who in the end do the right thing.

To give an example by jumping fandoms, this would describe most of the crew of Serenity, yet is a rare character type in HP canon - I'd say pretty much confined to Mundungus Fletcher.

Writing any of the main characters this way would be massively OOC, so OCs are OK.


** I would pick Harrymort in *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106).

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, and not a ship for everyone, but Lady Miya wrote some amazing Hermione/Voldemort fics. Most are focused on a slight OOC Voldemort, who values power and immortality over world domination and killing Harry, and I love her interpretation. The Contract, for example, is great, and Shared Flame is probably my favorite fic of all times. They're of Ao3 and ffn and I think that you might like them, even if it's not exactly what you're searching for. The characters are very interesting and the fics very well written.

*** Umm. Hermione/Voldemort had me raising my eyebrows for sure. But I just picked one of hers at random - the first chapter has Voldemort defeated, yet surviving the Battle of Hogwarts, and sneaking away. It's a fairly intriguing start.

**** Maybe Shared Flame then ? It's a really great one. Hermione gives as good as she gets, and the plot is very interesting. I think in this one you'll find Voldemort is somewhat of a anti-hero. Hope you'll like it !

** Just clarifying, are you looking for a fic where Harry/the main character still fights for the right side, but simply has no morals against hurting/blackmailing death eaters etc? Because if so, I am also interested in that.

*** I think what you're after is more on the lines of what TVtripes calls either a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero][Pragmatic hero]] - who fights for the right side and does nasty stuff because they see it as regrettably necessary or a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero][Sociopathic hero]] who does nasty stuff because they /like doing it/, and have arbitrarily chosen to do it on behalf of the good side.

Not bad hooks for stories in themselves, but I was thinking of something along the lines of the /Lovable rogue/. The sort of character who has a (well hidden) moral code. And if (unwillingly) present at the Battle of Hogwarts, would at least be fighting in the thick of the action. But after it was all over and when nobody was looking, would be busy looting the bodies of dead Death Eaters. Bonus points if a female character.

[[/u/deirox]] 's recommendation "Harry Potter: Hero of the Wizarding World?" is pretty close
