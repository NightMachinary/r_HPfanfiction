I only remember a scene where Hermione asks Harry to help protect the stone. He asks why is it the students job to do so? He then tells the prefects or head boy and girl the Weasley twins are planning a prank on the third floor corridor.

The next day, the professors confront harry and ask him why he lied to the prefects. He says they tried telling the teachers but they didn't believe them (Mcgonagall /cough cough/)

Any ideas?!


** i think its a rather popular one, can remember this scene....
