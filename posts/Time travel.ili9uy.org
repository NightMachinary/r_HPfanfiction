:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic where Harry was older and an Auror (the war was over) and on a mission in a cave somehow it blew up and Harry ended up in the 1970s and in a bar for a drink where death eaters decided to cause trouble. Harry kills all of them except Bellatrix. That's how the story starts. I just can't remember the name of it. Also I will happily take recommendations for any other time travel fanfics too.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
