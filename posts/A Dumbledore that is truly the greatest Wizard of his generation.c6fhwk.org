I've always found it a little ridiculous that the supposed "Greatest wizard of modern times" is incapable of creating something like the Marauders map, or becoming an Animagus, considering he's a master of transfiguration. If the Marauders could come up with and learn these magics, that clearly helped them learn the school from top to bottom. Why can't the all powerful Dumbledore not know them?

If Filch had handed over the map sometime between the Marauders and Harry's time to Dumbledore. He would of known about Quirrell, Pettigrew, and Crouch Jr. being in the castle. He would of known who entered Harry in the Tri-Wizard tournament, etc. He should also have an incredible Animagus like a Demiguise thats able to listen to, and help the students that need it.


** Who say he is not an animagus ? Maybe he just has a useless form like a goat and so never bothered to use it, or to finish the process.

**** Easy doesn't mean fast though. Or valuable, or worth it.

I had a conductor in college that would memorize every program. Every ~3 months, he'd get up and have ~60-90 minutes of music memorized. It was impressive as hell.

But he was the 3rd best conductor on faculty, and the other two better ones never bothered memorizing entire scores.

​

It took 4 talented, powerful wizards years to make the map. Maybe Dumbledore could've done it in a week, but is it ever the priority when he has a week free?

​

For all we know he can track people through the castle without an artifact, or has a better artifact for it.

***** I think the map is incredibly valuable, it would stop quirrel, crouch. If he put an alarm on it for some death eaters names he would know exactly when Draco started his invasion (wouldnt have mattered in the books, but what if they decided to attack at like 2pm when there are classes going?).

Also if the death eaters ever breached hogwarts in a battle, it would be a complete game changer, just throw shit at them when they cant know youre there, but you do(some grenade/flashbang like stuff, maybe the weasley darkness powder). Knowing where the enemy is crucial, especially when they could be invisible.

I think that he should have made the map after year 1, if not earlier. Remember: its not only good against what already happened, it would be great in pretty much any situation where voldemort tries anything at hogwarts.

The way it was in the books, Voldemort could realistically tell his death eaters to just go in through the room of requirement, find a student, polyjuice themselves, then go to the great hall during lunch and use fiendfyre. That is a very obvious plan that dumbledore should have taken precautions against, especially when he knew that hogwarts is breachable (crouch, sirius, imperius).

I like to imagine Hermione finding this out and being outraged that an Original Founder's Object was basically graffiti'd like this.

******* The marauder's map works based on the data picked up by the hogwarts wards, so, while it was certainly an awesome invention for a bunch of school kids, but dumbles really should already have access to those same wards - not just the lockdown function, but also the surveillance functions the map piggybacks off. _____

The question here is - (besides for plot purposes) why would dumbles not already know about pettigrew, or moody, or quirrelmort? I think it's the fact that the wards, if queried, give either a broad sweep of data without specifics - 261 humans and 56 house elves and 48 centaurs and(...) (or maybe just 549 living creatures) Or tell him about one specific person - Harry Potter, human, powerful magically, malformed soul infection, 1 active prophecy.

After all, dumbledore is just a single human, and I somehow doubt occlumency turns his mind into the veritable supercomputer (realistically mainframe but whatever) it needs to be not only to store the data on all the students, but also check them against his memories for security purposes.

Also, if he set up the wards to feed that data into a spell that checks the data against a list of "not authorised" people, the only successful intruders would be voldy (who dumbles knew was alive but who was not only a wraith, but himself a DARK LORD. Sneaking past the wards doesnt seem that impossible a thing for one of the greatest - terrible, yes - but nevertheless one of the greatest wizards of the age) and Sirius Black (In this case I honestly suapect dumbles forgot all about him being innocent and probably assumed him guilty of something or other - and he was not present for the meeting deciding sirius' fate, as the... 'chairman' (I forgot the terminology hehe) was someone else (either Crouch Sr. or Bagnold). It's also possible sirius and the marauders changed their names for the hogwarts wards through the method the map called on the wards. And that guy's Padfoot, not Sirius Black, the name on the list, so the wards didnt detect him). Fake-Moody (Crouch Jr.) and Peter Pettigrew, being presumed dead, were likely not on the list.

- all numbers and the report were random things as examples, not thought out according to research into canon details on wards

Damn, I made a textwall...

Better yet, make a pre-approved authorization list; the students and the staff. If anybody else steps foot on Hogwarts grounds, he automatically gets alerted.

I would agree that it's reasonable that Voldemort could sneak past this anyway, though the argument could be made that he was ridiculously weak as a wraith and shouldn't really be capable of it. But still, it would shut down Peter and Sirius at the least. Probably Barty too, unless we want to say that Voldemort helped him with it somehow.

********* With the list, there's the problem that people like Malfoy Sr. and the like often pop in, as people on the board of governers, and Hogwarts wards extend to hogsmeade - the surveillance ones, not defensive - and the forbidden forest has loads of named creatures, and is definitely under the wards.

The number of notifications for the headmaster and the number of alterations for the headmaster to make to the list would be huge. And have you heard of the plot for watch dogs 2? Trying to make a set of rules that can classify people is complicated when only including humans, and also intrusive. A spell that will scan new faces and determine if they are a threat or need to be reported would require either legilimency or require gathering loads of data on a person, because the amount of reasons why a person would be a threat is huge.

And any such spell would not be safe from alteration themselves.

Last but not least, I doubt dumbles himself is capable of making such a spell, given he's good at transfiguration, not charms.

Also, many of the concepts needed to build a system like that are hard for people to put together even in the modern day and age, and only emerged after a LOT of innovation.

I didnt consider other people to help dumbledore because those people are security risks themselves, be it because they can be compromised by voldy's grandmaster-level legilimency, death, or plain not being as sophisticated and reliable in their analysis of a person as dumbles would be.

Dumbledore is not McGonagall. He is said to be great at every school of magic. He published articles in a scholar journal for charms while he was still a student.

He was said to have done things that the examiner never thought possible with a wand, and that included his transfiguration /and/ charms exam. He came up with the communication method for the patronus spell.

*********** Again, even if he's a charms master himself, I doubt he's an expert at the charms equivalent of programming an AI to manage it. Marauder's map covers only hogwarts, but there are secret areas that the hogwarts wards can pick up, but which the map can't. Weasley twins discovered one such secret passage in canon.

Dumbles Shouldnt have a problem with using his brain to process the location and name of each and every person in hogwarts? I dont think so... And I doubt the wards cant pick up magical creatures, so as I said, The amount of data involved requires a mainframe to handle by human tech of the year 2019. Can Dumbles accomplish the same in his own time? Without a large nunber of geniuses sharing their innovative ideas to develop the framework for this?

Not to mention, Dumbles was not the only headmaster. All the headmasters before him probably had ways to do the same thing. Maybe the same one technique, maybe they had a number of techniques between them, maybe they all together built the list thing we're talking about. It's honestly the logical thing to do, and the only reason that wouldnt have happened is the perpetual stupidity of the wizarding world infecting the headmasters.

Regarding the hogsmeade thing, in DH, there was something about the wards letting people in hogwarts know that there were DE's casting spells in hogsmeade.

That's basically baiting him, you don't set traps and defenses unless you think they might be needed. You can't really argue that.

Well, we've never seen him show wards that do the same thing, we've never seen /any/ other magic that does what the map does for that matter, and we've got some evidence that he does not. He didn't know about Peter, despite the fact that he came up on the map. He didn't know about Sirius breaking in until after the fact. He didn't know about Barty impersonating Moody.

It's not that I think that marauders are better at charms, its not just Dumbledore's forte. He has little interest in it. Like how Einstein may be a theoretical physicist he can invent a new type of refrigeration since someone got killed by an old version so he modified his but it is rare for him to actually invent household stuff, Dumbledore may be just as good but he has little reason to bother with it since it didn't interest him. He can do a fidelus charm and it is interestingand vital enough to learn.

Further more unless one knows the map's password it insults anyone who uses common detection spell on it. There is little reason for one to suspect there is something more to the map since it was owned by a group of mischievous friends. it is not a stretch to think they just made it insult someone. He had no reason to tinker with it, it's a cool charm but it won't interest him since it's not his Forte. You don't use curse breaker level detection in student property just because it insults you. Portraits can insult you directly and it is a step advance to a insulting paper.

The marauders being animagus might get his attention, but technically someone had to tell the three that an animagus registers as fully animal in animal form and will not be harmed by werewolf. that tidbit is obscure enough that I can guess who left that info lying around.

** 1. One of many things I like about linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) are its chapters 68, (and 75!, but that's different point), 76, 82, and 83, whole story of the East African War. It is a bit problematic in the context of the whole story (because it is too big, it infringes on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][the unity of the story]]), but it is a great story just on itself. Of course, the problem JKR never fully resolved is that she didn't follow venerable rule of “Show, don't tell” in the case of Albus Dumbledore. Everybody is talking about him, how is the greatest wizard of all times, but nobody has ever seen him to anything superwizardry since he defeated Grindelwald (and that's a bit long time ago). Climax of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries is the only moment when we see him going full force (and by far the biggest wizarding duel in whole series), but it is too brief and it is only one case.
2. Do we know how he felt about being called this? Wasn't he as reluctant towards his fame as Harry is to be The-Boy-Who-Lived? I really like Dumbledore in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) with all his reluctance and a bit of disdain towards the general public for putting him on a pedestal so much, and his inability to resist it.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
