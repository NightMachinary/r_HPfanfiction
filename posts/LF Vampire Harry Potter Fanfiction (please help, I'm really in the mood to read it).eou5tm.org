:END:
I read it about a year ago and now I'm 'craving' to read it (kinda like food).

Basically, Harry goes into the forbidden forest alone and ends up in the past, he's found by a vampire called Quinton and gets turned by him.

Harry keeps his magic but hides it because he doesn't want anyone to use him. At the time Vampires and Werewolves are at war.

Other facts include: they can't go into sunlight until they are 100 years old, the leader of the coven is called a lamia rector (something like that, I could never remember), Harry ends up as the Lamis Rector, Harry has a kid.

Please help
