Linkffn(The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen)

This OC story is a work in progress. Set thirty years after the war's end, it's about a reclusive adult witch of rare skill, and the aftermath of her correspondingly huge mistake. She's a shameless practitioner of the dark arts, but only when it's necessary (it's often necessary). I don't believe she's a Mary Sue, but I'm not precisely impartial.

My goal for this character was/is to write a half-decent depiction of someone quite flawed and magically brilliant, someone who could attain Dumbledore levels of competence if she lives that long.

I've tried to keep everything as canon-compliant as possible with particular attention to the magic, how it's described and referred to (I'm determined never to use the word 'wards' in any context). The story is pretty dark, but not edgy, and there are scenes with gore, but not to an excess. As for the rest of the plot, I know the exact chain of major events that will occur up to and including the ending, so there's no danger of abandonment, though reaching the end will take a while.

If one is so inclined, accolades and criticism are both very welcome, of course, and the more specific the better. I'm going to bed, but I'll be back later to respond if someone comments.

That's all, I think. Hope someone enjoys it!


** I am a sucker for postwar fics so Iâ€˜ll check it out, thanks

*** Thank you! I forgot to mention, if anyone feels responsy, it'd be great to know if something(s) in particular turns you off about it; small things I can fix, and stylistic quirks I can attempt to iron out later on.

  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.
