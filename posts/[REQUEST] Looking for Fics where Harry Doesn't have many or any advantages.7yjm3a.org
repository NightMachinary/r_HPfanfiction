as in the title, I'm looking for stories where Harry doesn't have 10 million advantages like being rich, famous, magic comes easy, or being immediately popular.

For example: linkffn(8541055) , No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim ; Harry Pretty much has nothing, and yet he's still making his way in the world, though unfortunately that one is abandoned.

Thanks in advance!

*** Yes they are canon but Harry never uses them TO his advantage, /AS/ advantages. :)

******* Oh. Okay! :) Yes Harry could have been so much more than he was, if he took his own initiative more and worked harder. He even admits it in OOTP after Sirius dies, that he should have tried harder with Occlumency and everything. :)

***** True...I can't imagine Harry being able to survive if he didn't have the advantages he did. People love the idea of "I did it all alone," but ~alone doesn't exist in reality. We all have some people/circumstances/opportunities that have allowed us to get where we are - some more than others.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
