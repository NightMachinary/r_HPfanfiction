The reason I ask is Tom Riddle Sr, ran away and eloped with Merope. But after she stopped dosing him with love potions, he left her. So my question is “Is it in any way possible that Tom Riddle Sr came back from marrying Merope found out she died (or didn't) and then remarried some other rich girl?”


** Well, from cannon, we sort of know that Tom Sr. Went back to live with his parents and when Voldemort kills him, the book clearly mentioned '3 dead bodies' so I assume it meant only senior and his parents.

But that'd be a cool prompt for a fanfic to have voldy's sibling come to light, even more so if they're magical.

There is a famous Hermione time travel story where she raises Tom Jr and falls for Tom Sr or something

*** Riddle Sr. was actually abducted by witches every couple of months, and had a well-established yandere harem, each member of which had several children by him.

Merope showed her low class by 'checking him out' like a library book without filling out the proper paperwork.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I think a fanfic author could go that route if they wanted. It's certainly possible.

Personally, I think it's more likely that Riddle Sr. would have lacked the support and healthy coping strategies that would have helped him recover from his prolonged experience as a captive and rape victim. The 1930s-40s were a time when mental health was poorly understood and the concept of PTSD didn't even exist. Thus, I doubt he'd recover enough to desire an intimate relationship with another woman. Even if he did, it's unlikely that he'd be considered a desirable husband after the scandal of marrying below his station, being widowed so quickly, and then returning to live with his parents amidst rumors of lingering mental illness.

*** Though it wasn't immense in a civilian capacity, I'm obligated to disagree with your statement about ptsd. Shell Shock was a word for it with the military but as far as I understand, it spilled into the common vocabulary as a precursor to the formal ptsd.

Wow I've been writing too many essays lately, my brain is doing everything in its power to boost the wordcount.

** We don't know what Tom Riddle Sr did in the years between leaving Merope and his death. It's entirely possible he married someone else and had children. We know that only he and his parents were murdered by Voldemort, which may indicate he didn't have children, or possibly he decided to leave his wife and kids at home to visit his parents.

** He died at 38 years old. That is more than enough time for a kid. Probably out of wedlock. Not even discounting the fact of the lady/girl/etc he was with when Merope was spying on him. He died in the 40s, divorce wasn't heard of much back then.

This isn't even discounting the fact that he could have sworn off women after the Merope fiasco. Or he could have even been obliviated to hell. He was pretty freaked out and started screaming everywhere about magic. Could probably explain why he was still living with his parents.

​

Is it possible? Yes. The chances are pretty slim. It would be hushed up six ways from sunday.

** I would say that it's doubtful. Aside from the fact that HBP tells us that they married, his running out on his wife after just a year would have been a bigger scandal than his original marriage to "the tramp's daughter".

After coming home, he might not have been able to remarry due to the unknown status of his wife. Further, his prospects for a good match were probably pretty dim after his ill-advised and ill-fated marriage to the cock-eyed Merope.

The only bodies discovered were his and his parents'.
