Does anyone have a copy of this story? It seems like fanficauthors is down and I was in the middle of the story


** I haven't checked if it has all the chapters but the waybackmachine seems to have it saved.

*** Thanks for uploading, but now I have to wonder: just why would anybody read this? Sorry, you did a decent thing, and I am just silly.

**** There are thousands of fanfics where I ask that same question. All I can say is that different people like different things. Jeconais is a great author if you want some gloriously fluffy stories where the good guys win and the bad guys get their just desserts.

***** I love “It Means War” so I was eager to try this, but ... oh well.

** Does anyone have a clean copy of the epub? It seems to be corrupted on the site.
