** I feel like "transhumanism" covers two very different things. Absent the afterlife which renders the matter moot, I am all in favor of ending death, but that's more a matter of 'preserving' humanity than transforming it; I'm certainly not keen on altering the nature of human thinking, becoming cyborgs for the hell of it, etc. Yet immortalism as such is branded transhumanism by common classification.

**** In that case, not too interested, though I respect other people who want to do it to themselves.

** Personally, I'm with canon and the embracement of being human. For me the transhumanism in HP is something that extremely hard (like mastery level), limited (even if a wizard could make himself stronger with a potion, I don't think he could get the level of a comic book super hero like Superman, or Hulk), and always come with a price.

For example, I read a lot of fic where Harry just go to Diagon Alley, drink a potion and then doesn't need his glasses anymore. In my headcanon, while correcting his vision is theorically possible, I would need an incredibly dangerous operation of self transfiguration to correct his cornea (the wizard being forced to do it himself because without measure, only he can know when the cornea is well adjusted), with any error carrying the risk to blind the patient. And this is why most wizards just wear glasses (which can also be enchanted).

â€‹

Also, when it comes to transhumanism, there is the problem of the soul. No matter what someone does to his body, the soul can't be touched. There would be no problem when self repearing his body, but when it comes to truly "enhance" himself, there is a possibility that the soul becomes less "adjusted" to the body, with heavy consequences.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem. AU

** I'm partial to stories that explore the outer limits of what it means to be human. Stories like the one you linked (The Carnivorous Muffin's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?") are great examples of that.

When I consider Transhumanism, I'm more fascinated by the extreme scenarios in which science advances to the point that /Homo sapiens/ is made obsolete by the the computing/reasoning capacity of their creations. I like the idea that humanity will eventually create their own replacements; something so far from human that we may lack the capacity to comprehend it, but that might carry on our legacy beyond the life span of our own civilization.

I would love to read Harry Potter fics that head in that direction, maybe with science and magic working together in a far future, similar to the /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfic "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]]".

Thus far, the only HP fics I know of which come close are The Carnivorous Muffin's stories. She tends to write protagonists who stand outside humanity, looking in. Thus, their world view is less anthropocentric, which is the closest I've seen a fic get to the posthuman mindset. "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]" are good examples.

** Trans humanism is embracing humanity by attempting to exceed our limits and continue evolving to a new paradigm. By allowing us to stagnate at the wise ape level, we court extinction.

** "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" has some major themes along this line. It relies a bit heavily on cliches to make the points and drive the plot it wants to have, but picks up steam a bit in. It's fairly popular but mostly with people who don't otherwise read fanfiction.

**** I agree that Yudkowski himself is a bit of a preacher, and that comes through in his writing. I do think it picks up steam and that the random rants sprinkled throughout can be skipped to little deficit.
