I just finished All the Young Dudes and I finished Marauders on Wattpad, so I was wondering if anyone could recommend any canon compliant Marauders fics that span from 1971-1981+, because i'm having a hard time finding any.


** I did not like All the Young Dudes, so our tastes may be different, but I recommend:

linkao3(24620707)

It's my favourite Marauders Era story. It's the first instalment in the series. The first part covers the 5th year, the second part should be soon, I think.

** Shifting Lines is good! Wayy slower pacing than ATYD but really interesting relationships. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20043763/chapters/47464888]])

That span those years not so much but I have some other canon Marauder Fics? Though it's mostly 5th year +

Linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275]])

Also if your finished ATYD, try linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89). Same author but a muggle AU. Very good though trust me ðŸ˜Š.

People seem to like linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7869079/chapters/17970910]]) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30121269/chapters/74195841]]) too but I cannot vouch for them...

I can vouch for Text Talk which is a very nice texting Wolfstar fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]])

Hope they help.

  Long haul Remus Lupin story. Book One covers his First Year at Hogwarts and all its ups and downs. Making friends, keeping his secret, and trying to cope with being in the real world for the first time in his life.The world of Shifting Lines will eventually include Wolfstar. Mostly canon with a few exceptions.Please note there really should be a lot more tags but I dont want there to be a wall so I'm trying to keep it short. I took some of the fluffier tags. I mostly kept in the darker ones as warnings but I promise there is more than angst in this.Completed 3/3/2020!
