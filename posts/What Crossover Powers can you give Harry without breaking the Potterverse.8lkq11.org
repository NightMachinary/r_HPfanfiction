Exactly as asked. For example, the base Sharingan - the ability to learn spells at a Glance, the perception increase and the Genjutsu (which you could have blocked by Occlumency) wouldn't be too OP, but making him Goku would.

I'd like to see Harry with Annihilation Maker (the Longinus that lets you make whatever the hell your imagination comes up with creature wise) or Flat Snark from Mahoyo (Basic fuckery, everything turns into Fairytail and Fantasy objects)

The perception increase and learn spells at a glace would be absolutely OP in and break the Potterverse. I'm pretty sure Harry with Annihilation Maker would break the Potterverse too.

Aura from RWBY wouldn't be too OP but it would depend on what power that granted him.

Quirk from Boku no Hero, again depends on the quirk.

Reiatsu maybe, but i think Shunpo/Hoho might push it over the top. This is if Reiatsu isn't straight up more powerful than magic.

FMA Alchemy should be in line power wise.

Shadow Magic YGO.

*** How about just giving him Magecraft? Nothing absurd like Shirou's Tracing, but even Time Alter. Sane Voldemort, Kiritsugu like Harry. No aide, other than someone acting like Maiya, and someone (Lupin as a former arms dealer or something) supplying guns.

To be fair, it wouldn't break the verse TOO much depending on Voldemort. Learn spells at a glance? you're still years behind Voldemort and have to practice what you learn/learn to use it wordlessly etc. the Perception increase would be broken in duels, but you'd need to be fast enough to match it and dodge/block, and 20 Death Eaters all firing Unforgivables would require Haki like perception to dodge

Harry with Annihilation Maker would just be hilariously fun. Broken, but yeah, Broken AF. Even if you have him augment Magical Animals. "See this Unicorn? Its horn now generations thunder. See this Dragon? It can now Disillusion itself. See this Nundu? Fuck it, they're strong enough alone

**** To get it out of the way: If you're going to crossover power up Voldemort anyways, then that means the power that Harry gets requires something to counteract it by Voldemort which means it already broke Potterverse.

What do you mean Kiritsugu like Harry?

Harry that is just like Kiritisugu personality wise? Then that is just Kiritsugu renamed as Harry.

Kiritisugu ability wise? If you're talking about Time Alter, that would be OP as hell. IF it is only a crossover power not a full on crossover, then time manipulation such as pausing/slowing time is absolutely OP in Potterverse, it shouldn't even be a question. Voldemort/any bad, would need a crossover power just to match, otherwise it becomes a curb stomp.

Sharigan would outright break the Potterverse, that shouldn't even be an argument. To the degree wouldn't matter if you're asking for crossover powers that do not break the Potterverse.

Learn spells at a glance, would break the verse if you're using any non cross-over powered up Voldemort.

You would finish 5 years worth of Hogwarts within the week. Theory portion is to help you cast the spell, otherwise what's the point, and is useless because you already know how to cast the spell. Yea you learn to use it wordlessly, but he would have years in Hogwarts to learn it. The copying portion of the Sharingan is more than just seeing the jutsu performed, you learn how to perform it. If you know how to perform it, wordless spells aren't gonna be difficult for the vast majority.

That is a non-issue, Harry is already decently fast. It isn't like canon Harry is getting hit by a ton of spells already. Occlumency isn't even a general skill. On a 20 on 1 fight, he should/would just use illusions with the Sharingan.

***** To be fair, Kayneth is a FAR FAR FAR better Mage than Kiritsugu, and Kiritsugu just baits him, uses his much lesser skills, and the Overpowered Origin Bullets. a Utilitarian Harry with guns and Time Alter vs all of the Death Eaters and smart Voldemort would be fair purely because Time Alter half crippled Kiritsugu without Avalon inside him (with it, it would be a Lolstomp spite) Origin Bullet would be too OP as Horcruxes would be meaningless if Voldemort was squibbed

So?

That was Triple Accel.

A Double Accel Utilitarian Harry with guns would still absolutely destroy DEs and Smart Voldemort. All he needs is a few seconds. It isn't explicitly stated, but wizards/witches appear slightly more durable than non-witches/wizards so Harry would have those few seconds using Double Accel.

If you're using group numbers to even out the fight against ONE person with a special ability, yea that breaks the Potterverse.

**** Time Alter is still absurd to add in- it's specifically Kiritsugu's innovation, even with the mess with the Emiya crest, and is way overpowered in a world where we don't actually see self-empowerment spells- Harry Potter magic has very little in the way of powering up yourself (bar Voldemort's Flight). Even Shirou's reinforcement would be overkill.

If you wanted to include Nasuverse magecraft, it would need to be something "straightforward" to not break the Harry Potter system- Alchemy, Formalcraft, Runes (HP Runes are basically just for translating languages, there's no such thing as Runic Magic). Complicated/"Special" magic obviously completely breaks the system, i.e. Tracing, Wishcraft, Reality Marbles, many of the Mystic Eyes, but you can feasibly insert Thaumaturgy in the story through bringing in the entire system or creating HP-compliant magic that works with it. The Nasuverse explicitly works by having rules, some of which are essentially written in stone, but others of which can be bent. Not unlike magic "A Certain Magical Index," it includes a hodgepodge of rules that are often tapped into using similar ideas. Harry Potter magic can be similar, especially in the case of rituals involving sacrifice, but tends to be much more whimsical.

At that point, though, you could easily take inspiration from those ideas and include them in the Harry Potter universe, the way most fanfics with Runes or Arithmancy do. You can add material and classes that's mentioned in extra material, like Alchemy. You can include wandless magic.

***** Yeah Witchcraft would lead to Utter ubsurdity. Especially if you start getting into Ploy Kickshaw levels. Flat Snark could solo the whole Potterverse, including the Founders and Merlin.

** You can't give Harry and co any new powers without also giving your bad guys sweet new powers to play with, otherwise the story will end up very unbalanced. For example, if you make Harry a paladin from Warcraft with healing and protection powers (like I did in my own story) you have to give Voldemort some new powers of his own, like necromancy and frost spells.

So if you're going to give him Sharingan, you need to give Voldemort (let me look up Naruto powers real quick) a shadow clone technique or something. I mean hell, you can give Harry the ability to use the Kamehameha and go Super Sayian Wizard as long as you give Voldemort the ability to drink people a la Cell so he can become Semi Perfect Voldemort (then have your Vegita stand in do something dumb and allow Voldemort go to Perfect Voldemort).

The point is, if you are going to give your heroes new powers and allies, you have to give the baddies new powers and allies. If Harry gets aide from the muggle military and learns to use guns, then make Voldemort not crazy and have him rally the magical world to his side. If you give Harry geass and a giant mecha, give Voldemort an even BETTER mecha and his own OP geass (or whoever your villain turns out to be). Unless you want your story to be a stomp (which can be fun) you have to make sure that there is some compelling and interesting reason for the reader to keep going because they want to see how your heroes overcome these new challenges.

*** How about giving Voldemort the Snake Contract? It would fit. Finds it in the Chamber in his youth. Somehow gets Manda to obey him. Though you'd have to give Harry something to match it. Like Jutsu scrolls, or the Mangekyou. Base Sharingan wouldn't be enough to beat Manda without help.

***** The reason i ask in the first place was a power you could use to have Harry legitimately match Dumbledore/Voldemort without DEM like the Hallows. I was wondering how far you can tip things in Harry's favour til he becomes Voldemort's equal.

******* Wasn't the only Imprint Diary a Horcrux, and would actively replace Harry with Merlin/Gryffindor. You COULD go that route, but Merlin is supposed to be >>>>>> Voldemort. Trying to make it fairly equal. Making Harry Kiritsugu would be a funny way to do it.

**** I'd argue it absolutely would. The Sharingan is absolute bullshit, even before mangekyou. Any kind of hiding spell wouldn't work on it, because it can see magic. It can predict enemy movements. It has been able to take people into others minds, that translates into a bullshit legilimency skill in HP. Occlumency would absolutely not stop its genjutsu.

I'd go so far as to argue that Voldemort might become even with a skilled Sharingan user only if he achieved sage mode.

*** I disagree. Canon Harry only survived and succeeded because everybody else does the work for him. A Harry with powers of his own might actually be able to /contribute/ something, rather than just hide while the adults do all the work.
