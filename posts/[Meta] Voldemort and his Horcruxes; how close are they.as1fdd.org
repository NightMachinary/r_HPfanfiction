Hey! So I wanted to get some other people's opinion on the relationship between Voldemort and his Horcruxes. How closely are they connected? Not at all? A vague sense of wellbeing or location? Something even more? Do you think there might be spells, rituals, or something else that might change how much the person can interact with their Horcurx?

I'd love to hear your opinions on what level of interaction you prefer as well! I know canon makes a strong argument for no level of relationship, based on the fact that a few are destroyed without Voldemort even being aware. But is there any evidence in canon at all that there's some level of interaction or link between the two once the Horcrux has been created? Alternatively, what's your favorite fanfiction depiction of where they did have some level of connection?

Also, what other ways that Voldemort has been revived have you read or enjoyed or thought of? I imagine that the particular ritual used in GoF isn't or can't be the /only/ one available. If a Dark Wizard wants to create a Horcrux, but is ore concerned with research than making enemies, or doesn't know who their parents are, then they'd need another way of being revived. What do you think, or what were your favorite depictions?

I look forward to hearing all your thoughts!

Well, there is the fact that with /living/ Horcruxes, you end up with a telepathic link (i.e. Harry, Nagini). Though apparently unique to living Horcruxes in canon, it makes it not too outlandish to extend it to non-living ones in an AU. It also raises the possibility that as he became more and more alive, Diarymort could have developed such a link to Voldemort Prime, of which we simply never learned.

Well, there's flat-out possession, for one thing; I've seen stories where Voldemort takes over Quirrell completely, instead of the weird two-faced hybrid of canon. And, of course, there's the canonical solution of using Elixir of Life instead of the Regeneration Potion.

But generally, I don't think there /would/ be that many options to recreate a body for yourself, simply because the case hasn't come up a lot. Voldemort only needed to recreate a new body for himself /ex nihilo/ because his original one had been blown to ashes by the Power of Love mumbo-jumbo; I think that if he'd simply got hit by a Killing Curse, or had a heart attack, or something, he wouldn't have left his body at all, but rather carried on living as a kind of undead, possibly using healing magic to repair any potential damage to his body. In this scheme a Horcrux-maker is basically the /HP/ version of a lich.

As you mentioned, if Voldemort could sense his inanimate horcruxes in canon then he would have known as soon as Dumbledore started to destroy them.

I've read a few fics which posit that Voldemort originally had an active mental connection to his horcruxes that kept him sane, but that his 'death' severed/damaged the link and that's why he was more psychotic and less charismatic after his resurrection. If he'd had such a link then it would explain why he never felt the need to put an intruder alarm on his hiding places.

Personally, I like the idea that having a damaged soul would feel metaphysically painful, and thus the horcruxes feel an intense draw to reconnect with the other fragments as well as what remains of the 'main soul' whenever they are close to each other. However, when they are far apart they would be completely isolated and cut off from the world, which would drive them mad. This is a common interpretation in fics that focus on the Diary horcrux.

I only know of a few fics that features an alternate resurrection method.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] had a version that seemed to take more inspiration from folklore. The ritual was begun on the seventh chime of the midnight bell and the person conducting the ritual chanted lines with form similar to the scene in the graveyard. It required a cauldron, a septagram drawn on the floor with white candles at the points, the dead body of the person to be resurrected, their spirit, their wand, another fresh cadaver, ash from 7 different species of tree, a dish of water that had never touched the earth, and a vial of blood unknowingly given by an enemy.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] had a ritual that was similar to canon but used willingly given blood of a family member and runes in parseltongue inscribed on the ground around the cauldron.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] involved a participant willingly carving runes into their own body with a ritual dagger but is otherwise similar to canon.
