Looking for any well written (good story is subjective, I'll be happy as long as the grammar is good) Harry centric Peggy Sue fic. Any kind of time travel, sending memories back, looking into the future, etc. Basically anything that tries to "fix" cannon (hence the peggy sue).

Few caveats

1. No Harry/Ginny unless it's a multiple relationship. Basically I don't like Harry/Ginny but if she's in the background like it usually happens in Harry/Harem then it's fine.
2. No Harry/male don't care if secondary characters are gay or no, just not Harry.
3. No Hermione/Ron or Hermione/Draco
4. No OCs that are prevalent in the story. It's fine if the OC is the "trigger" for the fic or if they pop in from time to time but not something like "Harry gets a new BFF" or a sibling
5. No wrong boy who lived, this doesn't usually happen in peggy sue fic but just in case.

Also I've read a lot of the "Don't fear the reaper" challenge so I'd prefer if recs weren't from that sense IV probably read it already.

Sorry for the laundry list but I'm kind of picky when reading fics.


** If you care more about the /fixing canon/ than the time traveling then check [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14188524][Lord of Darkness]], Harry is basically godlike there.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

** Sorry, my favorite Peggy Sues have canon or near-canon ships. Unless you're willing to read a fic that fixes them so they're seaworthy?
