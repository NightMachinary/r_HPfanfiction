Maybe he sticks around at Hogwarts, maybe he goes to haunt George in the shop and get into Casper the Friendly Ghost style shenanigans, maybe he just goes back to the Burrow... It just struck me that it's something I don't think I've ever seen which feels like JKR maybe missed a trick on, in a world where anyone who didn't feel it was their time to die has the option of staying on as a ghost and interacting with the living.

  After helping defeat Voldemort, Ron finds himself not only dead, but a ghost. Worse, his brother Percy had died unbeknownst to the family a year earlier. Worse still, they've been sentenced to spend the next century together. Will they survive?

It's not hugely ghost-Fred-centric, but he does play a significant role in the plot at times.
