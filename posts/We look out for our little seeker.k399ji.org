One of Harry's Quidditch teammates move into one of the houses at Privet Drive for personal family reasons and are shocked to find Harry in the neighbourhood, and even more shocked still to realize just exactly how he's treated, vowing to get payback and help, because they look after their little seeker!

​

The Twins are very likely not going work considering the Burrow and all but any of the Chasers or Oliver, or the later teammates even might make for an interesting take on events.


** Oh god. I looked at this title and immediately thought "??? small Decepticon jets??? in the Harry Potter fanfiction sub???" and then I remembered that it's a position in quiditch. I have Transformers brainrot.

** This could also easily turn into Harry x one of the female players too, which would work pretty well

**** I really don't see enough of this pairing, which is odd since Katie has barely more “screen time” than Daphne, and there's a million Haphne fics.

***** The thing with daphne is she's pretty much a blank slate in terms of almost everything. Katie has at least some preexisting personality and traits

****** Eh sorta, I don't think Ginny would have turned down the captaincy like Katie did, and we don't really see her outside of Quidditch practice and the locket thing in book 6.

******* As I recall, Katie didn't actually turn down the Captaincy, but she did say she knew Harry was going to get it.

That said, a moment where Katie /shines/ is where she refuses Harry's offer of a free spot on the team, despite the fact that nobody would hold a grudge against her. She insists on earning her place by merit, and that's quite noble of her.

As I recall, her friend Leanne is a Hufflepuff, at least in the films, so an inter-House friendship is something to build on for her character, as the only other one we really see is Luna and Ginny.

******* I mean obviously they're not the same character but they share too many traits when Katie has so few of her own. I think she's a great character to explore but only place I've seen it done somewhat decently was in a cadmean victory

***** Pretty sure it's just Slytherin fetishism. Because Daphne's a blank slate, authors can write her as non-offensive while maintaining the Romeo and Juliet drama of an inter-house romance. We already see a lot of Gryffindor in canon and I guess authors aren't interested in writing more about it, which is a shame, because I'm sure there's more to the house than Quidditch parties and Gred/Gorge's unlicensed experiments

** It isn't quite what you asked for but I remember one where Cedric volunteers to stay with Harry at the Dursleys for a short while (after the events of fourth year) and learns about Harry's home life. I could provide a link if you'd like.

Edit: it's pre-Slash at most btw and it's more of a mood study (suffocation of privat drive, stress from bad press) than anything else

  They passed through the barrier and found themselves in Kings Crossing proper, everywhere thronged by children also back for the summer holiday. Any one of the smiling adults could be Harry's relations, so Cedric kept his eyes sharp for lanky builds or unruly dark hair or bright green eyes, amid all the joyful reunions going on around them. It was hard not to be infected by the celebratory mood.Maybe a summer holiday in the peaceful, uncomplicated muggle world was exactly what Cedric needed.

** There was one that sort-of had this premise, albeit she encountered him accidentally.

He ends up being inducted into a secret society, and Katie is his mentor/love-interest (though they're both as dense as bricks).
