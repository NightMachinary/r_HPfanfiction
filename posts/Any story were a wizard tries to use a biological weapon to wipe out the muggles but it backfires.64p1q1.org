Like they release a bio weapon that makes it so the any one infected can no longer conceive a non-magical anymore but instead of being wiped out the muggles have a bit more trouble conceiving but when they do they have an increased amount of wizards and the rest are more like Squibs in that they have magic but not enough to use it.

The wizard who did it would never be caught and the wizards would not notice till twelve year after the bio weapon was used when there are 4x as many muggle born in the coming year as the were in the years before with the amount increase by x4 with each generation, so in the second generation of children after the bio weapon the children that were of the level of squibs are now being born as wizard but wizards that are not powerful enough to pass any O.W.L.S so they don't get invited to wizards schools and there would be 12x as many muggle-borns that do get invited to wizard schools with it continuing to increase with each generation(48x,192x,768x,ect) til all new children were wizards.

with so many muggle-borns there would not be enough room in the wizards schools to train them all there would eventually be hundreds of untrained magical running around with untrained magic with some of there learning to use it by themselves.

but later they find out that it has not just been effecting Humans but plants and Animals as well which causes normal animal to start developing ability like fish developing the abilty to swim threw muggle fishing nets disputing the muggle fishing industry,ect. but the most dangerous thing that has been effected are Bacteria and Virus so there are a rise in new magical viruses and infections.


** It's an interesting premise, but it's more of a setting element than a meaningful plot.

I think that it could be framed as a mystery that the protagonists are trying to solve. It could then transition to a political drama when they do find the cause (if not the culprit), as wizards debate whether they should let the contagion do its thing and eventually replace Muggles with wizards (since wizards generally have better lives than Muggles), or whether to release a cure and return to the status quo ante.

As an alternative, given how magical genetics work, I can imagine someone like Tom Riddle seeking a different kind of immortality: imagine if, one year, out of nowhere, fifty Muggleborns show up at Hogwarts, having similar physical features and increased propensities for Parselmouth, high intelligence, and high-functioning psychopathy. Further testing would reveal that they are half-siblings. Next year, another hundred do, and then another hundred, etc.. (It doesn't even have to be unethical: as far as sperm donors go, Riddle is brilliant, handsome, healthy, and his offspring have a high probability of having magical powers.)

Again, it could be framed as a mystery for characters to solve.

lol that was similar to another unwritten idea I had but it would be caused by Sirius black going to as many muggle sperm banks as he could during the war.

the story idea was more of a one shot crack idea about the idea of Snape having a mental breakdown as he looks down from the teachers table in the great hall and seeing so many student sharing similar features to Sirius black.

**** Why stop at Sirius, though? We know that wizards have had several political movements that tried to reform their relationship to Muggles:

1. Muggle hunters: Muggles are beasts, and should be treated as such.
2. Grindelwald's Greater Good: Abolish Statute of Secrecy, and have wizards openly rule over Muggles for their own good.
3. Death Eaters: Purge Muggle influence by getting rid of Muggleborns and not allowing them into wizarding society; permit abuse of Muggles, as long as Statute of Secrecy is preserved.

I can see other reform proposals floating around, including:

4. Altruists: Abolish SoS, but the state should protect Muggles from abuse.

5. Negative Eugenicists: Kill or sterilize all Muggles.

6. Positive Eugenicists: Spread magical genes far and wide, eventually replacing Muggles with wizards.

The Positive Eugenicists might actually be pretty open about it --- they are out to impregnate as many Muggle women as they can without breaking SoS and wizarding laws against rape, Muggle-baiting, etc., claiming that they are "spreading the wealth".

It's a creepy idea, but it might actually be one that maximizes sum total sapient happiness and minimizes sum total sapient suffering in the long run.

***** 7) 'Friendly Takeovers': control and influence of Muggle governments, corporations, media, and educational institutions through systematic use of memory charms. I can see that happening in canon postwar world. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception][Inception]] should be easy with HP magic, and IMO, far more humane than blanket obliviate and plant false memories in Muggles.

****** TBH, if magic is genetic, I would fully support 6, although using genetic-engineering rather than anything as morally reprehensible as that, of all things. CRISPR for everyone!

*** I honestly don't remember I have read so many fanfics that they all sort of blend together like a gigantic interconnecting web.

Edit: found it is not even an actual fanfic it is in the notes of my many unwritten fanfiction idea that i have had but never written over the years

It starts out with a wizard drinking liquid luck with his goal being to wipe out muggle but it doesn't work as planned and then later dying from the poisonous effect that the potion causes when you drink tow much of it.

Owell if any one want the idea they can haven It because I will probably never get around to writing it.

** There's a story where Voldemort releases a disease to wipe out magic from all people with Muggle blood but since all purebloods have muggle blood at the beginning, it takes magic away from everyone. Voldemort is already dead in that fic and Harry had sacrificed his magic.

  AU end of sixth year. The war spiraled out of control. Harry fought alongside his friends, but many died in the conflict. When Voldemort is finally defeated, it is discovered that he has set in motion the extinction of humanity. Harry, after all he has sacrificed, discovers a way that he can save what was lost, and he will risk everything for the chance to unmake the past.
