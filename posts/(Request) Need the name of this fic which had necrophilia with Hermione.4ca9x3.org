I found this description in a disgusting fics thread

#+begin_quote
  I can't remember the name, but there was this fic where Harry and Hermione get in a fight after Ron leaves during the Horcrux hunt. Well, the fight turns violent instantly, and it ends with Harry killing Hermione by strangling her with a rope. Now, I was pretty disturbed at this point simply because of the way it was written (no remorse, full of hatred, etc). Unfortunately, it gets more fucked up. Harry decides "wow, Hermione has a nice ass." After he killed her. Harry proceeds to have Necrophiliac sex with Hermione's corpse. Right when he finishes, Ron walks back in, mumbling about changing his mind. Does Ron freak out? Does Ron try to kill Harry for the sight in front of him? No, Ron says he doesn't want Harry's sloppy seconds, and that he'll take Hermione in the ass instead. This was, by far, the most fucked up thing I've read.
#+end_quote

I am curious about this one since I have never read a fic where Hermione is killed by Harry.

And also because of the disgust factor.

...Also because I lost all sense of social morality a while ago. Though admittedly, necrophilia is new, even for here.

so is reading "messed up" stuff when browsing through HP fics.

And is child marriage not "messed up"?

**** I was on my phone and it wouldn't cooperate. The difference, which I'm just assuming you're chosing to ignore, is that I don't read A song of Ice and Fire because I desperately want to read about child marriage.

It's just a historical fact that it happened like that and the author doesn't shy away from it. Now, if I were asking for a fic specifically asking for child marriage here... That'd be fucked up and you'd have every right to chastise me.

I probably should've ignored this thread, for the sake of my sanity if nothing else, but someone seriously needs to put his or her foot down. There need to be bloody limits for what one searches for here.

Great hypocrisy there. I specifically mentioned that I wanted this fic for the Harry killing Hermione in rage , and not "necrophilia " content.

But I guess you lost your shit when you saw "necrophilia"
