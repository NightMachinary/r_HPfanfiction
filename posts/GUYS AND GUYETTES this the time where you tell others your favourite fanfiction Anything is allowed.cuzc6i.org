** But not slash, because that's bad /s

But seriously, the downvoting in regards to slash is CRAZY, and saddening. People wonder why the slash family made their own subreddit XD

**** Ahahaha, I knew it would happen.

Though, tbh, there is a LOT of downvoting on this sub, and not just against slash stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
