** linkffn(11395728). Well-written, quite long and now into a sequel, and actually written by a writer with dissociative identity disorder. I've seen a couple others, but this is by far the best.

  Harry Potter is a wizard, which surprises him. But Harry Potter is also a Multiple, which surprises everyone. But that's not the end of the surprises. Note: Trans!Harry eventually. This part is complete. The story will continue as "The Many Faces Go To War." Check my profile or subscribe to my author page for updates.
