** Ron the betrayer.

I'll go one better: I wish that there had never been a canon instance of Ron turning his back on Harry. He stood by him to face giant fucking spiders and stood in front of him when he thought Sirius Black was going to kill Harry. It could have been a bromance of the ages, if Ron had been the one to stand up and say 'I believe Harry' when his name came out of the Tri-wizard Cup, and I think it would have been a better turn if Hermione was the one to get mind-bent by the horcrux enough to get separated from the trio in the last book.

Could you imagine that? Dumbledore believes in Ron enough to give him a book of fairy tales but hands the light-stealing/giving device to Hermione, knowing that she will become frustrated or might be lost along the way and need to find Harry again. When she leaves, EVERYONE would think Harry and Ron are essentially screwed. Ron would agree to visiting Godric's Hollow because he understands how important family can be to a person.

In her absence, the two men would fight but afterwards they would also confess their feelings for the girls in their lives. Ron would resolve to tell Hermione how he feels with Harry's encouragement... if they ever find her again. In the meantime, they'd listen close to Potterwatch in fear of hearing that she'd been captured.

*** Both arguments are very misunderstood in the fandom, and usually informed by the film versions.

The films in general took every opportunity to bastardize, slander and bash Ron, creating a fanon interpretation that is sustained via fanfiction. In Deathly Hallows part 2 the film makers very un-subtly created romantic tension between Harry and Hermione (which was clearly not present in the books), creating a tidal wave of anti-Ron sentiment from Harry/Hermione shippers.

Only quite recently has Ron bashing become less popular, and fanfics with Ron as a main character are becoming more popular.

I just don't see how a fandom can be so bloody defensive of Malfoy, but bash someone like Ron.

**** | Yeah, sometimes I am curious exactly why JKR chose for Ron to turn his back on the trio

Ron struggles with jealousy and feelings of inadequacy. In addition, his temper leads him to act without thinking. Seeing Harry get chosen for something Ron thinks would set him apart from his family sets off his temper, so you can see why he initially would blow up at Harry. (You know, besides being fucking 14, since this community has such a hardon against teens acting like teenagers. See any discussion with Cadmean Victory in it) After the initial blow up, he probably struggled with embarrassment about how he acted, and double downed on his behavior. It's hard for adults to admit when they are wrong, so you can imagine it would be hard for Ron.

Hermione would give Harry the benefit of the doubt. She tends to believe the best in people, until they prove otherwise.

I do think a Hermione betrayal would be cool to read, if written without her saying it's because he broke the rules that she follows religiously (Because brewing a high level potion and illegally imitating other students is the behavior of a rules stickler, m-i-rite?) or because she's in love with Ron (these fics are normally heavy on the bashing so...). Hermione is very vicious in canon, and I wonder how her betrayal would have played out.

My thought was, since Hermione isn't there as a mitigating factor, Harry and Ron would get into a fistfight with each other, urged on by the influence of the horcrux. When it was done and they both were recovering and admitting that it was a pointless and painful waste of energy, they'd also be able to share a drink and confess their unspoken fears.

******* *Call-out culture*

Call-out culture (also known as outrage culture) is a term for the social phenomenon of publicly denouncing perceived racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of bigotry. Denunciation ("call-outs") can happen in person or online.Some commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the controversy at Google over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer James Damore. Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm progressive politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour. A 2013 essay, "Exiting the Vampire Castle", by Mark Fisher, is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture.

** Characters almost INSTANTANEOUSLY becoming badass or intelligent or competent or something else like that. It's stupid to assume that you could learn all the intricacies of magic and be at a level where you could compete with adults in an insanely short time. The number of fics I've seen where Harry decides suddenly without that he will be better and then they time skip and he's suddenly a badass. I know that it's relevent to the plot and all but it would take only a little more effort to write a premise where he worked hard from the day he got his books all the way until the point where you're writing your story.

Essentially my biggest problems with fanfiction in general is the common lack of character progression or lack of flaws entirely. I get that you want to write your favourite characters to be the utter Gods you want them to be but they can't start off that way and they can't be utterly flawless. It may be fun to fantasize about but when you're reading the story out just makes it so hard to read ahead because you know that there isn't any real risk and all the conflicts will be resolved easily.

Makes sense. Like how people have to use standard No. 2 pencils.

I remember reading a fanon explaination that quills work a lot better with parchment than pens and pencils, and that the parchment is enchanted (supported by post owls being able to sense who to bring their letter to), so they needed to use parchment.

Things that were once living have a greater presence in magic, along with metal and stone taken from the earth. They are easier to enchant and hold magic far longer.

Harry is physically blind but can see magic. Wood, metal, natural fibers, parchment, quills are bright with the colors of magic while concrete, plastics and other synthetics, are dark shadows. Wizards prefer the former over the latter.

Whether it's being emancipated, sticking it to Dumbledore/the Ministry/Voldemort (whoever), or getting a pesky Horcrux removed, the "Helpful Goblins" have all the answers (even though they're, you know, just a bank). Although they hate wizards, they find something truly special about Harry, and therefore will go to great lengths to help him.

Often in these stories we have Harry magically able to either say the correct English phrase to get them to think he's just super awesome or he even has memorized Goblin language etiquette books that dictate just what to say on such an occasion. It's usually something that's trying way too hard to sound commanding and adult but just comes off as juvenile.

** Slytherins being actually cunning, Machiavellian politicians at age 11.

I get the desire to depict it as more than the shithole it was in canon, but you have to remember that the pureblood bigots end up there due to tradition and disqualification in the other houses (genocide is not chivalrous, attacking Muggles is not fair play, believing in pureblood supremacy is not a sign of intelligence). The likes of Malfoy, Lestrange, Flint and Crabbe/Goyle have to go somewhere and they fit nowhere else. So obviously they would drag the standard down considerably (and beat up anyone acting like the average fanfic Slytherin).

Perhaps the better way would be to have a lot of fractions in Slytherin with lots of (sometimes quite violent) infighting, with the wannabe Death Eaters ruling the lot with mob-tactics.

According to the Sorting Hat's own words, someone not suitable for any of the four Houses would end up in Hufflepuff. That is what Helga Hufflepuff wanted. Unlike the other three Founders, she wanted to reach everyone who would learn.

She valued hardwork, kindness and fair play but still /would take the rest and teach them all she knew./

** Aside from the ones already mentioned in this thread, I'd get rid of wizards saying 'Merlin' as an exclamation instead of God/Lord/etc. It's very minor, but it's a pet peeve of mine that fanon somehow made this universal, despite it not occurring in the original books at all--even pureblood bigot Lucius Malfoy says 'Good Lord' at one point.

*** What's more I'll add is the secrecy thing didn't become law until the late 1600s. Christianity was pretty much standard for Europe and you are even looking at a post protestant revolution world.

So unless you are arguing that in an attempt to distance themselves from the world they are hiding from wizards revived ancient half forgotten pagan traditions it makes sense for them to be Christian's towards atheism/spiritualism than anything

**** My only argument against this is that nothing of Christianity is shown in the books other than Christmas and the "oh god/lord" expressions, all of which could be written off as a culture thing rather than a religious one. I'm an atheist and I have atheist friends who all celebrate either Christmas/the Solcist, and we say "oh my god," because that's a holiday and an expression of the culture we were brought up in.

***** Right, and maybe I didn't communicate it properly but that is what I meant by my last bit. They use christian expressions, or expressions that are common in the historically christian world even though they themselves aren't practitioners of the faith.

​

Though that does raise questions about magicals in the Far East, the Islamic World, Subsaharan Africa, and the Americas. What expressions might they use, and for that matter what are their opinions towards the Statute of secrecy? Did all the world really agree to it, or was there a period of/Ongoing magical colonialism to enforce it across the globe?

** I don't think it's the one I find the most objectionable, but the one that comes to mind right now is the "House Elves need to be bound to a wizard family in order to survive" trope.

"But, 'Mione, House Elves need wizard magic, they'll die if they're free." Explained Harry

Hermione had a skeptical look on her face as she asked "Are you sure? I've never read anything about that."

"Of course I'm sure 'Moine, trust me, I studied all summer, except for the time that I spent shopping for a new trunk, and new clothes, and a custom wand, and all the time I spent writing letters to my new Slytherin friends, and inheriting my lordships, oh and dealing with my marriage contracts and my parents will and all that Independent Harry (TM) stuff. But other than all that I studied all summer, so I'd know better."

"Oh, okay, well if you're sure, I guess I'll just stop caring about House Elves and never mention it for the rest of the fic, I sure am glad I have such a smart and wise friend, such as you."
