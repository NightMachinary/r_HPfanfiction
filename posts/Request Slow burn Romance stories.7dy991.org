I know some people can get rather annoyed at the romance taking a long time but I like a slow burning romance, it just makes it more believable for me.

Can be any Era, anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, I tend to not like them; but if they are believable I will allow it.

Very little to absolutely no character bashing please. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

I read Grow Young With Me.


** Damn, this is the third time I've rec'd this tonight, but when it fits, it fits. This is the best romance novel in the fandom in my opinion:

linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca)

Maybe check out linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7; Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7; Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker). *Warning: Yellow Submarine is about hurt/comfort regarding rape and PTSD, but it is pretty excellent.*

The last one is kind of in a grey area because they don't actually get together in the chapters that have been released, by linkao3(Tomorrowland by winterfool) is the best Harry/Luna I've read.

** linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW)

The slowest burn. It takes like 400k words for them to get together. Also contains the most sensible interpretation of a marriage contract I've ever read.

The first ten chapters or so are a bit iffy. But the story gets better after that.

*** How is Daphne Greengrass written? Is she written like a ice princess/ice queen? I tend not to read stories that have her written that way because I don't see her that way myself so I was just curious.

  How is Daphne Greengrass written?
#+end_quote

As a cautious, bright, somewhat self-serving, seventeen year old girl. I could write more but the story is 50% plot and 50% character study, so a lot of effort is put in by the author to demonstrate how Harry & Daphne (and Ron & Hermione to a lessser degree) grow, develop and change.

#+begin_quote
  Is she written like a ice princess/ice queen?
#+end_quote

There is no ice and there is no princess (or queen). In fact the author flat out states he will not write Daphne in that way, in one of the early chapter ANs.

***** Okay cool thanks for letting me know. I tend to stay away from ice princess/ice queen stories of Daphne just because that's not how I see her character.
