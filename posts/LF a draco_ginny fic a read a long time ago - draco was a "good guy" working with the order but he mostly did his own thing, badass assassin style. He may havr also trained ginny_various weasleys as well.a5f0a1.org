** Not sure if this is what you were looking for, as it was a Harry-centric story, but it has elements of what you mentioned: (eventual) Draco/Ginny, Draco working with the good guys somewhat independently (I remember that there was some sort of mystique or aura of death about him), don't remember about the training, though.
