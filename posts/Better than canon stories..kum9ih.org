Share the stories you think are better than canon! Complete rewrite? AU? Sequel or prequel fics? Anything goes as long as you explain why the fic is better (to you) than canon.

Feel free to discuss, but if you disagree with someone, please keep it polite.

** I keep coming back to this one:

linkao3(13795605) Victoria Potter.

Mainly because of the insane amount of world-building done in the background and the fact that, while it's still recognizably a Potterverse fanfic, it reads like an entirely different series as opposed to "canon events but with x added in".

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/632600][Crow Rides a Pale Horse]] series has gorgeous worldbuilding, including a whole lot of details, like a more interesting Triwizard Tournament, and specifics of anti-werewolf bias. All the wholesome hugging can get tiresome, but the story overall is great.

** Think the quality of writing in "A Marauder's Plan" is excellent, maybe on par with canon? I know your post is asking for better but I just felt like it sucks you into another world the same way canon does, like I can picture so many things so clearly.

I actually abandoned it quite deep into the story/skipped ahead to the end, just because there are a lot of things that aren't *my* thing- i.e. the Lord stuff/family magic/Harmony/ Harry being good at everything....but I would highly recommend it to others.

*** The bashing immediately disqualifies this one for me. Rather then long form, some one-shots/short form stories would fit better?

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.
