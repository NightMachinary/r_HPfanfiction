I've read a lot of body-switch stories, so I thought I'd write one of my own! Looking for feedback and suggestions, especially regarding the way I've written Dumbledore. I've got a few more scenes written for the next chapter, including Harry-as-Dumbledore meeting Scrimgeour for the first time, as well as Harry and Dumbledore going to an ICW conference, in addition to some horcrux-hunting scenes.

** It was a long time since I laughed so much. Both your Dumbledore and Harry impersonating Dumbledore are amazing. If you can also deliver on the drama part of the fic, and keep it from devolving into absolute crack, it would be fantastic.

*** Okay, noted, I'm definitely trying to balance it so it doesn't become crack, so I'll keep an eye out for that. Thanks!

** My ONE criticism is that, at times, it was difficult to follow who was talking. Granted, I'll probably get used to it when you add more chapters, and I'm not certain it's anything you could solve without breaking immersion.

Is that breaking immersion?

**** I meant I had trouble following who was saying what because they switched bodies, not because the author literally didn't indicate who was talking.

That's why I said it'd be something I'd eventually get used to.

** You could go the gred/feorge route to show who's speaking: humbledore and dotter[with the first letter signifying body while the rest of the name signifies actual soul]. Or h/p-dumbledore and d-potter to show harry talking through dumbledore's body or vice-versa.
