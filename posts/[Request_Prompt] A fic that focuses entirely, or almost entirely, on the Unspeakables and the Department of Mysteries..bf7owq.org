The wiki description makes me think that it could be a very interesting self-contained fic that doesn't need to involve any characters from the main series.

#+begin_quote
  Very little is known about what an Unspeakable actually does, due to a high level of secrecy surrounding the Department of Mysteries. Some may study love in the Love Chamber, which, according to Albus Dumbledore, is kept locked at all times, or time in the Time Chamber, where the Ministry's stock of Time-Turners was stored prior to being destroyed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries; others may explore the nature of thought in the Thought Chamber, or death in the Death Chamber, where Sirius Black was killed by his own cousin.[1] There is a veil in the Death Chamber that acts as a one-way doorway, separating the land of the living and the land of the dead. Any living being who goes near it will hear voices of his/her dead loved ones. Any living being who tries to cross it will suffer instant death.

  The autonomous nature of the Department of Mysteries granted the Unspeakables a great deal of impunity, as they are the only division that does not need to answer to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. They can even ignore the Minister for Magic's interventions, as they did when Minister Radolphus Lestrange attempted to shut down the Department.

** I've always thought a procedural/case of the week format would be perfect for this. It could be totally original characters and take place at any point in the timeline, done like Fringe or Warehouse 13 but within the HP universe. It wouldn't have to be the major stakes present in the series, just a romp through the magical world and the oddities it contains.

  Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter assumed they would never be anything but civil enemies, until Potter lands on Malfoy's doorstep, bleeding, covered in curses, and acting very strangely indeed.

** Okay, so it's not all about the DOM but you get a lot of good stuff about it in linkffn(Healing Hermione by LeQuin) Harry is an unspeakable and Hermione soon joins him. There's not a ton of detail, but the DOM at least plays a role throughout the entire story
