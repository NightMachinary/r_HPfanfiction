I just started this fic, it's my first one ever so bare with me. Currently have two chapters posted at 3k words about half way through chapter 3.

I got the prompt from this group so I figured I should say thank you and share what I have so far.

Hope you like it

Story: Harry Potter and the Flaming Phoenix [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13503265]]


** I quite liked it and its implications. Harry couldn't rescue Ginny from the Chamber (as he is not a Parselmouth), Harry doesn't get any visions of Nagini attacking Arthur Weasley and the locations of the cup and diadem horcruxes. It has great potential.

*** I dont know just yet how I'm going to treat the chamber just yet, I have some ideas but I need to get through first year first

As for the horcruxes, I have a plan for those and hopefully it all ends up making sense

** As a preface: In my defense, I'm sick or getting over whatever I'm sick with. And a case of penicillin allergic reaction.

It took me halfway through the first chapter before I realized this was the prompt I made...

​

Oops?

Followed.

** Your story will greatly benefit from the skills of a beta reader. Fanfiction.net has a list of people who are glad to help fic writers with issues like spelling, punctuation, etc., and fleshing out ideas. I think it's good that you are trying your hand at writing a fanfic, but there are some things that a beta could definitely help you with. Good luck!
