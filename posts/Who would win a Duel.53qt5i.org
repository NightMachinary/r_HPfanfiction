In this discussion, I want to explore who would win a duel to the death. Death for this discussion is the neutralizing of the bodily threat that the wizard has. I say this, because it feature Voldemort who is known to have Horcruxes.

Grindlewald in his prime (Before the battle with Dumbledore in which he lost the Elder Wand) verses. Voldemort (his prime, before the utterance of the Prophecy)

RULES: None except no outside interference. That includes Nagini, and death eaters. This is a one on one duel.

Who wins? and Why?. Any fics that feature this duel are of course welcome to be linked.


** Voldemort, no doubt.

Grindlewald with Elder Wand couldn't beat Dumbledore. Dumbledore with Elder Wand couldn't beat Voldemort. With magic, sure, age might slow the reflexes a bit, but knowledge increases, and with magic power scales with knowledge and skill.

*** And Voldemort was defeated by a seventeen-year-old, who had very little training (and knowledge) compared to him.

There could have been a valid reason on why Grindlewald lost to Dumbledore, whether it was a distraction or because he got cocky with an 'unbeatable wand' and made vital mistakes.

I do agree that Voldemort would win, but it's simply because he was a better duelist overall, at least in his prime.

***** HP wikia: "Dumbledore's romantic feelings towards Grindelwald went unrequited and indeed probably unrevealed, given the culture of the late 19th century, but their friendship was very close. But Grindelwald was a sociopath, and may have sensed that the depth of his friend's affection for him could be used to monopolise his attention and push his moral envelope."

So probably not actual lovers. And Grindelward's sociopathy makes him unlikely to be significantly influenced by emotions - he was possibly apprehensive of Dumbledore's reaction to Ariana's death, and perhaps had some remaining ties from their former friendship, but that would not have caused him to hold back. Dumbledore was the one more likely to be emotionally compromised in that situation, imo.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore with Elder Wand couldn't beat Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Because it implies that Voldemort trumped Dumbledore or forced him back or something of that nature, when in fact, the only time we've really seen them duel, Dumbledore was the one pressing the advantage and Voldemort was the one who backed off in the end.

Back on topic, we don't know enough about Grindlewald's situation to estimate how powerful he is. If I had to guess, I would say Grindlewald would have the upper hand, since he terrorised a much larger population for a similar length of time as Voldemort and was unmatched until his ex-lover came to confront him. We don't know the particulars for that confrontation, but it was quoted to be "the most magnificent duel" that people have ever see and there could be extenuating circumstances behind Dumbledore's victory just as there was for Harry's victory over Voldemort. Often times these nuances aren't explained to the public.

***** Not really, Dumbledore was still fairly old and was most likely faster than he could have been in the Duel in the Atrium. His magical knowledge most likely didn't change at all, he still relied on his own previous knowledge to research something instead of going and getting new books etc. Not once did Harry mention that Dumbledore seemed to have books sprawled across his desk, there is a reason he looks into pensives more than he looks into pages.

** We have no idea how Dumbledore beat Grindelwald. For all we know, Grindelwald could be twice the mage Voldemort is, and he was captured through intelligent trickery.

Sure if we pretend that it was one on one, wands only and without any sort of preparation, the case is clear: Voldemort / Dumbledore > Grindelwald.

But still, Grindelwald is basically a blank slate. In linkffn(Hail Odysseus) for example, Grindelwald in his prime would have wiped the floor with Voldemort, while in linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) Voldemort in his prime could have taken on Grindelwald and probably win.

I personally like to believe that Grindelwald was for the entirety of Europe what Voldemort was for Britain, and with an equally bigger repertoire and power. I personally would write Grindelwald as the superior wizard in a one on one duel with Voldemort.

But again, this is all just fanon.

** It is my belief that Grindlewald would actually win.

Grindlewald was Dumbledore's equal, except Dumbledore (in harry's mind) was slightly quicker with transfiguration. Voldemort excelled in Dark Magic. It should also be noted that when Voldemort and Dumbledore dueled, that they were equal. Dumbledore was over a hundred years old at that point, and had not been practicing magic as strenuously as he would have when he fought Grindlewald. During Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel, Voldemort would have lost to dumbledore. Dumbledore, if he was fighting to kill would have killed Voldemort in the first couple of seconds. It is because he believed in the prophecy that Dumbledore did not kill Tom in the Atrium.

However if we look at the duel between Grindlewald and Dumbledore, we know that it was "the most magnificient duel ever witnessed." We can assume then that in essence the two participants were equal. Dumbledore in his prime /couldn't/ kill Grindlewald.

That is why I say that Grindlewald would win. The only measuring stick that exists between them is Dumbledore, who had multiple chances to kill Tom. Tom even admits it, asking why Dumbledore isn't trying to kill him. Yet Grindlewald, not only survived but only lost because Dumbledore had a slightly faster transfiguration.

*** A series of valid points.

I'd argue that Voldemort asking why Dumbledore isn't trying to kill him doesn't automatically mean Dumbledore could kill him, just that he wasn't trying to. They do say that in the first war he was "The only wizard he[voldemort] ever feared." I always interpreted this as him being afraid because Dumbledore knew who he was pre-voldemort, not because of magical power differences. The thing that sticks for me is Dumbledore himself states that when it comes to magic Voldemort knew more than he did, primarily because he delved into the darker aspects I'd guess. So take them both in their prime, it's not quite so cut and dried. I think in a duel to the death etc, Dumbledore would lose. I don't think he's got the real killer nature that the other two would have to have to start a war. Moving to Voldemort vs Grindelwald? Harder. Grindelwald always struck me as more politically capable than Voldemort, but in dueling? He was a rival of Dumbledore true, but throughout the series and extended universe everyone paints him as second string to Voldemort, though that may be traditional British bias. My money is on Riddle.

**** You'd argue, but you'd lose. Many people knew of Tom Riddle being Voldemort, Slughorn and the older professors from Hogwarts all knew, while Minerva and Filius might have known as well (given they were a part of Dumbledore's "Inner Circle"). Voldemort may have known more about/more magic than Dumbledore, but in reality, Albus bested him in combat (despite multiple handicaps) and Voldemort technically being in his prime. If it was a duel to the death, Dumbledore would still win. In my mind, Dumbledore has always seen one hundred steps ahead of everyone else, even in duels; most (if not every) spell cast during that duel in the ministry was somehow countered by Dumbledore or parried.

Then there is Grindelwald, there is no question about his intelligence, in this case. I doubt Dumbledore would have wanted to be "with" anybody less intelligent than himself, it was a characteristic of his that was well known in his earlier years (considered himself wasted potential if he didn't get to travel the world, wanted to rid the world of non-magicals because he thought them undeserving, etc...) While Grindelwald lost to Dumbledore prime, he still put up a tough battle and Dumbledore only won because he was "a shade more skilful", while that can mean many things, I liked to think Dumbledore was referring to an underhanded tactic he used during the duel (Like a sucker punch, or maybe playing on emotions etc...).

The second string to Voldemort as a Dark Lord, not as a wizard. Like I said before, Grindelwald existed in a time where Dark Magic was more accepted by the ICW, but even then he was kicked out of Durmstrang because he was too extreme in his methods. Meanwhile, Voldemort had to actively search out Dark Magic, only after his wizarding education (Giving Grindelwald a significant headstart in terms of magical knowledge).

My money is on Gellert for this one.

** Grindelwald would win, if he truly matched Dumbledore in his prime, he would defeat Tom quite effortlessly. The main reasons that Dumbledore's duel versus Tom was long and drawn out was because of two reasons, 1) he was not fighting to kill, 2) he was not in his prime. Grindelwald lost because he was cocky, his hubris got the best of him, or he didn't take Dumbledore seriously (Old flames and all). Not only did he go to Durmstrang at a time where Dark magic was as normal as learning the stunner in most schools in the ICW, he still managed to best everybody.

It would not just be a power thing, because if you get the right three witches/wizards together, they could beat or hold off anyone. Grindlewald controlled/terrorized most of Europe. There were definitely three witches or wizards that could team up and hold him off. The fact that only dumbledore could beat him means he was weak to dumbledore.

JKR: [re: Grindelwald] I think he was a user and a narcissist and I think someone like that would use it, would use the infatuation. I don't think that he would reciprocate in that way, although he would be as dazzled by Dumbledore as Dumbledore was by him, because he would see in Dumbledore, 'My God, I never knew there was someone as brilliant as me, as talented as me, as powerful as me.
