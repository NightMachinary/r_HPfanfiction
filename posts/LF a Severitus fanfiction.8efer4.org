Hi! I hope you guys can help me.

I'm looking for a fic I think I've read on AO3. It was about how Harry has been put aside by his parents so they can be here for the not so true boy-who-lived. Harry is adopted by Severus Snape and his family. And when Harry goes to Hogwarts, I think he goes to Slytherin and his twin is a huge jerk whose fame has make his ego huge?

If you can help me find it, it would be great! Thanks!


** So it was also a Wrong Boy-who-lived fic. And like Snape has many children with his wife?

Maybe it wasn't on AO3.

So if someone could help, it ould be great.
