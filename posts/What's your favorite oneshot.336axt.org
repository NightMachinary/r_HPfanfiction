****** I like that he can swap perspectives on someone. It's a nice contrast to someone choosing to just senselessly bash one character constantly in all their stories.

I love the way Wood is in Number Games. It's such a parallel to the way Football/Soccer pundits are a lot of times - some are homers, but a lot of them just absolutely skewer their old clubs after they leave, because they don't want their replacement making them look like the organization got better after they left. Must be a Footy fan. :)

****** Its hardly just Wood. /Bungle/ starts off with some ridiculously contrived plot to 'control' Harry, which included everyone in the Weasley family (bar Bill), Hermione and Dumbledore. /Lie/ is better, but the portrayal of the Weasley family (this time including Bill) is still stupid, all of Gryffindor hates Harry when he becomes champion (they threw a party in canon instead) and Victor Krum is suddenly the devil reborn.

JBern writes fun stories, but most of his characterizations, bar the main characters, are plain terrible. Even /Lie/ skirts into bashing territory way too often for my comfort.

** I've always liked excentrykemuse's /Crayon Colored Lupines/. Not for the pairing but for the writing style, more than anything; I always remember it as being the first time I was exposed to such a...um, /distant/ (for want of a more noetic description) writing style, and loving the way it felt to read. Of course, no links for it--this one's easy to find by googling, though. Kind of like the /Enchantment/ series for the same reason, but that's slightly harder to get hold of (in full, at least).

All I can say is that the ExcentrykeMuse's fics are mainly slash, that both her multichaps and oneshots are very well written, and a lot of her work seems (to me, at least) to have a slightly dream-like quality about it.
