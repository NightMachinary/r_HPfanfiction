I'm actually really curious about Harry's fortune. He's from an ancient family line that is practically an honorary "Sacred Twenty-Eight/Nine" so surely he has more money than the few piles that were in his vault. There's also the fact that he's most likely still paying for any Potter properties (possibly a mansion?), as well as the manufacturing of Sleekeazy's Hair Products. I know that his grandfather sold the company, but could Harry be possibly getting some sort of profit like some sort of investment fund?

As far as I'm aware, a headcanon is that Harry is still gaining money for it. My own personal thoughts or headcanon is that Harry's family/he still partially owns the company, and is, therefore, still getting profit from it.

Just a few thoughts.


** The Weasleys are also in the Sacred Twenty Eight. This list has no meaning in terms of wealth or power. It just means that in the 30s, whoever wrote that list thought those families were still pure blood.

*** I wasn't thinking of fortune when I mentioned Sacred Twenty-Eight, actually. I just thought that the Potters are practically in the Sacred Twenty-Eight because the bloodline is so old.

** My headcanon is that Harry has a decent pile of money and that's it. The potion patents probably expired a while ago and/or the formula got replaced by a better one by a competitor. I highly doubt that Harry has any stock in a company since a civil war isn't the best time to invest in the economy so his parents probably sold everything. They had the house in Godrics Hollow but that's a memorial site now, resale value equals zero. Sirius probably doesn't have that much more either, his mother likely spent much of the family fortune to fund Voldemort so it's far from what it used to be. It's also very unlikely that there are any crazy useful magic items / amulets in a vault somewhere because if they existed, they would've been used during the first war. If the Potters had a big manor it likely was used as a base for the Order, attacked by Death Eaters and completely destroyed during the first war, otherwise we would've heard of it. The land might still be worth something but it could've been sold during the war for a very low price to help fund the Order. Can't fight a war without money after all.

*** I believe the company was sold by his grandfather, but, even if it wasn't, it's a hair product. I bought shampoo yesterday and I'm in the epicenter of a plague.

Walburga was a sympathizer. Not a supporter. They thought he had the right idea "until he showed his true colors." She wasn't the oldest/only Black nor did she outlive her parents and ILs. She also doesn't seem like the type to go broke for anyone.

If it was a base for the Order Dumbledore would've protected it. The bases in canon are well protected until Dumbledore dies /and/ the Ministry falls to Voldemort causing the protections around them to fall. If there was a house, it's much more likely that James just moved out of it to protect it like Slughorn does his parents' home.

*** I feel like hiding (even with Fidelius) in the only house that you own is...kind of dumb and not exactly hiding. Bear in mind that the Potters were in hiding for some time /before/ the Fidelius was cast (the Fidelius lasted a week), so hiding must have actually been hiding.

In fact, despite the wiki referring to it as 'Potter Cottage', in canon it is /never/ referred to as such, it is simply 'the cottage'. So I don't believe they owned it.

Even if it wasn't a country house, Harry's grandparents have to have lived somewhere. We don't know what their opinions on the Order were, whether they supported it or not and even if we take Pottermore's comments on them as true (which I emphatically do not), they died at the height of the war - James and Lily's lives were manic and then Lily got pregnant and then a prophecy happened and they went into hiding.

Harry is, generally speaking, /utterly uncurious/ about his family. He doesn't ever so much as think about his grandparents or whether he has any magical relations. So there's nothing to say that he doesn't own property he doesn't know about.

*** That's an interesting headcanon and I do actually agree with it.

I'm simply just interested in the political (?) side of Harry having a vault and becoming the Potter Heir to the Ancient House of Potter. I read a really interesting fic where Draco and Harry got together (I think it's where Draco got his veela inheritance, but I'm not sure) and everyone begins to realize all of the crap that Harry's been through and how he's kinda gotten the short side of things. I actually think the fic might be linkffn(DragonKin). But, everyone begins to learn that Harry's not simply just lazy or anything but that he truly doesn't understand anything about the wizarding world or just school in general. And it ties into Harry somehow learning that his family has an actual separate vault full of treasures and he finds a will and then he keeps learning things about his family and just about wizarding politics itself. So, I guess you could say that it's not really my headcanon, but I agree with it completely.

I just really like rich Heir Potter Harry, I think.

** As always canon leaves fanfiction authors with lots of flexibility. Harry has a vault that his parents set up for him at birth (now it's implied that it's a "trust" vault but I'm not sure that phrase is ever used in the books). Now typically IRL if a child has a trust vault it implies that there is also a "family" vault. Otherwise why isn't he just given access to the Potter vault but because of his age he is limited in how much money he can remove and what if any items he can remove. There is one story I read where the Potter vault was converted into a "trust" vault upon his parent's death due to his age.

If there are Potter vaults as well as a trust vault the one thing we don't know is if the trust was started with a one time deposit or if it is periodically replenished.

All we know from the 1st book is vault 687 is Harry Potter's vault. That phrasing could be used to justify that this vault is Harry's vault and there is a Potter family vault. Or it could justify that this vault is the Potter family vault and since harry is the last Potter it's Harry Potter's vault.

And I don't think we ever see whether the vaults earn any interest eg do the goblins use the money in the vaults for investments (like real banks) or are they nothing more than very large safe deposit boxes.

*** I think I was thinking that Harry's vault kinda keeps getting gold from profiting off of the Sleekeazy's Hair Potion. (But, obviously, that's not really canon, that's just my idea.)

** The explanation for me is that, as much as purebloods don't want to admit, the magical world is so small, that it is a way poorer than the Muggle one. Bill Gates and Warren Buffets of the magical world are no way as rich as those.

Potters have just the house in Godric's Hollow ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Potter_cottage?file=Harry_potter_23_470x350.jpg]] perhaps it goes a little bit more to the back, so it is slightly larger than it looks here; The Potter Manor *is* pure fanon), and perhaps just some farm somewhere (for some reasons, I like how in [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127049][Friends by Antosha]] Dursleys end up in the one at the Channel Islands in hiding), Blacks have Grimmauld Place, some house at Côte d'Azur, some investments in some companies, and that's it. They are rich in terms of not having to work for the rest of their life, but there wouldn't be much remaining then, and they are certainly not owners of the universe, and they usually do work (or at least actively manage their investments).

It follows my persuasion that the spirit of HP canon is mostly bourgeoisie, middle-class world of shoppers, officials, entrepreneurs, there is really no nobility and landed aristocracy, however Malfoys try to pretend to be the one.

** You can read about how JKR envisioned the family history and fortune if you google potter family and pottermore.

Tldr, they've had a bit of money since the twelfth century and always been a hard-working family. Harry's granddad invented the hair potion and with that he quadrupled the family fortune when he sold his company. Harry's dad lived on that money.

I believe Harry mentions in PoA that he would almost have to empty his vault if he were to buy a Firebolt for himself, so presumably that's the extent of the money left to him? In one book he also decides against buying a fancy moving model of all the planets and stars because he knows his money will have to last him for all seven years of school.

*** The quote is

#+begin_quote
  Price on request ... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything so much in his whole life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already?
#+end_quote

So we don't actually know the price of the Firebolt, just that Harry assumes it would cost all his money. Of course, Harry also doesn't know what his Nimbus 2000 cost because it was bought for and given to him and he doesn't appear to know, on page, exactly how much money he /has/. So he's speculating with very little information.

*** Wait, really? That would make his vault have around a thousand or so Galleons. He specifically said that he had a "small fortune" in reaction to seeing the vault the first time, and I would personally say that's at least around 100,000 dollars, or Galleons, I suppose. Also, if you check out Prisoner of Azkaban, it doesn't specifically say how much the Firebolt costs. I'm pretty much assuming that Harry over-exagerated the cost of the broom since the sign said "PRICE UPON REQUEST." It's too bad Rowling didn't have Harry ask for the price. There's also the fact that Sirius bought him the broom and didn't seem to go broke, so I'm assuming that it was at least a thousand Galleons (or around $5,000-$7,000). That would put a dent in his vault, I guess.

Plus, someone did some calculations upon the mound of Galleons in the movie, and that amounted to around 50,500 Galleons ($252,500).
