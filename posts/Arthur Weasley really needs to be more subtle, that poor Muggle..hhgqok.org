Obliviator Margaret Stanton : File 138 Henry Moore

Henry has been in therapy for years. Perpetually constipated and afraid to use the public toilets. Ever since he was five years old, And he had watched a man going into the toilet and never come out. He feared the watery Vortex would suck him in like it did that man. Dragging him to a place known as the ministry.

Additional notes: Arthur Weasley Really needs to work on his subtlety. I have had to Obliviate the muggle Henry Moore 926 times. I'm starting to worry about the poor muggle's health. I'll have to consult Saint Mungo's if I have to obliviate him again.


** Repost from a few months ago, and I'll say what I said then:

Whoever is involved with this shit needs to go to azkaban. If obliviation causes permanent brain damage in your AU when applied repeadedly, then don't apply it repeadedly. Makes no sense for a cheap gotcha moment that reads like bashing.

What do you even want with this post? Is it a prompt? A request? We have flairs for a reason, you know.

*** Based on the guy running the campground for the QWC, it does look like there are at least short-term side effects to sufficiently many Obliviations in succession, besides which a backfiring Obliviation has been shown to produce permanent damage, at which point it is not unreasonable to extrapolate that sufficiently many Obliviations could lead to permanent deleterious side effects.
