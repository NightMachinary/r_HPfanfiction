There are a lot of fics where Harry is raised by Sirius, Remus, Lucius Malfoy, Snape, Voldemort, the Weasleys, a long lost magical relative, a distant Potter cousin, Dorea Black returning from the brink of death or any other Death Eater. But are there any fics where Harry is simply raised by his maternal grandparents?

  Being raised only by his Aunt, Harry comes to Hogwarts not only knowing about the Wizarding World, but with a kind of training no one at the school is expecting. Chapter 30 up

***** That's really nice to hear, there aren't a lot of fics that care more about plot than romance.

*** I found it enjoyable but not really relatable. Harry seems way too smart for his age and I doubt that ten-year-olds are coached in Rugby by former national players.

But not what I am looking for.

  Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.
