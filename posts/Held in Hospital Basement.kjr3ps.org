I am trying to find a story where Severus tracks down Harry to an out of the way room basement in a hospital. I believe it was a psychiatric one. Harry had been first at a normal hospital after the Dursley's were killed or arrested and his severe abuse was discovered, yet when he kept trying to clean and exhibited other odd behavior, he was transfered. Soon after that point, Severus finds out it says Harry was transfered again or his records disappeared yet when tracking his Magical signature, he finds it leading to the basement room. He finds a teen Harry in very poor health hooked up to an IV and there is records/evidence the a doctor was trying to get the magic from Harry's blood into others. Severus rescues him and takes care of him. That beginning is all I can remember so any help finding this story would be helpful! Thanks!
