*** Whats a little death among friends is written by /kathryn518/, though. So I'd expect really long winded chapters. Not bad chapters, but she generally writes really slow paced stuff.

edit: lol. Her beta especially challenged her to make this one faster paced, at least in the relationship department. He...

** I too enjoyed Keira's Soulmate Bond at first, but by the end of the story it was just starting to grate. Of course, the biggest strength of stories like that are also its biggest weakness: At no point in the story was there any serious conflict, any moment when you genuinely though something might happen or someone might actually die. And the Weasley bashing was- somewhat- tolerable, but it just went on and on and became more and more repetitive...

It was just so disappointing at the end.

Anyway, I think you might enjoy [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]...if you can get past how it's an AU with no magic.
