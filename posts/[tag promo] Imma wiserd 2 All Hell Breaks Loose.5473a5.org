Have you ever wanted a sequel to the horrible trollfic Imma wiserd? If you don't too bad!if you do that's...kinda weird... Nonetheless, this is an experiment and fun activity for me to see what I can do with a story so bad that it almost surpasses /MY IMMORTAL/! So I made this, so far it's only a prologue but it will get updates VEEERY frequently (sometimes even multiple times a day)

Also this story has bad grammar and spelling, like the original, so if you can't handle that then please don't read it. Also it contains MANY offensive words and stereotypes. I do not subscribe to any of them nor do I dislike any groups present in the story. It's simply me using them the way the original story used them.
