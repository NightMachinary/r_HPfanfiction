We know that snakes are usually attributed to the Dark Arts and parselmouths to dark wizards. I read plenty of fics that say that being a parselmouth has nothing to do with dark magic and that snakes are just innocent animals with a bad reputation. I, on the other hand, think that snakes have a deeper connection to dark magic than most realise.

This idea came to me when I realised that in the books, every time a snake is vanished it turns into smoke. (At least every time I could think of)

The duelling club:

#+begin_quote
  Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore vs Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass.
#+end_quote

McGonagall vs Snape:

#+begin_quote
  Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers.
#+end_quote

Perhaps I'm looking too much into it, but, /Why/? Why do snakes not simply disappear, but instead turn into smoke? Do other animals do this? because if they do, I don't remember.

This little tid bit with the smoke made me recall what other things we know of snakes.

We know the basilisk is affiliated with dark magic of course. We know that in GOF Voldemort talks about a "potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided", when reffering to the potion that gave him the rudimentary body (I think). I don't know how reliable this is, but the wiki describes Herpo the Foul's features as "distinctly snakelike". Combined with Voldemort's snakelike appearance can we assume that horcrux-making (definitely a dark art) gives the subject a snakelike look?

Also, there is this quote from Rita's article in GOF:

#+begin_quote
  "Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers."
#+end_quote

This was said by some Dark Force Defence League member (could be made up by Rita, though). Then you think at all those other times in canon where snakes or parseltongue were associated with dark magic.

Could it be that this snakes=bad correlation is not simply some paranoiac "in the past parselmouths blah blah blah" bullshit, but instead is something more concrete?

Is it possible that snakes /themselves/ are directly connnected to dark magic. What if the reason parselmouths are often thought of as dark wizards is that they actually /do/ have a deeper affiliation with dark magic? After all, we see Harry cast the imperius, cruciatus and sectumsempra.

Let me know what you think. Tell me if you think I'm completely bonkers or I actually have a point.


** First off, it's highly debatable whether "Dark magic" as an actual, physical concept is canon. Many would argue that a lot of what is classified as "Dark magic" is not /essentially/ different from the cutting charm you use to cook. Not the "Dark Magic can be used for good, it's the wizard that wields it" argument, not exactly --- more the argument that while there's no peaceful use for a guillotine, it's made with the same wood and metal as a wheelbarrow, not of some shadowy "inherently evil" substance.

Now next off, your three examples are not of /real/ snakes vanishing in smoke, but Conjured snakes --- magical constructs that were never alive. That they vanish so is likely because the spells in question are Dark magic themselves, not because of snakes' inherent nature but because they were invented by Dark Wizards. (The only gray area is the first one, the /Serpensortia/ one, as some interpret the spell as summoning a nearby snake rather than conjuring one, but then there's the possibility that Snape's spell actually teleported away again rather than destroying it.)

Now that we've cleared up canon on this point... on to my headcanon. My belief is that snakes are, in fact, quite sentient, much like goblins or veela. This is because they are naturally born with a magical ability that, instead of allowing them to work spells, increases their brain functions. However, because their biology was totally unprepared for this, snakes still have a lonely, family-less lifestyle that is not conductive to them forming a civlization (or developping a clear moral sense; it is not impossible, but it is rare). (The whole "snakes are dumb animals" belief of the Muggles is part of the Statute of Secrecy; because of the dark magic connection --- see next paragraph --- no wizards had ties to them anyway, but they realized that muggle scientists would start asking questions if the creatures' IQ was wildly off the map compared to their apparent brain capacity).

An entire race of opportunistic, sneaky assassins only you can understand was every Dark Wizard's dream, so early baduns like Herpo the Foul developped the Parselmouth curse to allow them and their offspring to naturally understand, and influence, their new minions. Since they had unlimited supplies of obedient snakes on hand, they also developped all sorts of Dark rituals involving them --- they were the perfect guinea pigs, expendable (as their brethren would not betray you over their loss) but also able to report about the experiment if it did not kill them.

Now keep in mind, all of this is merely speculation. Others have theorized that /speaking Parseltongue/ automatically grants the target heightened intelligence, and the idea has its merits (it is best showcased in linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone)), but I simply find the idea of naturally sapient but stone-age-level serpents much more interesting.

Snape's Ever-Cutting Curse is more related to Healing that anything else, relying on the same basic knowledge but used for the malicious intent of /preventing/ healing rather than the other way around. Voldemort's rebirth ritual was some sort of freak Potions/Transfiguration/Healing hybrid (I'm not exactly sure). And so on.

***** I think we have a completely different view of HP magic. We see in canon that magic can be applied to pretty much anything. Words, job positions, places and concepts and traits (the Sword of Gryffindor - bravery). This means that even different pieces of magic used towards immoral use can belong to another branch. Because they follow the concept of "ill use".

This is what Voldemort says in regards to the potion:

#+begin_quote
  "it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight"
#+end_quote

Yes, it is a potion, but it is also dark magic.

Also, remember this back and forth in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Certainly," said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. "I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed -"

  "Of some kinds of magic," Dumbledore corrected him quietly. "Of some. Of others, you remain... forgive me... woefully ignorant."

  For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.

  "The old argument," he said softly. "But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore."
#+end_quote

Voldemort and Dumbledore talk about the Dark Arts as an entire branch of magic here.

****** I suppose we are not talking about the same thing when we say "branch". I was talking about the /theory/ behind the magic --- how it /works/. Under this definition, in my headcanon, Dark Magic simply isn't a thing; there's no "scientific" [I'd say Arithmantic, but I'd mean White Squirrel-style Arithmancy, not the divination method Rowling later said it was] trait that defines magic as Dark. Meanwhile, the magical phenomenons at work behind Transfiguration, Charms, Divination and Potions are /objectively/ different, and so they are Branches under this system.

However, there is a less rigorous classification of magic in place, a more practical one for (if you'll forgive the phrase) "everyday use". This one classifies magic not by its nature but by its effects, thought of in human terms. To go back to my "objects" metaphor, this is the same way one can speak of "weapons" as a general category of objects even though, to a scientist's eye, there's nothing objectively in common between the constitution of a hand-grenade and a longbow. A physicist would point and laugh at someone classifying the elements this way, but two master craftsmen would discuss the concept of weapons as a very real thing.

******** Well if we're going abstract, my idea is that Dark magic can be any branch of magic, but must be designed and created with cruelty in mind. The bloodboiling curse is a cruel mockery of a spell that was invented to combat hypothermia. The Entrails Expelling Curse is, according to the wiki, originally supposed to expel blockages from your intestines. But with cruelty in mind, it now expels the intestines themselves.

The one subject Dark magic has in common is Pain, Suffering, and Cruelty. That's what makes it Dark. That's why Voldemort is capable of pushing the boundaries of Dark Magic; He's a sadistic psychopath, and it comes naturally to him.

*** Ah, the eternal conundrum of the definition of Dark magic. Let's not get into that today, we'll be here for hours.

For a while I've held the idea that regular snakes are just animals that are capable of following very basic orders. Think of a dog that you didn't have to train. It can fetch, bite, heel, etc. Magical snakes are the ones with higher intelligence and actual personality.

My only problem with your idea is that snakes are far, far too numerous as pets for someone to miss witnessing their intelligence if they were all capable of such.

That one wasn't a magical snake and yet it clearly had 'higher intelligence', since it understood what its 'Born in Captivity' plaque meant and could form the abstract desire to travel to this place he'd never been on the faith that he was /supposed/ to live there.)

Something I may have made clearer is that because they have no society or even basic child-rearing for the most part, non-magical snakes are often quite stupid. Not unintelligent like an animal, but... stupid. Like feral children, pretty much. Pet snakes are probably in this scenario --- a mix of that and "The humans would freak out and probably stop feeding me if I proved myself clever enough to be a threat to them, better to lay low", /Toy Story/-style masquerade.

I do like the idea of feralesque snakes, as it would make sense that most of them would be quite content with just being snakes, even if they were capable of more. Look at human beings: A lot of us are happy to sit on our asses and pig out. Snakes are probably even more susceptible due to not being able to do anything even if they were inclined to. So the majority is happy to do snake things, but some 5% has the drive to learn and grow their intelligence.

In Greek mythology, the Rod of Asclepius (Greek: Ράβδος του Ασκληπιού Rávdos tou Asklipioú; Unicode symbol: ⚕), also known as the Staff of Asclepius (sometimes also spelled Asklepios or Aesculapius) and as the asklepian, is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicine. The symbol has continued to be used in modern times, where it is associated with medicine and health care, yet frequently confused with the staff of the god Hermes, the caduceus. Theories have been proposed about the Greek origin of the symbol and its implications.

Do you just hiss, and then if the parselmouth doesn't understand, you... what? Make the /s/ longer or something and suddenly from the parselmouth's pov it goes from stupid hissing to english sounding?

If I had to guess (or, case in point, have such a scene in my fanfic), the result would be incorrect /English/: let's say the pseudoparselmouth is tryint to say SsssSs ("Hello there") but ends up saying SsSssS, which is gibberish but sounds more like the word for "Sugar plum" ("SsSsSS") than it does "Hello there" (SsssSs), the exchange would go something like:

*Person:* SsSssS

** Someone else made a thread on the subject of the basilisk and made a good point that the breeding of a basilisk was an inherently Dark process; You had to bespell a toad, likely with the Imperius curse, to sit on a chicken egg until it hatched. Doubtless there was more to it than that, because how you go from chicken to snake due to a fucking squatter toad is beyond even me. But that led me to a headcanon that I liked.

Parseltongue is a Dark ability not because you can control snakes, but because you can control the King of snakes. The Basilisk is a murder machine, plain and simple. Nothing with the ability to kill things with its eyesight is anything less than an apex predator. Fear of Parselmouths is much more understandable when said Parselmouths have their metaphorical finger on the trigger of a very lethal weapon, and you don't know when or on who they'll use it. It's basic fear of the unknown.

As for the rest of the species, it's likely that their dark roots are due purely to their animal nature. Snakes are cold blooded carnivores, and because of this are likely used in very dark rituals. Their classification as reptiles might drastically change how a ritual works and contribute to its dark nature. Hell, I'm sure using a crocodile would be even better, but no wizard wants to go hunting crocodiles, magical or otherwise. They're not crazy-ass muggles, after all.

*** You have now gotten me thinking about magical crocodiles. Surely there must be some. So anyway... I love this headcanon you have here. After all, the fellow behind the Basilisk Ritual was a Parselmouth himself. Maybe it /can/ only be performed by someone who speaks Parseltongue (though admittedly someone who did /not/ would be crazy to try if they had no means to control and/or educate the Basilisk afterwards).

**** If we're going by the wiki, hatching a basilisk is a stupidly easy process. You can literally take the egg out from under the toad and hide it when company comes over, with no harmful effects to the egg. So not only are they easy to hatch, they're easy to hide as well. So I find it very reasonable that people are so afraid of Parselmouths. It's like knowing someone has a Conceal and Carry license, but never knowing if they're actually armed. And since basilisks are usually bred by dark wizards, you know the guy carrying is mentally unstable too.

Yeah, I'm not surprised at all that Harry was shunned in second year. More surprised he didn't get lynched.
