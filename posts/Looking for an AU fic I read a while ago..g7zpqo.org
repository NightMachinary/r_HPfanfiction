:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction I read a while ago, however I don't remember too much about it. What I do remember is that Harry had multiple parts of his body replaced by the silver metal like Pettigrews hand. He traveled to a dimension where is parents were alive and they had a daughter in addition. If anyone knows what I'm talking about that'd be great.


** Sorry I don't recall any story along that line. The only two stories that I've read even remotely like that are

An abandoned story called Flesh and Steel by Knife Hand where the first task of the tournament goes very badly and Hermione "rebuilds" Harry.

linkffa(1209)

And a story called Harry Potter: Ironwizard by kb0 where Hermione thinks Harry will be much safer if she builds him a suit like in the comics.

*** What annoys me about the description of both fics is that it's /Hermione/ that fixes him. Surely it should be professional Healers and Medi-wizards/witches

**** Read the story Flesh and Steel. It does a good job explaining why Hermione takes the lead in "fixing" Harry.
