** Umbridge was killed by a rogue Muggleborn in a very brutal fashing in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994):

#+begin_quote
  “How did you kill her?”

  “I sneaked into her office, ambushed her while disillusioned. I used a Full Body-Bind Curse on her, then beat her to death with her own blood quill, transfigured into a golf club. Before the death blow, I obliviated her, so even if she became a ghost she'd not be able to reveal me. Then I vanished the body.”

  Hermione felt a shiver run down her spine. Extended answers under Veritaserum were very uncommon, as far as she knew. Allan must have wanted to tell this story. But he spoke of a ‘death blow', as if... “How often did you hit her before you killed her?”

  “I don't remember.”

  She winced. “What did you do to her before the death blow?”

  “I smashed her limbs, broke every bone in them, crippled her. Then I broke her hips and ribs, crushed her shoulders. I spared her spine, so she would live longer.”

*** I like the premise of Starfox5's fics, but this line ruined reading Divided and Entwined, along with the arbitrary love triangle.

"But she was a Gryffindor because she was braver than she was smart - and she was the smartest witch at Hogwarts."

But man, Starfox5 really does a great job with the ensemble. The OCs are usually interesting, everyone but Snape is treated well.

** In linkffn(The Arithmancer) Hermione uses so many self crafted spells that she ends up looking like a modern art painting. It's pretty late in the story after 800k+ words though. Bellatrix's death is even more gruesome.

**** It's been a while since I read it, not sure.

Now that I think about it, linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is much better if you want brutal deaths of baddies (elder Malfoys and a bunch of other death eaters die pretty quickly, Draco only lasts about half of the fic). Or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) if you prefer them completely ruined instead of dead.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
