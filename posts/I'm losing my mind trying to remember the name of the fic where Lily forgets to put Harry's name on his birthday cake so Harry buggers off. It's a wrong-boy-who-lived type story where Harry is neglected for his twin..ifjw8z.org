I remember that after Harry disappears, Lily spends her time sobbing over what few pictures she has of Harry and realizes she forgot to put both twin's names on the cake. Pretty sure Harry never forgives her and she has a mental breakdown in St. Mungo's near the end.


** oooh, i think i've briefly flicked through this one!! for the life of me i can't remember what it's called.... did you know what the twin's name was?

*** Seconding this! It sounds familiar.

If you can remember the name of the twin, I should be able to find it. I've read so many WBWL fic that I keep a column for WBWL, twin/sibling name, etc. in my fanfic spreadsheet.

**** Ah, just give me the whole list, I can go through them one by one. I might be mixing up two stories, the way that these plotlines are all so similar. The Hardships of Family is very close, it has the cake thing and a bit about photos, but no breakdown of Lily because of the hours she spent staring at the photos. Maybe I just mixed two stories together in my mind. Silence is Silver has the St.Mungo's thing. Could have sworn there was one story that had them both though.

***** I can't share the whole document, most of the notes are personal to keep track of things that are useful to me in categorising fic. It's not likely to be helpful to you for me to list stories that are WBWL vs searching this very subreddit for the very regularly requested WBWL recommendations.

Some of the ones you have just listed like The Hardships of Family and Silence is Silver are not ones I have read, or I read prior to the spreadsheet and I have forgotten them. Others are only on the list because they are SO BAD I need to remind myself not to start reading them again as they pop up on recommendation lists.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
