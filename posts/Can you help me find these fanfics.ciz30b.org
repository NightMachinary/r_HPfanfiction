I remember reading a few fanfics a while ago but I can't remember the titles for the life of me! If you guys can help me find them I'll be super grateful!

1. Harry can hear his mom Lily in his head. She guides him and tells him about the magical world
2. Harry is helped by Lady Magic at a young age. She stays with him (in his head) and helps him. He calls her mother
