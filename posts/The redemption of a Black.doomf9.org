Hello all. I'm looking for some redeemed!somewhatsane!BellatrixXHarry fics. Doesn't matter if there's smut or no, this is a pairing I've been curious about for years now, but haven't seen any good writing of.

â€‹

Thanks in advance, lads and lassies.


** Arguably the best example of this is linkffn(Delenda Est), though I will admit the fic meanders a bit the characterization of Bellatrix is at least interesting. Whether she is "redeemed" is somewhat up for debate given that this is explicitly a time-travel/dimension hopping fic, but there you go.

Personally, I would actually be interested in fics that pull off a believable redemption of Bellatrix that is /not/ about making her palatable as a pairing with one character or another. As an example, say she survives the BoH and is thrown in Azkaban, but ends up being humanized by...lets say visits from Delphini (which also works as a way for Delphini to see how insane her parents actually were). Or she gets agonizingly tortured as a child and it makes her reluctant to do the same to others.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
