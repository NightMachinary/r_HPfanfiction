I'd love your insights on Lily's character, as he was written in Canon. She's often seen as a saint due to being dead and a long love of Snape.

However is she as "perfect" in Canon as in the film?

What are Lily's

• likes/dislikes

• insecurities

• strengths and weaknesses

• things she values

• fears

- Was she ever mean or cruel?

- Did she know Snape liked her?

- Did she have lots of friends or just Snape and slughorn, and the marauders

Any other insights you'd like to share? Is she as perfect as the movies seem to suggest?

** Not much to go on, but we know a few things, mainly from Slughorn and Snape:

Slughorn calls her 'cheeky', which suggests a sense of humour, confidence and that she talked back to him.

She was good at potions for sure and probably charms as well. Slughorn mentions she was intuitive as a potioneer.

She was made both prefect and headgirl, which suggests good grades, natural authority and good behaviour (although if James could become headboy then well-behaved is debatable).

JKR said somewhere outside the books that she was a catch, which suggests she got plenty of attention from other people than just James and Snape. She has thick and dark red hair and the same eyes as Harry.

Sirius, when Harry states that his mother seems to have hated his father, says she didn't. According to Lupin the pair began going out in seventh year.

From what Lily says in Snape's worst memory in fifth year, she also inadvertantly makes it clear that she's very aware of James and has been watching him closely, which suggests that there is some attraction there from her side too that she's trying to quench. Or you can read it as sheer distaste, but considering they got together in the end, I think it reads like a teenager who has fallen for someone they wish they hadn't: OOTP, ch 28 "'Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can - I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it."

She's clearly couurageous. She stands up for Sape in Snape's worst memory until he calls her mudblood, and it's in front of quite a large audience. She's also quick to recover and insult him back when he calls her a mudblood. There's also a suggestion that she thinks the Marauder's practical jokes are funny but is trying to hide it: OOTP, ch 28: "Lily, whose furious expressioin had twitcged for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, 'Let him down!'"

As a child, we see Lily struggle between her need to be friends with both her sister and with Snape. Both were important to her. Petunia breaks her heart by calling her a freak when she leaves for Hogwarts, and presumably their relationship never recovers from that, in the same way that Lily's and Snape's never does after he calls her a mudblood.

Petunia is clearly jealous of her "perfect sister" and says that their parents liked having a witch in the family and were very proud of her.

Harry, when watching Snape's memories, sees that he has feelings for her, and notices that she seems oblivious to them.

Lily and Snape were best friends until the mudblood incident, after that she won't forgive him and she also states that she's been making excuses for him to her other friends for years, which means she was a very loyal friend to him.

Presumably she faced a lot of the wizarding world's equivalent to racism, but we never see her unsure of herself or like she in any way let it get to her.

** I always thought that while she was popular other muggleborn must have been a bit mistrusting of her.

She was a muggleborn that hung out with someone everybody (rightfully) thought was on his way to be a death eater, some she knew called 'every other muggleborn a mudblood' and only changed her view after she was directly target of his bigot words. Someone like that is iftn viewed as a colaberator and traitor by their own people.

She was resentful and could held a grudge. she ignored Sirius when he wanted to greet der at the Gryffindor table after her sorting, becausewhat happened on the train.

She can be selfish in the way children are. She became friends with Snape after he dropd a tree branch on Petunia, who was her sister and best friend up to that point, because Snape could finally tell her whyshe was different.

She probably was arrogant in her own ways. She thought for yeas she knew so much better what kind of person Snape was compared to all her friends.

But other than that she never knew a magical world not at war about her right to live, other than from Snape's stories before Hogwarts.

*** I prefer to think she was an Unspeakable, that she used her relationship with Slughorn to get connections in the government, and learn about all the bleak little corners of magic. I like to think that the Order of the Phoenix was ‘her' brain child, and that she used Dumbles' name to garner support. That she knew about the Crux's, and had a plan in place to see the end of Voldie way back in ‘81.

And then Dumbledore just ‘Had' to go and F it all up; for the greater good...

X---x

They weren't planning on revealing their hand for another few months yet, at the time, but they trusted the wrong person in Wormtail. But even given the trap they were in, Lily still managed to set back Voldie a decade, while acting with only minutes to spare. The Blood Ward was never intended to be a part of the plan, it was just an act of desperation, and even then it wasn't intended to last past a week. Dumbledore though it was a wonderful tool, though, and used it without fully understanding the cost. Padfoot was in on the plan, but he made one bad choice in chasing after Wormtail and Dumbledore abused the law to hide him away, and out of the way. The Dementors cost him most of his happy memories, including everything he knew of Lily's plan.

Harry ‘was' ment to go to the Dursleys via the potter Will, but the still active blood ward twisted every petty thought (such as exists in any relationship) into jealousy, and then hate; and Dumbledore would come in now and then with compulsions to ‘ignore the boy', which led to the room under the stairs.

In the end, Dumbledore intended to keep the blood ward alive long enough that harry could sacrifice himself to it, to grant it's protection to his friends; which, had it worked, would have protected a good part of Hogwarts with Harry's death. They won, either way, though there was a heck of a lot more puppetry involved in Dumbles road to the future.

**** Well Lebicorpus must been known in fifth at last as we see James use it on Snape. and is described by Luoin as a spell that was used often between students to hex each other.

We further see Snape use something that could easily be Sectumsempra on James in his worst memory. It was silent and James avioded it mostly, but it cut open his cheek

***** Based on Harry's description Snape had scribbled the instructions of the levicorpus on his book and some troubles he had using it, by that we can tell it's not a fifth year spell simply because Snape wasn't stupid. Anyway, Lupin did not said that, in fact all Lupin said was not to judge James based on his bulling, saying he was only fifteen and everyone thought he was very cool, that's it. Harry when he used it thought this was probably what death eaters liked to use on muggles, and Hermione believed it wasn't ministry approved magic. That's all we have on the levicorpus.

As for sectumsempra, it isn't the only cutting spell, and James did not avoid whatever Snape used on that memory as he wasn't looking at Snape but at Lily, so it clearly wasn't that spell but a much weaker cutting curse.

***** Cutting in since I foud the quote of Lupin's about Levicorpus. It's a bit open to interpretation, but interesting nonetheless. HBP, ch 16:

"'The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus -'

'Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,' said Lupin reminiscently. 'There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.'

'My Dad used it,' said Harry. 'I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.'

He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin's smile was a little too understanding.

'Yes,' he said, 'but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular... you know how these spells come and go...'

'But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,' Harry persisted.

'Not necessarily,' said Lupin. 'Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.'"
