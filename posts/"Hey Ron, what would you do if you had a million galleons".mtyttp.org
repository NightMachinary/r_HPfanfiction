** "Hey Ron, what would you do if you had a million galleons?" George mimed putting on sunglasses. "I'd probably blow it all on my own island somewhere sunny, someplace to put my feet up and knock back with Firewhiskey and a bevy of gorgeous half-Veela babes in bikinis."

Fleur swatted George in mock outrage, who smirked.

It was all a joke to George, but Harry shifted uncomfortably and kept silent; it was a question too close to home for him, having far more wealth than anyone else present, and nearly all of it inherited. Under the table, Ginny squeezed his hand sympathetically, and she sniped back on his behalf: "I dunno, George, buy you out probably. After all, he seems to have quite a flair for the joke shop business."

"Ronnie'd probably buy the Cannons first," said Bill.

Charlie snorted. "Complete bloody waste of Galleons, that." Ron hit him in the arm; Charlie gave him a don't-make-me-come-over-there look and shoved Ron back with one beefy, burn-scarred hand, nearly toppling him off his chair.

"Boys," said Mr Weasley mildly. "Please save the rough-housing until after dessert, thank you."

Everyone went back to the serious business of the Weasleys' weekly family dinner, which today was Mrs Weasley's roast beef with all the trimmings - new potatoes, Yorkshire pud, the Burrow's own peas and carrots - chunky pumpkin soup, Butterbeer, and a tremendous treacle sponge pudding. The conversation meandered elsewhere. Harry ate with one hand under the table holding Ginny's, who was sitting beside him; but he was sure he was being far more discreet than Ron, who was staring at Hermione with a fixed grin on his face as she exchanged Ministry gossip with Bill.

After some time, Percy said "Of course, if /I/ somehow obtained a million Galleons, I'd put it all in a low-risk investment fund with steady returns, rather than fritter it away in frivolous temporary extravagances..."

Nearly everyone else booed and hooted at this; Percy sank, grinning, under a deluge of crumpled-up napkins.

"Perce, you absolute bore!"

"It's a /game/, Percy, the whole point is to /be/ extravagant!"

Mrs Weasley came to the rescue. "Well, we Weasleys and Prewetts have never been spendthrift, and I trust all my children, all," she looked meaningfully at Harry and Hermione, beaming, "to continue to be prudent, now that you're finding your own ways after the war."

Charlie nudged Ron again. "Well, Ronnie, what of it then? Any big ideas? Open a pudding factory, perhaps?" he said pointedly, as Ron was making heavy inroads into his slice of treacle sponge.

Ron shrugged. "I 'on't 'ave an' ne'er will 'ave a million Galleonsh, 's not worth thinking about," he said thickly.

Everybody groaned and put their heads in their hands. Fleur poked George in the ribs and said, "Zis one 'as too much imagination, and Ronald, too leetle."

"I 'unno," said Ron, shrugging. "Got just about everything I want already, don't I? I'd probably keep a decent pile in Gringotts for myself, and give the rest to some poor bloke who needs it. Like St Mungo's, or house-elves, or Hogwarts maybe."

"Oh Ron, would you?" said Hermione, her eyes shining.

"Yeah, why not?" Ron shrugged disinterestedly. "Oi, George, chuck me another Butterbeer."

The rest of the night, Harry observed, it was Hermione who seemed to hang on to everything Ron said and did. And, shortly after the washing up, she announced that she and Ron were going for a walk, and disappeared somewhere with a gleam in her eye. Ron, thought Harry, might well have made the best of a million imaginary Galleons of anyone at the table.

** "What'd you do with a million galleons?" Was the question at the Weasley table, that night.

The whole family was there, the table extended to fit everyone. A huge meal, made courteousy of Molly Weasley, filled with roast beef, green beans, carrots and peas. A nice chicken-flavored broth. Different drinks, alcohol induced and not filled the table.

It was George, who had asked. Causing people to pause, and ponder the question.

"I'd buy a land, create a moat, and build my own mansion!" George said excitedly, a grin on his face.

"Waste of money!" Percy muttered, under his breath. Rolling his eyes.

"Oh yeah, what'd you do with it?" George shot back.

"Invest it, most likely. So that way the money will triple" Percy announced, causing boos and napkins to be thrown at him.

"And most boring answer goes to!" George said, making a sweeping hands gesture to Percy.

"Boys, knock it off. It'd be wonderful to invest, Percy" Molly said, smiling at her son, who smiled back gratefully.

"I don't really need anything, myself" Bill muttered, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Maybe a vacation house set in France, for when we visit Fleur's family." He said, causing Fleur to squeal and give him a quick kiss on the lips.

"How bout you, Ron? What'd do you with a million galleons?" Bill asked, taking a bit of the roast beef.

Ron frowned, a thoughtful expression on his face. Unsure of how to answer. "I... now don't get me wrong, I know the two of you did everything you could to provide for us, and I will always appreciate that." Ron started, turning to his parents, seriously.

"But... if I had a million galleons, or something close to that. I'd try and start some kind of deal with Hogwarts, for families who are low income. So that way they can get clothes that fit right, their wands and books, and anything else that they need for school, so their parents don't have to pay out of pocket."

It was silent at the table. Everyone turned to stare at Ron with surprise. Most of them thinking that Ron would have said a joke answer like buying the Cannons, or having cheerleaders to cheer him on or something.

"Oh... Ron." Hermione said, her eyes shining brightly.

"That... that would be a good investment, son." Arthur said, smiling at him proudly.

Molly sniffled, and wiped her eyes on a new napkin. "That's just a wonderful thought, Ron."

Harry smiled at his friend, but then frowned, an idea coming to his mind. He had more money than he would ever need. What if he made Ron's dream, a reality? He'd give all the credit to Ron, he'd have to think about this.

** He would probably buy a nice property and a mansion for his family. Also some better clothes so he doesn't get anymore comments about hand-me-downs. Growing up with the social pressures of no money tends to make people more practical. It would also get him that recognition he craves of being the son to get their family "out of the hole". I can't see him immediately investing in a business, though.
