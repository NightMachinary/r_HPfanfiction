Are there any good fics out there where instead of Harry, Ron, or Hermione traveling to alternate dimensions, it is some other character from an alternate timeline/dimension that does the traveling?

Something along the lines of The Plan series ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1466644]]) where it's an alternate Bellatrix that travels, and I found it quite fun. Figured I'd ask about other stories in the same vein.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

*** Stages of hope was a lot of fun. I have to read it again now. I was asking for the reverse of this though. I will give a shot to A Riddled universe though, a healer Tom Riddle sounds way out there.
