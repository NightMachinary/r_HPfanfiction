*** I beg everyone to heed the warning for playmate. Please. Don't read it. It's just pure horror and pain. Self-inflicted crucio to be perfectly honest.

** My personal list:

Applied Cultural Anthropology\\
linkffn(9238861)

Unlike a Sister\\
linkffn(6574535)

Of Quidditch Pants and Persuasion\\
linkffn(4068063)

I know you asked for 5 - 10 stories, but these three are absolute gold. The first two stories are unfortunately unfinished but there's a good amount of story there for them to be great. The last is a two-shot that is one of the best of its kind.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

  Full title: The One Where The Entire Gryffindor Common Room Lusts After Harry Wearing Quidditch Pants and Hermione is Persuasive. That's rather self-explanatory, I think. Really, it's just best to move on. Equally pointless second chapter now added.

** i have over 1000 bookmarks hm.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3962879/1/Keogh][keogh by chelleybean]], the concept is so interesting and i loved the characte and relationships development, the ocs were well written and i loved the mentor figures in this. the hints of where it would probably end up going were fantastic and i was really looking forward to it, it's probably abandoned now but i still reread it once a month and hope that one day chelleybean returns.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7880959/1/Ad-Infinitum][ad infinitum by speechwriter]], also probably abandoned but the plot is just too good, so confusing and so many twists and turns and a very unique idea. the author had a very good grasp on tom riddle's character and i really liked the characterisation there, and the oc is so intriguing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13625910/chapters/31287798][yesterday is tomorrow by writing_as_tracey]], this is probably my all time favourite time travel fic. it's a marauders era setting with hermione as lily's sister, a very common idea but the author took it to a totally different place and i absolutely adore it. my favourite thing is actually a relatively small part of the fic but it's hermione's relationship with her sister, petunia not lily. hermione starts off quite withdrawn but that changes and so their relationship does as well and the conversation they had was very touching, i really like petunia in this fic. incomplete but updates about once a month.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5309891/chapters/12259118][oath breaker by goblincatKC]] has my favourite worldbuilding in it, the way dark magic is written in this is so interesting and the lore and history and magical traditions in this is amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][applied cultural anthropology by jacobk]], this fic is the slytherin/dark hermione fic - no other compares.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1731827/chapters/3693347][war paint by provocative_envy]] short and sweet and i love the characterisation in this

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][the scientist by greysfanhp]], very interesting concept of magic and relationship development in this is tender and heartwarming.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][hermione granger's hogwarts crammer for delinquents on the run by waspabi]], i absolutely adore this fic, i normally dislike fics where harry has been kept out of the wizarding world but this fic is a masterpiece

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][crazy little things by dreiser]] i fell absolutely in love with luna's character in this she's a star

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][goldstein by laazov]], as a jew this fic really means more than i can say and i think everyone should read it.

this was really hard, i have so many categories of fic saved. like short oneshots that are emotionally wrecking and normally angst/horror/everyone dies type things, various length ship fics with little plot, various length ship fics with actual plot, au gen fics that explore different alternatives in hp universe, novel length fic with more plot than the actual books, niche fic that cater to my specific interests etc. i could pick 50 favourites for each of those categories and still have hundreds of random fic recs left, so i decided to rec the ones i reread the most and which are most satisfying to read.
