  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** Self Inserts have /author/ as the main protagonist, not the /reader/. I think OP might mean fanfiction when the MC is literally a hypothetical reader - these are popular on AO3, I think. They read a little like quests or CYOA.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

**** Eh, I personally don't much like this one. Most of what I read was just the SI going around giving magical vows to everyone he meets, convinces some moms to make a Hogwarts Mothers club (to really stick it to that old coot Albus!), and starts convincing Amelia to go after Dumbledore.

He spends more time fighting Dumbledore than he does even thinking of what to do about Voldemort.

Couple of Hiver's older fics, it is average for spacebattles. He's improved a lot now.
