The self-insert from our world is immune to all magic in Harry Potter's world. I've read only part of it.

*** Wow. I like the worldbuilding, especially the arc in magical Hawaii. Also like how knowledgeable the SI is, but can't stand his personality- which mostly consists of pop culture references. Also the story has really strong religious overtones which didn't bother me, but might put some people off. Especially how he evangelizes Harry. But, there is a well written OC in Libra, I really like her

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

*** There's also one fanfic, that's actually a comic of Lego miniatures and one of the OCs is immune to all memory manipulations. Not just Obliviate, but also Muggle-repelling charms surrounding Hogwarts and the Men In Black pens.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
