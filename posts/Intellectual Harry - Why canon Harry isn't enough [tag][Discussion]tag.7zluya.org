I've been reading fanfiction for a long time, as I'm sure many of you have as well. One thing that intrigues me about genius/intelligent Harrys out there is that they delve far more deeply into the world of magic itself.

I tried reading Blindness. I lost my taste for it when Harry and Herms decided they wanted to invent magic for the muggles and bring them out of hiding. I don't need to list the amount of bad shit the major corporations and the government will do to exploit the magical animals for their gain and leave major damages at its trail. Honestly, the fact that the magical world is being hidden from the muggles is a good thing.

I tried reading Black Luminary. This, I find, is the best one so far. Harry may be a genius, but this doesn't make him any different than any other genius' out there. He doesn't have any special powers like Blindness' Harry does, and he's still just a kid, which I could easily compare to canon Dumbledore from his Hogwarts' days. Of course, I lost any taste for it when Harry started torturing puppies. That soured it pretty much instantly.

Godling Ascending is a femHarry. She's intelligent, being blessed by Athena. Unfortunately, she's only purely academic and doesn't do much to get into the magic itself. Thus, it was purely plot driven.

I read Methods of Rationality. I lost interest. Period. This Harry was annoying as fuck and irritates the fuck out of me. Because this Harry is so special that no other genius's out there in the wizarding world didn't delve deeper into how magic itself works.

As far as I found when it comes to intelligent Harrys out there, Black Luminary was the closest one I could get to an ideal Harry that could be compared to Voldemort, Dumbledore, Flamel, etc. Too bad he tortures puppies.


** I share your like for an intellectual Harry. I dig the idea, but I'ver never seen in done in a way that I like. All the fics you named had one point where I stopped reading it. Blindness just /dragged/, I felt. I also disliked that Harry's blindness, the thing that brought me to the fic in the first place, was eventually made from a weakness of the character to an extremely powerful tool for him. Black Luminary was just... weird as fuck and I always had the feeling like the author didn't really disconnect from what he wrote there. As I said, weird. Methods of Rationality... I think I can only take a Rationalist circlejerk so long until my inner Empiricist rebels. I get that the Harry in the story wasn't really a character, but more just a carrier for a continuous argument. I did enjoy some of the conclusions, especially the timetravelling, even if I think I disagreed (I can't remember).

I think the only fic in which a Harry is truly /hunting/ for knowledge that I liked was Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194). It's a nice mentor!Dumbledore fic in which Harry excells in his tasks and under the mentorship of the headmaster.

For me a intellectual!Harry fic needs two things. Harry needs to use the magic he learns. One of the most defining traits of Harry,. I find, is that he is absolutely driven whenever he needs to know something to survive. The Patronus Charm is the perfect example of the ridiculous heights Harry can reach once he feels the need to. The second point is that Harry also needs to earn these skills. I kinda despise fics in which Harry reads a few books and gets more powerful than Voldemort in the timeframe of a summer (and */fuck/* those time-turner do-over montages "One summer is 10 years hurrrr". Bullshit). Harry needs to put in blood, sweat and tears to get to a point where he resembles Voldemort /in his seventh year/, not even mentioning reaching the skill-level of a Voldemort, Grindelwald or Dumbledore who studied, researched and trained for decades.

Eh, considering that Harry falls for the lies of the main villain because he relies entirely on his rationalist conclusion instead on empiricism, I don't believe "rationalist circlejerk" is a fair conclusion.

I thought the fic made a good point that you can come to the opposite of the correct conclusions when you rely entirely on rational logic. Harry got trapped in a web of rationalisations instead of going "Yeah, looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, swims like a duck... it's probably a duck"

*** Is he? Harry would need combat magic to survive (if he didn't have tons of "expendable" people basically jumping in front of curses for him!) but he really only knows a stunner, reducto and his signature spell "expelliarmus" and maybe a shield, but that's it! Sure he uses some unforgiveables, but that only shows that he lacks knowledge because he needs to use forbidden magic (hell, I wouldn't have a problem if he used everything else he saw like legilimency and if he truly tried at occlumency, but the sad truth is that Harry kind of is a one trick pony!)

No, Harry is a slacker who IMHO either needs an attitude change or someone who makes him see magic as what it is - MAGIC, not something boring that isn't fun to learn (I meam I am sorry, but I'd turn into a recluse if you gave me the ability to learn magic and a library of magic-books...damned, the ability to basically tell the universe to go fuck itself - "I want this to hover! Gravity be damned!" - you bet I would want to become good at it!)...

Harry sadly lacks that sense of wounder you'd expect from a mundane raised child (Hermione has it IMHO), while Harry kind of acts like a stuck up pureblood ("Magic? Yeah, seen it...now can we go play quidditch?")...he kind of makes Snape right and that pisses me off!

*** linkffn(12104185) The Life He Leads.

Very interesting take on the matter, Harry isn't a super genius, just rather drawn into the study of magic. There's a particularly good amount of Harry-Dumbledore interaction, with good amounts of magic use. Hope you enjoy it if you read it.

If you find HPMOR!Harry annoying, there's no helping it --- for whatever reason, half of the people who read it love him, and the other half hate him. However, you didn't keep reading long enough to judge that particular plot-point fairly:

Harry's investigation of how magic works is /pointless/ and is /treated/ as Harry being overconfident.

His experiments in trying to figure out the principles of magic /totally fail/, with his only true "discoveries" over the course of the story being the nature of Dementors (which he's far from the first wizard to figure out, it's just that all those who do keep it a secret) and Partial Transfiguration (for which knowledge of advanced physics was needed, so no wizard could have figured it out in the past).

Thanks. Any opinions about that stuff from people who haven't finished the fic are completely invalid anyways.

It's still strange when people keep claiming that the main character is some kind of Gary Stue though. He's being played completely by the (possible) villain very early on.

**** People who claim Harry is a Gary Stue think that Harrys opinion of himself = authors opinion of Harry. MoR Harry most certainly is an unreliable narrator.

Personally i'm kind of annoyed with many MoR dissers. Sure the story had more than a few faults, but the most often seen complaints tend to be due to wrong assumptions made by the reader, who then dropped the story.

There's a reason why it isn't my favorite fanfic: It's more than a bit elitist, the plot-line is unfocused, the pacing is poor and the protagonist is certainly annoying at times (even if it is intended, it isn't exactly pleasant). Yet I have to constantly defend it around here.

  Human Transfiguration is a sub-branch of Transfiguration and a form of transformation in which one transfigures *human body parts* or an entire human being into another form.

  Human Transfiguration is more difficult than any other form of Transfiguration, including Cross-Species Transfiguration and is therefore N.E.W.T.-level, taught only to sixth years and above at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

** I don't get what you are trying to say. I assume you want to know why people write about Intelligent Harry?

I think it has much to do with expecting explanations about the magical world. /Why have we hidden ourselves?, What is Magic? How does potions work? Can Magic be explained using Muggle */Laws*/?/

If I read a story about an Intelligent Harry, I expect Ideas that tries to explain a world of Magic, I expect solutions that I could not have thought of and I want to see how the Magic world simply does not comply with a teen that thinks he is right.

Maybe I am thinking more of a Scientist than an Intellectual. But it is not as an Intellectual Harry is presented in these stories. He is a researcher and a researcher answers questions that are yet unknown.

As to why he is /The smartest person ever!/ is simply to make it feel like Harry is the only one that matters.

If you think about it, there is probably many things in the magical world that is already explained in a book somewhere. We just never get to know about them because Harry, our point of view, doesn't care about that kind of knowledge like, for example, Hermione.
