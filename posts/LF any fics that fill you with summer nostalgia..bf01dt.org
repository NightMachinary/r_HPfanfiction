** I do know of one... It inspires nostalgia about summers for me, but, trigger warning, the whole story is centered on Ginny's self harm and it's quite old: 2002-ish, so old the author calls Ginny 'Virginia'-old..

Chapters one and two, especially. I think it helps that I have a similar family dynamic as Ginny in this fic.

  They passed through the barrier and found themselves in Kings Crossing proper, everywhere thronged by children also back for the summer holiday. Any one of the smiling adults could be Harry's relations, so Cedric kept his eyes sharp for lanky builds or unruly dark hair or bright green eyes, amid all the joyful reunions going on around them. It was hard not to be infected by the celebratory mood.Maybe a summer holiday in the peaceful, uncomplicated muggle world was exactly what Cedric needed.

** Oh! I know just what you need! Hope you don't mind Ginny and Luna being the main characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys][/Dinner With The Weasleys/]] is one of my favorites. It's not really summer nostalgia. More like the Sunday dinners you have at your grandparents after church.

Linkffn(7227719)

/Faith and Understanding/ is my favorite fanfic of all time. Luna and Ginny's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein. Sweet and soft and tender, this story has my very favorite passage of all fanfics:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2619705/1/A-Night-Without-Stars][/A Night Without Stars/]] where a few opportunities to stargaze make Luna and Ginny become best friends.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
