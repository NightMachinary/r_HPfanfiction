I've been through Core Threads by theaceoffire, any vaguely similar stories? Preferably fairly long. I've got plenty of spare time on my hands.


** linkffn(Blindness) has a blind Harry who can "see" magic. He's so OP that Voldemort is more of a nuisance for him and danger to his loved ones rather than a direct, personal threat. This story has nice world building, exploration of magic and of British magical society following Voldemort's death. Deals with different magical beings, etc.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Try stargatesg1fan and megamatt09 for authors. Both have good stories with godlike Harry and depending on if you go to fanfiction.net or hpfanficarchive.com you will get smut free or smut filled versions. Both are normally crossovers. However try mjimeyg stories. Not always godlike but always completed stories.

** You've read Core Threads and the On a Pale Horse has been linked, so I guess I'll just list some crossovers

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble (HP/Nasuverse) linkffn(9586702)]]: This fits your requirement for long, it and it's sequel break a million words. In this story Harry grows more powerful throughout the story, it's basically exponential growth. This story has a few issues imo,

- There's a light harem. Pretty much all of Harry's friends are hot girls and he surrounds himself with them.

- The story has undertones of Dumbledore bashing for the first half or so, iirc

- The author clearly forces a few cannon friendships. [[/spoiler][They fall apart eventually, it's not a big deal]]

- The author drones, he will write multiple paragraph explanations of nasuverse magic that you will probably scroll through to get back to the story. On the upside, you don't need to know Nasuverse when reading this story.

Edit: The sequel which has been on hiatus for over a year just updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10067222/1/Black-Blood-Wizard][Black Blood Wizards (HP/Soul Eater) linkffn(10067222)]]: This is a long one-shot, Harry somehow ends up with Medusa in Soul Eater pre-cannon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not family (HP/F.E.A.R.) linkffn(11589304)]]: Also technically a one-shot, just two different endings. Harry is the same thing Alma is in F.E.A.R. speaking of which Harry/Alma. You don't need to know F.E.A.R., people who know it basically just understand Alma is basically some kind of dark-god-thing (it's an FPS and it explains nothing) and won't ask questions about how she and Harry do what they do.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10596643/1/Harry-Potter-God-of-Gods][Harry Potter: God of Gods (HP/High School DxD) linkffn(10596643)]]: Harry is literally the biblical god. I feel context is probably necessary here unless you can make sense of convoluted anime plot lines without actually watching the shows, so if you regularly read anime fanfiction and crossovers like me and watch copious amounts of anime, then no knowledge needed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11035459/1/][Oblivion (HP/TES:Oblivion) linkffn(11035459)]]: Harry is Jyggalag, [[/spoiler][the original mind of Sheogorath that was so obssessed with order that his existence threatened all the other daedric princes and they made him the insane mess that is Sheogorath]], I would argue a thorough playthrough of Skyrim would give you enough knowledge to read this, I can't remember if it explained anything.

Sirius sends Harry to Tony Stark's for the summer and in a freak accident Tony Stark's brain is copied to Harry's.

*Features:*

*~* independent!Harry

*~* smart!Harry

*~* Magic incorporated into technology

*~* Harry/OC ^{(female)} but relation ship doesn't last long

*~* Slight Dumbledore and hermione bashing

*~* Mentions of Slash ^{(no intimate scenes)}

Sadly abandoned but a great fic none the less.
