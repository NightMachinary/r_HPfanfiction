  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I am writing one now where that occurs shortly after his resurrection, but it is only the one chapter in and I don't even resemble slightly a fast writer.

If you want the link anyways ask and I'll throw it in, but otherwise since it's just the 7k words I'll leave it be.

Edit: I forgot how bad that description was, been a while a since I looked at it in particular. I need to do something about that. *shrug*

  Lord Voldemort discovers the scar Horcrux, and elects to reclaim it by removing Harry Potter from time entirely. Those who meddle in time without understanding it fare poorly, and the Dark Lord Voldemort is no different. The Figure in Gray is his own creation, and yet his downfall.

Edit : Wow! Now I read it seems awesome! If you keep this up, and transform it into a long fic, it'll become legendary!
