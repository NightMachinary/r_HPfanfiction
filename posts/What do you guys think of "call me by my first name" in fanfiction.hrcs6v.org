This is a weird turn off for me in all fanfiction, and it irates me just like the classic blood lineage testing Lord Hadrian Black p whatever gryffindor slytherin.

Sometimes I will be reading a fanfiction, and Sirius might call Professor McGonagall "Minnie" or something stupid. Or when Snape grows close to Harry, he might say "call me Severus in private."

Even "Filluis" Flitwick is just plain rediculous.

Unless its time travel, and Harry is secretly older than the professor, its not acceptable for someone his age to call a professor by their first name. In canon, when Harry or you want to be disrespectful, you call them by their last name, ie. Snape, without the professor. If you have a fanfic where one of the professors grow into a parental roll, instead have them call the professor "auntie minerva," or "uncle severus" because a child that age should never be as disrespectful as to call an adult by their first name. Even when it is offered, I think you should refuse and respect your elders.

When Sirius calles McGonagall Minnie, it just makes him extremely childish and disrespectful, considering she taught him as a professor and is at least twenty years older than him.

Im not sure what you guys think but its such a turn off to see a 17 year old boy call his teacher Minerva in private. I am always "disimmersed" or whatever you call it whenever Harry says, Minerva, Severus, Filluis, Pomona, or Poppy.

As a final note, I am not really sure, is this an American thing to do? Have any of your teachers grown to you as a parental figure and let you call them by their first name before you graduated? This entire rant might be my culture speaking (asian/chinese), but the sheer disrespect, I shudder from every time the students, even past students like Sirius, refer to the teachers using their first name, because it always, always feels disrespectful and "disregarding" of their accomplishments to achieve the title "professor."

In fact I like it better when the fanfics are like "I will call you 'Snape' because you arent worthy to be a professor!" Since the last name still implies distance and unfamiliarity, but also disrespect in a different way than calling an adult by their first name.

I know its more common in collage to call the professor by their first name, but generally when they offer that, they offer it to the whole class, and also collage kids are most often adults by that time, which means older than 18. Im on my phone so excuse the typos.

Edit: I would also like to hear from anyone who is part of or familliar with British culture to see if that is totally acceptable, because all I know is that things are more relaxed in the US in these matters


** In general I agree, but I make an exception where the professor has a social/honorary family relationship with the student. In the epilogue, Ginny tells her son to give love to “Neville” and he answers that he can't because */at school/* Neville is “Professor Longbottom.” Neville doesn't stop being a dear family friend James II has known since birth in private even though he's the professor in the Herbology greenhouse.

As for former students, what about former students who become colleagues? Both Snape and Lupin were taught by most of the other professors before teaching alongside them. Does Lupin get to say “Minerva” during POA and then have to revert to “Professor McGonagall” in OotP? Does Sirius have to use “Professor“ at Order meetings while his former classmates Snape/Lupin do not? It gets pretty awkward if you have a hard and fast rule that a student can never move onto even terrain with a former professor regardless of circumstance.

*** You're right, and if they give permission, Sirius can call Minerva "Minerva," but I'd never heard of anyone referring to her as "Minnie" which was my point about somebody "older" calling colleagues by their given names, especially since Minerva is twenty years older than her former student.

** I think some of this might be cultural, but on the whole you're right about a lot of fanfics taking this to an extreme level. I'm not familiar enough with Chinese culture to speak to that directly, but I am American, so I can explain from that perspective.

In the US, it's common to refer to teachers respectfully by default (usually with a Mr./Mrs. prefix, and/or sir/ma'am/miss). "Professor" is reserved for colleges/universities. However, this can be changed by any teacher's personal preference, and it is possible for them to ask to be called by their first name. I'd say it's more common for them to do that in colleges/universities. This will of course vary a bit regionally -- I'd say in more rural areas, or in the South, you'll get lots of sirs and ma'ams regardless.

In general, in a student context, teachers who "drop the formalities" in America are rare, but highly favored. They are thought of as being relaxed, sociable, and genuinely caring for their students, as opposed to the more strict educational norms. They are teachers who (on average) are perceived as highly individualistic, confident, progressive, and have a more modern, unique classroom style.

Of course, not all "first-name teachers" are actually like this, and that doesn't mean that more formal teachers can't have these positive characteristics, I'm just talking about perception as a whole.

So basically when Americans try writing HP fanfic, and they write the professors this way, it is their way of making them the ultimate "best teacher ever", like the best form of teacher that exists, even though it's not really the common American experience either. Is it realistic? No. But it is complimentary and cathartic to frame them this way.

As Americans (and I suppose probably those in the UK too?) grow up out of childhood & studenthood, we are often encouraged to drop formalities, which is why you see Lupin calling McGonagall "Minerva", as they are now colleagues, or Snape calling Dumbledore "Albus", as they are now both adults even though Dumbledore is still greatly his senior. The latter is of course only in private, as a power dynamic still exists between them, so Snape will more often call him "Headmaster" while they are conducting school business. There is an adjustment period, but in general these kinds of formalities are relaxed as children become adults.

And so, when we see adoption/mentor fics, an insistence on using a first name by someone who used to be a teacher, but is now perceived more as a family member, is a gesture of affection. So those Snape-adopts-Harry fics where he allows Harry to use his first name are very endearing to us, because Snape is normally a very formal person, and he's essentially "opening up" in that sense.

When you talk about Sirius calling McGonagall "Minnie", that's actually a cutesy pet name, not a "first name" per se. It's considered immature to give people pet names instead of using a nickname that person provides. Depending on the context, it's perceived as Sirius either being purposely mocking or overly familiar-- In the US, pet names are usually reserved for people we are extremely close to, and even then sometimes they are flat out disliked & not used. So to be assigned a pet name against your will is considered annoying (hence Sirius could be mocking her) or the fanfic author likes all the adults to act like best friends (hence Sirius could be portrayed as overly familiar).

Ummm I think that's most of the points you touched on? Let me know if I missed anything. But yeah, my general assessment is that in America in real life, this is a disrespectful thing to do, but if a teacher allows it, then it becomes a complimentary, comforting, and "cute" thing to do. Personally, I hate pet names in both real life & fanfiction, and I like when adults/teachers who develop a familial bond with the main character are formal in a workspace setting, but are to a lesser degree or not at all formal in private.

  I think I can understand that perspective. To me it feels weird because it takes me ages to call someone by their first name. My mom introduced me to her date at the time as "Dr. O'Brien," and even though they got married and he's my step-dad; and he's white, he's asked us to call us "Will," instead of his formal title. But I still call him Dr. O'Brien sometimes, because I've gotten used to it. So switching titles isn't something I'm unfamiliar to, rather just the concept of swapping back and forth super easily, between class and "private moments."

  And it just took years for me to start calling him by his first name, and I feel a lot of fanfiction don't take the time to see this development through too. I haven't gotten a fanfic where I truely trusted that it was time to call them by their first name, you know?

**** I totally get you. I think a little bit of the reason is like... Time? Most fics aren't long enough to simulate this in real time, and even if they are... author perception is skewed. /They/ have spent over a decade in the fandom, and so they personally feel like they have progressed to that level of familiarity with the characters, even if the people in universe have not. It's an interesting phenomenon to consider.

  is this an American thing to do?

Yes and no. It's an age as well as racial/cultural divide type of thing.

We /are/ more relaxed about these things, but not with older people or teachers/professors. If honorific titles are disregarded, it's surname only. In fact I was super surprised when Harry finally called Lupin Remus.

*** I thought Harry finally dropping a “Remus” just drove home how much these things operate on a case-by-case basis. On the one hand, Harry got from “Professor Lupin” to “Remus” over the course of four years.

On the other hand, Arthur and Molly stay ”Mr. and Mrs. Weasley” for seven years, even though Harry is essentially their surrogate child.

And on the third hand, Hermione code-switched from “Mr. Black” to ”Sirius “ (without invitation) the first time she met the man, and after that none of the kids ever called him by anything but his first name.

There are a million sets of circumstances and preferences that don't necessarily reflect level of respect or closeness of relationship.

**** Case by case in that it's age related. At least for me. Like I've never given a title to my aunts, uncles, and older cousins who were pretty young when I was born. If I were Harry it would be Aunt Andromeda and Sirius.

And I think Hermione switching has a lot to do with Sirius' reaction to "Mr. Black" lmfao.

** This is such an interesting topic. I kind of had the opposite problem: I never had to address my teachers by their surname until I was in college (and even then only a couple wanted to be addressed properly), so it always felt very conservative that the teachers in Harry Potter insisted on being addressed not only by their surname, but by their title as well. On the other hand, my country has plenty of schools that insist on the title + surname thing, too. I guess we're just strange. ;)

I have also always addressed the parents of my friends by their first names, as well as my aunts and uncles (and great aunts and great uncles, etc). Only my parents and grandparents got a familial title, and I grew rather...flippant, I suppose, with the familial title with my parents in my teens. It was much easier to get their attention when we were outdoors to call for their name than that it was to call for "Mum" or "Dad". I do rarely call my sibling by our familial bond, but that's about it.

Politicians and artists (authors, singers, actors, etc) are usually either their surname or their name full out, but never with a title for me. Perhaps a title isn't that indicative or informative. I mean, if I mention Merkel, anyone in my surroundings will understand I'm talking about Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. If I say Pedro Sánchez, most of them will recognize that as the name of the Prime Minister of Spain as well.

All that said, I was writing a chapter in Snape's perspective just a week ago and I often wrote "Snape" instead of "Severus" by mistake. It's a tad odd to have a character think of themselves by their surname, but it's how I now think of him. I happen to bein some anime fandoms and it really bothers me when the honorifics are missing, especially if a certain character always uses that when calling another character's name. I guess it's just what we grow used to seeing.

** I get it. I'm Pakistani, and for me, it's crazily disrespectful to call an elder by their first name unless they insist. But in my last two years at school in the UK, we were encouraged to drop the formalities. It took time for me, and I imagine that if Harry was asked to call Prof. McGonagal "Minerva" in 6th Year, and he had been saying Professor for five years, it would be hard to adjust- he'd definitely mess up.

Regarding "Minnie", I think the whole point of the joke is that the Marauders were juvenile and liked to make fun of people this way. I can't see Harry doing it, though.

** I'm not a fan of the nickname thing. But if in the context of the story Harry grows to have a different relationship and power dynamic with his teachers, then I think it is appropriate that he uses their first names. It's symbolic that they are equals ,and a sign of respect and trust going both ways.

But I'm not fond of the use of first names if the groundwork hasn't been done to show that their dynamic has changed enough to make it appropriate.

** I agree that it's weird. I live in the States, and it was definitely hard to become accustomed to calling some of my high school teachers by their first name -- my orchestra director and choir director, for instance. They're the only ones. In fact, on the occasion I go back to visit for concerts, I still prefer using honorifics for my old teachers.

Certainly, I use honorifics for my current and former college professors, unless specifically given permission to address one by first name.

Even when addressing the parents of friends, even those I've known for a while, I prefer honorifics. I might refer to them in third person by first name, but never to their face.

Strangers are always "sir" or "ma'am".

So basically I only address friends by given name.

Then again, I'm Asian too, so that might be the only reason. I don't know.

*** Traditionally in the united states children address adults with an honorific unless given permission otherwise. Adult strangers are also to use honorifics until given permission otherwise, but this rule is often dropped among peers. Adults in authority may or may not use honorifics with the people they are over but stick to using the underlings last name. The same is not true in reverse. Its also respectful for adults to use honorifics when talking with children and their last names. Children usually refer to each other on a first name basis and can use their last name. In the past 80 years or so children calling eachother by last name is usually a nick name or other sign of affection. Before then it was more likely for children to refer to eachother by their last names until aquainted.

** I think much higher tendency to call people by their first name is definitively Americanism. British stay with their “Miss Weasley” and “Mr Potter” (not even mentioning “Professor Snape”) by far longer, and sometimes forever. Harry's tendency to ask everybody to call him by his given name (in Northumbrian stories for example) is an exceptional eccentricity and his subconscious(?) effort to suppress his celebrity status.
