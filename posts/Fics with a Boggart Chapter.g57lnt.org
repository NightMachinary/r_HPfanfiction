I love that 3rd year DADA lesson. Some fics handle the lesson better than other. It's a great place to clarify/reveal the fears and insecurities of characters and some fics do this better than others.

Chapter 47 of The Other Dursley [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6762561/47/The-Other-Dursley]]

and Chapter 9 and 10 of Felix Fortuna [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.56551/reader/]]

are examples of great soul searching boggart lessons. Please post some of your favorites.


** I make no claims as to it being particularly soul-searching, but perhaps you'd enjoy linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13170534/chapters/54122758]])

It's a one-shot set it a HPxNaruto verse, but the chapter (I think) should stand on it's own if you get the basic premise of Harry, Ron, and Hermione living dual lives, (the other being Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura respectively.)

I too am quite the sucker for boggart fics. (:

  Snippets written in The Troika universe that don't belong in the main story line and are dubiously canonical to the 'verse. Also known as the dumping ground for anything I might write relevant to this universe while the first main installment is still in development.

*** The fifth chapter right? The boggart scene itself was beautiful it really captured Hermione/Sakura's general sense of insecurity.
