*** You eat poison, you're inoculated with venom. Of course, Basilisk Venom is /also/ probably poison (I'd be surprised if you could just down a glass and live to tell the tale), but it's primarily venom, and it most definitely was in the cases of Harry and Diarymort, who both got /bitten/.

******** Poison is more widely used here, even if technically incorrect in this context. You can draw an analogy to poisoned arrows made with poison tree frog secretions, which are a contact poison. We also use poison daggers, which are often made with true poisons rather than venoms (since you'd have to milk a venomous animal otherwise).

***** “Bitten/Stung/Whatever by a venomous [insert name].”

I'm not kidding, that's how you say it. Someone really dropped the ball. And that's why it's “you've been poisoned”: it sounds about 23 times less ridiculous.

Edit: Though there always is the word “envenomated”, but it's used only by biologists who study animals that interact with venomous stuff and the word sounds no less ridiculous.

*** For the case of the Basilisk (As there's no way it could be made Airborne. That'd be horrifying) Poison would be if Harry bit the Basilisk. (People often write fics of Goblins eating Basilisk meat) whereas Venom is injected directly into a wound. so if he drank a cup of it, or sat and enjoyed some tasty Basilisk steak, it'd be Basilisk poison

*** Technically (and pedantically) speaking; venom could probably be considered a subset or type of poison.

The difference between poison and venom isn't about the chemical makeup or toxicology; as they're both considered different forms of toxins. It's strictly about the delivery method involved in its introduction to the body.

For a toxin to be classed as venom usually requires that it be introduced to the body in the form of a bite of some kind. Ex. spider bite, snake bite, etc.

Whereas poison is usually used to refer to a toxin that is introduced by ingestion or absorption of some form. Ex. rat poison being eaten, inhalation of a poisonous gas, skin absorption of a poisonous liquid, etc.

**** Bitten. Nearly killed. 'Envenomated' is the correct word, but it's very much a word for a scientific or medical context, nobody uses it in ordinary speech - when you take a victim to the hospital, you tell the doctor he was bitten by a snake, not that he was envenomated.

**** Envenomed was my first thought but it's actually used in context of (object) (has had poison added to it) (envenomed water); and is basically just an archaic synonym of poisoned.

Envenomated however, seems to specifically refer to the action of venom being injected into a creature directly by the bite or sting of a venomous creature. That is to say, if you extracted basilisk venom from a basilisk and then had the liquid and used it to kill someone, you poisoned them (albeit with venom). But if you are bitten by a basilisk, then you were envenomated.

The specifics (pedantics) of venom vs poison mostly has to do with how a toxin/poison is used by a creature. If they inject it (e.g. via bite or sting), then it's venom(ous). If they don't then it's poison(ous) (e.g. via touch or ingestion). But venom is a poisonous substance, just as poison is, the difference is purely in how the creature that makes it applies it.

****** Because not all toxins are synonymous. You can drink the venom of a lot of animals for instance, and aside from possibly some stomach sickness, unless you have cuts in your mouth or digestive tract, it won't really hurt you.

Poisons are almost always by consumption or touch. One is consumed by your actions. The other is by injection from another source. They both imply different things.

******* But, for a non-technical discussion --- i.e. when you're not diagnosing/treating someone suffering from a specific toxic substance --- "poison" also means "a substance that through its chemical action usually kills, injures, or impairs an organism." In other words, once it's in the body, when specificity is not required by context, it is appropriate to say that "the poison is killing him" even if you're referring to a venom specifically.
