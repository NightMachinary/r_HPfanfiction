Re-reading this one right now, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]]

I quite enjoy it but the one thing that bothers me is the end Voldy fight. Its all over the place and difficult to read. Was just curious what anyone thinks.

Also I always laughed when Fleur got irked by Harry unknowingly ignoring her.

*** Those words ring my Voldy bells.

I've read some fics where Voldemort says those exact words to his followers.

**** Over what period of time? Because Cadmean Victory took only 6 months, updating multiple times a week. That shit is bonkers for a fanfic.

***** Wildbow updates every tuesday and saturday, and every other week on thursday. I believe Worm took about a year (I got into it just about the last week, so I can't be sure), and As far as I know, he hasn't missed a single update on that schedule (3 years going now, I think?)

** The Harry the author writes is so OOC that it ruined the story for me. I can't believe that the catalyst for his change would result in such an extraordinary change for the more bitter. The story over-extended my sense of disbelief.

** Was ok. Difficult to read in some parts; I never finished it. If it was your first fanfiction ever it could possibly be pretty good

** So it seems to me that after all this time everyone on here has assumed it's bad.

I disagree. Are most of their criticism valid? Yes. Some of the writing is so I'm 13 and this is edgy that it's painful. Yes some of the tropes are reallyyyy bad.

But overall? I think it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It was a fun read that I really enjoyed. I actually was really eager whenever the author would push out a new chapter. Regardless of how you feel about it, you have to respect the author's commitment and never abandoning it. I think if you felt like it was worth reading and enjoyed it, then you should. It isn't for everyone. If you can stomachs the tropes and writing, then I think it's a really good read.

In the last 10-15 chapters, it becomes really evident that the author was a little tired of writing it and tried to hurry it up and end it. He or she tried a whole bunch of different writing styles that feel really jarring. So I do agree that the Voldemort fight scene is really hard to follow.

Also the Harry/Fleur romance is one of the best developed ones in the genre, regardless of some of the tropiness. You can find WAY worse romances written in 95% of other fics of all ships. It really got me to feel like they were in a genuine relationship, the small details were such nice touches.

*** Agreed.

In many ways the fic is pretty horrible; nothing ever really truly challenges Harry and Fleur, all adversities are more road bumps than obstacles, the love story is at times quite hard to believe in and all that. It's all the jazz that make a fanfic writer a fanfic writer and not a professional, blockbuster author.

Yet it is, still, a very good read. I truly enjoyed reading it, although I admit to skipping a lot of the wordier parts simply because there is too much text in there and too much stuff that I find both unnecessary and hard to stomach. The broad outline of the story still shines quite bright, in my opinion.

*** Yeah, I find it strange that people are hating it for being tropey or cliche when thats pretty much 90% of the Potter fics out there.

At the very least it made me believe that these 2 were teens in a romance.

** Starts good, drags through filler chapters in the middle, picks up a bit and then ends catastrophically with 2 final chapters that basically said the author was fed up. 6/10

** It was ridiculously bad. Every chapter just heaped more shitty cliches on top of each other and the entire story was pretty much completely horrible. It was a real struggle just to get through the dozen or so chapters I read.

** It's one of the best fics I've ever had the pleasure of reading...up until just after the Yule Ball. After the ball, the story goes to shit. I've read it twice and I stopped on same chapter.

** I find it interesting that a lot of the criticism I see for the story is that it was cliche and trope filled, which is strange because it felt like it did that less than 90% of the rest of the Potter fiction out there which is filled with all the same cliches every story.

Oh well, still enjoyed it. Nothing will ever be worse than My Immortal
