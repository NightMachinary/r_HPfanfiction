** One of my favorites is Whiskey Time Travel by Private Jenkins

It's an overpowered, alcoholic Unspeakable Harry that goes back to the Marauder era. I haven't read it in a while, but I remember it being decent, a nice way to waste a few hours. I know I've spent longer times on shittier stories, so I suggest it.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) features a dimension-crossing Harry that is NOT having helping out the Order with the Voldemort problem. So much so that I thought he was being unreasonable at times, but still very entertaining.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
