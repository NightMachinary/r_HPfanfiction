The Patronus can travel anywhere because it is used for sending messages. The Patronus must be coporeal and solid, so that you can grab onto it. The Patronus can take you anywhere, too. You can make it as hard to perform as you want.

Edit: You can just give it to just one character or someone figuring out because in canon the Patronus is not solid. It works kinda like a portkey where grap onto it or you can ride on the Patronus depending on animal


** Be careful. This "Transport me to this person" can cause a few plot holes.

** I mean... depends on the patronus, really. If you wanna try saddle a squirrel, be my guest. The suspension on that thing'll make for a real bumpy ride. :D

** I can see Harry riding his mostly solid patronus, then going by a tree. "Uh, Prongs, tree! TREE!"

Thump!

Harry once again wakes up in the infirmary.

** Addendum: It should also include the line, "Don't patronize me!"
