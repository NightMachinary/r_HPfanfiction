She is very fashionable and quite libertine, but also rude. She also doesn't shave, including her moustache. She only eats croissants and baguettes and when she laughs it sounds like "hon hon hon".

***** Of course she also constantly addresses the students at Hogwarts as 'rosbifs' and whenever she is excited or surprised, she yells 'Sacre blue'.

** I really don't understand the "french don't shave" stereotype. Like really? And I've lived in France for about 3 years now, I can say that I'm yet to meet a french lady with a moustache.

*** I believe it was an older thing and then the American media perpetuated the stereotype to the point that many of us think that that's the actual case (I don't).

*** I'm pretty sure it's just because women in France (and most of the rest of the world, probably) started shaving body hair later than Americans did. So there probably was a time a few decades ago when most American women were shaving (and American pop culture was pushing that idea), but most French women hadn't started shaving yet. And the stereotype just never disappeared after it became untrue.
