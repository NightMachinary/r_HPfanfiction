I am tired of Order of the phoenix being depicted as pasive and incompetent so any Fics where Dumbledore and Order of the phoenix are active fighters that go for the kill every single time and active befire the events of book five?

Please no Slash or Snape/Hermione

  "I'm still alive, as you may surmise from this note. Of course, I could be dead and someone is faking the letter to fool you..." Harry is NOT happy about being left at Privet Drive all summer with no one to talk to.

** ok so I'm pretty sure I have seen it, but my brain isn't working, so I can't remember where. sorry! but there are a few fics where I'm pretty sure there is an order that works well.

If I remember correctly the order is pretty good in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia-from-the-ashes]])

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

** I haven't read this in a long time, but IIRC, linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin4) and its two sequels (and prequel) have a pretty capable Order.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

***** I've seen it with Dark Harrys that have sided with Voldemort. None of those have really been stories I would recommend, but they're out there. Essentially, if the Order is on Harry's side, they're incompetent (otherwise they would solve Harry's problems). If they're antagonists, then they can be competent (otherwise Harry wouldn't have anything to fight against).

*** The problem with the Order is that it's guerilla warfare done completely at the enemies whims. The Order just defends, and badly at that. They aren't huge in number and still manage to get injured. Take the battle to get the prophecy, they had: Kingsley, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore (who was fashionably late as usual), Moody, and maybe a couple others like Hestia Jones and Diggle. So they had around 10 people, along with the 6 kids (at least 3 of them were still fighting at that point). I don't know how many deatheaters there were but we can presume around 10 as well. The deatheaters did not die. Sure a few went to prison but that didn't last long. The order completely lost Sirius (who despite being a fugitive who spent half his life in prison was still a formidable fighter and could've been used later) and Tonks was injured as was Hermione and Ron, Neville broke his nose, Luna broke her ankle I think. The point is, the order was never proactive. They only ever reacted to the fights The Death Eaters started. How many people died in book 6 at the random muggle attacks like that one bridge and Amelia Bones and stuff? Where was the Order during those fights? Despite having a spy they weren't good at preventing anything.

A bunch of kids had a better system in place to communicate with those galleons, the order only had patrons messages which are no subtle in any way. They needed help.

They were losing the first war too, that's why Harry was such a big celebrity. He literally fixed the world for them.

This is why it's hard to find fanfic portraying them in a good light, compared to the kids they weren't very good at their jobs even in canon.

I'm rambling and it's not my most coherent post and I know u didn't ask for this...I don't know why I typed this all out. I don't really have a point.

**** The order were far to inactive, even when Harry supplied them with the names of 10+ death eaters, they sat on their ass instead of silently removing Riddles support before he got a chance to fix his power base during ootp.

Imagine if they had taken the majority of the pepole in the graveyard before the battle in the ministry, their position would be far superior to that during the first war and definetly in the original timeline
