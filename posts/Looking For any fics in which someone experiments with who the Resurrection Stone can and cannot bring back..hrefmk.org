  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I can't remember the title, but I've read one in which the Stone was used to determine if they'd dealt with all the horcruxes - if Riddle's shade couldn't be summoned, there was at least one more horcrux left to deal with.
