Can I have some fic recs on The trio being teenagers? I mean like actually doing stupid things and going out on the weekends and stuff. Like I'd like to see something where they just be teens. I don't mind if it has like angst in it or other darker themes.


** linkao3(I Won't Just Survive(No you will see me thrive)) has this. There are changes to the Golden trio though - Harry's in Slytherin and Hermione's in Ravenclaw

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

** linkffn(1628334) and linkffn(1553629)

They are written pre-HBP as the equivalents of years 6 and 7. Harry is a bit of an angsty bitch but he is mourning Sirius and he is dealing with the prophecy. However it deals with a lot of teenager shenanigans. For example at one point the DA members get so fed up with the sexual tension between Ron and Hermione that they lock them in a broom closet to sort their feelings. And Harry messes around with the minds of a few girls (no sex and he is not some suave lothario though) and then they mess with him. Also some drinking and partying.

However note that they are - much in the spirit of the early 2000s - poorly edited and may contain some spelling/grammar mistakes... but the author gets better eventually.

  Warning OotP Spoilers. Harry starts his sixth year at Hogwarts, but he's in for some surprises. He's going to learn the true story of his parents and learn to deal with loss. There might be a little romance and adventure. Related to my JL fic. Complete!
