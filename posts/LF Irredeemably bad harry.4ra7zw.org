A problem I have with many dark!harry pics is the way the author tries to justify his actions. I want to read something which clearly shows harry to be the villain? Preferably no slash and no abandoned fics

Warning: it isn't complete yet, so I have no idea if the author will try and decide to do a full on redemption thing for Harry or not. But it's a horror fic. Harry is super deranged.

*** Spoilerish: I don't think that a full on redemption is gonna happen because their was already a thing that happened where Harry could've chosen sanity

**** I often immerse myself in dark Harry fanfics and I can safely say that I have seen things like what have happened in Worthy of Magic and in the end, Harry has, sadly, redeemed himself. I've only read a select few where he remains dark until the very end without being like, "Oh, lol, just kidding guys, I love the light!"

I'm not sure if you want individual fics or not, but linking you to what I did should give you a wider range. :) If you want some recommended fics, I can link you to some good ones I have read.

**** I agree with you--like I said, the story is still incomplete so it IS technically still possible for a second, COMPLETE redemption thing, but it seems highly highly highly unlikely.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
