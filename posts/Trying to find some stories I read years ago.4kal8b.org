***** Nah, that's not it. The one I'm thinking about isn't a series of one-shots and after initially killing the Dursleys he overhears Dumbledoor and/or McGonagall talking about how tragic it must be for Harry since they think it was an accident. Plus a few scenes with Harry being mesmerized by a match/candle/lighter flame.

******* Yea I checked all of them. Didn't find it. It was less of a 'Harry is an elemental' fic like a lot of the ones linked and more of a 'Harry is a pyromaniac with legitimate un-romanticized issues' fic.

******** you know, there's a Harry Potter/Looking for Group fic you might like. He sends a letter to Richard about teaching DADA as a joke only to find out Richard is real and ends up being Richard's minder from then on.

  It was supposed to be a joke letter, but it ended up so much more. Who would have guessed that the 'poster child' of the Light side was a closet Pyromaniac with a distinct inability to care about the trauma he causes? Now there's a warlock teaching DADA, there's Death Eaters on fire, and the mediwitch is hexing everyone! Who knew being a minder for Richard could be so fun? CRACK
