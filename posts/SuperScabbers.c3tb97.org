We've all seen fics where Harry gets super powerful and Hedwig becomes king of owls, or something like that. So my thought process got a bit off and I came up with this:

Prompt: Ron obtains his hidden heritage and 34 thousand titles and millions of galleons, and Pettigrew becomes god of the rats through their unexpected familiar bond.


** I... I actually have no clue how Pettigrew would react to this situation. “OP!Pettigrew” just... doesn't compute. It goes against the laws of the universe. Any and every thing that we know about the character is defined through his behavior when he's cowering before stronger individuals and forces. If he were thrust in a situation where he genuinely doesn't have to be afraid of anyone ever again, I think the /Harry Potter/ universe might just explode.

...Also, what with familiar-bonds usually including some form of telepathy, I now have this plot-bunny in mind of Pettigrew's cover being blown early because Ron learns about a cool familiar-bond-creating ritual and performs it on Scabbers, suddenly granting him a window into Pettigrew's mind and all his memories. (Obviously Ron thinks about reporting him to the authorities, but Pettigrew persuades him that if he does, then the Ministry will ship him to Azkaban, or even get him Kissed... which might be /very very very/ unpleasant for Ron if he's bonded to him. ...See, this writes itself. Ah, if I had more time.)

*** There's a SI Pettigrew fic where he become OP, but in Hogwarts. That's but he's nothing like his canon characterization for obvious reasons- it's the only one I can think of that explores that idea. Linkffn(12026429)

As for your idea, it reminds me of this bizarre and kind of horrific romance fic where Ron and Peter are pen pals during Goblet of Fire. It's well written and devastating but I'm not going to link in because it somehow becomes an explicit slash fic halfway through

  One day, Christopher died and woke up as everyone's favorite character-Peter Pettigrew. "Don't suppose there's a return policy on this kind of thing? 'Cause...I think I want a refund." With Christopher as Peter, how much will change? Semi-SI(Self Insert)/OC. Marauders-Era. undecided pairing, slash, m/m, m/f, bi, multi-shippings

*** I was thinking a crackfic, but now I'm just imagining a serious story of a Pettigrew who is, by proxy, one of the greatest wizards alive.
