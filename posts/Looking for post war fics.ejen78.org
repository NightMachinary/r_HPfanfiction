Specifically fics that feature Harry going off the deep end after the events of DH, like dead things or even Sum of their Parts. Cheers in advance.


** the stories mentioned in OP:

--------------

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][Dead Things]]

  #+begin_quote
    oneshot (so no easy way to describe it without spoilers, tho I don't think this one is 'spoilable')
  #+end_quote

  story spoiler:Harry became Master of Death, Hermione tries to change things but nothing changes... Harry decides to become a Dark Lord

  #+begin_quote
    Nothing really changes after the war, Purebloods get away with it and are gaining back their power/wealth through investments etc... Harry decides to become a Dark Lord to force change, with Hermione & Ron as security through Unbreakable Vow.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Linkffn(I see the Moon), crossover.

This one is bitter-sweet. The confrontation with Tom and the destruction of the soul piece damage his mind, and it's Luna who helps him come to terms with it. however, he loses his memory and runs away, and it's unclear what happened to her, but the implication isn't good. He eventually runs into one Bruce Banner on the run from the american government, set before the first Avengers movie.

  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."
