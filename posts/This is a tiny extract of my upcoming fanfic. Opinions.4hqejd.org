** Did you mean excerpt?

- Names of magical spells are capitalised, so make it 'Killing Curse.'
- Red-haired is hyphenated. It's also overused in this instance. It's obvious that you're talking about the Weasley twins. What advantage do you gain by referring to them coyly as the 'red-haired boy/boys/twins' instead of by their names?

#+begin_quote
  I was hoping that, without context, you could tell me some of your opinions on the extract, whether they be about the characters or my writing style or anything else:
#+end_quote

It's 228 words long. What do you expect us to be able to tell you?

Sorry I can't be more helpful, but I need a lot more to go on than what you've posted here.

*** I've fixed the Killing Curse error on the ff.net version, so thanks for pointing that out otherwise I probably would have missed it. I knew I messed up somewhere in the description of the twins, but I didn't know where and it's a relief to know what the issue was. The idea behind having them referred to as the twins, or the red-haired boy, is to create a degree of seperation, as if you don't think of them as Fred and George you tend not to think of them as they are usually portrayed (identical in every way). I plan to have them stand out individually in this fic as well as keeping them together as a strong duo. Everything you've said has been really helpful, thanks for taking the time to do this for me :D

** u/Doomchicken7:
#+begin_quote
  Magic can be a dangerous thing... The other two unforgivables weren't much better
#+end_quote

The tense changes from present to past in this line.

#+begin_quote
  I guess that's why... Makes sense, I guess.
#+end_quote

You should try to avoid using "I guess" two times in a row.

--------------

Just some quick advice, sorry if it's being harsh, but you really want your opening to be strong to draw readers in. Hope your fic goes well!

*** Thanks, I feel so dumb honestly. I went over the start thoroughly and that present to past error slipped my mind. The thoughts are meant to be in present tense, while the rest is past so I needed to fix that. Thanks :D

** u/hchan1:
#+begin_quote
  The red haired boy currently contemplating the morality of the unforgivables, which he'd only heard about when his dad had come home one day flustered, talking about old memories of the war, was currently sat next to another red haired boy, who looked just like him.
#+end_quote

This sentence is a complete mess. I got lost halfway through.

** Red-haired boy starts to sound tiresome very quickly. It's necessary for the first two, but after that you should just leave it as "boy" or "twin", once you've established who they are.

Break up the sentences more, cut out filler you don't need.

#+begin_quote
  Magic can be a dangerous thing /for a number of reasons/.
#+end_quote

Why do you need that next bit? You don't go on to categorically list, and it sounds awkward, so just cut it there.

#+begin_quote
  For example, the killing curse does, well, exactly what it says on the tin, and the other two unforgivables weren't much better, either.
#+end_quote

I would cut a ton of this. I don't think it's giving across what you want - he's not contemplating morality here. He's just saying the killing curse kills. I would expect something more broad, saying [magic can take away life so easily, a flick of the wand and the soul is stripped from the body, etc.]

(These thoughts also seem really weird in their current form, to be coming from people who've been raised in the wizarding world. Sounds like something a muggleborn/Harry could realistically think, but is just too obvious for those raised in it.)

** I won't repeat what others have said, although I agree with the other users' opinions.

#+begin_quote
  Magic can be a dangerous thing for a number of reasons
#+end_quote

I would suggest changing "can be" to "is". Pretty much anything can be dangerous, but magic being inherently dangerous fits better IMHO.

#+begin_quote
  The red haired boy currently contemplating the morality of the unforgivables
#+end_quote

As others have suggested, split this sentence into two, it's a tad long and confusing. Add more detail. How is he contemplating their morality? Is he considering that they might not be as immoral as they first seem? Or of situations in which it might be acceptable to use them?

Also, I believe "unforgivables" should be capitalised as well.

#+begin_quote
  which he'd only heard about when his dad had come home one day flustered, talking about old memories of the war
#+end_quote

I still want more detail. Why was his father flustered? Had something happened that reminded him of the war? Who was he speaking to?

#+begin_quote
  He wasn't supposed to have heard his dad talking, but this particular red haired boy had a penchant for breaking rules. His twin did as well, but he had been de-gnoming the garden when his dad had been reminiscing about the old days.
#+end_quote

Why did he decide to listen in on his father? Why wasn't he with his twin?

#+begin_quote
  For some reason he couldn't quite place, the red haired twin who had overheard his dad had neglected to tell the other this information, even though they shared everything.
#+end_quote

Eh, seems a bit strange that he wouldn't tell his twin, particularly when you state that it's normal for them to share everything. Had he gotten distracted by something else and it slipped his mind until now, and if so extrapolate on it. Why is he contemplating the Unforgivables now? Did something remind him?

#+begin_quote
  Polyjuice potion can be quite dangerous if it's used in a certain way, I guess.
#+end_quote

Is there a reason he immediately considers Polyjuice? I would assume foreshadowing, but we do only have a small snippet. I would also assume that in "Polyjuice Potion" both words are capitalised, as it's a name.

#+begin_quote
  But that kind of thing is a lot more severe than what we're doing.
#+end_quote

What kind of thing? Unforgivables or the abuse of Polyjuice Potion? If the latter, expand on dangerous ways to abuse Polyjuice, if the former, you may want to reword to reduce confusion. I like the foreshadowing for whatever action the narrator is undertaking. Not sure about the word severe, it doesn't really make sense. Perhaps a simile for dangerous?

A little bit too much whimsy/purple prose for my taste, for example not mentioning the twins by name when it's obvious (or at least seems obvious) to their identity. If it's not the Weasley twins you could leave the suspense and reveal their identity later, but if it is, explicitly avoiding their identity seems pretentious. It feels a little heavy-handed, but if it's a prelude it fits fine, I just wouldn't want to read an entire story in the same vein.

It seems interesting, and my main critique is to add more detail, which may just be a personal preference, but I do prefer to know all the little details, which often make the story flow better.

Although I feel I've only made complaints, I am intrigued, and if you ever were to publish it I would be interested in reading.

*** Yeah, I've ran through and made a lot of changes to the opening segment on my ff.net version. With Arthur's bit, I didn't want to be too revealing, as that memory is going to play a part later on. The fact he didn't share it is laying the groundwork for the seperation of the twins and make them stand out as individuals. Yeah, the Polyjuice is foreshadowing. Yeah, I do need to change that little segment quite a bit. Don't worry, the Weasley twins will be known by name after this chapter. I'll post it here when it's ready :D thanks for taking the time to do this!
