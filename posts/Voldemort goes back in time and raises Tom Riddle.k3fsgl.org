The story is from Tom's point of view and starts from the moment Voldemort adopts him. If anyone is interested and would like to give me some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]]


** This is by far my favourite fic this year! I've already left a review on the story, but I'll say it again. The pacing is amazing, Voldemort and Tom are very in character, the plot is unique!

Thank you for writing it!

** I love this fic! Easily in my top ten for the year :)

Also, probably the best depiction of young Tom Riddle that I've read: sympathetic, but at no point descending into woobie-ism. His relationship with “Marvolo” is a masterpiece. The only fic that even comes close in terms of fleshing out Tom's character would probably be realignment.

** This is probably my fav fic of all time so far, I never read slash and read the first 12ish chapters on FFN thinking it was just a mentor/father fic.

Alas this is truly a masterpiece! Its executed to near perfection.

*** Thank you!! I'm very happy you are enjoying it! I am sorry about the FFN not tagged as slash. It was the first story I ever posted and, for me, FFN is much harder to figure out as a publisher.

** I saw this post and thought "hmm that sounds good."

I wasn't expecting an absolute MASTERPIECE! This is the best fanfic I have read in a long time! The relationship between Tom and 'Marvolo' is so amazing. I don't even have words to describe how much I like this - I had to sacrifice sleep to read this, but it's so worth it.
