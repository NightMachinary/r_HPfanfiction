:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Iso a fix-it fic set in POA, where Lupin took his potion the night they found Peter Pettigrew. Harry ends up living with Lupin and Sirius and events subsequently change. I just want some good ol Wolfstar taking care of Harry


** - “The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga” linkffn(13052940), except it is not Woflstar but all M/F (Lupin is with Tonks eventually).

- “Three little words by Rouven_Auge_des_Sturms_Singer” linkao3(16472705), hmm, also het ... Sirius/Amelia. Sorry, no help.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one. Trying again with chapter 92. I think the site is fixed and those of you who couldn't see it last week can see it now. 11-6-2020.
