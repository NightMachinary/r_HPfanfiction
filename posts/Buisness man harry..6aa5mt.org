I want a harry who runs his own business. It has to be a if not the key point of the whole story, and i want that confidence and buisness savvy nature of his to be applied to all areas of his life. He still at hogwarts well he's not gonna put up with snapes behaviour, who does he think he is, harry owns and runs a buisness, he's just a teacher. Basically also very independent. Bonus points if he actually started it up himself.

Edit: Minimum 40k words


** in this story the power the dark lord knows not is money and harry uses his wealth to win the war and to get what he want. its a lord potter fic but harry focuses a lot on harry harry using his wealth and businesses linkffn(10364683)

*** Read it. Looking more for a harry who isn't raped by a few schoolgirls/boys. Not looking for super strong harry, but at least a harry that can hold off a few magical schoolgirls. Also i believe a lot of the staff was too ooc. I mean i know mcgonnagal at least wouldn't have followed so blindy as to miss and even cause pain to one of her'cubs'.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.
