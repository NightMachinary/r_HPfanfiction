So any newer WBWL fanfics I might no know of or old even abandoned ones. The fics can be bad as I doubt they can get as bad as what I attempted to read. If you some how found a good one on Wattpad I'm willing to read that as well. Please save me.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter is nothing special, or so he thinks. That is, until a letter arrives, inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hardly believing his luck, Harry thinks his life is looking up - until he finds out the terrible truth. His parents gave him up because they thought he was non-magical, a squib. Even worse, his twin brother is the famous Boy-Who-Lived.

  After meeting his godfather, Harry goes to Hogwarts, determined to prove himself to his parents and the Wizarding World. But what will they think of their Slytherin son? What will his Gryffindor twin think of him?

  Harry is drawn into the mysteries of Hogwarts, all the while balancing his schoolwork and his new position as the heir of the infamous Black family.

  Everyone involved in the decision thought that he'd be fine when they got rid of him, and he was. Eventually. But if you kick someone out of their home, hurt them, and ignore them, why would you think your level of fine would be the same as his level of fine? Wrong Boy Who Lived Fic!

**** Btw if you visit my favorites read the descriptions of the fics carefully. Some of the fics in my fav list have non consensual content. These are pretty obvious in the description but I wanted to give warning so you don't accidentally visit.

Note none of these are in my wbwl (at least from my memory) Talking about some of the other fics.
