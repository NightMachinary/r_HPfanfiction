Basically, what forms do you think Magical Punishments and Incarceration would take? (EDIT - besides Azkaban, I mean. What other punishments exist besides imprisonment and what would nations that don't have Azkaban do?).

*Firstly, Imprisonment*. I imagine it'd be very, very difficult to successfully contain even a mildly knowledgeable criminal. So, traditional prisons would be a significant investment to make secure. Would Magicals make them? Would they make something else? (EDIT - What kind of prisons would they make? What kind of alternatives might they use?)

*Secondly, Corporal Punishment*. Would Magicals inflict pain or bestow curses as punishment? Would stinging charms be used like caning students, would there be a stocks for prisoners, would they get a paralysis curse to remove use of a limb for a year, etc? (EDIT - What methods might a Magical nation use?)

*Thirdly, Deprivation Punishments*. There doesn't seem to be a Capital-Corporal-type term for this, but I'm including fines (depriving of resources), repossession (depriving of property), and exile (depriving of home) in this. Would Magicals do those? How might they enforce exile, if they do it?

*Fourthly, Capital Punishment*. We know the British have the Dementor's Kiss for some criminals, but we also know not every nation has Dementors. What alternatives might exist? (EDIT - specifically, what alternative methods of Capital Punishment might exist?)


** I imagine that in addition to Azkaban, they have an ordinary prison for people like Mundungus. Sentencing him to months of clinical depression in a place that makes a medieval dungeon look like a four-star hotel in comparison seems a bit disproportional for a petty criminal like Dung.

I think that taking the wand away either permanently or for a limited amount of time is also a common punishment. Getting one's wand broken is a punishment shown in the books and I don't think that a temporary confiscation of the wand is too much of a stretch.

I could also see people like Pansy Parkinson, who weren't Death Eaters but still collaborated with the Death Eaters, serve some kind of community service after the war. Like helping with the reconstruction of Hogwarts.

*** Pretty sure Azkaban is the only prison, it's the only one ever mentioned and referred to as the wizard prison rather than a wizard prison.

*** Probably a good idea, yeah. Maybe the Ministry itself contains the low-level cells?

A good point that Wand Confiscation would fit with what we saw in canon. The only issue I can see with the wand thing is that the vast majority of Wizards seem to be very low-level casters and borderline useless without their wands. To the point that having no wand and no magic, even temporarily, might actually lead to them dying.

** Jinxes, hexes, and curses, I felt would be appropriate punishments for less serious crimes and other magical beings. Hag kill an animal to eat it without owning the animal? Cursed to hate the taste of flesh. Thief steal gold? Cursed to be unable to touch money for the next year. Someone try and rig a lottery with chance magic? Cursed to be unlucky for the next year. Goblin piss off a ministry official? Cursed to serenade wizards as respectfully as possible in their presence.

I think it would provide historical context for muggle fairy tales too. Many of these stories would come from wizarding punishments.

I'm not sure why you see prisons as difficult to construct. Azkaban seems to work just fine. So long as the prisoners don't have wands and you staff it properly, they'd probably work just fine. They'd probably construct a building, charm it, and then use it.

Corporal punishment seems to only be used in school. It would probably have come up as a punishment for statute violations, underage sorcery, etc.

Oh yeah, there'd definitely be fines, confiscations, etc. Doubt there'd be any exiles though.

Killing curse, potions, etc for execution methods.

*** All great stuff, thank you. :)

Specifically a fair point on Corporal Punishment though. I hadn't considered that it'd probably've come up for the sentencing we see in Canon.

  Prisons as difficult to construct
#+end_quote

Not so much difficult to construct as difficult to implement well and a lot of work to construct well. Sirius was apparently able to escape Azkaban without running into another guard (IIRC, he didn't have a wand, so that fight would've ended quickly), nobody frisked the Crouches for Polyjuice Potion before they went to visit their kid, and Voldemort blew the side of the building off, etc. Azkaban seems to rely purely on the apathy and depression caused by the Dementors to sap the motivation of its prisoners to escape.

The general conclusion people seem to have with magic here is that it takes power to overcome other spells, meaning a prison-warden/constructor would have to create powerful protections to stop people escaping. It only takes one mistake for a prisoner to get hold of a wand and so it's only sensible to prepare for that. Even if it only happens once, that's still a relatively significant problem (Azkaban being the prison of the Bellatrixes of Magical Britain, after all).

** *Imprisonment*

Obviously very effective in canon. Despite what fanfics would have you believe, wandless magic is not common, so taking away someone's wand and locking them up is pretty effective. It even worked worked on Grindelwald. There are also doors that can't be opened with Alohomora and areas that can't be apparated to or from in canon. So even with wandless magic available, imprisonment should remain effective.

*Corporal Punishment*

Assuming Filch isn't just trolling the kids, this used to be common at Hogwarts. And Umbridge's blood quill would probably qualify too. But while I can imagine minor corporal punishment being used on children and students, I doubt it would generally be used on adults as punishment for crimes. The magic that would be most effective for this sort of thing would almost certainly be classified as Dark, so most governments aren't going to want to advertise their use of Dark spells like that. Obviously Voldemort's regime is an exception, but most governments want to at least pretend to be the good guys.

*Deprivation Punishments*

I'm pretty sure fines are mentioned in canon, but even if they weren't, it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't exist. As for exile, I'm sure some fics would create some sort of spell that stops someone from ever entering a country, but I don't think that really fits with canon. I'm not a historian, but I imagine that back before surveillance and strict border controls were normal, exile was pretty hard to enforce anyway. So I imagine that the way they kept people exiled was by basically saying "If we catch you in this country again, you'll get an even harsher punishment, probably execution."

*Capital Punishment*

Dementors seem to be the default in canon, and the Veil is the default in fanfics. But I can't imagine the Unspeakables being fine with a bunch of people coming into their territory whenever someone needs to be executed. The Killing Curse is obviously an option, but as with corporal punishments, it's probably not one that a government would want to choose, even if it is the most effective and humane option available. Beheading is also an option, as Sir Nicholas can attest, though I don't think it was ever established in canon if he was beheaded by muggles or magicals. It would have been before the Statute of Secrecy anyway, so it probably doesn't matter. But I think the most likely method of Dementor-free execution is the consumption of a poison. We know poisons are effective, there must at least be some that are easy to brew or obtain, and there's at least some historical precedent.

** I'm assuming you're asking this outside of the obvious choice of Azkaban that the UK uses?

1. There'd be no way that a witch/wizard would be imprisoned in a muggle jail; not even including all the ways they could escape it would become a serious breach of the Statute of Secrecy and would rely on the Ministry wanting to have any form of contact with the Muggle world. With magic and House Elves taking care of most of the necessities, it would be easy to manage a wizarding prison.

2. Like the real world it's probably dependent on what the countries' stance on corporal punishment is - even if it's not allowed I'd be surprised if it didn't still happen, the wizarding world is barbaric in a lot of ways.

3. Fines make sense and we know that wand-snapping is a punishment, both for not finishing your education or for a criminal act. Wand-snapping is basically being excommunicated from the wizarding world, it's illegal to own the one thing that makes a witch a witch.

4. MACUSA in America uses execution as their punishment for a heinous criminal act - it's likely that other countries have their own forms of capital punishments given the macabre nature of the Wizarding World, probably involving some form of horrific creature or another.

Hope this is what you were looking for.

*** Yeah, I'm looking for alternatives or things-in-addition to Azkaban, basically. I guess my written post wasn't that clear on that, huh?

It's kind of what I'm looking for. Basically the stuff behind what I was trying to get - eg. you say that countries may do corporal punishment, I'm looking for specific ideas on how they may do it.
