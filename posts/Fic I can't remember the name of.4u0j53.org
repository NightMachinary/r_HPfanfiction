James survives the attack on Godric's Hallow, but Lily is killed. James remarried and had another son, who's in Ginny's year. Harry lives with the Dursleys until Voldemort rescues him when it's five or six, He is raised as Harrison Riddle and goes to Durmstrang. In his fifth year, he goes to Hogwarts for the Triwizard tournament voluntarily.

The Lestranges lived in hiding in this story until called by Voldemort, and Evan Rosier fled Britain and went to France and got a job at their Ministry before returning.

Can't remember the name of the fic.

*** While the writer's grammar does have room for improvement, I loved the actual story itself, which was unfortunately abandoned like all but one of the Death Eater Harry fics I've read.
