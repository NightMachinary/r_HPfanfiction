I've read stories where Harry is an older brother in WBWL fics. I've read him being taken in by the Grangers and he and Hermione grow up as siblings. However, I can't for the life of me remember any fics in which Harry is the younger brother. I'm in need of Harry having someone to look up to. A cool older brother/sister who gives him advice, teases him, teaches him how to talk to girls. I've read one or two where Tonks fills that role, but it's rare. The only one I can think of where she doesn't end up as a pairing is Silver King. Bill Weasley taking him under his wing. Cedric and the Diggory's taking him in. Hell, even just age up Dudley and have him be a better person. Something. Anything. Just don't let that relationship turn into a romance. Anything come to mind for this?


** There's Heather For Protection (older sister) but she ends up with Snape which is so creepy

** First thought was Triumphant , the Dreamer by Shadowblayze on ffnet - I haven't actually read it yet but it's on my list and it has Harry having an older sister

The other is Blindness by Angelastarcat on ffnet - it's been a while since I read this but it's great especially in the Harry having a good family relationship with the Dursleys and Dudley playing more a protective big bro role.

*** Accidental Animagus. Not from Harry's orphanment(?) but from a pretty young child.

  “My, oh my my my, you're a complex one, aren't you? Let's see here, a quick wit, with quite a bit of cunning to go with it - not too much in the way of ambition, but you are a hard worker, yes indeed...”You're just going over the stereotypes, Heather thought. What about what Felicity and Kiera told me on the train?The voice remained quiet for a long moment. “...hmm. Seems you're inclined to look a bit deeper than most whose minds I peer into, eh? Well, if it's deeper analysis you want... yes, I see, you've realized magic is a gift, not a privilege - you'd be surprised how few seem to think the same way... And a fierce desire to protect your brother, my, look how brightly that shines.” Harry's all I've got. If I don't look after him, no one else will.

  A boy, ostracized for reasons his family never quite explains. A girl, ostracized for being the new kid in school and having a penchant for reading at recess. Two dentists who see a problem they can fix. This fic contains the somewhat-advertised scene of Albus Dumbledore getting poked in the chest repeatedly.(part 1 of who knows how many parts. each installation in the series will end such that there aren't too many loose ends hanging if I don't write more. there is no posting schedule regarding future parts.)
