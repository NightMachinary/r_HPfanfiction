While I have not watched the Stepford Wives film, I remember seeing its trailer years ago. This memory plus reading the Wikipedia and TV Tropes article about the movie adaptations and the novel prompted my prompt.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStepfordWives]] _

Privet Drive is very much like the Stepford Wives' community: Here, every woman is "perfect." The only anomalous family on it is ironically the Dursleys because Petunia did not have to undergo any brainwashing or turning into a robot to become the way she is. She and Vernon are really just that obsessed with being "perfectly normal." And so Vernon becomes part of the men's club and is too daft to notice anything strange about his compatriots. The men realize and begrudgingly respect that Vernon really does love his wife. So the men don't care to enlighten him about their secret. But they are very amused with Petunia's efforts to try and keep up with their wives' beauty and accomplishments (keeping the house perfectly clean, the garden perfectly cared for, having the perfect recipes, etc.) _

That's all I've got for now. Let your imagination flow as to how this will affect the Harry Potter universe. :-)


** More ideas:

Dark - where the Men's Association reveal their secret to Vernon to help the guy out with his problem nephew. Young Harry is brainwashed so thoroughly that he becomes the perfectly normal nephew that the Dursleys have always dreamed of. An owl never goes out to invite him to Hogwarts, Dumbledore investigates and erroneously comes to the conclusion that Harry must have become a Squib as a consequence of Voldemort's Killing Curse. He never suspects anything because the Men's Association use nonmagical (though technologically advanced) means to subdue their wives and the boy. Harry grows up as a boring Muggle.

Not so Dark - similar events as above but Harry's magic and/or the Horcrux protect him and he is able to escape Privet Drive.

Dark & Sad- Divergence comes when Dumbledore investigates and though he couldn't detect anything magical, he still feels something off. The wizard discovers the horrors of Privet Drive and Muggle science. Harry's condition is irreversible. Dumbledore regrets placing him with the Dursleys and lives with this regret for the rest of his life.

Dark then happy - Harry's brainwashing is reversible and he is taken away from Privet Drive

What about the "blood wards"? Since none of the people behind these things were wizards, they didn't act up.

Kid's adventure - pre-Hogwarts Harry has always felt that the Dursleys and his neighbors on Privet Drive were odd. He investigates stuff and stumbles upon the Men's Association's secret. The leader catches him and uses this opportunity to "help" the Dursleys out without revealing the secret to Vernon.

Auror Harry's adventure - an older Harry wakes up from nightmares about Privet Drive. It turns out that he witnessed stuff when he was a kid, caught a few times and brainwashed although it never stuck. He was only "obliviated" of the stuff he saw. Now, he remembers them thanks to his nightmares. He goes back to investigate the community under the pretense of visiting his relatives. He finds out the secret of the Men's Association. He tries to help his Aunt Petunia "recover" but to his dismay learns that she really is who she is. Although it isn't in his jurisdiction because it isn't a magical crime, Harry cannot, in good conscience, ignore the crimes so he finds a way to report the events to the Muggle authorities.

To make the stories darker, we can have the original Stepford Wives tale where the person gets murdered and is replaced by a robot. Less dark would be the brainwashing and it would be easier to explain how a child can still age.
