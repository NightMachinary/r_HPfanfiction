  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** You don't say what sort of fic you like.

I'm updating mine twice a week but it's nearly done; there are only three more chapters to go. And my other one updates once a week but I'll be breaking for five weeks while I'm away and it's a Cursed Child fic which everyone hates, so I can't imagine that one being much use to you either. Sorry.
