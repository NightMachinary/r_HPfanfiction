** Promising start of a series.\\

Auror Lily Luna Potter is thrown back in time (GoF resurrection scene) and Dumbledore makes her impersonate Harrys mother.\\

  Percy goes back in time.He doesn't do it to save the world, doesn't do it because he is a Gryffindor, doesn't do it to help the Order of the Phoenix defeat Voldemort.He does it because Ginny died and his shirt is still drenched in her blood.He does it because he's selfish, because he's the last one standing in a world destroyed by years of war.He does it and he succeeds.His family, however, doesn't understand why his behaviour has changed so much.

  It's 2029, and Lily Potter is bored. But don't worry -- soon, neither of those things will be true.

  The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever.It made Walburga furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time those filthy blood traitors might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn't be allowed. Or,Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and it changes everything.

*** Are there any more fics like black pride? I love this idea of the black family. Dark magic to uphold whatever the family desires instead of “for the sake of evulz”
