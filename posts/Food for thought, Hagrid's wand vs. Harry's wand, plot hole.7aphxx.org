If Hagrid's wand was destroyed when he was expelled and he was able to piece it back together (which shouldn't have been possible according to, you know, DESTROYED) , then why wasn't Harry able to put his wand back together (without the elder wand), when it was only snapped in half, not completely separated?


** Harry's repaired wand was initially faulty; it was only fully restored using the Elder Wand. Meanwhile, Hagrid's wand was pieced together by an Elder Wand-wielding Dumbledore.

*** It never said the wand was faulty, harry never tried to use it before he fixed it with the elder wand. And How was Hagrid able to get the wand back? if the ministry destroyed it, they would have disposed of it too, wouldn't you think? Or is this just another "Dumbledore" answer? It really seems that "Dumbledore did it" is Rowling's favorite go-to answer.... and Jahoan, I don't think it would have been transfigured. If I'm not mistaken, once you transfigure something, it loses all properties of the object it was before it was transfigured. My guess is that if "Dumbledore" is the answer, however he got the pieces back, he attached the umbrella parts to the tip of the wand, that way if someone did the "finite incantatem" spell, he would still be able to use his wand, it just wouldn't look like an umbrella any more.... I'm probably just rambling here..

** I think Dumbledore repared Hagrid's wand using the Elder Wand.

*** ...you know, I never actually realised that. So would it be the actual full wand as part of the umbrella handle, then?

**** I don't see why not. He wouldn't be able to have the full wand out and about so it would be in the umbrella either way.

***** This theory can go one step further. What was Dumbledore's original post at Hogwarts?

That's right, he was the /Transfiguration/ teacher.

Dumbledore didn't just repair Hagrid's wand, he transfigured it into the pink umbrella.

**** Probably similar to Lucius Malfoy's Cane/Wand combo.
