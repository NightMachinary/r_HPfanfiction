Let's face it, as much as we love to tear into the fanfic cliches, we love some of them. What are yours? Is it Ice Princess Daphne? Lord Potter-Black, Kingpin of the Wizengamot? Or is it something structural like blood wards, runic magic, or something mundane like a shared bedroom for the Head Boy and Girl?

My personal favorite is time travel romance. It goes against literally everything canon tells us about time travel (not including Cursed Child of course) but they're just so fun and dumb, especially when they don't bother to explain the mechanics of it.

List away! Fanfic is a guilty pleasure, let's have fun with it.


** Runic magic is my favorite fanon cliche, as the idea that 1 of the main electives would be a 4 year long language course on dead languages seems like a complete waste of time. Sure it could be useful for translations, but considering some characters like Crouch know a lot of languages i can imagine there is probably an easier way to learn them in the wizarding world.

Although i personally prefer the idea that Runes themselves don't have much power, but can be used as anchors for spells as long as the runic words/structures are linked to the purpose of the spells, e.g. Protective runes used to bind ward barriers.

*** Here's my headcanon on the whole thing: Accidental magic is still magic, right? Right. I vaguely recall someone in canon saying something about reality warping powers. Can you imagine people getting pissed off and accidentally nuking the school, their home, shopping district, etc. Wand magic and latin incantations are a way to put a safety onto magicals.

Moving on. Now, Wards, runic script, enchanting, etc. That uses ANCIENT runes because they aren't commonly in use. Can you imagine the DADA teacher accepting homework for the blasting hex and someone bumps into the desk. BOOM! The classroom explodes.

**** I think the difference is that it's so mundane. Muggle studies makes sense because Dumbledore or someone thought it was important that magicals at least acknowledge that muggles are more than the dirt beneath their shoes, but the idea that runes is only for learning a dead language is pretty strange when every other class has some amount of magic related application, even History of Magic. Also, why runes and not Latin or Greek, considering that they seem to be the basis of a lot of spells? It's just weird, so people ignore it, and combined with the common trope of ancient languages having power, runes becomes a warding class.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** I love the idea of ward magic in general, and it's so prevalent in fic that it's hard for me to believe it's never mentioned in canon. I wonder who brought it into the fandom first???

I also love the completely ridiculous notion that Quidditch players get all built and muscle-y, as if they're like pro footballers in real life. Makes no sense, but I do like to imagine the boys all buff!

I love the notion that a witch or wizard's magic is influenced by their family or nationality, or otherwise has personal markers. That someone could recognize a certain spell was cast by Frenchman, for example, or that "this charm was definitely done by Bill and not Charlie", or something like that.

OMG I *love* the marriage law fics, even though it all started with Snape/Hermione which is TOTALLY not my thing. To my utter delight, the fandom just took the notion and RAN WITH IT and I've read so many different amazing stories with that premise (with ALL kinds of pairings) and it's the best thing ever!!!

Magical tattoos! Of course Charlie is covered with dragon tattoos, and Bill has Egyptian hieroglyphics. Also they move around, just like magical photographs or portraits.

*** I think ward magic is so fascinating in how intricate, and relatively consistent people are about it considering it is not in canon. It's as if there are general rules stated in the first fic it was used from, or some other media (D&D? Other High fantasy?) and people stick to those conventions, using them to explain how the Fidelius works or how the wards on Privet Drive function.

And Quidditch toned abs! Ah, that brings me back. I haven't seen those in a while, but I loved that trope too. I definitely imagined they'd be more lean, since it's mostly stretching but there has to be some excuse for buff characters.

And the idea of magical signatures is so clever, I never knew it wasn't in canon until way too late. I just expected it to be there. But the idea you can identify spells like a fingerprint would make for interesting scenarios, and might be based in Priori Incantitem, but would make things like Prisoner of Azkaban make no sense.

Ah Marriage Law fics. Like Soul Bonds, they can be very soapy or high drama. Of course they're kind of true Handmaids Tale horror if you think about it too much, but the authors clearly don't so you kind of have to take them for what they are and have fun with them

**** The seekers and keepers are probably lean- a small build would help a seeker go faster (like how horse jockeys tend to be small) while a keeper would be better served by a tall, wiry build with long limbs. Chasers could easily be well toned because they have to be maneuverable and have strong throws, while the beaters would likely be buff since the stronger they are the harder they can hit.

So in reality Harry would probably be the smallest person in the quidditch team, while Fred and George would be the buff ones.

​

-The (in)famous Gringotts inheritance test is surely overpowered and the Goblins played up to the point of the ridiculous in many fics. *BUT* the test is essentially just a DNA test. It's perfectly plausible for it to tell the MC which families he/she is related with. Also, while Goblins obviously wouldnt bend over for Harry just because he remembers their names and says thank you, it's not far fetched to imagine Gringotts offices across the world as a sort of embassies for Goblins. With the right bribes and connections I totally see them offering more services than just storing your gold.

​

-Some characters I just cant possibly imagine in any other way than their fanon characterizations. Blaise the smooth, Italian butterfly. Nott, the studious kid with a horrible father. Daphne... well, Daphne.

​

-fix it time travel with a tinge of crack in them. I saw so many people complain that there is little to no conflict in them, but to me that's exactly what makes them fun to read. They are the perfect excuse for an OP protagonist facing as little opposition as possible. At least when it comes down to Harry returning to his first year.

​

-Like other comments already mention, I kinda absorbed some Magical theory fanon as canon by now. Wards, Runes, Arithmancy, stuff like that. I'm at the point where I cant envision the HP magic system lacking the fanon view of these things.

** I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love the Ancient and Noble Houses cliche, but I am a sucker for fics that expand on pureblood traditions. I think it adds another dimension to the idea of being a long-standing wizarding family. Once we get lawyers and mansions and fortunes into the picture it gets a little wealth porn-y for me, but otherwise I am interested in some of the world building that has been done in the area of blood purity. Courtship practices, magic associated with godparent relationships, bonds that go with engagement, etc.

I like a bit of politics, but nothing crazy - especially when the kids are still in school. What teenager thinks about advancing their families political interests while in high school? But I think it's realistic up to a point that kids would be aware of politics and their place within it.

One trope that I unabashedly love, though, is marriage contract fics. It's a reasonably believable way of putting two characters together that otherwise might not interact in the same way, and it's a great set up for a slow burn romance - if executed properly. Harry/Daphne fics are good at this, and I've seen at least one Harry/Susan fic that I liked as well.

Death is a friendly and bored entity. (from a random father figure entity, Mistress Death of Marvel, Teluete to Sandman, to Terry Pratchet Death. Death is literally an old friend.) I just wish there's at least a oneshot of Death from Sims 4 where Harry can flirt and give death flowers to save Sirius or Cedric even Hedwig. Just imagine the absurdity of seeing death hanging around, Harry flirting, then someone getting resurrected. Where Harry is just like, Yeah, every Perver-... Um... Peverell talks, flirts with death. Heck, Ron can even challenge Death for Fred with chess.

Potter family magic or Potter grimoire. (though honestly a part of me truly wishes there's more, living earth,golem,teracotta warrior,gargoyle or even the ancient and noble house of potter decended from Galatea and Pygmalion for literal Potter magic but any family magic is fine for me)

Scandinavian magic, Seidr vs. Witchcraft and Wizardry (Norse, celtic and other druidic living/wild magic versus the modern magic is a tool. Like living magic is more of a soft magic system versus Hard magic system of Wand magic.)

** Using conventional weapons in ambushes. Whether or not a shield charm can withstand a bullet is a different debate because if used from an ambush, the target (usually a death eater) won't see it coming and shield spells are irrelevant. Same goes for hidden explosives.

Magic is not the force, and even if it is used to heighten senses, it won't give you precognition and no wizard a force user.

I guess that this is mostly the result of wanting Harry and co to have a more active role in the war and actually hunt Death Eaters and Snatchers down, but recognising that the trio would probably lose in a fair fight, partially because they refuse lethal force.

*** I generally headcanon there being two types of shield charms: energy and physical. /Protego/ is an energy shield charm, able to protect against most spells and other forms of energy, like the energy of an explosion. It has a breaking point, but can still negate some of the damage. /Aegis/ is a physical shield, able to block banished objects and even bullets, but not spell bolts.

As such, grenades/pipe bombs would likely be very effective, as they release both explosive energy and shrapnel, and very few mages are able to keep up both types of shields at once.

She and Remus fall in love while she has to avoid telling him of Sirius's innocence and everything that will happen that year.

It has a lot of great time turner worldbuilding, and while it drags in the middle as Remus catches back up to her, I still enjoyed it a lot.

I am writing a time travel story right now where the time traveler isn't the PoV character in the past, and most of the story is in the present. I read a lot of that trope and wanted to do some of the things I never see writers doing, heh.

I wrote a 'guide' on how to write a bad time travel HP story if you're interested in reading it. It's basically all tongue in cheek, pretty short.

****** Yes! It's my favorite of all time too :D Even with the parts that drag. That part where he says he'll wait for her, oh my god.

Edit: lol at downvoting someone's preferences? Or did you think it's a spoiler?

******* I love how it's vague in the beginning of how her relationship with Ron fell apart and you see what happened in the middle of the story, and how Hermione is so sweet to Teddy!

** Mindscape battles, psychic wars via occlumency/legilimency. Usually involves Snape teaching Harry and then both of them using this ability to somehow defeat Voldemort in the very end. Potions training or dark arts/dueling training from Snape to Harry is also good, but occlumency/legilimency is the best. It all boils down to Snape is already a badass and teaches Harry to be a badass too, instead of an incompetent wizard who's only power is "loving" his enemy to death. /The Power of Hugs! The Power of Friendship!/ In real life, your hugs and your friends would just die and get eaten by titans. /(Attack on Titan)/

I love the marriage-contract stories as an excuse to get Hermione/Snape together lol. I love dark-arts/mind-connection/blood-spell-connection/magical-signature-connection/whatever in regards to Hermione/Snape. Bonus points if Hermione is even smarter than she is in canon so she can keep up with Snape's talents.

** Manipulative Dumbledore. If you look at canon with a different perspective years after the books completed, Dumbledore has a lot to answer for. That, and a l love how people get so protective of him. Bonus points if Harry and the gang know about it. Watching the gang navigate their way around voldemort AND dumbledore? That's what I love in a manipulative dumbledore story.

Personally, I don't give a damn if he is good, bad, senile, or dead. As long as the story can back it up. You can quote canon all you want at me. I don't care. Stick with your canon, I'll stick with my fanfictions.

** God. There are so many... My personal favourite would have to be Lords and Ladies of the Sacred 28, and political power and the shit. It's just so much fun! I've read a couple good fics where Sirius remained part of the Black family and was way for subtle about muggleborn pro reforms. its like incredible. I love the idea of Lord and Lady Black, and how families often fight for political monopoly, its rlly fucking cool. ward magic is just impossible but its fun too so like its so so for me. I know we're not talking abut ships but I also just find Harry x Voldemort and Harry x Snape so fucking funny. its just so weird but when its done in a comedic way its amazing.

** I'm kinda a sucker for the "Hadrian" nickname. I think it's mostly because I gave my insane Dark Side Sith Sorcerer from Star Wars the Old Republic that name.

​

I'm also a sucker for WBWL stories where Harry doesn't immediately hate his twin. Bonus points if his twin is an ok guy, instead of a stupid git.

** I like the idea of ward magic, it's interesting different, yet similar; ways it's described.

What happens in Slytherin, stays in Slytherin; trope. While I HATE Child Politics with a fiery passion, and stay away from those, there's something about the what happens in Slytherin; stays in Slytherin that I love. You can hate each other in private all you want, but in public we are united.

Sauve Blaise Zabini. Theodore Nott with a horrible father.

Charlus and Dorea Potter are Harry's grandparents. I just can't picture anyone else.

Time Travel: BUT! I like them when they change what happens in canon. It can be set in the Marauders or the Golden Trio Era, but yeah, I'd rather them change what's happening, instead of just witnesses it.

Snape as a mentor/guardian. It's just something I love.

Freed Sirius, with more of a personality then just womanizer, hater of authority, et cetra.

Soulmates: Though this one heavily depends on how it's written.

*** MoD!Harry is the best, but only if it's really MoD!Harry. Some people write God!Harry and call it MoD!Harry, you know what I mean? Like, if you want MoD!Harry to be a death god, that's cool, but if you make MoD!Harry omniscient and omnipotent, then you're mislabeling things.

** I love time-travel fics. Even badly written ones (but I can only stomach them for so long). I have read a few good marauder meets golden trio meets next generation fanfics and that has a lot of potential! I, also, love the 8th years sharing a large dormitory regardless of house trope.
