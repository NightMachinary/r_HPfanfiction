My google-fu has failed me, though I feel I have more than enough detail to find this fic. So I come to you for help!

This is an after war story. Harry helps Hermione find her parents in Australia (or possibly meets up with them already found). He has received a diary/journal from his mother that details how his life will be difficult now because other wizards will try to defeat him to become the new most powerful wizard. She was a sort-of seer and could only see some details.

Hermione's parents decide to travel with them as they train and hide to protect themselves. They all end up in Colorado at some point, meet up with the Stargate crew and exchange knowledge. Harry designs devices that can block/nullify magic. The parents use these at some point to beat some wizards while visiting a magical town in Colorado.

At some point someone is kidnapped and harry ends up wiping out an entire ministry (Brazil maybe?) to rescue them.

It may not be marked as a crossover as I don't recall the stargate portion being a major part of the story.

Thank you in advance!


** As a big fan of the stargate fandom, i can safely tell you that i have sadly not encountered this fic :( should you happen to find it, please sharre the link :)

  What would Harry do now that the Dark Lord is dead and he has survived? He never thought he would live and he was not prepared for it. Who will help him find his way and help him find himself? What of his best friends who are now dating each other. How will the trio fare in the new World Order? Pairings H/HR
