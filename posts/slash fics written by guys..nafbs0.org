I wanna see if there's a difference; if at all. Any pairing would suffice.


** Eider_Down, the author of /The Second String/, is a gay guy. I love this fic for several reasons, but in addition to being a great story I think it's one of the best (if not the best) slash stories I've read. This is because, speaking as a gay guy myself, it reads really true to me. However, it's not really about the relationship (which is Harry/Gideon Prewett), but about taking down Voldemort and the First War itself.

The author of /The Man Who Lived/ is also a guy (at least, I'm pretty sure). This is another good story, but since I'm more for action, adventure, and conflict-drama and tend to avoid Drarry, I wasn't really into it. It's heavily focused on queer issues, and some of its perspectives rang a little off to my own experiences. This isn't a criticism--my experiences are hardly eveyone's!--but it made it a little harder for me to enjoy. linkao3(20979779).

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
