Not looking for super powerful Harry, Harry more powerful than in canon obviously, but not Dumbledore levels of powerful. It has to make sense.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on ANY Site

Harry doesn't have to be the main character but can be.

No Harem or Lord Potter.

No bashing of the characters. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine if it makes sense in the story, but an author going out of the way to bash a character is a no go.

** What We're Fighting For linkffn(9766604)

Harry's been trained by Sirius and Remus since that night. He's very powerful but has been in hiding, training his entire life and has no social skills. If you've ever seen Full Metal Panic!, it reads a lot like Souske Goes to Hogwarts.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
