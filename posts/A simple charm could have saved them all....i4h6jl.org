Messers Weasley and Diggory sat back and watched the children hunt for the group's portkey before the World Cup. Each man suppressed a small laugh at their charges as they all strained to see through the pre-dawn light for an unknown object. Too bad the youngsters hadn't yet learned about the Portusrevelio Charm. It would have saved them time and dignity. Little did any of the traveling party know, that charm could have saved lives, and the world, and prevented The Second Rise.


** Kudos for having a prompt with details beyond a sentence in the title.

That said, I guess I'm a bit confused about the prompt. Is there a reference to something that I'm missing? Is this a purposely ambiguous prompt?

*** /Portus/ is the charm that creates Portkeys.

Casting /Portusrevelio/ presumably reveals nearby Portkeys, much like casting /Homenum Revelio/ reveals nearby humans.

Arthur Weasley and Amos Diggory are amused by their children having to aimlessly search for the Portkey, and thus do not mention the spell's existence, nor do they cast it, as a little prank.

However, had they mentioned or taught it to Cedric or Harry, they /might/ have thought to cast it on the Cup (after all, it would be totally in-character for that -ed up tournament to booby-trap the Cup), and then triggered it without touching it to see what would happen. Alternately, they might think to check the Cup immediately after ending up in the GY, and /perhaps/ might have used it to return before Pettigrew could murder Cedric and Stun Harry.

Had they done so, Voldemort's plan would have failed and at the very least, his return would have been delayed.

Considering Amos' heartrending grief over his son's corpse, one can only imagine the if-only guilt he would feel should he come to follow the above chain of thought...

**** I always assumed the cup was meant to be a portkey that brought the winner out of the maze. It'd explain why portkeys were allowed to work and why it went there when Harry used it to escape.

If the portkey were merely two way or intended to deposit Harry's body in the maze so it looks like an accident then it's go back to the middle.

***** Yes. I spoke in line with what I understood the OPs Intent to be, not what is neccesarily canon or evem my headcanon.

*** Yes, the prompt is vague on purpose.

Each author will have their own interpretation of this starting/plot point. Any resulting stories could have wildly diverging paths.

** Harry and Cedric already knew the cup was a Portkey, they had been told by Bagman before the task began that it would bring them back to the maze's entrance upon touch. So they would have had absolutely no reasons to use that charm on the cup, it would only have lost their time.

*** At the beginning of the chapter ‘Flesh, Bone, and Blood' Cedric and Harry both indicated that they didn't know it was a portkey.

**** You are right, after checking. But even so, the cup was intended to be a portkey by the organisers and why would it even cross any of the champions' minds that they should check if the cup was a portkey? I'm sorry to say but your prompt just doesn't make much sense and seems more like pushing a character to do this instead of this because /you/, the writer, knows the plot point while the character doesn't and possibly couldn't know.

** So other than Amos Diggory being sadder than normal (and he's both very sad and irrelevant already), how do you think this would change anything.

*** Maybe it could be a turning point for teaching defensive charms in Charms class or something. Considering the ‘teacher' that they had in Defense the next year, Flitwick could have stepped in and expanded his curriculum after realizing there was a potential for kidnap-by-portkey or it could have been something that one of the students could have found or researched for DA.
