  Well, whatever it is, I'm sure you will find a use for it," said Dumbledore. "I appreciate the Christmas gift too, Iris, but I think you misunderstood me that night --- when you asked me what I, myself, saw in the Mirror of Erised," he added. "I'm afraid I said wooly /socks/."

  "Ah," said Iris. "See, that's what I thought you said. But with what Aberforth told me, I thought I /did/ mishear, and that you said wooly c---"

  "Quite an understandable mistake," Dumbledore interrupted, and if he was younger, Iris was sure he'd be blushing by the tone of his voice.

** "Headmaster, if you were a bit more open to finding love, you wouldn't keep needing a fresh pair of thick woolen socks," Harry said, as he handed Dumbledore another package wrapped badly in colorful paper.

Albus Dumbledore looked mortified. How could Harry have known about his poor luck with beautiful, darling Gellert Grindelwald?

Accepting the gift with a stammered expression of gratitude, the Hogwarts headmaster rushed back to his chambers, ready to cast a warming charm on the fresh garments.

Truly, there was nothing like a pair of new, warm, woolen socks.

I was thinking that maybe Harry asks Hermione to teach him how to knit... or Hagrid.
