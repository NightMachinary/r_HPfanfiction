:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this one ages ago and despite having gone through the Harry/Fleur threads have been unable to track it down.

I can only remember the opening scene: Fleur is outside a cafe, I believe with a friend, and I think in France though I could be wrong. There's a death eater attack and a character who is revealed to be Harry steps up and handles it. Outside of that I only remember Fleur being disappointed with how she handled herself during the attack. Fairly sure the fic starts during 4th year, has a powerful!harry, and, though I could be very wrong here, has a Harry who doesn't actually go to Hogwarts. It definitely started with an attack outside a cafe of some sort though.

Many thanks in advance!

Bonus points: post your favourite Harry/Fleur fics. Chances are I've read it but you never know!


** Is it the time travel one, Where Harry is keeping a tight time schedule(keeps checking the time) and saves Fleur from an assassin at the start of every restart time. Pretty sure they then go find Atlantis and Harry has to fight Chronos...

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
