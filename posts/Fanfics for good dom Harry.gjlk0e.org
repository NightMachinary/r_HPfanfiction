I want some recommendations for some good Dominating Harry (No M/M). Bonus points for stories with a strong witch submitting to Harry but dominating fellow witches. For example, in some stories of red jacobson, where Harry is the main character with dominating Hermione, but Harry is not submissive. Or Ginny is paired with Harry where Ginny loves dominating other witches and watching Harry dominate these witches. But any dom Harry fanfic is appreciated.


** Moderator note:

Any stories recommended that contain characters under 18 in sexual/suggestive situations *cannot be linked*. Remember Rule 8.

Thank you!

** Well you could try Harem of the Ancient House of Potter by SSJ04Mewtwo. In this story Harry has a little bit extra in his background that causes Witches to submit to him but only to the level that they want to. Eg the witch decides "how deep" the connection goes. Be aware the story is fairly explicit as it's on adult-fanfiction net.

*** Thanks for that recommendation. I don't mind explicit content. In fact, I'm looking for it. So, if you have any recommendations like that, explicit or not, please share.

** Well if hpfanficarchive ever comes back up there is a trio of stories by TigerMoonHunter that you might like. Hermione Learns a Lesson, Hermione and Ginny Summer Lessons, and Hermione and Ginny Remedial Lessons.

There's another story by Rtnwriter called Two Little Words that has Harry helping "relax" by being the dominant she needs. Now again it's on hpfanficarchive however, supposedly the author posted it on ffn under a different name.

*** So, it wasn't only me that had trouble opening hpfanficarchive. I had wondered about that as I tried to open a link to Aluria's gift(turned up during search of this same genre). Any ideas why it's closed off? Anyway, thanks for recommendations.

**** No it's been dead over a week or so. Someone on another post stated that the owner is notoriously hard to get a hold of. Hopefully it will come back soon. There were quite a few WIPs I was following that were only on that site.

** "Outlet" by Shaya Lonnie and La Matrona on AO3 is based on this. It's an 8th-year fic where Hermione almost pushes Harry into a friends-with-benefits type thing. He's the dom and she's the sub.
