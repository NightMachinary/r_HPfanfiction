This seems to be a reoccurring theme in various fics. Was there something in canon or pottermore that mentioned this idea or was there a really popular fic with that trope? Or something else?

Thanks in advance!


** Rowlings [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/illness-and-disability][Pottermore article about Illness and Disability]] actually said the opposite and mentioned that a wizard are explicitly not immune to muggle diseases, but that they can simply heal all of them.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. *Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it*; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

Though they are apparently extremely resistant to muggle poisons and significantly more durable than muggles, which some people have taken as meaning they are somehow resistant to muggle diseases.

*** Very nice! Thank you for the link. That bit about wizards and witches curing every muggle ailment (but not actually immune) corresponds with my head canon so it's good to know that it /is/ canon :)

*** Even just within the books it's fairly heavily implied (and sometimes stated) that Wizards and Witches are far more resilient than Muggles both physically and medically. We never see or hear about them succumbing to illnesses or diseases that are common in Muggles, we only hear about magical illnesses (eg Dragon Pox) and the physical ailments we see can be fixed fairly easily (broken bones are implied to be healed by a single spell, but Lockhart fucked it up, Harry falls several stories off of his broom and is only in the Hospital Wing for, what, a few nights at most? Granted Dumbledore slowed down the fall but it still seemed pretty severe) or the Wizard's magic outright protects them (eg Neville "bouncing" after being tossed out of a window by his great uncle). So, it's fairly easy to misunderstand JKR's intention of Wizard Medicine being able to cure pretty much anything non-magical as Wizards just being immune/resistant to such things.

**** Right. Most Quidditch games should result in multiple fatalities unless magic types are a hell of a lot more durable than mundanes.

Not true we see them getting colds in chamber of secrets

#+begin_quote
  October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward.

** Most likely from the fact that we never see (or even if we did, I don't remember) anyone have common cold, the flu, measles, chicken pox and the like in canon. Add in the fact that the disease Dragon Pox has all the same symptoms as Chicken Pox in addition to leaving a greenish tinge on the patient. This leads to the belief that Wizards are mostly immune to normal muggle diseases and that they have or at least had their own version of common diseases.

**** That it does. It is also used to warm up the recipient which it was used for after the 2^{nd} task in GOF. I think it might have been used in CoS for curing cold as I can vaguely remember something about Percy and Ginny.

But the point is it was used so seldom in canon that no one remembers that little tidbit.

***** Because it makes the Potion far more useful for a story. "Oh, I have a cold... and cured" isn't as appealing as dosing up on magical energy drinks so you can stay awake at a critical moment, hoping the crisis will be over before you crash.

I know what the potion does in canon, but I use the energy drink variant in my stories anyway.

****** Fair enough. I mean you could write a story where you include a new potion that is the magical energy drink, but fanon pepper-up is already there and people are expecting it. The only downside is that it might end up in someone's pet peeve thread and honestly, what doesn't end up in the pet peeve threads?

***** In addition to what Starfox5 said, it's likely authors don't remember the canon use for it, and therefore just see the name "Pepper Up" and assume it's a type of stimulant.

** I figured it was a logical extrapolation of the concept of magical folk using accidental magic to save themselves from danger. Neville bouncing off the cobblestones, Harry wondering how he got onto the school roof, etc. From there, it seems to naturally follow that any witch or wizard who finds themselves dying of some mundane illness could very likely save themselves.
