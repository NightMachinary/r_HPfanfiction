  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  [AU] The Hidden Leaf had a long and sordid history of producing some of the most dangerous rogue ninja to walk the Earth; Orochimaru, Itachi, Kabuto, Sasuke. It was only a matter of time until they produced another one. But no one, especially Naruto, expected their next rogue ninja to be Bolt Uzumaki. Disgraced after the exams, Bolt sets out to make his mark on the ninja world.

***** Spoilers ahead:

Unwoven Threads of Fate has the main character turn his back on his friends and threaten their lives to make an escape. That's evil.

Stargate Galactic Imperium has wholesale genocide. That's evil.

A Twelve Step Program to Omnipotence has the main character nearly destroy an entire nation for personal gain. That's evil.

Point is, they /are/ evil. Just because it doesn't happen immediately doesn't make that false.
