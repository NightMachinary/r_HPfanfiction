I honestly can't remember that much of the fic but at one point, they two were in the future in a prison but then Tom was left in it alone. Also, there was a lot of hopping through time

Again I could give more info but I'd rather not spoil it more for other people if it's found

sorry for doing another one of these but I had to factory reset my phone so I lost all of my fics


** Ad infinitum by speechwriter ? There was lots of hopping through time and they were wanted by the law, but I haven't read it in years so I don't remember if they end up in prison.
