** Linkffn(Harry Potter et al and the Keystone Council Oleggunnarsson)

This sort of fits. I have a Slytherin fem!Harry who tends to keep her own counsel and is slow to open up, but grows more assertive as time goes on. Then I have the Gryffindor twin sister of a deceased Harry Potter (died from injuries after the Halloween attack). She is quiet and experiences anxiety and panic attacks and whatnot, but eventually opens up to Hermione and neville, but ends up more protective and less likely to, say, walk up to someone and slap them. I feel like both girls (Rose the Slytherin and Marigold the Gryffindor) have elements of what you're requesting.

(It's a multiverse story, so both girls exist in their own worlds but interact with each other and three different Harry's, because magic)

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

** !linkffn(WHen Harry met Tom) counts. Harry is... basically a walking disaster with no ability to communicate who effectively who ruins everything she touches.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

** There was a cancelled short fic about a fem-Harry who even Dumbledore didn't believe could take on Tom. They decide to summon a person from an alternate reality. He doesn't seem to mind since he quickly falls for fem-Harry and seduces her in secret.

** All of inwardtranscendence's solo fics have a fem!Harry that is at least socially awkward (Her Mother's Love) or at most a sociopath (The Long Game). They are all well written, if a little bit rambling. She does a complete au in most cases. There is usually a lot about linguistics and the history of the au in the author's notes. None of them are finished, but they are all very long. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/inwardtransience/pseuds/inwardtransience]]
