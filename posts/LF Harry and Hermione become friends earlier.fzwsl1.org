I'm looking for any stories where Harry and Hermione meet and become friends earlier than canon, be it in muggle school, on the hogwarts express or at hogwarts before the troll incident. preferably H/Hr (unsurprisingly)

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** I mean, there's also Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, the fic that still keeps the argument over the balance between mild to moderate paedophilic grooming and pretty decent worldbuilding going. I'm not offering an opinion either way here, because I don't have the energy for an argument, but it does have Hermione and Harry becoming friends early on.

I don't know if it violates the rules here or not, so I won't link it, but it's by LeadVonE on Ao3.

In case you aren't familiar with the fic and want some clarification on the grooming point (and don't mind spoilers): A time-travelling teenaged Harry goes back to his childhood body, pretends to be an adult Lord and befriends a bunch of eleven-year old and earlier girls and ends up in marriage contracts to two or three of them, though it hadn't gotten remotely sexual the last time I read it (I have no idea if it's updated since then, I don't really follow the fic closely, sorry!) but it's a present thing

Fair, though. Anything that long and that meandering needs some serious editing down. There's a reason most novels are 60-100,000 words only.
