I read this a while ago where Harry Potter is basically a dark wizard or was it dark lord, I don't remember. I clearly remember him killing almost all of the Cullens but keeping one alive. She was a witch but got turned by a muggle vampire. Basically if she turns into a witch vampire she could have children. That's all I remember.

** I can't tell if this is Twilight bashing or not, but it sounds like it might be just a little bit, so I'm here for it. Yes, Harry! Join the Dark Side!
