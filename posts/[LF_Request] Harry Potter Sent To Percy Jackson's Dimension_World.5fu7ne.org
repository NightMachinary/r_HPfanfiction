****** I linked you the stories with the filter. It basically means that you get all the crossovers with a guarantee of Harry in them as a main character. By the way, its only around 900 stories, and I didnt use the completed only tag. I'm sure if you added another character filter, like Annabeth or Percy, it would narrow it down a lot more.

****** Search. We aren't your personal fic searchers. Stop being a dick about it and look for it yourself.
