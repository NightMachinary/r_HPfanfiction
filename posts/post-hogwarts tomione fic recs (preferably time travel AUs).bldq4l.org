Basically, I just want to read a story about grown up Hermione and Tom.

Ideally, an engaging story that isn't lovey-dovey (with Tom still being a POS) but realistic, that deals with Tom becoming Voldemort and Hermione working against him.


** Have you read pygmalion by columbrina? It starts in Hogwarts 7th year and progresses on from there. It's quite au. Sorry I don't know how to do the link bot thing

** Linkffn(unsphere the stars)

Doesn't fit your description exactly. They are in Hogwarts, but it keeps going as they're adults with Hermione opposing Voldemort, but they also are attracted to each other? It gets a bit weird at the end with Voldemort getting a Souls reboot back to Tom Riddle, but it's a fun ride nonetheless

***** To be perfectly honest with you, it did cross my mind to say "basically Unsphere The Stars but 100% post-Hogwarts" in the post :D edit: thank you anyway. Hopefully someone who's not yet read that amazing piece of work will get to read it.

  When you can't change time, but you can't go forward, what is left? Hermione learns how to be the protagonist of her own story. [Tomione WIP]
