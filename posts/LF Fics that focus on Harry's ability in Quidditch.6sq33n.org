Most fics I've read only mention Harry's prodigal skill in Quidditch when he's put on the team, then it's ignored for other plotlines. I'm looking for a fic that focuses almost exclusively on Quidditch and Harry being a skilled Quidditch player.


** try this: linkffn(10305847) It does have Fem!harry, but its incredibly quidditch centered, while retaining a solid core narrative.

  In a world where women are prohibited from flying, Harriet Potter's only dream is to play professional Quidditch. What lengths will she go to in order to achieve her dream? AU Fem!Harry, twin. Rated for swearing, minor nudity, innuendo.

** linkffn(Vitam Paramus), although it's kind of slow-paced and 'mundane' at times, does away with many canon characters, and has an OC best friend for Harry. That said, he is a Quidditch star in it, and there are a good number of match scenes.

*** Yeah I've read it. This fic kind of annoyed me. It's advertised as a romance fic, but the romance doesn't start until the second to last chapter.
