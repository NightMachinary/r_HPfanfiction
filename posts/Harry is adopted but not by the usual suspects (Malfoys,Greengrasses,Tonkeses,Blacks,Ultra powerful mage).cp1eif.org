No uber Harry


** I dunno, a lot of families count as 'usual suspects' for adopting Harry. Grangers, Malfoys, Tonks, Gringotts goblins, centaurs, intelligent-dragons, Harry Dresden, Tony Stark...\\
Strangely enough, I don't know if I've seen that many Weasley-adoptions...though there's Like A Red-Headed Stepchild (the one by mugglesftw).

Hmm...who could the newest unusual suspect be? Not Potter-family house elves, that's been done...not Umbridge, that's been done...not Snape, that's been /over/done...not Hagrid, not Lupin...not Newt Scamander either...

Ooh, what about Viktor Krum? As in, his parents? James & Lily's flight from Voldemort takes them to Bulgaria, where they strike up a firm friendship with the Krum family. Voldemort kills Lily and James, but unbeknownst to anyone in Britain, Harry survived and was adopted by the Krums, rising to become a Quidditch natural like his brother Viktor.

** Most of the "Harry gets adopted" stories I know of are crossovers, involving everyone from Batman to Godzilla as an adoptive parent. Some that aren't crossovers are:

linkffn(Fate's Mistake by kb0). Harry gets adopted by the Diggory family.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny). Adopted by goblins.

linkffn(125850897). Adopted by a gurkha. Used the number because the title contains parentheses.

linkffn(Lucky Harry by pygus). Adopted by the Delacours.

linkffn(Marked by Fire and Thunder). Adopted by Odin (not a Marvel Universe cross).

linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus). Adopted by the Pinegrews.

linkffn(The Paths Diverge by Vaneria Potter). Baby Harry wanders from the doorstep, gets adopted.

linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089). Adopted by Amelia Bones.

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Odinson challenge. The daughters of Loki and Thor are stolen, hidden in mortal forms, and to avert Ragnarok, Odin locates the child who will find them in Godric's Hollow. With lightning and fire on his brow, can Harrir Odinson find the goddesses when he goes to Hogwarts? HP/HG/DG, with Hermione as Thrud and Daphne as Hela. Rating: safe, not sorry.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

*** Ok, "Gandalf vs Godzilla" was not what I thought I was linking to. The number doesn't even match. What I tried to link is a story called "Harry Potter Orphan (Jim Black Rashard)" by Ravengrad.
