So, what fics have been on hiatus for awhile and semi-recently restarted? I realised I've been mixing in my 'possibly going to update in the future but not soon' bookmarks folder with my 'I have now read the thing!' folder and it got me thinking how much of a thing that might be. Plus, it could be interesting to see what fics have updated that people haven't seen. :D


** Falling Star by GoldenLioness4 on fanfiction.net , it was left for a while but she has posted about ten chapters in the last two years, she hasn't posted in a wee while but I think she will. It was a really interesting story mainly following Sirius - the last two chapters I read I was crying ! Really realistic characters , however infuriating that can be at times haha! Xxx ( don't know if this is what you meant)

*** ...kind of what I meant? Sounds like she was on hiatus, then returned, then went on hiatus again, so she'd be what I meant when she comes back. :D

But hey, she did it before, so I suppose it could also count retroactively?

Either way, thanks!

***** We certainly do. No apologies necessary - like I said, it was pretty close to the request (and it looks good, so I can forgive the slight distance. Any fic I haven't read is a useful recommendation. :D).

** Not sure, whether linkao3(Animagus at War by White_Squirrel) qualifies.

*** I mean, if it was on hiatus for a while, then started again, then it certainly does! :)
