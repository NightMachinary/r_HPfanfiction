Preferably little to no romance, harry centric, and above 10k words. Idon't mind if they're unfinished if they're long enough since some of the best stuff I've ever read still are. Not sure if it's different enough? Drop it anyway and I'll check it out

I'll link some that I remember at the moment as examples. If nothing else, i hope you enjoy them

  Something happened in the graveyard that night. A spell no one predicted and an event set-off. Priori Incantatem turns out to be more than just seeing ghosts but a reversal of the spells all together. And those spells are decades old. (Harry time travels to the first war).

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

  When Harry received his 1st ever letter, he never expected for Aunt Petunia to tell him (with pinched lips) that he would get Dudley's 2nd bedroom, or inform him about other “freaks”, or reveal that his parents hadn't actually died in a car crash, or to bring him to a dingy-looking pub and ask the owner to ‘open the back for her nephew' while looking ill and refusing to enter ‘Diagon Alley' herself, instead thrusting two £50 notes in his hands, telling him 'their' bank would be able to change it for 'freak money', or for her to bring him to King's Cross on September 1st before snapping that, no, she didn't remember how to get onto the ‘ridiculous platform' so he best wait for other ‘freaks' to come show him.But Harry especially never expected the magical castle, with plans of her own (yes, Hogwarts is apparently a 'she') for those who came within her walls.Or the one where, after being introduced to the magic by a more perceptive Petunia (pointing out to Vernon that they would come if Harry wasn't sent to Hogwarts, so might as well get it over with before 'they' thought on actually coming to Privet Drive), Harry transported 20 years back in time for his 1st year at Hogwarts.

  Gen, AU. The moment that Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, a stranger appears---a Potter relative that Harry never knew he had. The stranger stands up for Harry, adopts him, and makes sure that no one can touch him. It's only later that Harry knows why. Time travel, twoshot. COMPLETE.

  It took Harry far longer than it should have to realise that he had been transported to a different world. Granted, he thought he had been merely transported back in time, which was the logical conclusion to come to when you were suddenly displaced during an incident with someone who wanted to re-invent the time-turner.Arriving in a different world with nothing but the clothes on his back leaves Harry scrambling to find ways to make money and survive this new world, and this time the trouble that he finds himself in might be entirely of his own devising.
