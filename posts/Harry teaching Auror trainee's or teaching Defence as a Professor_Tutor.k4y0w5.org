Just looking for any stories in that kind of whelm there.

Anyone can be the main character/any site/any length/old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if not that's fine.

NO Weasley Bashing. No Ron abusing Hermione, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune cliche.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc. (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).


** How about "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12231363/1/Playing-Defense][Playing Defense]]"? This is an EWE with a Harry/Daphne Greengrass pairing. Both are professors at Hogwarts. His daughter with Ginny is a 7th year at Hogwarts and is trying to find Harry a date to Ginny's upcoming wedding. Everyone is on amicable terms.

  Athena Potter, daughter of Harry and Ginny, wants nothing more than her parents to be happy. With Ginny marrying Oliver Wood, her father needs a date. Luckily for her Teddy Lupin is glad to help. Now to find the impossible; a date for her father, Professor Potter. An EWE story, not part of the Professor Muggle series.
