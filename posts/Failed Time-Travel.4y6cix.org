So, usually Harry goes to Voldemort or Marauder time (accident or not) and he kinda fits there perfectly - same age/year to communicate, so the plot goes on. Or Harry old enough to raise Tom Riddle. Is there some fics, where he ends in wrong year, like, too young or too old for Tom/Snape/Sirius etc.? Like, 12yo Harry and 17yo Tom, or 17yo Harry and 20yo Snape? Or something similar?

I prefer slash, but gen and good het is nice too.


** I don't remember the name of this story, but I'll describe it as best I can. Voldemort intends to help himself towards victory by sending Harry back in time. Don't ask me why, it has been long enough that I don't remember the train of thought. Somehow Draco gets caught up in all this.

V originally intends to send H and D back 200 years. Somehow he only sends them back 20 years instead, and hijinx ensue.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** I have a few Drarry recs that kinda fit your request and one Snarry.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/989537][Annus Mirabilis]] - This is a really interesting fic where Draco and Harry accidentally travel back to the first year of Hogwarts (like 1000AD). Even though only a few minutes pass back in the present, they live there for eight months and start a relationship. Their relationship development was just okay, but the historical details - especially the wand making - were really cool and unique. This was a twist on a time travel fic that I haven't seen done before. I really liked it!

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/245875/chapters/379160][Fast Forward Two Steps Back]] - This was a really unique time travel/romance fic! Usually time travel fics are told from the perspective of the time traveler, but this fic is from 27 year old Harry's POV as a professor at Hogwarts when 17 year old Draco comes from the past. I thought this was really cute and well written. I loved Harry's (mostly platonic) relationship with Neville too.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/936002/chapters/1822648][If Only I Could Turn Back Time]] - This is a HP/DM time travel fic where adult (early 20s?) Harry and Draco accidentally travel back in time years rather than days. They end up in 1991 - their first year at hogwarts - and have to figure out how to get back. The time travel parts were good and the author used the causal paradox really skillfully. However I am really neutral on this fic. The author desperately needed a Beta as well as less cliches. Almost every Harry Draco relationship cliche is in here - seeker games, oblivious Harry, bed sharing, fighting turning to kissing etc. Even the smut was so unbelievably unoriginal - I felt like I had already read every sex scene before in another Drarry.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756/chapters/4040178][Tempus]] - I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OC romance (the Draco in this is Canon Draco's great grandfather). In this, IIRC, Harry accidentally time travels back to 1920s era hogwarts. Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The description of the Slytherin common room was also unique and unusual. A definite favorite!

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox]] This is an incredibly popular time travel Snarry where a 23y/o Harry goes back to 1971 (snapes first year) and can't get back to his time. He becomes a hogwarts professor and a mentor for Snape. If you like Snarry, you might like this, but it just wasn't well done IMO - but tons of other people loved it which is why I am recommending it here.

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.
