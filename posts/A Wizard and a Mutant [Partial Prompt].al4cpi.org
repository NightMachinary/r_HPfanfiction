This is part of a crossover I've been writing (soooo slowly, I'm like half-ish the way through writing it) for most of the last year. Just thought I'd post part of it to see if anyone finds it interesting. It's mostly an interaction about something that goes on in the background to the main events before the effects come to prominence down the line. It's rather out of context so it probably won't make a lot of sense, but whatever. I'm just testing the waters a bit.

  To the passerby, the sight of two well-dressed men in the park at midday was quite normal. That they were playing a competitive of game of chess at a table would hardly bear noticing.

  The weather was uncharacteristically nice for the time of year. People - /normal/ people - were out and about simply enjoying the brief respite from the bitter winter air. Dogs were walked, children played nonsense games and the adults spoke endlessly about this inanity and that triviality. Powerless beings leading meaningless lives, signifying nothing. This was something both men agreed upon.

  But to the outsider, they looked as normal as could be, though more than one noticed the good looks the men possessed. Neither man noticed these second glances, however. Appearing to all the world to be engrossed as much in their game as in their continual conversation, they carried on. A rook captured here, a pawn there. Queens and bishops dashed around the bored cleverly, each side having layered many potential moves to spring on the other at a moment's misstep. Such would be an evident observation to any competent chess player observing the two and their dance of black and white.

  But to the detritus walking passed the two, it all looked quite normal, even boring.

  But to the distinctly /abnormal/ communities, this meeting would be seen as dangerous. To the criminal elements of these hidden societies in particular, well-versed as they were in the existence of the other, it was hailed in quiet as the mother of all powder kegs. The slightest spark could spell horrifying damage to their respective peoples. This had been long since foretold.

  Yet the two men took it in stride and spoke with familiarity to each other, not, perhaps, as friends but out of respect for the power of the other. Certainly for the ruthlessness they saw in the other in decades past.

  “Oh come now, Erik. Surely you must admit using a Magnus Smith trap was rather on the nose.”

  “Forgive a man his lapses, Tom. Given all I must do, a brief laugh is welcome respite from the dreariness.”

  “I suppose. But it dampens the sweetness of victory knowing you held back. It's rare I truly find myself on my back foot in any endeavor. I would have allowed it this once for novelty alone.”

  The two shared a slight laugh. One high and cold, the other deep and menacing. Neither reached their eyes, remaining ever locked in the other's.

  “In all seriousness Tom, this is rather far for me to come to play a game of chess and catch up,” the man called Erik said. He steepled his fingers together before his own face and stared harder into his old acquaintance's eyes. “For what purpose have you asked to meet me?”

  Seemingly unfazed by the domineering presence of his counterpart, the handsome brown-haired man answered easily. “To business, then. I am informed that you have been working subtly to free the largest concentration of your kind. Enslaved on an island known as Genosha, if my sources are to be believed?”

  “Somehow I'm not shocked you've learned about it. You always did have a way of slithering into the mind, tearing out what you needed and then some,” Erik mused.

  “Indeed. I must compliment the maker of that Disillusioned helmet you're wearing. The enchantment was work of a superb Occlumens, no doubt. You've rarely met my gaze so boldly before.”

  Not surprised the man knew, Erik continued, “Indeed. That aside, Genosha would both be the greatest source for forming a military force of my kind and a suitable fortress for us to operate from. But inside knowledge goes both way, Tom. My wife is rather well connected among your kind. I hear a mere adolescent is giving you fits, and has been for some time. A... curious state of affairs, you must admit.”

  Tom almost imperceptibly winced before schooling his features. “Indeed. Fate herself seeks to instill humility in me. It will be needed in what is to come after. The boy is prophesied to be lucky enough to escape me for a time. But I have my ways of winning in the end, as you well know.”

  Himself now irked, the metal chess pieces rattled slightly as Erik said, “The reason, Tom. Why am I here? Do not mock me or the consequences will be severe.”

  “Erik, you know I try to act only when necessary and only to the degree needed. As for the reason you're here... Those mechanical monstrosities are the main impediment to taking the island, yes?”

  “...What have you got and what are you asking for in exchange?”

  Smirking, Tom said, “For all the trouble went into obtaining these, you are fortunate that my demands are easily met by comparison.”

  From his vest pocket, Tom pulled out a photograph whose occupants were moving. The enchanted picture was placed before Erik, who couldn't help his intake of breath at the sight of them. A pair of enormous, gray, winged beasts with eyes like the devil, tearing through the skies with ferocious claws and torrents of flame. Erik knew these could considerably tip the scales in his favor. But...

  “How on Earth would I even use these, Tom? Powerful as they are, an uncontrollable beast is as much a liability as it is strength.”

  “Erik, you know I'm no fool,” he said, giving a sinister smile. “There's a reason this breed has /Ironbelly/ in its name. I believe you can work the rest out...”

  It was too good to be true, that much Erik knew. “And your demands?”

  “Well, should I fail in the coming year, I require you to ensure the safety of two people of my choosing while I am out of the picture. They will need passage to your sanctuary for a time, perhaps a few years, until they can safely leave. I don't trust you, nor anyone else for that matter. But,” Tom said, inclining his head to the man opposite him, “You are dogged in holding up your end of a bargain, always have been. My minions, while suitably brutal, are purely self-interested in the end and few are truly dependable. Loathe as I am to say it, I require your services should my plans be set back again. If my enemies knew about these two, they'd stop at nothing to end them.”

  Snorting, Erik said, “You're not the type to rely on anyone's word alone.”

  “But of course not.” Flicking his hand slightly, a decorated piece of parchment appeared out of thin air atop the now cleared chess board. “This is a binding magical contract. Once you sign this willingly, attempting to break your oath will be quite... unpleasant. Your wife over there - not as well hidden as well as she thinks - can confirm my words. But even if you're dependable, I must ensure your word survives my life.”

  Erik was reading over the contract and his eyes widened. The two he was to protect... “But you aren't- have you...?”

  “No, not yet. But plans are in motion already, we could proceed at any time, even should I perish despite my greatness.”

  “I never took you for the type, Tom.”

  “Even we immortals grow curious, Erik. I have my reasons.”

  Erik shrewdly countered, “If you're immortal then why all of this? It's almost like you know you'll lose, that you'll die. But I'm led to believe a true death is irreversible, magic or not?”

  Tom began laughing genuinely for the first time in an age. “Ah, the limitations of lesser wizards don't shackle me. It may well be true that magic cannot do absolutely anything, but there is one force in this world even greater than magic, one only the powerful can utilize. And should Fate again attempt to deny Lord Voldemort his destiny, nothing will stop him from turning Heaven and Earth to enforce his will.”

  “Then to the victor, the spoils. You are not the only one with an ambitious long game in mind.” Erik signed the contract after a moment's delay and the two bid each farewell, never again to see each other, should they be fortunate.

  The two communities each let out the breath they'd been holding. They could acknowledge the other's existence, but fraternizing had been taboo to both sides for ages. Even Voldemort abided by this rule.

  If only a certain scarhead hadn't been so irksome as to force his hand in the matter...

*** It's the end of the first chapter, but for those familiar with Marvel it shouldn't be hard to figure out who Riddle is talking to, hehe. ;)

Sadly, it's not out yet. I have the unfortunate tendency to start a story after planning it out, but then lose interest in it. The only solution I could come up with was to mostly finish writing out the entire story first, or at least most of it. It'll make progress... Eventually. 😭
