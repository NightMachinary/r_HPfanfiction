On another thread, a debate occured between myself and [[/u/iamthewookieenow][u/iamthewookieenow]], about what makes a story an AU.

We couldn't reach an agreement, but the question seemed to me interresting enough to deserve its own thread (sorryif the question has already been discussed here, which seem probable, but then, this is the nature of reddit that some questions will come up again and again...)

So, there was (obviously) two positions.

1. You're making an AU if the world in which your story takes place is different from canon. If you start from canon, then your story won't be AU no matter how much you diverge form canonical events.

2. You're making an AU if you diverge too far from canon, no matter if it's from the start, or if the divergences begin to happen in the middle of your story.

So, what do you folks think about it? Is it 1 or 2? Or are myself and my fellow redditor both wrong about it?


** Both are AUs. In case one, it's a completely new setting AU. These can also be called AR--alternate reality, to give focus to the fact that /everything/ is different as opposed to only certain aspects of the original universe. In case two, it's a canon-divergent AU.

**** There is such a thing as canon compliant fanfic that shows missing moments. In that case, I wouldn't consider it AU, since it could have already plausibly happened in canon with no alterations needed.

**** Now that we have a conclusion most stories are AU. Fanfiction started when not all the books were out, at that point you could write your own 6th year and not be AU because we didnt have a canon 6th year yet. But now that we know what happens that makes most stories AU.

** I think, if you're being very literal, both are AU. If you're using non-original characters, and changing canon events, then it's still /technically/ AU. It's an alternate set of events. However, on a practical level, that much isn't enough to be AU. Consider the three things that make up a "universe" for the intents of storytelling:

- Objects (Characters, places, etc.)
- Events (The timeline)
- Mechanics (How the world works)

I'd also add /theme/, but it overcomplicates matters here so we don't need to worry about it.

The problem is, "alternate universe" is not a complex enough term to describe all the possible levels of departure from the original story. No matter what, you're going to end up with some confusion.

So, what's AU then? Are the movies AU? They tell the same story in the same settings with the same characters. There are missing details and minor changes, but it's a different telling of the same story rather than a different story. What if I took the books, copied most of them word for word, but changed Hogwarts so that it was a massive magical ship rather than a castle? It's /definitely/ the same story, in most places it's outright plagiarism. Still, large portions of the imagery have now changed. You may not recognize it immediately, but it's not too different.

The answer then is AU is /not/ a literal term. It's used subjectively, but with a decent level of consistency. AU is almost always used to describe a story /heavily inspired by/ another. So, Harry fighting dragons called Death Eaters in the early medieval period with magic swords is AU. Cyberpunk cyborg Hermoine, hacker extraordinaire, is AU. These are AU because "Harry Potter" means a story set in a known position on the timeline, using similar events, and either canonical characters with some changes or original characters that don't seem terribly out of place. AU still takes some notes from the original series, but if you changed a few minor things around, would functionally be an entirely different story. Non-AU fics, such as Harry being raised by Sirius, are still largely based in canon, or extrapolation based on canon.

Personally, for your own stories, I'd err on the side of caution and call things AU if you're unsure. For instance, consider a story set in the 2010's or 2020's, during a transitional period where the walls between the muggle and magical world are breaking down. Such a story would likely star a number of new characters and take the story in an entirely new direction, even if it's still about Hogwarts students doing magic and facing challenges. The reason being, you're far enough from the original story's premises that it's still nearly unrecognizable as Harry Potter, even if it takes place in canon locations with some canon characters and uses the canon timeline as its foundation.

The only reason I'd do that is because Harry Potter fanfiction readers are particularly sensitive to changes from canon. In most fanfiction circles, you could reasonably describe a wildly different story from the original and /not/ call it AU if it were set in the near future (relative to the story) or about original characters and events. It wouldn't really be considered AU, but it'd still be understood as very different. That's not the case here, but if we're being honest, it doesn't matter all that much anyways. You'd have to be exceptionally anal to take exception to whatever the author considers "AU" or not.

** Authors sometimes use "AU" to mean "don't give me crud about how this isn't like canon". Like if I write a story in which a basilisk starts killing ghosts and people complain that CoS shows that basilisks can't kill ghosts, I can point at the AU tag in the description.

Sometimes people talk about specific types of AU, where they produce a new world and bring in characters from the original work. Coffeeshop and high school AUs are popular in some fandoms.

Definitions are not worth debating.

** I'll go with what [[/u/dysphere][u/dysphere]] said, too: if you have a fic that does not do anything that voids canon compliance, then it is not AU unless you as the author specifically say that it is, and if it does void canon compliance then it is AU.

The thing with AU and with some people getting confused over it is that, truly, all fanfiction that is not canon compliant is AU, but most people only mark AU when the degree of divergence from canon is high enough. Basically, you could count four degrees of divergence from canon: canon compliant (so no divergence), different details (usually not marked), different basics (usually marked as “AU”), different world (sometimes marked as “AU”, sometimes as “AR”); and really, other than the first one they all are AU.

Of course, the reason why people tend to only mark the last two as AU is, in the end, fairly simple: the second one can be seen as “mostly canon” even though it too is AU, which means that people are using the normally nigh-meaningless tag (because, you know, if it's not canon compliant then it's automatically AU) to mark stories that are too far off.

So really, answer 1 is according to use---stories that start from a canon position and then deviate due to some details are the second category, and thus one for which people do not use the term---whereas answer 2 is according to the definition---because lack of canon compliance equals AU---so they are both right depending on how you look at it.

** Hmmm.

In my opinion, I'd say that to /not/ be an AU, a fic must be as canon-compliant as possible at the time it was written. So like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][The Psychic Serpent]] isn't AU, even if it clashes with books 5, 6, and 7, because those books hadn't been written yet. However, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], which diverges from canon at the very end of CoS, /is/ AU, because the author knowingly wrote it to contradict canon. Any missing moments fics, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot][Six Foot of Ginger Idiot]], aren't AU because they are as canon as is possible. Similarly, any post-canon works, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], are AU as long as they obey known canon. Works that have minimal relation to the canon plot, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7217938/1/Etc-Etc-and-Life-Goes-On][Etc Etc and Life Goes On]], tend to also be canon-compliant, and thus not AU.

Interestingly enough, this means that, say, a Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover doesn't need to be an AU, because there is no evidence that they don't occur in the same world. Shipping James/Pettigrew is totally canonically possible (if not exactly /plausible/, whereas to ship like Snape and Ron, it would almost have to be an AU, because we would've noticed if they had been hooking up on the sly (but not necessarily! the idea of a wacky relationship like that fitting in around canon fascinates me, and I wish more authors would try to write this kind of ship without using AU as a crutch.)

I'd say in modern fen parlance, however, AU is generally just used to mean your first point, although sometimes the second. The second, when mentioned by a specific name, is typically called "canon divergent". The first, as mentioned in other comments, is also sometimes called "alternate reality".

Anyway, that's my answer! I know this thread is kinda already saturated with answers, but I just wanted to flesh out that not all fics have to be AU, and those that aren't tend to be very interesting on account on having to deal with such strict constraints (and also tend to be better-written on account of having to work together with canon personalities).

i.e. you can write a Harmony fic AU or not AU. You can write a post-hogwarts fic AU or not AU. If you want Bellatrix and Charlie Weasley to be hooking up, it'll be hard to make it canon-compliant, but it still doesn't have to be AU. If you want Bellatrix and /Neville/ to be hooking up, it's * barely possible* for it to not be AU. If you want Harry to be raised by goblins, that necessarily has to be AU. Etc...

Hope that's helpful-- or interesting, at least!--Merely saw that you wrote:

** I always understood it to work like this:

Non-AU could be canon. There're no conflicts (e.g. Harry isn't actually Sirius' child), or those that are there are explained away (e.g. Harry didn't realise it the first time around, but Umbridge was secretly two house-elves stood on each others' shoulders all along). If J.K. Rowling released them, it wouldn't overwrite other parts of canon. Interestingly enough, continuation and time-travel stories are the types that fit this category best.

'Minor' or 'weak' AU, or 'single point of divergence' stories, have very few changes from canon but are definitely Alternate Universes. There's no canon timeline they could fit into. Usually, these are the stories whose starting points are 'What if... Harry had quadruplet brothers & sisters/Hermione was secretly evil/Snape looked like Alan Rickman and was also a gay paedophile?'

'Strong' AU are completely different settings, where there are many differences to canon. Usually, the way to recognise these stories is to look at whether you can safely assume anything not explicitly changed is the same as canon. They're also (imo) the most interesting and varied e.g. linkffn(Wit of the Raven; Patron by Starfox; Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) all fall under this category. In each story, the default approach is that canon might be true, or might not, rather than that unless the author mentions it's been changed it's true.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Attractor Field

An Attractor Field is a cluster of world lines that lead to a single converging point. While each strand may be slightly different, they're ultimately part of the same great structure and yield the same end result.

in this case the alpha world line 0 to 0.999 will lead to voldemort death, beta world line 1 to 1.999 will lead to voldemort winning. so any fanfic can be said to part of the same cluster world of harry potter.

so by this term anything in fanfiction can be considered AU.
