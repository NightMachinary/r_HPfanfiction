I am trying to find a story where Harry is in high school, friends with Ron and Hermionie still. However, his parents aren't Lily and James, he somehow is on his own in his own house. While searching for roommates, he discovers college students James who is with Lily, Sirius who is with Severus, and Remus. There is an A/B/O element as it turns out Harry is an omega I believe and Remus is his Alpha/mate. Both Harry and Remus had issues with cutting. That is all I can remember, so if anyone could help, I would appreciate it! Thank you!


** This sounds interesting. Did you find it? If so,can you tell me?
