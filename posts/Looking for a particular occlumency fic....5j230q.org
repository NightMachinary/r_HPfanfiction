I'm looking for a particular slightly-occlumency-centric fic (it might be two of them, but I think it's just one) where (1) Harry's mind is organised as a town, and his memories are, at one point at least, assigned to different coloured candies in a candy shop based on their emotional content, with fake memories in the town library to trick the likes of Snape and (2) there's a point in the story where Snape attacks Harry's mind, and Harry traps him there, visiting various tortures upon him, including repeatedly feeding him to a mental construct of either the Rancor or Sarlacc (can't remember which).

I know that the fic(s) exist, and I remember getting good laugh out of it(/them), but I can't for the life of me remember what it(/they) was(/were), and I can't find it(/them) via google. I hope I'm asking in the right place... Please help?


** I found it (with some help from the DLP forums)... it was "Searching for the Power" by GinnyMyLove.
