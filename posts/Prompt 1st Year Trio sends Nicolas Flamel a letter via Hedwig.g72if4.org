Mr. Flamel,

My friends and I have determined that Professor Snape is working for Voldemort and intends to steal, well, we're not really sure what IT is. But we know IT's yours and seems really important. I'm giving this letter to my owl Hedwig, hopefully she can find you so you can take appropriate action.

Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley


** Albus,

I received the attached letter from some of your students. Is everything under control?

Nicolas

--------------

Nicolas,

All according to plan, yes. Thank you for the heads up though. My students always find ways to surprise me.

*** Messrs Potter, Weasley, Miss Granger

Thank you for your letter. Your Headmaster assures me everything is under control, but I still thank you for your concern.

Nicolas Flamel

Mr. Flamel

We're sorry to bother you again, but Professor Quirell, who was possessed by Voldemort's ghost, went after your Stone, and he almost managed to get it. Harry took it first, and we managed to swipe it from him before the Headmaster took him away to the Hospital Wing.

Professor Dumbledore is searching for it, and has told us it must be destroyed now that Voldemort is searching for it. Do you want it back or should we give it to Professor Dumbledore to be destroyed?

Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger

** Dear Mr Flamel

Motherfucking Snape is trying to steal your motherfucking stone of motherfucking Immortality. We suggest you do something about it, as we want the fucker to fucking die soon in order that we can have a potions teacher that knows their shit instead of behaving like a shit-eating dog.

From Ronald Bilius Weasley

P.S My brother is making an expiremental auto-erotic-asphyxiation potion to poison Snape with. Attached is the formula. Can you help?

‚Äã

Dear Mr Weasley

Dear fucking God. No-one has sworn at me in a long fucking time, and back then, the swear-words were different. Tell your brothers to just feed him unicorn blood, as you don't get cursed for killing the unicorn, just drinking it's blood.

Your's truly,

Flamel.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
