[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] see him raised by Goblins. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12246163/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Lord][Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord]] sees him more or less raised by House Elves. I wonder if there are any others out there worth reading? Thanks in advance :)

  Blue Magic

Oh man, as a Mass Effect and Liara fan I really love the concept of this fic, but it gets worse and worse with each chapter. Not surprised that it's (probably) abandoned. In particular after Harry arrives at Hogwarts it seems like 90% pointless ramblings about Biotics, mansions and class schedules.

The "completely-useless-as-Head-of-House" characterization of McGonagall is refreshing though.
