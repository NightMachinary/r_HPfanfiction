*Chapter 2: The Train*

Early in the morning, Barry and Bagrat got dressed and left the rickety, two-star submersible they had stayed the night before. As they walked out the door, Bagrat asked Barry a question.

"Er... ya wouldn't, perchance, tell Fumbledork abou' las' night's incident, now would ya'?" Bagrat squeeked.

"What's a Fumbledork? Is it edible?" asked Barry. "Blimey!" exclaimed Bagrat, "Yer don't know who Fumbledork is?! Barry, he's the most infamous, most lucrative wizard of all!" "Darn! No food..." said Barry deppresingly. Barry then found a light bulb. "Yay! Food!" he began devouring it (wow! that's "shockingly" refreshing!). They approached Bagrat's broom. Barry looked up at Bagrat, exposing bloody lips and bleeding gums.

"Uh... Bagrat... are the hydrolics neccessary?" questioned Barry. Bagrat gave an enormous grin and laughed semi-maniacly.

An hour, ten barfbags, and a hurt bottom later, Barry began to wonder where he was going. "Er, Bagrat? (bletch!) where is it we're going?" he asked. "To London!" squeeked Bagrat. "London? Why?" "Ta buy yer school supplies, o' course!" "Can we find all of that stuff in London?" "Sure! Jus' Follow yer nose!"

At that moment, a flock of pigeons collided into Bagrat's broom. "Whoa!" yelled Barry, "Chicken!" Barry began snatching the pigeons out of the air and eating them. The broom began to tilt dangerously. "Barry! Leave them pigeons alo-!" A pigeon had hit him in the head. "Ow! My eye! My eye!" Bagrat, suddenly, fell off the broom.

"AAAAAAGGGHH!!!" he screamed as he plummeted to the ground. Barry looked down to Bagrat. "That looks fun!" Barry said. He decided to fall, too.

"WWWHHEEEEE!!!" he yelled. "MOOOOO!!!" bellowed a cow as Bagrat smashed it to mush. Barry was still yelling when he hit the grass covered ground with a solid THUD. "Ouchies! He yelled, "I guess it wasn't that fun..." "Darnit, Barry! Do somthin' abou' tha' eatin' disorder!" Bagrat stood up. He had a swollen black eye, a fractured right hand, and a limp. He wobbled up to where Barry was, and lifted him up. Barry's glasses were shattered, his face a bit squashed, and the fingers of his left hand stretched a bit too far backwards to be comfortable. As Barry got up, immediatly he ran over to the cow, which Bagrat had squished. "Mmmm... Ground beef!"

After walking around thirty minutes, Barry and Bagrat finally reached London. "Here we are, Barry!" Bagrat said as he pointed to a shop that had, posted in big letters:

*/The Spilt Cauldron/ GUARANTEED TO SPILL YOUR TEA, OR YOU'LL PAY!*

It looked old and uninhabited. The windows (some shattered like my dreams...) needed a cleaning. The grime, on the windows, looked alive. (of course Barry didn't mind this, in fact, he found it very delicious!) Barry and Bagrat entered the store. Once in, Barry found out that the shop wasn't a shop, but sort of a bar. The bartender, who was also the owner, had several teeth missing. He, also, had bushy, ragedy hair, and wore robes the color of blue. Everybody else in the bar seemed to be wearing robes also. This seemed a little weird for Barry. "Aye, Bagrat!" exclaimed the bartender, "The usual, I presume?" "No thanks, Gliddy!" squeeked Bagrat in reply, "I'm on official Pigwarts business!" Bagrat meant to put a hand on Barry's head, but he accidently smacked him. "Ow!" said Barry. The bartender looked astonished, not because of the head smack Bagrat had given Barry, but because of another reason... "My gosh... this is... this is... this is him..." he mumbled incoherently, "This is... this is Barry Cotter!" Everyone looked up from their tables and stared at him. "Uh..." he mumbled, "S'up?" "GET HIM!!!" Someone yelled. "Run Barry! Follow me!" Bagrat squealed.

A few minutes later, they sat huddled in an alleyway as a large mob ran by. "Sorry abou' tha' Barry..." "But why'd they attack me...?" he asked. "You see, back when you vanquished Lord Moldybutt, the people were forced to pay extra taxes to pay for recent loss in ministry money due to Moldybutt... when he was still in power, they paid even less. He was an evil, purple, beast, but heck! He saved them money! UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!!! ...which reminds me..." he began choking Barry, "I ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT, YOU WORTHLESS PIECE O' HORSEFLESH!!!" beep! beep! beep! "Hold on, Barry. I gotta answer my pager... Hullo! Proffesor Fumbledork! Don't kill Barry? Awwww! Oh well! if you insist... see ya, Bulbus! Bye!" (ok... so that's a phone and not a pager... get over it!)

After the mob thinned, they set off to get supplies. "I still need a crockpot and a magic stick..." Barry muttered. "I'll get yer pot, you go gets yer stick!" squeaked Bagrat.

"Have a stick!!!" screamed the cashier as he entered. He threw a stick and hit Barry in the eye. "MY EYE!!!" he screeched, running into the street where he was hit by a bus. "Hey! You dented my bus!" yelled the driver. He then commenced to back over Barry a few more times before driving away. A few minutes later, Bagrat appeared. "Hope yah didn' have any trouble gettin' yer stick!" "Nah..." said Barry rubbing his cuts and abrasions. "I got yer a present!" he pulled out a cage with a single pigeon inside. "Thanks! I'm hungry!" "NO BARRY! GET THA' OUTTA YER MOUTH!" he yelled pulling it out of Barry's mouth. "It's a pet! Not food!" "awww..." he sighed. "Candy!" Barry said upon seeing a blue rock. "Must be one of those jawbreakers I've heard so much about..." he said crunching on the gravel. Bagrat shook his head in dismay. "An' I thought I was dumb..." he mumbled. "WHAT WAS THAT?!" "Er... I said... look at that bum!" Bagrat pointed at a drunk man.

An hour and a wet mid-section later, Barry was heading for platform 9. "Uh... sir?" asked Barry, "Where can I find platform 9?" "Uh... platform 9?!" "Yeah, thimble brain! Where's it at?!" "This is the Toy Train Station, not the train station! That's next door!" "Crap!!!" yelled Barry as he ran to the next building. He wondered what sort of crazy way the wizards kept the gruggles, non magic folk, out of platform 9. Visions of going through walls were rushing through Barry's mind as he passed platform 8. "WHAT?!" he exclaimed. Platform 9 was the same as every other platform, the only difference was a small, battered, wooden sign that read: "NO GRUGGLES! WIZARDS ONLY!" Barry smacked his head in disbelief.Suddenly, a rat ran by. "Yay!" he exclaimed, stuffing it in his mouth. It was a fat, hard to swallow rat. A boy came running, flailing his arms. "Flabbers!!!" he screeched, yanking Barry's snack away. "Oh!" he replied, "Sorry... I hope we can just forget about this incident and become friends..." "What incident?" said the boy, "Hi! I'm Con Sleasly!" They shook hands and walked toward the train. "Conald!" a woman ran up and squeezed Con in her grip. She was morbidly obese and extremely ugly. "Woops," she said as Con fainted in her tight grip, "Be a dear and drag his body onto the train please!" "Yes'm." replied Barry.

Con, a sort of lanky child, had orange brown-speckled hair, a freckled face, and a smell that could gag a goat. They found a seat towards the back of the train and sat down. When Con woke up from his daze, he looked up at Barry in shock.

"Wow! You're Barry Cotter!" he exclaimed.

"How'd you know? Was it the scar?"

"Scar? What scar?" he asked dully, "It says right there on your nametag." he pointed at Barry's shirt. Just then, the door slid open and a plump woman asked,

"Anything off the trolly, dears?"

Barry started twitching and convulsing...

"FOOD!!!" he cried, lunging at the lady. "My preciousss..." he hissed, snatching at the food.

"AAAAEEEEIIII!!!" she screeched.

She ran and jumped out the backdoor of the train and rolled down a hill into a lake.

"What's her problem...?" remarked Barry, stuffing chocolate in his mouth.

"I guess we'll never know..." Con pointed out his window. A pack of Indians had tied her up and was dragging her away while chanting ominously.

"I know a spell that can turn Flabbers green!" said Con, pulling out his magic stick, "Ahem... Snail slime and leftover spleen, turn this stupid fat rat green!" Flabbers squeaked loudly and killed over dead.

"Flabbers!!!" Con started sobbing. The door opened again. This time it was someone without food.

"Hi... I'm Hermi-1... have either of you seen a frog? A boy named 'Smeville' lost one..."

Barry and Con looked at each other, as they heard the faint screams of a woman. "No." replied Barry and Con in unison.

"Well, no matter, like I said before, I'm Hermi-1 Ranger!" Said Hermi-1, who had bushy, brown hair, large front teeth, and sort of a plump body.

"Hello, I'm Con Sleasly!" Con was going to get up and shake Hermi-1's hand, but, while he was getting up, he slipped, which made his hand smack Barry, which made Barry stand up and walk incoherently.

"Ow!" yelled Barry.

"Sorry!" said Con.

"Let me help!" said Hermi-1. She took out her magic stick, as she ran towards them, but, suddenly, tripped on Con's foot.

"Oh!" said Hermi-1 as she fell. Suddenly, a green light shot from her magic stick. It struck Barry in the mid-section.

"OW!" said Barry as he stumbled and fell out the window. "AAAAGH!!" he screamed.

"BARRY!!!" screamed Con. Con and Hermi-1 heard a loud "SPLASH!" from below. From far off, where the Indians were, came a man with long locks of hair and the palest skin of any man seen. He ran towards the area of where Barry landed. When he reached Barry, a loud scream could be heard.

"NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!" yelled Barry, "MICHAEL JACKSON'S GOT ME!!!"

As Con and Hermi-1 heard this, they both looked at each other. "Uh-oh...." they both said. Screeches could be heard and, also, maniacal laughter.

Barry was sitting by Con with bandages around his waist. Con was looking at his feet. Hermi-1 was playing with her magic stick.

"I'm sorry, Barry." she said, "I didn't mean t-." because she was fiddling with her magic stick, it fell and shot a sparkling blue light at Barry. Barry screamed and fell out the window. From a distance he could hear a strange noise coming towards him, "...Thriller...!" Barry jumped up and chased after the train. Michael Jackson was gaining on him. He was almost upon him. Barry lunged forward and clamored through the window. He sighed as he watched Michael Jackson moon walk away.

"Sorry, Barry... If it helps, I'll jump out the window!" she said, moving towards the window.

"No!" but it was too late.

Jackson was coming fast, but he suddenly stopped in mid-skip.

"Giiiiiirl!!!" he shrieked, pointing at Hermi-1.

He turned and skipped away at a sound breaking pace.

"Wow!" said Barry. "We're almost to chapter three!"
