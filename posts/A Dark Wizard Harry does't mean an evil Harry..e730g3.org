Hey guys, reccently i've readed the fics:Cage and KeyA cadmean victoryAnd both of them, more in Cage and Key, i saw a Harry very interested in the dark arts and in cage and Key he acctually enjoyed practicing u/ i looked for more fics with the same vibe, but most of them are just an evil psycho Harry.Cage and Key have a very interesting tematic, where Harry practices the dark arts to become stronger, but he is the normal Harry brave, normal and awkward and dense near girls.He acctually have a good relationship with Dumbledore even with the old goat knowing about his dark practices, in a nutshell, Dumbledore gives advices to Harry about his practices and to don't let the arts corrupt him.One of the best things of this Fic was that against foes that treathen his loved ones, Harry became very ruthless, capable of torturing Nott in cold blood using bone breaking curses to destroy Nott's arms when he was already defeated.He is cold blooded when he needs to be but he is't the psycho that mos dark Harry fics make him.A cadmean victory was almost the same, but in there Harry was more slytherin than gryffindor, so he was very selfish about the ones he wanted to protect, because he was't noble.But my point is more demonstrated in Cage and Key, a noble and good Harry that has a very good relationship with Dumbledore (They have ups and downs) that uses dark magic but it's not evil but can be ruthless when he needs.\\
So yeah, a Dark wizard does't mean a evil wizard, Severus Snape is a good example of this (Even if he's not good also).


** Oh, I think this is the consensus of this sub. Based on our surveys, this sub likes dark Harry, but hates evil Harry.

The canon is more about intention anyway. For example, it's ok for Snape to use Avada Kedavra to euthanize Dumbledore, but it's cold blooded murder when Voldemort confunded a House-Elf to poison her master.

Near the end, good guys are throwing around Unforgivables like confetti too, but the Books never consider them dark Wizards.

--------------

I think too many fic authors are influenced by Star Wars. JKR also has a different view about what character traits are dangerous. For example, Star Wars sees anger as a key component of the dark side, whereas Harry Potter repeatedly praises angry or emotional responses from the good guys, especially Hermione and Ginny. Their violent outbursts against their enemies' (and even friends') transgressions are generally seen as awesome moments by the fandom.

*** I agree with you, star wars has a very strong duality, an excample is that we never see an dark side user being good, unlike HP where we see dark wizards doing good deeds.\\
The thing is not just trowing unforgivables arround just like in the end of DH, but a really dark wizard character that is't evil, in Cage and Key, Harry leard very dark magic that is't just for self defense os necessity but because he really enjoys learning about it, just like his eagerness to try fiedfyre in the fic.

** I don't think it was explicitly stated in the books what dark magic is. My "feel" throughout reading them was that it is actually supposed to be evil, but there are plenty arguments to be made that even unforgivables can be used for good.

However, when people in canon were talking about "dark wizards", they certainly meant evil people: Grindelwald, Voldemort, Herpo the Foul, Bellatrix, Lucius. Not nice people who use dark magic for good, and are unfairly stigmatized. Further, good guys using dark magic (aurors; the order and Harry in the war) didn't get called dark wizards. There isn't a dark wizard division in the auror corps to act as a SWAT team or special forces, which there would be, if "dark wizard" just meant person specializing in dark magic. That said, there's the counter argument that this is from Harry's POV, maybe from a Slytherin's POV the picture would look different.

Ultimately, this gives people enough leeway to write dark magic and dark wizards in a facfic however they want. There are plenty of good fanfics where dark doesn't mean evil, my favorite is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/out-of-the-night-by-raining-ink-t.14151/][Out of the Night]]. There are also bad ones, where the "dark, but not evil Harry" is is actually a pretty douchebagy purebood supremacist who "righteously" takes down anyone who disagrees with him. There are also fics that make dark magic explicitly evil, like it gives you enjoyment for torturing people - which, I'd say, is a pretty convincing reason to ban it (linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) was an example of this, I think).

** I get what you're saying, but the: Dark!Harry not Evil!Harry trope is getting old in fanfiction.

There are a lot of examples of that, just read any indy!Harry story and they usually have the good guys spew unforgivables like candy. One of the best stories that was opposite to that trope was On the Way to Greatness. Which had Harry who was angry, jaded and dabbled in dark magic, but was not Evil. Just morally dubious. Most of the stories in the Dark not Evil genre treat Dark magic as a tool with no downsides, just powerful magic. If that was the case, everyone would use them. The thing about Dark Magic in canon is that you have to mean it. You have to want to kill, torture, dominate.

That's basically the definition of evil.

Now, I'm not saying that it can't be used for good. There are plenty of examples in history and even in HP canon of evil deeds accomplishing a good goal. But let's not kid ourselves, if we devolve the HP fantasy world into reality of moral choices in warfare, we are bound to be faced with evil deeds perpetrated by "good" men. That's just the reality of it. Hiding from it, like many fanfiction writers want to is disingenuous to me.

Good example here is What We're Fighting For by zugrian. It's an awesome fic, but Harry progressively becomes more unstable, willing to kill and morally ambiguous as the story progresses. I think the author is even aware of it as the second to last chapter shows.

Do not be afraid of your characters crossing the moral event horizon. It might make them more human.

*** "You need to mean it" is /specifically/ for Unforgivable Curses and as Dark Magic, according to JKR, includes jinxes, hexes, and all those minor curses Harry teaches the DA, a large part of it /is/ magic without consequence.

Snape is not a good person, but "You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation" suggests that using Dark magic for good or moral reasons means it won't have consequences. That probably goes for all magic, though, as Draco bleeding out on the floor could have been achieved with the Severing Charm.

**** As to Dark Magic being jinxes, hexes and anything offensive. I don't buy it. JKR is very ambiguous about it. George Weasley lost an ear and Moody was scarred by Dark Magic. Which means it cannot be reversed. Yet Snape reversed the curse on Draco (it could be because he invented it or was just that skilled) and as you said Dark Magic can easily reversed with a counter-spell. So I'll take anything from canon on that front with a grain of salt.

As to Unforgivables. Is it only for them? I'm not sure, the canon evidence is fragmented. Some spells require the intent component others don't as the plot requires. But I like to think they do require at least some level of malice, ro they wouldn't work. You can't say Harry didn't want to actually hurt Draco, who was about to use the Torture Curse on him.

--- Friedrich Nietzsche

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends will be even less forgiving.

I think if you want to write realistic, but not fairytale characters, pretty much every good guy who went through Year 7 and the Final Battle will have to commit at least a few atrocities of their own. Some would recover, some would not.

**** Pretty much. But they would not be "Dark not Evil" as most fanfiction writers understand the term.

War makes people into monsters. That's the reality of it. If you want to be a soldier in a war, you have to kill, mutilate, possibly rape. Soldiers are not angels and they never will be.

Even the limited war in the wizarding war has it's share of terrible things happening. People will be traumatized by it, no doubt. My only issue is how the fanfiction authors deal with. Usually they don't. Everything is fine and dandy between the Imperius Curse (stripping a person of their will) or Torture Curse (torturing them with the intent to do it) or the Killing Curse (you just want the other person to DIE).

Dark magic is Evil, with a capital E. No way around it. But it can be used to do good, just like a rifle or an artillery shell.

P.S. The only other problem, is that it's impersonal to fire a rifle. You can become detached. It's part of your training. You can never be detached from casting a curse in the Wizarding World. Remember: You have to mean it.

Kill, yes. Obviously.

Mutilate, perhaps. If it's truly necessary - for instance, a being as resistant to magic as a troll or giant, but imperioused or confounded into fighting the good guys; no stunner works, so you've gotta disable him.

Rape? Never. Never, never, never, never. you don't have to rape, EVER. I don't know why you say this, but there's no situation in which rape is the correct or preferred solution.

Interrogation, torture, breaking their pride/will? There are far more effective means to do that. Any other "reasons" cannot be justified in any way.

**** It's the point we're making. At least I am.

Most fanfiction authors, the vast majority, simplify the choices and morality of their characters to appeal to the largest audience and/or to satisfy their own simplistic view of the world.

The actual psychology of people in war is incredibly complex and while I don't expect the levels of All Is Quiet on the Western Front, at least some acknowledgement of the realities of killing someone would be appreciated. Just basic empathy.

But no. Most "Evil Harry" stories are torture fests and affirmation of evil is good morality. Similarly most "Dark Harry" stories gloss over the fact that he kills people just because he wants to with no effects on his psyche (this is usually coupled with Dumbledore objecting to people dying for no reason at all).
