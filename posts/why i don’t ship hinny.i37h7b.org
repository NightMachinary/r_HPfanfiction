  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

*** M8, I mean no disrespect, but the whole point of that scene was that Ginny understood that Harry wouldn't be happy unless he was fighting Voldemort. It isn't hero worship, in the same way that spouses of miltary personnel or certain police officers aren't loving their SOs because they're heroes, but love their spouses enough to know they won't be happy unless they are helping people, and admire them for that trait.

To summarize, Ginny isn't saying she loves him because he's a hero. She's saying she loves him because of the traits that make him who he is, and he is a hero.

***** That simply isn't true. Her behavior changed massively from book 2-book 6. The fact is, she isn't encapsulated in a case of hero worship. A proof we have for this is when Harry dies at the end of book 7. We hear her scream what I believe Harry called a soul-wrenching "Nooo!" If you've a case of hero worship, you're in shocked silence at the fact your hero isn't there to save you, like most were in that scene. If you love someone, all you feel is pain for that loss, not "How do we win now?" This is one example of many.
