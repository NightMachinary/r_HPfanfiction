For reasons I can't remember, Ginny and others learn Occlumency from Harry. And are, in the process, totally or partially naked. Ron doesn't want to learn. Hermione, I think, is partly on.


** I think it is probably linkffn(5790760). Very much an 18+ fic, but does have emotional investment in too

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

*** That's quite possible. According to Calibre, I dropped the story after 35 chapters. So I have to look at it again. Thanks for the quick answer.
