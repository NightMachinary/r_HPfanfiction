I'm looking for a faniction where Harry travels to the past and raises a baby. Im 90% sure it is the horcrux as a baby. But it could be Teddy, I'm not positive. He raises it and I'm pretty sure, again not positive because it has been a while, that he is raising it in the Marauder's era because I think Regulus makes an appearance. I'm sorry it has been a while, any help would be appreciative.
