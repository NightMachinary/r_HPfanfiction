This is my first one-shot. I was inspired to write about Lily and James so I took a break from writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12271054/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Perfectly-Normal-Life][Harry Potter and the Perfectly Normal Life]] and wrote this little story. It could be canon. It sits in the main universe.

It's a smut at the end, but the majority of it is NOT. I give warning in the author's note as to where to stop should you not want to read that part.

Give me your thoughts and let me know if you'd maybe like a sequel.
