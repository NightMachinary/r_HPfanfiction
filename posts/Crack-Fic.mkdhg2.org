**** I don't remember the name of it. I think it was an unfinished time travel fic. It wasn't a drug kingpin kind of story it was just a little side plot that happened

** Book name: Business by esama

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]].

Summary: The Dursleys didn't raise Harry Potter to be a very good boy. Mildest of fusions with Sherlock Holmes.

Harry gets inspired by James Moriarty from the Sherlock series. The book doesn't use any characters from Sherlock Holmes series except the names.
