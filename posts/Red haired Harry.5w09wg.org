It's been requested before, but that was some time ago and there was no suggestions back then (though a few fantastic drabbles in the comments). So has anyone found anything where Harry inherited his mother's hair colour, or looks more like her her than like James? Fun scene suggestions were Draco mistaking him for a Weasley when they first meet, and Snape reacting to him differently


** I mean Harry already has Voldemort's horcrux in his head, there's no reason to write him as /completely/ soulless.

I'm just as interested as everyone else. Maybe if there isn't any 'Harry has red hair and is mistaken for a Weasley' fanfiction already, we should write it.

*** Damn Dumbledore, you're back at it again with the Lily/Snape wish-fulfillment of the authors. If Dumbledore was actually evil, he would have glamoured Harry to look more like Lily, just so Snape would be tortured everytime he had to grade Harry's work, or look over his papers. The words of "Get away from me, you Mudblood" constantly etched into his mind. While I do dislike Snape a lot, because he was a weak-willed person that easily fell for the promise of power, and wasn't willing to make changes to get what he wanted (still had greasy hair, an obsession with the 'Dark Arts', and an insufferable personality that let its true colours shine easily) I think he deserved no one. Even his last wish was selfish, "Look into the eyes of a dying man and watch as the life is snuffed out from his eyes, just so he can see something that he will never have." Wait... yeah, he does deserve that kind of torture for wanting a child dead rather than a crush that never reciprocated his feelings. He's a fucking monster.

***** Harry already looked a lot like Tom Riddle, and maybe that was why Snape himself disliked the Dark Lord. A lot of Purebloods look alike, because they are very much related, I wouldn't be surprised if Potter was a minor line of Slytherins.

** I know some fem!harry's with red hair and I know there are some Indy!Harry's with red hair. Even though I know quite a few fem!harry fics that follow this idea, it doesn't affect the plot as much as the genderswap. In Indy!Harry stories the overall power ups Harry gets are more plot central. It would be nice for this one idea to be the main part of the FF.
