It can range from anything between muggle scientists who recently found out about magic, to unspeakables wanting to discover the secret behind the boy who lived. I don't mind. I'm a sucker for this kind of storyline. Oh, and preferably no slash--- but if the only fics you have are slash, go ahead. Thanks!


** There was a long (100k+ words) incomplete story I read like a decade ago, where Harry saves a little girl from experimentation and they learn about yet another little girl that is kept captive somewhere in Russia (I think) and they set out to rescue her. Harry is around 11-12 and the girls around 10. It was very well written and full of tension, gore and action. The girls had super-creepy powers (like telekinesis, biokinesis, tentacles, psychic manipulation etc) but they were loyal to Harry (and he to them). Harry had his vanilla magic but he had learned to wield it quite fearsomely. After the second girl was rescued they went to France and found sanctuary with Apolline Delacour. The story was abandoned at that point.

Unfortunately I don't remember the title or author, if anyone has any clue pls provide.

More than just Harry, Hermione and Dean are there as well. However they don't escape because the foster home they're at is a great place to be, minus the occasional bully, and they all have good relationships with the parental figures.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Harry Potter had been an unwanted freak in the Dursley home, so when an opportunity arises for them to be rid of him, is it any wonder they jump on it? Harry finds himself trapped and experimented on like a lab rat by those that wield the strange power he's come to suppress. When he finally escapes, he carries with him a secret that must be kept so, lest he find himself shown as the freak he had always been told he was.[Updates every 2 weeks!]

  One day, Harry J Potter made a wish in front of the mirror of Erised. One day, Bruce Banner woke up naked in a green-eyed man's aparment. One day, Harry introduced himself with his father's name to a strange man he found naked, green, and angry on the street. One day, SHIELD discovered human magic... and tried to make weapons from it. And the world is never the same.
