Looking for stories revolving around Hermione where is powerful or really badass. No makeover stories. No rape in the stories either. If Hermione is looking for Revenge rec to me. I don't care what pairing it is as long as it is not Ron, Viktor or OC paired with Hermione. If it's a Harmony story please make sure it doesnt have superpowered Harry or Harry suddenly so taking center stage. Same goes for any Dramione stories. Any vindictive, manipulative Hermione stories are welcomed. Just dont rec any fic that are to dark. Please make sure they are long and well written. Thanks.

PS femslash and slash are accepted but no genderbends please.


** Firstly, /are/ there any readable Krumione fics that actually feature a badass Hermione? They have the makings for one heck of a power couple, and it could be an interesting way to bring out Hermione's more cosmopolitan side. Most of the ones I've seen are these elaborate portrayals of Eastern European courtship (based in Regency Romance) with Hermione having very little personality.

Also, there's this whole subgenre of fics --- disproportionately many of them being Snamione --- where Hermione is trained to be this badass spy/assassin for the Order, who somehow manages to forget all her hard-earned skill when the author requires Drama! or needs to visit a Station of Canon.

Regarding the recs,

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacbok): currently /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19): a heavy AU where Salazar won.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): Hermione as a rational!protagonist.
- linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood): another Slytherin!Hermione fic focused on her progress as a witch.
- linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser): Long story short, Hermione's parents pull her out of Hogwarts, so she tricks her way into Durmstrang...
- linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen): a crackfic featuring Harry trying to keep a somewhat sociopathic Powerful!Hermione only held in check by being attracted to him from being too destructive.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer): : a non-crackfic featuring Harry trying to keep a somewhat sociopathic Powerful!Hermione only held in check by being attracted to him from being too destructive. (But seriously, Harry is sent into the past by a Powerful!Hermione who'd gone Dark in an AU where they weren't able to find all the horcruxes.)
- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge): a one-shot featuring an ActionGirl!Hermione.
- linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozhalsky): a slow-burn post-Hogwarts Hermione/Neville romance; not very action-oriented, but Hermione is casually shown to be a very powerful witch. For example, she spams Fidelius Charms to hide her affairs.)
- linkffn(Heap Coals of Fire on His Head by White Squirrel): Voldemort wins. Hermione makes the best of a bad situation. Poor Draco.
- linkffn(Strangeness and Charm by Consume): Hermione is Tom Riddle's equal in magic.
- linkffn(Reconnaissance by Albernheit): Hermione talks to Hogwarts.
- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa): Hermione sends herself a care package back in time.
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen): A very Riddle-like Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah): Harry accidental magics himself into a more cuddly version of a basilisk. Hermione adopts him, and ends up doing some badass things as a consequence.

***** No worries. As someone pointed out to me a long time ago, what a magical/combat training montage does for some readers and writers, a makeover scene does for others: both are scenes showing the protagonist proactively altering themselves in order to obtain more power --- though of different kinds.

But, the two kinds of power differ in an important way. The power of the training montage puts the ultimate agency in the hands of the protagonist: it is the ability to do things /to/ others, and those others do not get to choose whether it is done to them; whereas the power of the makeover puts the agency in the hands of those whom it seeks to affect, by at least signaling the ability to do things /for/ them, and they can choose to simply reject the signal.

The two kinds of power are not mutually exclusive, of course, but in a fictional narrative, they compete for in-story significance: the more impact one has, the less impact the other has room for. In other words, why would a Makeover!Hermione need to hex someone into doing what she wants them to, when she can just bat her proverbial eyelashes at them and have them do her bidding to please her? And, conversely, why would a TrainingMontage!Hermione need to spend time styling her hair, when a demonstration of human to newt Transfiguration gets compliance much faster?

I think the OP was looking for those fics where Hermione has the power of the training montage, with less emphasis on the power of the makeover. Those tend to be rather difficult to come by.

****** While all that is true, outside of the beginning of the story, Hermione's change in appearance isn't what makes things happen for her- her shift in ability, and supposed different/more powerful magic give her a change in status, as well as make her as a person more powerful. The change in appearance (at least the hair, which in the narration was the outstanding part of it) was out of practicality first, wasn't it? Especially since she went back 'home' on short notice because of her new condition.

Idk, as a reader I saw the change in appearance as a small story element and not actually important beyond the beginning. But I can certainly imagine some readers seeing that as a distraction or major element!

******* I understand that much --- though I don't think the high heels were worn out of practicality. But then, what drew the Slytherins to her was her post-makeover appearance and their lust for her, not power or reputation. That was revealed later.

Now, I admit that I only got as far as the end of the doctor's appointment, and I stopped reading after that. (What got to me was that the portrayal of Hermione was too childish and flighty for my tastes, unbefitting her canon personality and her experiences as a war veteran and an adult. Hermione may be miserable, she might angst, but it never stops her from pressing ahead with what needs to be done.)

Mind spoiling me as to whether it's romance and lemons for the rest of the story, or whether there is a plot, a physical conflict, Hermione actually accomplishing big goals with powerful magic?

******** Part of the draw was magic, which without going into too spoilery detail, was vital. Initial attraction isn't to be dismissed, but what came after that was more than appearance.

I thought the portrayal up to the part you read to was kind of fitting. She escaped into her work, left everything behind, and suddenly she can't do anything right and is in system danger of death again. She had reached a breaking point before leaving the country, was able to grow and revaluate what was important to her. It didn't seem too far of a growth from the canon backbone we saw, but that might just be where we disagree :)

The bulk of the story is the journey to actually be able to use her new/different abilities without getting killed in the process. There is conflict, but the scenes with conflict-action were short and contained. Then there's the romance and smut, which does relate to the plot itself regarding the magic.

** linkffn(sleeper) is a Hermione centric fic where she is a "sleeper cell" within the Pureblood world. Finished it last week and loved it.

Edit: no golden trio, and Ron and Harry don't feature very prominently until end of story. Still an excellent read!

*** Thanks for the rec.

It's well-written, and I've read through quite a bit of it, and I'm not seeing the "powerful" or the "badass" parts, nor any meaningful trend in that direction. Does it get better later on?

For someone who's been raised for the job, she's gotten no training or preparation for being a spy beyond what social skills a pureblooded girl would get (in this AU, where purebloods are a pseudo-Victorian aristocracy with formal courtship and chaperones and all), and she is, overall, significantly less driven or proactive than her canon counterpart, so she doesn't seek out any training or preparation, either. [1] She actually comes off more innocent, ingenuous ^{^{^{not}}} ^{^{^{ingenious,}}} and generally vulnerable than canon, which would be good if it were just a facade, but her internal monologue confirms that it's not a facade.

Also, nothing she's done so far has had any effect on the storyline, with Stations of Canon --- including those involving her! --- fastidiously revisited, even if there's no reason for them to be. (Her eventual love interest and increasingly manly man) Theodore Nott have actually done more than her.

Random thought: Can anyone name a fic where Harry is raised by Sirius (or Moody, etc.) with the stated intention of raising him to defeat Voldemort through magic and sneakiness (as opposed to moral purity and courage), but where those raising him don't actually teach him anything except for deportment, and certainly don't have him practice any combat- or espionage-related skills, magical or not?

[1] I'm pretty sure the only mildly age-inappropriate spy-related magic she's used was a Disillusionment Charm in her 4th year.

**** Skimmed to the end. In case anyone is curious, she does do some badass things in the last year of the fic, that indicate that she is, indeed, a very powerful witch, but she still doesn't have half the personality she had in canon and spends far too much time moping and far too little planning and acting.
