  The summer after his godfather's death was the worst in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark.This story is based on â€˜The Unknown Light' by Someryn and the idea was used with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath so do not read if the subject matter offends or upsets you. There is no slash and Ginny is not raped.

  With Sirius dead, Harry expected a summer filled with dark times, marinating on how he was to blame. What he did not expect was for the Dursleys to thrust a baby into his arms and declare it his. Apparently one night of recklessness was enough but he refused to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Could he do this at 16 on top of school and extra Defense? (Mentor/Fatherly Snape, eventually.)

******* you know Harry can take his child with him when travelling , right? And Harry doesn't have to work and things like food and cleaning are taken care of by a house-elf. And its not like Harry wouldn't enroll his child in preschool so it has contact with other kids. And there is nothing wrong in hiring a nanny to take care of it when when he is unable to. we are not talking about months we are talking about about some hours every week.

Harry can spent more time than any working parents could with his kid and is still able to basically do what ever he wants.
