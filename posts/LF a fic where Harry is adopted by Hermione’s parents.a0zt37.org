I believe it was called something like the accident, and I can't for the life of me find it anywhere now. All I can remember is that it was rated M on ffnet

Any help appreciated

** The fic I immediately thought of was Harry Potter-Granger and the Elixir of Life, but that's not rated M, so that can't be it. It's still pretty good, though... there was another, even better story, but it's been removed from FFN and I can't find it anywhere else.
