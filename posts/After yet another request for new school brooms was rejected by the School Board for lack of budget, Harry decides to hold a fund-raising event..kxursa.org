Harry had to admit, Hermione was right. While he could have bought some standard brooms himself, this was a lot more fun - plus, it made everyone feel involved. If he'd just given money or bought the brooms himself, he'd have seemed like he was throwing his money around. By making a fundraiser happen, he was getting others in on it and taking the attention away from himself.

Dumbledore had taken his request to the board, who - in a surprising move - had given the go-ahead for the fundraiser, after someone had brought up the idea of making it a learning project for the students. Indeed, some of the ideas for activities were magically pretty impressive.

Harry, Ron and Hermione were wandering the grounds, shortly after the opening spiel from the teachers. From a little distance, they saw various carnival-games having been set up. A fourth-year Ravenclaw had set up a shooting-gallery with magically moving targets, there was a Haunted House set up by a seventh-year Slytherin, and a few vendors from Hogsmeade had set up stalls with goods they'd donated to the cause.

In the distance, he saw Fred Weasley manning what looked like a dunk tank - his brother sitting on a seat above what looked like a large tank of a strange-colored liquid that Harry was sure would have some interesting effects.\\
More surprising was the other person sitting in the dunk-tank. Harry wasn't sure quite how they'd roped Draco Malfoy into it, but he seemed to be drawing a line to get a chance to dunk him in whatever liquid the Twins had cooked up - his constant complaining and goading making a lot of people eager to see him get some comeuppance.

Luna Lovegood's contribution of various charmed necklaces was also drawing a bit of a crowd, for the oddity of the jewelry if nothing else - various fruits and vegetables were fashioned into earrings and necklaces, each proclaiming to ward off some creature Harry hadn't heard of before. A few of the better-selling ones were instead layered with simple charms - the Warming Charm necklaces were going quite quickly for her.

Harry passed by Ginny Weasley, who was making a show of doing broom-stunts for tips on what looked like George's broom. It was actually quite an impressive display, and Ron was surprised to learn she'd been sneaking broom-rides since age five.\\
Harry couldn't help but be impressed as well, musing that she would be a shoe-in for a Chaser position once one of the three current Chasers graduated.

Another surprising inclusion was Professor Snape - he'd set up what looked like a Potions-oriented escape room, that reminded Harry a bit of the potions riddle he'd used to protect the Philosopher's Stone in Harry's first year. Harry supposed that the surly Professor was roped into it by Dumbledore himself, but there was surprisingly no irritation on Snape's face even when Harry passed by to check on the proceedings.

Harry was currently just passing time for the main event. He'd volunteered to hold an auction with some of his old belongings - his Nimbus 2000 had been recovered and, while it was no longer in usable condition due to the charms being impossible to re-apply, Harry had reluctantly agreed to sign it and make a wall-decoration out of it.\\
He'd vetoed the contribution of Pansy Parkinson, who'd said "maybe the Great Harry Potter should just auction himself off?" as if to mock him - the auction itself was actually a good idea, but no way was Harry going to include his actual person.

Speaking of Pansy Parkinson, it appeared the girl had done an about-face on her attitude - she was holding a booth with magical make-up and face-paint, and her customers were lining up as she was actually quite good at making people look good.\\
Even more surprisingly, she'd teamed up with Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who'd turned the same sort of attention to outfits that Pansy was giving to make-up - resulting in, currently, a slightly pale-faced Hufflepuff second-year getting a full makeover and wardrobe.\\
It wasn't entirely without arguments as the girls seemed to be squabbling over color-coordination, but several teachers seemed to be proudly looking on as in one afternoon, several years of House rivalry were broken through by the power of charity.

Harry, in the meantime, was just glad that for the moment, he could be Just Harry - and that the fundraiser seemed to be going so well that he was fairly sure they could afford a full complement of training brooms fifteen times over by the time it was done.

--------------

Yeah, I have no idea where this one came from, or where it's going really. I'm also not sure when in the timeline this could happen, but I'm personally fond of putting it in Fourth Year before the whole Triwizard Tournament business - seeing as it's the only time the Wizarding World has any chill.

As always, feel free to continue where I left off, or write up some more examples of what students, teachers and/or guests might be doing at a fund-raising carnival thing like this.

** I'm thinking of writing one where Harry auctions off himself like one of those stud auctions? Maybe a funny part where lavender brown pays a sickle for Ron and he's sulking.

*** I pretty deliberately stepped away from that here, but it might make a good crack-romance story if he did auction himself off in one of those.

**** Yeah it would just be a fun little comedy. Maybe even a romance one. I might write a little something like that when I finish my book.

** I want more stories like this! Just where all the houses get along, stop with the blood rivalries and politics.

This was great, I like how you made Draco into the one getting dunked. It makes so much sense.

Now I want a slice of life fic involving Pansy, Lavender and Parvati. There aren't as much female friends stories out there, compared to male/male or male/female friend stories.
