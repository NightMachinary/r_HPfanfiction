[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325612]] The Runaway Returns

Sorry i dont know how to do the cool blue title is this link thing.


** Could you elaborate a bit? I haven't read these stories but it seems as if they are both post DH and Harry is an adult in both of them already? If you tell us what you liked about these stories, it would be easier for people to give you recommendations.

** Sorry, first time posting to reddit. I'll try to be more detailed in future post.

These stories are after the events of HD and how Harry deals with everything. He leaves everyone and everything behind to, in his mind, to protect everyone. After some period of time he tries to return. I like how these stories deal with that.

They are really interesting takes on the aftermath of the books. You should check them out. Thanks for reading this post and helping me out.

** If you don't mind comedy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the world is Harry Potter]] is along these lines and is quite good. It has 2 complete sequels as well, though they go different places iirc.

If you're also interested in Harry running away as a child, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] and its sequel are quite good. The sequel is incomplete, though was updated ~a month ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One Trilogy]] is a little bit of both. Sirius takes Harry at 8 and runs away, and then eventually it gets to the other after Hogwarts sort where your links seem to be. Which is as specific as I can be without spoiling things, I think.

If you want to know how to do the link thing it explains if you click formatting help under the post a comment box.

** Don't know the two stories you linked, but when I read 'runaway type stories' i thought of this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10901705/1/Out-of-the-Dark-and-into-the-Green][Out of the Dark and into the Green]] Harry runs away from the Dursleys, meets a weird guy and grows up away from the wizarding world. Dumbledore & Co. are of course trying to find him. No character bashing, no slash and no overused clichés so far.

There's surely more Harry!runaway stories, but I can't think of any other off the top of my head.

Edit: just remembered: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë]] After his second year at Hogwarts Harry runs away, accompanied by the sorting hat and Mr Weasley's old flying car. Well written and interesting.
