--------------

Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, there lived a man by the name of "Elder". He was born, like many witches and wizards of his time, into a magical family. At first, he was the first-born son - hence, his name, 'Elder' - but in the years that came, he was joined by a second brother and a third. As the three brothers grew up, they were thick as thieves, going on the greatest of adventures and quests together. However, all little boys must one day grow up, and Elder and his brothers were no different. In time, both of Elder's two brothers took wives.

While his both of his younger brothers found love, however, Elder did not. With each passing year, Elder became older, and yet he had still not yet found a wife.

In his upper middle years of life, tired and angry of being unable to find the "perfect bride", Elder began to lose hope. In the midst of his brothers starting their own families, Elder's heart saw their happiness and joy, and slowly the seed of darkness and bitterness rooted deep within his heart. In his despondency, he turned to the Dark Arts in an attempt to find his bride - and, in turn, Death himself. One one Samhain night (October 31), Elder mounted a ridge on which a single rowan tree stood, and summoned Death to him through ancient and Dark magic, asking for Death's assistance in finding his "perfect bride".

However, children, if there is one thing you must remember, it is that all ancient magic comes with a price. Elder, in his sorrow and despair, was eager to pay any cost necessary to achieve what he desired. Death agreed, but on one condition: that, after Elder and his bride had wed, that he would claim his price.

Plucking a branch from the rowan tree, Death imbued it with his magic, and gave it to Elder.

"In one year's time," Death rasped, his voice akin to a cold and shuddering wind. "You shall return to his hill, where your bride will await you. Give to her this branch, and her heart will be yours."

Come Samhain next year, Death kept his word. On All Hallow's Eve (October 31), a Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the "darker half" of the year, Elder, mounting the hill once more, found that the rowan tree was gone. Instead, he saw a woman more beautiful than he had ever beheld before. Tall, willowy, and pale, with hair red as the rowan berries from the tree, she was elegant, regal, and more than Elder had ever dreamed of. Approaching her, the enchanted branch in hand, Elder felt a strong affinity for this woman as he offered the gift to her.

The woman, who said her name was Rowan, accepted Elder's present with a smile. Soon, Elder found himself completely and utterly in love with Rowan, and the two arranged to be married.

For next thirteen years, Elder and Rowan were the happiest they had ever been. In time, Elder and Rowan decided to start a family. However, during those years, it appeared that Rowan was barren - Death's "price". Summoning Death once more, Elder again asked for his help. Once again, Death agreed...but again, he said he would come to claim his price.

Reaching into his cloak, Death pulled forth a potion, imbued with his magic, and gave it to Elder.

"Have your wife drink this potion," Death instructed. "And you will conceive a child."

Again, true to Death's words, not long after Rowan took the potion, she became with child. For the next nine months, the couple were overjoyed. However, when the time came for Rowan to give birth to their child, a terrible tragedy occurred. The moment Elder and Rowan's child entered the world - a girl - Rowan's life was lost.

The child herself was stillborn, and for a third time, Elder called upon Death, asking him to do something - anything - to return his daughter's life. For a third and final time, Death agreed. Bending over the child, Death breathed in all of the essence of death from her into himself, making her well again. However, Death left Elder with a word of caution.

"Thirteen years," Death breathed, his voice rattling. "And I shall return again to claim my price."

Once more, Elder's life was lost in despair. He had lost his beloved wife, but had gained a daughter. Elder buried Rowan's lifeless body on the hill on which they had met, the enchanted branch laid in her hands, and, in time, another rowan tree sprang up over her grave. In time, their daughter grew to be just as beautiful as her mother, with pale skin, and hair and eyes black as night. He named her 'Ebony', and Elder soon grew to love her dearly.

However, on Ebony's thirteenth (13th) birthday, Death returned to their household. Appearing to Elder and Ebony, Death asked for Ebony to leave with him - to go to the Underworld, never to be seen again. Elder, however, had grown to love Ebony so deeply and covetously that he denied Death's request. Furious at Elder's refusal, Death vowed to return to claim what was rightfully his.

However, children, no man can escape Death - and Elder was no exception.

On the morn of the seventh day after Elder's refusal, Ebony woke up early in the morning, before her father had risen from his bed. Hearing strange whispers, Ebony followed them outside and into the nearby woods - and ancient druidic forest - in which she discovered a mysterious arch. In time, this archway - a doorway would be called 'the Veil'.

Ebony walked through it that day, children, and things were never the same. Only too late did Elder realize what had happened, and the darkness that had rooted in Elder's heart finally consumed it.

Afterwards, they say Elder later claimed ownership of a wand that he claimed could 'defeat Death'...but that, dear children, is a story for a different time...

*** Wherefore comes this criticism? I don't see the phrase "new and improved" in the story, and the point of the assignment is to unearth hidden tales of Beadle the Bard. <no snark> So as it is, indeed, a tale hitherto unknown to us here at Flourish and Blotts, it is a "new" story, even though it is obviously quite old and rooted in ancient wizarding lore! :)

** This is beautifully written, well-structured, and hauntingly elegant. Not only does it reference the woods of the wands; the Veil; and eloquently echo Greek mythology in its ending, it is just so incredibly well-woven and well-written. I love it!

***** She is, yes, in a way. She's not Death's wife - obviously, she's too young for that - but in one of my fanfictions, she's the "caretaker" of Limbo. The same space that Harry met Dumbledore in at the end of DH.

******* I unfortunately took down my fanfic [and may have deleted it] due to being insulted [on my writing skills] it as soon as I posted it on Tumblr, but the gist of it was this: Hermione is sent to Limbo, meets 'Ebony' (her real name is Arabella Peverell), and the latter sends her back in time on a quest.

To make a long plot short, the Hallows were made by the Peverells - as Dumbledore theorized - and each Hallow was tied by blood to each brother's descendants (the Wand for Antioch, the Stone for Cadmus, and the Cloak for Ignotus). Hence why each Hallow (excepting the wand) was passed down from parent to child, generation to generation. Only those of Peverell blood can fully harness all three Hallows to become the 'Master of Death', or even use the Hallows.

As Antioch's bloodline died out with Arabella, Hermione (with the aid of Tom Riddle, whom she befriends) finds a way to construct a new body for Arabella. This, in the fic, was done the same (or similar) way Voldemort gets a new body in GOF. Since Arabella never truly 'died' - her soul is stuck in Limbo - she is brought back to the living realm in order to fulfill her 'blood claim' on the Elder Wand. This also ties in with WWII and Dumbledore's showdown with Gellert Grindelwald, the latter of whom had stolen the Elder Wand from Gregorovitch.

At the end of the story, Arabella returns to Limbo to be reunited with her father and mother in death. The Elder Wand was also hidden by Hermione do that Riddle would "never be able to find it".

'Rowan' is Philomena Peverell, and 'Elder' is Antioch Peverell. Philomena's name means "loved", which ties in with how deeply she was loved by her husband, Antioch. Both names are dated back to ancient Rome.

******** What was there to insult? This reads very well as a fairy tale.

I greatly enjoyed this first part and the rest of it sounds interesting as well. Maybe you should try posting it elsewhere? fanfiction.net and ao3.org would probably be places way less negative to post it on.

Either way I'd like to commend you on writing it in the first place. It was entertaining.

I don't recall exactly what was said, but the gist of it was, "you suck at creative writing, stick to journalism" and "Arabella is a Mary Sue", even though I had only posted one chapter online.

******** You are an awesome person: very creative and your stories are incredibly well thought-out and structured. This is brilliant. I don't know why those jerkwads downvoted it. They were probably vicious jealous trolls who couldn't wipe the ink from your shoes with a magnifying glass and a bottle of Windex if they tried! :)
