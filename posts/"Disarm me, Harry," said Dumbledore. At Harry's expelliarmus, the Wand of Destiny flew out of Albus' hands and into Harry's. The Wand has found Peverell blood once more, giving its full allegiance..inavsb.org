Has Death just been whispering in Dumbledore's ear this whole time, berating him for not taking up the job himself?

"For the last time, I'm already Headmaster of Hogwarts, Supreme Mugwump, Chief Sorcerer, and seventeen other titles I can't be bothered to remember! The answer is /NO!/"

***** Technically this was only Dumbledore's plan, we don't see it happening and thus have no way of knowing for sure if it would actually work. For me it always came across as being more guess-work than anything else. Plus it would only manage to take the wand's loyalty, not it's power (eg. Voldemort managed to use it to great effect despite it being loyal to his enemy) so either it would never be loyal to anyone anymore but still be much more powerful than a regular wand or it would just chose it's next master by itself (maybe Olivander takes it to his shop and have costumers try it until it accepts someone?)

******* Yes, it have absolutely no loyalty to him but it was still as powerful as a wand that he had won or that had chosen him. Remember how bad at magic Neville was while using his fathers wand, or how the wand Ron stole for Harry performed so poorly? The fact that the wand worked that well for Voldemort show that it is rather more powerful than any random wand.

Harry's lessons with Dumbledore in his sixth year aren't just about viewing memories of Voldemort, but also memories of Dumbledore's greatest battles, with the goal that one day Harry can learn how to beat the headmaster in a duel.
