Having spent the last half-century sleeping with the Elder Wand on his bedside table- far longer than anyone had successfully held it before him, Albus Dumbledore didn't realize that perhaps the Wand may have taken a liking to him to have allowed his continued survival for so long.

When Snape casts the Killing Curse against Dumbledore in the astronomy tower it fizzles out on contact with the old man. Albus is confused, Snape is furious, and the Death Eaters are terrified.


** The body was remarkably well preserved --- death hadn't dared touch Albus Dumbledore's features. But his eyes were closed, his breath was still, his right hand was black and shrivelled --- and no victory was ever sweeter than this one. Snape may have delivered the final blow, but Albus Dumbledore was slain by the Dark Lord's hand.

And there, on the corpse's chest, laid his prize. An unassuming length of elder, uneven and twisted, barely elaborate enough to be called a wand. A weapon of devastating power implied to be created by death itself. A weapon that was only waiting to be claimed by Lord Voldemort and ensure his reign eternal.

Yet, something was wrong. If Voldemort still had hair, he suspected that it would have been standing on its ends. It was as if the world was now covered by a heavy veil, and even the water in the lake behind him grew still.

But no, there could be no trap. He was Lord Voldemort --- no Hogwarts professor ever knew even half of what he did. Albus Dumbledore was defeated, ruined, dead --- and now his corpse would witness his final failure. Cackling almost against his will, the dark wizard reached for the Elder wand...

...only to be stopped by a strong grip on his arm. Sundered, he looked up into the now open but no less dead eyes of his enemy.

"A corpse should be left well-enough alone," whispered Dumbledore.

Voldemort tried to pull back, but the Inferi --- it had to be an Inferi! --- was too strong. As if far in the distance, he heard a crack --- and it took him a moment to realise that his arm was now broken. Gasping in pain, he reached for Lucius's wand with his left hand, but just as he grabbed it, the monster flung him into the ground face-forward with the same unyielding force.

He was fairly certain that the fall broke his spine --- at least he could not feel his legs anymore. But the sound of shuffling, stumbling, unsure feet closing in on him gave the Dark Lord a reason to try harder. As a last-ditch effort, Voldemort tried to apparate --- only to remember that, according to Hogwarts: A History, the apparition was impossible on the Hogwarts' grounds.

"Only an honest death will cure you now." whispered a voice from above.

Somewhere in the depth of Gringotts, an ancient cup suddenly exploded in a ball of green fire. On the seventh floor of Hogwarts, an unmarked wall opened only to spew out a cracked statue with a broken crown on its head. A snake on the Malfoy Manor grounds slithered into a ball and screamed in pain with an almost human voice. And Harry James Potter awoke with a gasp only to see a locket on his best mate's neck break and fall into pieces.

By the time the first light reached into the now desecrated tomb, Lord Voldemort was no more.

*** It's not gonna be helpful to you, but you just gave me an idea.

Let's make Wanda Maximoff grow up not on sitcoms but on fantasy books and shows. So instead of transforming Westview into /Bewitched/, she unconsciously pulls a person she always admired into her own world.

Minerva McGonagall has picked a very bad day to stop sniffing catnip.
