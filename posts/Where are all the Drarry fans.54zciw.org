Personally I love Drarry and it's probably my favorite ship, with RL/SB at a close second, but on this sub people are rarely recommending it or asking for recs in that pairing or for slash in general. However, I was just reading through the discussion post of how people's tastes in fic have changed over time and lots of people were saying they love Drarry and only or mostly read Drarry.

So to that I say, Drarry lovers come out of the woodwork and hit me, and your fellow Drarry shippers with some recs! What have you read recently that you liked? What are your favorites troupes and ages for your Drarry fics. Favorite authors? General Drarry-loving discussion also welcome :)


** I enjoy Drarry, but I like the "older" Drarry, which I have a hard time finding. What I mean by that is, a lot of the Drarry I've read has Draco, and often Harry as well, acting very very childish. As soon as I read ""But Haaaaaarry," Draco whined with pouty lips and puppy dog eyes..." I'm out. I don't actually care if the characters are still at Hogwarts, or if the fic takes place after the war, but I don't want to read "Draco acts like a two year old". I prefer 6th year Drarry, where Draco is super stressed, trying to live up to his father's expectations, and freaking out. (I actually read a really good Dramione in this time period as well)

I also really love a good Snarry, but everyone seems to hate that pairing so I've learned to stop asking.

*** I don't hate Snarry! I just think that there will NEED to be a troupey plot device to make Harry ever give Snape a chance in the first place (botched potions accident, accidental bonding spell etc.) because otherwise it is too OOC for Harry (or Snape for that matter) for me to enjoy. You've probably read all of these because I think they are fairly well known, but some of my favorites are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936][*Cambiare Podentes*]] linkao3(714361), [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][*The Boy Who Died a Lot*]] linkao3(670548), [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/610909][*With Eyes Wide Open*]] linkao3(610909), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315797/1/Gray-Skye-Mourning][*Gray Skye Mourning*]] linkffn(8315797).

I can't remember how "mature" Draco acted in this fic, but one of my favorite 6th year fics with Draco where he is really in character is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164/chapters/527529][*Eclipse*]] which is a fic where Draco kidnaps Harry for Voldermort and then has a change of heart. if you haven't read it, you need to start it asap! linkao3(327164)

For some more adult Draco, here are some of my favorites -

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/639538][*Eye of the Beholder*]] - This fic was really unusual and well done! It reads like a portrait of Draco Malfoy. It is written in the first person (Draco's) and is an introspective and detailed account of Draco's whole life - his motivations, his thoughts and opinions, his participation in the war, his relationship with his son and wife and how he came to discover he was gay. The relationship between Draco and Harry is well done, although it felt pretty secondary to the rest of the story - which was also somewhat a breath of fresh air for H/D slash. This fic is also totally epilogue compliant and to me, as just the author's head canon on who Draco is/was and how he turned out within the confines of canon. Linkao3(639538)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5403371/chapters/12482513][*Any Instrument*]] - Harry and Draco are 28 and Draco has been living abroad for 10 years. He comes back to England to be Harry's Doctor because Harry can't control his magic because of the elder wand. The whole story is from Dracos POV and I really liked it! This fic is well written and has a lot of interesting details. Not as angsty or squee-worthy as most HP/DM - it's more adult. Linkao3(5403371)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124273/chapters/2266086][*The Printed Press*]] - Incredibly well written fic where Draco is hired to write Harry's memoirs. I love journalist Draco (probably because of TURN) and this fic was angsty but not too crazy, well written and sweet. I also love that the plot device of the memoirs forces Harry and Draco to talk about all of the things that happened at hogwarts year by year - it is so cathartic for a Drarry fan and suuuper well done. Linkao3(1124273)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2693312/chapters/6026747][*The Light More Beautiful*]] - This story has an interesting plot device I haven't seen anywhere else -- In the first chapter, Draco and Harry lose their virginities together 6th year due to an accident with lust potion. Then Harry helps Draco leave the country to get away from the war and Draco doesn't come back for 10(?) years. That's where this story picks up. This is a sorta auror-partners fic and there is some magical creature stuff thrown in too but it is not the main focus. The writing here was good and all the magic and auror stuff was well conceived. Linkao3(2693312)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/257338/chapters/401734][*Must Love Quidditch*]] -- The basic premise is that Harry and Draco meet on an online dating site for wizards. At first I thought the plot device was a little lame because in canon, no one uses electronics. Also, Harry and Draco are a little pretentious with their initial profiles on the site. However, I quickly changed my mind about the fic once I got into it because the story and the tension were just so good! I loved Harry woo-ing Draco and I loved the relationship with Cal and all the other kids. Highly recommend for a heartwarming and entertaining read. Linkao3(257338)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][*Here's the Pencil, Make it Work*]] - This was a sweet short story post-DH where Harry and Ginny are broken up and Harry is pretty aimless. He runs into DM a few times and befriends him. I really liked how much drinking and drugs were in the story because it felt realistic for their age. Also I liked that Harry is bi rather than gay. It makes the stuff with Ginny a lot more believable. Also all of the OCs are cool and Draco in this story is one of the most lovable Dracos in all of fic. Seriously of the 100s of Draco fics I have read, there is no Draco I could fall in love with more than this one - so well written. Linkao3(640449)

**** Wow! This list is going to keep me busy for days!! I actually hadn't read one of the Snarry's you mentioned, Grey Skye Mourning.

Thank you so much for all the suggestions!!

***** Haha I always post when I just wake up too and inevitably make a bunch of mistakes. GSM is really good but it's like a sickly sweet romance. Like, if you don't like Snarry it's gag-worthy over the top romance. But the time travel is done right (causal loop) and the writing is really good so I tend to rec it pretty often.

Most time travel fics are set in either dynamic or multiverse timelines, probably because fixed timelines are harder to write (and in many cases, what's the point of time travel if you're not going to change anything, lol).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/192712][Lettered]] and its sequels are a really great 3 fic series beginning with this fic where Draco and Harry are secret pen pals during their 7th year. Harry doesn't know Draco is his pen pal for most of it until he does. The plot device is brilliant because the author does a cool thing where the only letters are Dracos. You have to fill in yourself what Harry might have written between. The sequel is 20 years later when they find eachother again. And the final fic is a year later, still from Dracos POV after Harry gets kidnapped. It's very well written and the author has such a clear voice for Draco that his character is nuanced and super flawed.

** I love Drarry dearly and have also been wondering the same thing on here. Often times I see slash posts get down voted or harsh responses so I think it's important to rally the community around the idea that slash and/or femslash ships are just as valid and beautiful as hetero ships.

With all that being said, I personally enjoy Drarry at any age but particularly from 4th year and onward. I haven't read anything recently since my newest obsession right now is Guardian!Snape fics with Harry but my forever favorite Drarry fic will always be linkffn(Being a Veela's Mate by Chereche).

This fic builds a compelling and beautiful relationship between Draco and Harry from a very young age. What I love most about it is that the relationship is purely platonic for many years and we as the audience get to experience their growth with them. I cannot recommend this fic enough!

**** I agree as well. The casual homophobia in the fandom nowadays is not something I like. Of course people use the defense "it's not in the original text!!1!" as if a) fanfiction wasn't meant in the first place to be a re-imagining or a filling in the gaps of canon, and as if b) there were any fandoms with hordes of interesting, central, well-written canonically full-on gay characters so we wouldn't have to project or question characters' presumed straightness.

The fact is, ignoring (or even accepting!) the epilogue of Harry Potter there is not one shred of evidence to say that every character is 100% heterosexual. How many of us who are LGBT tried hard to take interest in the other gender because it was expected of us? Even people who date opposite-sex partners could well be bi, it's never specified otherwise.

When I saw a young person a couple of years ago boil down all of slash to hard-core sex, I made sure to write in a rather chaste, ordinary couple that happened to be gay in a longer story, not to be prescriptive or instructive, but just to have that be as normal as it is in my life.

  casual homophobia
#+end_quote

I have no problems at all with homosexuality. I'd love to swing both ways, because that'd double my dating pool. But I have several problems with much of the ff slash.

(I apologize for the following wall of text.)

First of all, it tends to be badly written. Admittedly most of ff is badly written, but I feel the slash stories are worse than average. The focus is more on making incompatible people jump into bed with each other, than to tell a compelling story with more than just an unusual relationship. It's usually accompanied by bad lemons written by kids who have never had sex in any form, except with Mrs. Palm and her five daughters.

Many times the contortions needed to force the relationships to work kills the suspension of disbelief. Often the relationships are between people incompatible with each other in canon. I have yet to see a believable premise to make Snarry or Drarry work. Likewise with Snape/Sirius Black (what do you call that? /Snack?/). The enmity between them is insurmountable. This is not limited to slash, it is just as unbelievable in straight stories, like Dramione.

Why is Harry always paired with someone that is /un/friendly in canon? Why not pair Harry with someone friendly, like one of his dorm mates, or Cedric Diggory? Hell, make it a threesome with the Creevey brothers! This is both slash /and/ perfectly believable.

Why do so many stories go all out with the slash? Suddenly there's not a straight relationship in sight, except between Hagrid and Hedwig. When you turn /everything/ upside down, it's literally beyond belief. Also, there are probably more /bi/sexuals in the world than pure gays.

And let's not go into MPREG. Apart from the sheer mind-bogglingly impossibility of it, it's usually accompanied by strong dominant/submissive overtones, which does very little to float my boat.

This rules out about 99% of slash stories for me. I'll get back to those when I'm done with my Dark/Independent period.

Bad fanfiction is bad, whether it's slash, het or gen. I have read many phenomenal stories that feature a slash pairing, just as I've read phenomenal het pairings or no pairings fics. I think to say that most slash is worse on average than non-slash fics is a bit unfair and a common misconception I see a lot in this subreddit. There are a lot of bad stories PERIOD. The trope/pairing does not matter one bit.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is true for many non-canon or rather "non-easy" pairings, though. And it's not limited to pairings but to non-canon tropes as well (ex Snape is Harry's biological father). But if you haven't read any good slash, then you probably haven't seen good examples of nicely written relationship growth. Honestly, /any/ trope or pairing works as long as the /writing backs it up./

#+begin_quote
  Why is Harry always paired with someone that is unfriendly in canon?
#+end_quote

In the easy pairings, where is the tension? The conflict? The sparks? The fun?

In Soap Operas or Daytime Dramas, where a story is told around relationships between a group of people, the most interesting stories are told between people who are in conflict with each other, whether they are a potential love interest for each other or bitter enemies (or both). Easy pairings can be and are done and can be done well, but I think the pairings where both people have to come from polar opposites in order to fall in love are the most interesting to read for me and part of the enjoyment for me is reading how the author manages to make these two people who hate each other to fall in love. But there are Harry/non-Slytherin/Death Eater pairings written, but I personally don't seek those stories out.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I see this a lot as well and it bugs me too. But thankfully, those side relationships aren't always pertinent to the main story so they are easy to ignore.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

MPREG is just another trope. As far as impossible, I mean we are talking about a world full of magic, right? So the world itself is built on the impossible right there. There are stories where Harry can go back in time and raise himself or become the Headmaster of Hogwarts at 15 or have a harem of 10 females while he's still a teenager or is so powerful , he becomes the second coming of Merlin, or crosses over to another impossible world and is a Jedi or on the Starship Enterprise, etc. etc. MPREG is just another trope in the world where anything impossible is possible.

I'm not sure about the D/s thing in regards to MPREG. Some of the MPREG stuff I read is just an offshoot of an established relationship and is very similar to het in that regard. Also, just because someone is a bottom doesn't mean they are submissive or less equal to their partner in their relationship, if that is causing your D/s unease.

Honestly though. If you're interested, take a look at some of the recs in this thread and you might just find some stories you would enjoy.

****** As a lover of Drarry, I disagree that they are incompatible. Aside from the bathroom incident in book 6, most of their encounters are damned trivial and childish. Calling Hermione names doesn't count as "insurmountable" to me, and that's really the worst thing Draco does in canon.

What I, and a lot of other fans of the pairing see is chemistry. Harry and Draco /notice/ each other pretty much from day one. They continue to notice each other even when they have to go out of their way to do so. I hate the Ginny pairing because for six books Harry barely gives her a passing glance and then it's time to wind down the series and get everyone happily paired off, so he suddenly has raging chest monsters for her. I don't like pairing Harry with any other characters because I think they're either boring (Seamus, Dean) or annoying (the twins, Sirius).

Harry + Draco has a bit of an edge to it, and I think that if they could both mature beyond their childhood grudges, they'd each provide the other with an interesting companion. Not just vanilla "happily ever after" wish fulfillment.

I mostly don't read any other fanfics except for Drarry because I usually find the pairings super boring or they don't appeal to me. This one has this energy and conflict needed to launch a story, if you know what I mean.

***** Agree with all of this! It just makes sense to me based on my high school friends as adults now that a few of the "main" characters in Harry's year would end up LGBT and there's no reason that Harry himself wouldn't be. One thing I hate though, even as a huge lover of slash, is when authors make EVERYONE gay. Certainly it's possible, but not likely and reads as (blatant) wish fulfillment rather thoughtfully planned character development. One I read recently that suffered from this was [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6854605/chapters/15646567][The Devils White Knight]] a cool multiverse fic where Voldermort had been killed in the 50s. In the this though, George, Remus, Sirius, Harry, Draco, Regalus, James, Ginny, Luna, Tonks, and Fleur were all gay. Little excessive right?

****** I guess the thing with making a large number of characters gay is it somewhat sidesteps the need (or perceived need) to take up a chunk of your story with /every other straight character's/ shock-horror that gay people and relationships exist, and needing to have it explained to them, with a few chapters of the related angst. Often comes with a side order of a Weasley being homophobic and revealing their 'true colours' -_-

Of course, some stories nowadays sidestep this by remembering that in a fictional universe that is canonically a secret and separate world, social norms might be different, and homosexuality might be quite normal and accepted. I've seen that in a few AU fics where muggleborns are adopted by pureblood families; often there's casual lesbian couples etc. which is nice to see.

** Whelp, here is my top picks list for Drarry (not including TURN, which I see has already been mentioned, thankfully). I hope some of these are new for my fellow fans so ya'll can dive into some awesomeness!

/Linkao3(879835) linkao3(1049966) linkao3(78824) linkao3(2734082) linkffn(4109630) linkffn(4359350) linkffn(11448018)/

Personally, I have trouble reading Draco in a relationship unless he's older. He's just too snobbish as a child and he needs a lot of growing up to do before I can believe that Harry would fall for him. I guess that's why I love redemption fics so much haha.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

*** A lot of good recs, thanks! I haven't read Requaero Probum yet, but now it is definitely on my list. I have never been able to like Lomonaaeren though and not for lack of trying. She just seems to write Harry so OOC to me. Draco is easier to be flexible on because we don't see that much of him in canon, but her Harrys never feel like Harry to me. It's a shame too because I think the premises in a lot of her fics are interesting.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][TURN]] is the fic that has stayed with me as headcanon, but the romance in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812/chapters/6748463][Helix]] is so so good and one of her only hogwarts era fics. I can't wait until she comes out with something new but it'll probably be awhile because I saw on her blog that she recently moved and is working on renovating her new house.

  Despite the weight of all this history and the ephemera of an uncertain future, we are ridiculously happy together. I can't explain it. He answers something in me and I answer something in him, and most days it's so fucking brilliant that I can't stop smiling.

*** Yes I have so many recs for fics like this!

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/496883][*Pocket Full of Starlight*]] - This is 100% a parent trap remake but with Scorpius and James and Quidditch camp. There are references to mpreg, but that is not really part of the story as this is set when Scorpius and James are 12. The family dynamics in this fic were great and there was a lot of really sweet family fluffy parts. I loved the narcissa and lucius in this, and Blaise's son Pip is hilarious. Femme is a great author so this is well written, but it really wasn't the most creative (as it is just the parent trap) and as it was mostly told from the POV of the kids, it wasn't my favorite. It was cute though so I would still recommend it. linkao3(496883)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/989537][*Annus Mirabilis*]] - This is a really interesting fic where Draco and Harry accidentally travel back to the first year of Hogwarts. Even though only a few minutes pass back in the present, they live there for eight months and start a relationship. Their relationship development was just okay, but the historical details - especially the wand making - was really cool and unique. This was a twist on a time travel fic that I haven't seen done before. linkao3(989537)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/3047][*If Sieve series*]] - This series is great. The premise is that there is a magical object called an "if sieve" that works the same as a pensive, letting you see how events would have played out if one decision was changed. Draco in this fic wants to find out what he could have done to have been friends with Harry. He makes a ton of changes ranging from having Voldermort not kill Harry, to befriending Harry in Madam Malkins, to having Harry apologize after the 6th year bathroom incident, to joining the DA 5th year. Not much really changes his relationship with Harry in all of these different possible pasts. But Draco slowly starts to realize how to befriend Harry in the present and the If Sieve gives Draco some insight on how to fight Voldermort. linkao3(78806)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6148987/chapters/14088400][*A Madness Most Discreet*]] - This is a great sequel to [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2106744/chapters/4594389][The Gentlewizards Club]] (which is really shipping focused but very good!) and a quick read. It is one of the best (the best maybe?) H/D auror partners fics i've read and the mystery is interesting and well done and the writing is great! I LOVED the Draco in this too - it's rare to get a really funny Draco in fic and he was really well done here. linkao3(6148987)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][*House Proud*]] - Already rec'd on this sub a lot but still worth noting. It's an odd but good fic! The premise is that old pureblood houses are sentient to some extent and grimmauld place kinda tries to set up Draco and Harry. This fic reads like a Victorian romance/horror novel though. Kinda like Poe or similar. linkao3(6177703)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/330906][*The Boy Who Only Lived Twice*]] - This is a "secret identity" fic like I've never read before. In it, Draco and Harry are both unspeakables - spies who use polyjuice to hunt criminals and work in pairs. They are partners but neither knows who the other really is. Until Draco finds out Harry is Harry... It's well written, has hot smut and a good plot. linkao3(330906)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][*If the Sun Goes Black*]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][*There Is Always the Moon*]] are really good Drarry mystery-ish fics set a few years after Hogwarts. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098). There is Always the Moon is one of the best fics I have read this year - if not the best. It is a creature fic without falling into any of the usual tropes.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/392764/chapters/645041][*The Pure and Simple Truth*]] - This fic is a great character study for where everyone ended up a couple years after hogwarts. This author can seriously write dialogue too and the talks at the bar all felt really realistic. There's a reason why a G rated Drarry has this many kudos on ao3 and it is because it is just that good. Linkao3(392764)

If you don't like reading realistic teenage relationships (and I don't blame you because it can be insufferable!), it is clear why you stopped reading. TURN is a lot more adult and better written than TWIST too. I love everything by Saras_Girl, but Helix is another particular favorite.

Between then and now, I got into guardian Snape fics and then AU and time travel fics and then strayed to Naruto fics and then got back into HP recently. I've been really into master of death!harry and then I found this sub and recently got back into Harry/Draco after reading one rec. Re-obsessed lol. And there's so much new stuff!!!

I almost exclusively read EWE fics for this pairing because I'm pretty attached to canon. Also I don't like reading fics where Harry is not the main defeater of Voldemort and a lot of pre-DH fics change the final battle... ALso I don't like character bashing.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][*TURN*]] , which you have probably seen rec'd all over is canon-compliant through the epilogue and so so good.

One of my all time favorite canon-compliant fics though is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506][*Twist of Fate*]]. It has a Harry/Draco romance during 4th and 5th year at hogwarts yet due to some heartbreaking memory modification, still is almost completely (EWE) canon-compliant.

This whole thread turned into a shitshow against me from my comment, which wasn't what I was looking for. Anyway, Slash isn't my thing and I can now see why people like to read it. It's probably similar to me liking romance in fics, it's something you just enjoy reading. Didn't mean to start this whole thing mate. Cheers.

  I just don't see the point in slash.
#+end_quote

Many people enjoy slash. It may be because they themselves are gay, and they identify more with gay characters. It may be a straight person who just wants a change of pace. Just like somebody who might read Harry/Luna one day and Harry/Fleur the next day. Variety is usually welcome, and if the reader has no qualms with slash it offers that variety.

#+begin_quote
  but I feel like just making straight characters gay for shits and giggles is just, I dunno, weird?
#+end_quote

Why would it be weird? People make minor and major changes to canon personalities all the time. For instance, Harry isn't a bookworm, but there are plenty of stories where Harry is super book-smart and studies a lot. Is that weird?

It may be true that Harry's canon personality isn't like that, just like he isn't gay, but the fanfic author can do whatever they like to him and if people enjoy it, oh well.

On the flip side, maybe it is a bit weird. Is there anything wrong with that? I like weird.

*** Sorry to break it to you but there are gay people in the world? And it's not weird. Would you be saying you don't see the point in shipping a straight character with another straight character? No, probably not. As long as everyone is hetero then everything is awesome, right? Sorry, but that is homophobia.

And it's all about interpretation. You see Harry and/or Draco as straight? Cool. Fine. But the minute someone says that there could be an inkling of homosexuality or anything non-hetero, suddenly that's not okay or it's "weird". I see the most ridiculous of crack ships being thrown around (Harry/Pansy, Hermione/Snape, etc) and no one bats an eyelash--these ships even get plenty of recognition and praise. But slash and/or femslash ships are shot to hell, no matter how valid or invalid they may be. It's gross and yes, it is homophobic.

*** Okay but we only "know" these characters are straight from the epilogue. If you ignore the epilogue, they can plausibly be any sexuality the writer wants. The only canon characters that ever struck me as firmly straight were Molly and Arthur, everyone else was either a kid (and therefore could change), or not said.

Even if all of the characters sexuality was well explored in canon, your opinion is only valid if you ONLY read canon compliant fics. Anything else is just the author changing something for "shits and giggles." That'd be weird right?

**** But Ron and Hermione, Ginny and Harry, Pansy and Draco, Snape and Lily (well, he tried anyway.), James and Lily, Molly and Arthur, Bill and Fleur? They're all together or attempting to get together over the course of the story. It wasn't just all of a sudden the epilogue popped up and everyone was together.

***** Just because you're with someone of the opposite gender in one relationship does not mean you're forever and only attracted to that gender.

And no response to the second part of my comment? Am I to assume that you do only read only canon compliant fics?

And why are you on this post anyway? No one asked for opinions about how/why slash is "weird."

****** I have shipped that poor little moppet Draco Malfoy with just about everyone. If I can make him fancy Hermione, I sure as hell can make him gay. And as for how Harry can "suddenly" be gay? Voldemort's soul bits are gone, and they took the straight with 'em. Sorted. :)

****** Fair enough. I'm not arguing against having slash fics around, it's just not my thing.
