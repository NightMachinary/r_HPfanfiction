Here's an album of the [[https://imgur.com/gallery/BWTN8Vs][Owl Griffins]]. They're adorable and Hedwig being one would be amazing. She was one of my favorites characters alongside Hermione and Luna and I'd love to see a story where she is much more capable of deterring and threats made to Harry.

Take a look on this website. Look as the Strix and the gryphowl. Those are pretty close to what your thinking of.

***** It wasn't actually a plot point; the story was 'Dimension Hopping For Beginners', though I can't recall the author, and it was merely a mention in one of the worlds he came across. Not the best I've read, but pretty interesting.
