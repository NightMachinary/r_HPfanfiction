Specifically, I am very interested in fics where the traveler ended up in the past and gave a random name of someone he knows. In the end he ended up being that person from the beginning. Example, harry traveled to founders era and introduced himself as Salazar, just for kicks, without actually realising where he ended up. Any other interesting "it was me all along" time travel twist will do as well. Het/slash/gen will do. Thanks!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  Lily is prepared to do anything to save her son, so with her dying breath she finishes the ritual to cast her wish to the Wishmaster, asking to send Harry back into the past. Years before that fateful event, a green-eyed toddler is found by Salazar Slytherin, who decides to take him in as an heir. But the child has dreams much greater than simply being Slytherin's heir.

** M rated. AU post half blood prince but keeps main canon facts. Completed.

Hermione is the main perspective. Coherent, slow burn, well plotted. A little romance heavy, but overall good story.

One of my favourite marauder fics.

  When Harry finds himself in the time of the founders, he makes a shocking discovery. Meanwhile, in the present, Draco finds himself in desperate need of a bucket list. Rated T for "cheeky" behavior.

** I am writing a closed loop time travel story! It is not really a "ME ALL ALONG!" story though because yes it is a very open plan between the future version of the protagonist and the present/past version. Also yes there is a lot more going on than just the closed loop because things happen INSIDE the loop, and some small things can be changed if you try hard enough. Yes I took inspiration from my favorite TV SHOW 12 Monkeys and also from Kingdom Hearts for this story.
