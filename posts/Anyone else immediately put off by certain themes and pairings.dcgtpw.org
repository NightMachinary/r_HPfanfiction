Could have the greatest concept I have ever seen in fanfiction but then certain things are put in that just kind of saps the interest from me immediately.

Things like mpreg - don't know why but the mere idea of it can ensure that I don't read the fic. Doesn't matter who it's with or how it's done the whole concept of mpreg is just incredibly weird and more than a little bit cringey to me.

Or pedophilic pairings like HarryxSnape/Voldemort/Bellatrix/etc. I don't want to read your pedophile fantasies! No, I don't care if you insist they have a soul bond! No, I don't care if you think it's 'hot'. Characters shouldn't be paired with other characters that are old enough to be their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents! Tom Riddle was born in 1926. He was a legal adult when World War 2 ended!

The only acceptable method would involve time travel and I find the writing quality usually suffers in those cases.

Anyone else have any concepts or themes or pairings that they avoid like the plague?


** To be honest, it's usually blunt relationships, stuff like, "Oh, now I'm going to love you now." or "Oh, now I'll just have a harem, because one isn't enough." where there isn't any real buildup to the relationship, barely any hint, and then they want to Mate wie Kaninchen. I'm fine with slash and harem and any pairing, but I /despise/ relationships that have no base and are executed for no reason.

I've also grown numb to it, but ones where Harry just has all of the abilities or just has connections to random powerful families all of the sudden. there's no struggle, there's no fight, hell there's no reason to care because Harry will come in with his Große Penisenergie and solve all problems. It's good when executed correctly and given reason, but when he's suddenly just Überwältigt, it's highly annoying. That problem is also especially painful when given to OC characters shoved in so that the main character doesn't die. Es bugsiert wirklich den Mist aus mir heraus.

*** I hate harems because I'm in a polyamotus constellation and all Harems are just 1 chatacter using the other characters for pleasure.

Which is like NOT what a poly constellation its multiple people in a equal relationship. harems are disgusting because they dont treat their boyfriends or girlfriends as anything but a conveinent hole.

I like 3 or 4 some relationships usually in slashfics as most often they actually treat them as people

**** Not all of the harems are just sex-fest orgies. I've seen one or two that actually treat the people in it as just a girlfriend and boyfriend, but there are two of them. Some of them I've seen are kinda dumb, like a long hidden house of phoenix that hasn't been used in Hogwarts for hundreds of years, and whoever the male is, has a house worth of females in his harem, but some actually so it well. But a majority do it bad.

**** I have always been confused as to why Ginny would need love potions since she is canonically described as being very pretty, having quite a charming personality and also quite able to move on when her affection is not reciprocated (sure she ends up with Harry but until Harry realizes he likes her, she minds her own business).

***** The trope is typically used in Weasley bashing fics, so I don't think logic and reason apply. As far as her being pretty and charming, I've seen this trope used in quite a few fics where Harry turns out to be gay after he stops taking the potions.

** Mmmhmm. Mpreg is actually my biggest one as it squicks me the hell out and I won't read anything with it in the story no matter the story. Extreme abuse Dursley's is another one I'm tired of, and so are the huge number of Independent! Harry stories that read exactly the same. Super! Harry stories come to mind as well as they're very rarely done well, and always contain poorly written smut that turns me off.

** I hate pairing Harry and Hermione with Death Eater scums, period.

That being said, I do not object these pairings in time travels and extreme AUs. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is after all one of my favorite fics.

Ultimately though, it comes down to writing, character and plot development.

"Hadrian". I have yet to see a fic featuring this word that wasn't cringe worthy

Evil!Dumbledore fics

Weasley bashing

Weirdly enough tho I'm not that put off by mpreg in the HP universe. I still don't particularly like it but as long as it's not the main focus of the story but implied I can cope. I guess it's plausible enough to me that wizards would try and potentionally succeed in making it possible for men to conceive to get over it even if I'm normally repulsed by the concept

** I'm super put-off by most Harry/Hermione fics, as they tend to be the most boring romances possible. I've only found a few worth reading outside of one-shots.

Besides that, I'm not picky at all about pairings. As a lesbian, I don't care much for M/M pairings, or het pairings with super macho guys, but I'm fine with pretty much everything else otherwise.

I'm fine with most themes, but I tend to back out of most fics the moment Ron or the other Weasleys are bashed. I don't like bashing in any form, but Weasley bashing irks me the most, just because so many people do it and it's hardly justified to the extent that they're bashed

** Mpreg is an unconditional drop for me. Doesn't matter if the fic has one of the premises I like and my favorite pairing in my favorite era (yes, there is actually a fic that fulfills these traits). It's still a drop.

There's a lot of ships that also causes me to ignore a fic -- far too many to list. But the most common ones among my usual filters is main-focus Jily, main-focus slash/femslash, any Snarry and any Tomarry.

There's also things that cause me to ignore the fic unless other things make up for it (be it me liking the premise, it having one of my preferred pairings, etc), such as soulmate fics.

  Mpreg, for example, I can now read once I learned it's a somewhat common kink in the gay community.
#+end_quote

From what I've read, it's a kink amongst slash writers, but members of the gay community are divided on the topic. I've seen some people voice opposition due to the fetishized and extremely unrealistic portrayal of gay relationships and the forcing of gay relationships into het gender roles (feminization of men, etc.)

- teenage pregnancy for example is an insta-close (unless it gets aborted because IMHO kids should not have kids!)

- same for slash (just not interested - I am not homophobic, hell I am all for giving homosexuals the same rights (marriage included, despite the fact that I despise marriage!) as heterosexualy (I am glad that Germany finally did this a few years ago!))

- bad spelling (especially of things that are canon - occulmancy for example (it is called OCCLUMENCY -.-) or similar things Epleriamus...damned, stop it I am in pain reading this!)

- Hermione worship! Seriously, she is pretty flawed in canon (and not as smart as she thinks, because her grades take a lot of effort and time, while a true genius wouldn't need to spend that much time - look at Snape and the Marauders who were all good students, but didn't spend much time on it (they were busy - Snape was busy making better potions recipes and the Marauders were busy pranking people and sneaking around and becoming animagi etc.))
