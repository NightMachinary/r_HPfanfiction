Okay, so currently I'm writing a dark ginny fic. Where in ginny goes full death eater and even tries to overthrow the dark lord. I also want Ginny to end up with Bellatrix. At first, I was going to have it be that ginny just convinces her to see that the dark lord will never love her, but then I thought that it would be a nice bit of irony if Bellatrix is aware that he'll never love her, but that she's okay with it because he'll be happy.

​

It really works with Ginny as a character because all this time she's only cared about people who care about her and has only worked to maintain friendly bonds with people who like her(her fellow Slytherins) and disregard people who don't (Her family). Bellatrix throws a curveball at her by being someone who knows she won't be loved but doesn't care. It completely shatters ginny's view on love and relationships.

​

It's nice from a plot twist, but I still want my ship to sail, so I need her to still turn against the dark lord.

How would you get a dark death eater ginny to get bellatrix to turn on the dark lord?


** If she's cunning enough to achieve such a thing, the obvious way would be for Ginny to place Voldemort in a situation where it is convenient for him to sacrifice Bellatrix like a pawn in a chess game. Bellatrix may not be foolish enough to think the Dark Lord loves her the way /she/ loves /him/, but I'd assume she is still very devoted to the idea that Voldemort /values/ her more than anyone else, and would be heartbroken if he showed otherwise. Perhaps Voldemort has to choose between Bellatrix and Nagini, and, perhaps not knowing that Nagini is a Horcrux, Bellatrix goes ballistic when it becomes apparent he likes his /pet snake/ better than her?

*** Bellatrix being mad about being shoved aside for a pet snake would make more sense if Nagini was a dumb animal, and not as much if Nagini was known to be sentient.

All the Death Eaters have seen Voldemort talk to her in front of them, and they know Voldy's sent Nagini off on private missions, like Arthur Weasley in the DoM on Christmas of 1996. At the very least, Nagini's contributions would be ranked among the lower-tier Death Eaters like Pettigrew.

**** Well, yes, Bellatrix proabbly does know Nagini is a person --- but that's all the more reason to be jealous. Presumably they don't know she used to be human, so she'd fall under Death Eaters' prejudice against nonhumans.

*** Something about your comment made something click for me. What if I don't square this circle? What if she doesn't stay with Ginny because she loves her?

What if I have her kill Voldemort and have her Bellatrix try and avenge the dark lord. So far Ginny's motives for keeping Bellatrix alive are that she enjoys her company and she does think that they were both abuse victims. What if the reason Bella stays with Ginny is that she wants to kill her. It's only that Ginevra proves herself as a capable dark lord that she does. That way Bella stays in character and I get a fun relationship dynamic.

Bellatrix never says she loves her or shows her any outward feelings of affection. Ginny gets to show how far she's cracked by having taunt Bellatrix that she is enjoying the world she's created while also playfully threatening her to smile cause it's the only thing keeping her alive.

***** Thanks for all the help. I read your fic and I'm enjoying your work the one thing I will say is I don't like the fact that the dark lord calls Ginny, Ginny; I prefer it when Voldemort calls her Ginevra. Not only because it feels in character with him to use the more formal name, but it highlights the divide from Ginny's old life to her new one. Ginny is what her friends and family call her, but Ginevra is what the dark lord calls her.

This would work well in your story because it's another form of psychological control the dark lord has on her by renaming her. It strips her of her old identity and replacing it with one the dark lord created.

On a positive note; I enjoy the fact that Ginny isn't some god child who can steamroll her opponents. Her victories will feel earned. I also enjoy your foreshadowing if that scene in the great hall actually does happen in the end. (don't tell me if it does)

** Regulus was a devoted death eater that turned against Voldemort the moment he learned about a horcrux, so at least one black thought that splitting your soul was crossing a line which must not be crossed.

** Bellatrix's character traits are fanatical insanity and loyalty, so doing this in character can be tricky. Some options

1. Change the character: You don't have to stay completely loyal to canon. Maybe Bella is one of Voldemort's more contentious henchmen who constantly questions him, and she just believes that you have to put on a loyal face in public. Or as some people mentioned, you can add jealously or something similar.
2. Dark Lord isn't evil enough: You can make Voldemort more pragmatic (He doesn't actually like torturing, he just does it because it works on his dark followers, he just wants power. If it makes sense he will lie low and forbid additional attacks until the heat dies off). By leaving Bella a fanatic and making voldemort more rational, you can have a conflict where Bella decides Voldemort isn't evil enough because he is making compromises and power plays instead of just going all in.
3. "He made me like this": Bella is a doe-eyed new recruit who volunteers herself to the dark lord, and he decides to experiment on her, warping her mind to his whim. Thus Bella is a creation of the dark lord, much like Nagini. Your turn comes from temporarily (or partially) bringing back the girl she used to be, and then having her go "My god, what did he make me do".
4. "I got help". This is more for a heel-face turn rather than changing masters, but you can have Bella address her insanity. Maybe she gets accidentally put into a Muggle mental hospital. Maybe she is captured on a mission abroad and they have better magical mental health services than Britain. You basically end up with Harley Quinn from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_and_Harley_Quinn][Batman and Harley Quinn]]. Again, this doesn't really work for changing evil masters, unless you are going to make Ginny less 'dark' and more 'grey'

*** Yeah, during the scene where ginny confronts bellatrix I plan on bella mocking her that she understands love better than ginny does. Only to tick ginny off so much that she tells bellatrix why she's so much better than the dark lord one of those reasons being she actually is a pure blood and for bellatrix not to believe it.
