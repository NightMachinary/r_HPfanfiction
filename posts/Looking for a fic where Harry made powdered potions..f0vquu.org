  In this fic i remember harry making powdered versions of potions, he then put these potions in shotgun shells to help a group of muggles defend their town in case death eaters attacked. he even made a powder potion version of the killing curse. he didnt care about breaking the statute of secrecy he only cared about keeping people safe.
