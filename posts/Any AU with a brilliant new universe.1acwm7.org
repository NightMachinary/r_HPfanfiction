So I´ve read two novels that I absolutely love, given how the authors have managed to take some parts of the Harry Potter story and created their very own remake of the universe. I will recommend you go read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][The Lords of Magic]] though it is currently inactive, as well as [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird´s Son]] which is a work in progress.

So, have any of you come upon any good stories like these? It may just be, that they have remodeled the magical world, such as making it more pronounced that it is different from muggle life.


** It's not really AU, but the [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=79048][Alexandra Quick]] series. It takes place in America at an American Wizarding School and is almost a completely separate series in itself.

*** aw, I hate it when your favourites are abandoned. Mine might as well be :( Oh well, atleast he gave me good ideas for my story.

Thank you for your recommendations.

Prince of a Dark Kingdom. Well I don't know... I tried reading the first chapter but it just make me shake my head.

Personally I don't enjoy the way MoR has turned out. I liked it previously, but his "Harry" makes me cringe too much.

I will try out Butterfly Effect and Unspeakable things, and see if they are any good. I can't stand the disappointment of not knowing what will come when stories are abandoned.

**** Butterfly Effect is indeed spectacular... although it's not really AU in terms of creating a new universe {it's more AU in terms of plot and character development}. There's a lot to like if you can tolerate femmeslash and hurt/comfort.

Unspeakable Things is also very good. Better by far than the majority of Darth Marrs' other stuff.

***** well, I am done with Unspeakable things now, and I enjoyed it very much. It is strange to see how they morph certain characters entirely instead of just creating new ones, but if you see past that it was good. Not flawless, but good nonetheless.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]] - It is continuation, fully compatible with canon (including epilogue) - but as it takes canon and mercilessly extrapolates it to its logical conclusions in style it is quite AUish.

*** Necro, I know, but I had to comment and thank you for linking this. What a dark, horrifying, utterly plausible take on the hideous underbelly of the Weasleys, the Golden Trio, and the whole magical world.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/979216/1/The-Dragonmasters][The Dragonmasters]] is okay... if you like elves and high fantasy type stuff. Also, not finished and probably never will be.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle]] - amazing humour, interesting plot, bonus points for avoiding dumb!Ron, good worldbuilding. Sequel is a WIP.

*** I have read that one. Laughed my pants off at first :) I don't know why so many fanfic writers insist on having Ron being a stupid/dumb/jealous jerk. I mean, it was prevalent in the fourth book, but he is not that bad.

**** And anybody is free to introduce as many AU elements as (s)he likes - and it includes character of Ron.
