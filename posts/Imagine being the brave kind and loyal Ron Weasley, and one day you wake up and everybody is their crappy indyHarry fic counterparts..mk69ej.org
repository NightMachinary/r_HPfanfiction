Poor, poor Ron. How is he going to convince Harry that he is not the devil incarnate or Ginny that love potioning isn't right?

I picture him trying to set things right only to indy! Harry go around misinterpreting situations and thinking he's evil while Ron curse canon! Harry, deducing that his bad luck rub on him and transport him to a crazy alternative universe and trying to bribe evil!Hermione with eating with his mouth shut (thing that he actually almost always does, but for some reason everyone thinks he doesn't) to get her studying interdimensional travel for "the greater good" in case they have to replace indy!Harry only to drag HIS Harry and HIS Hermione there, because he won't suffer an special branch Harry's induced insanity alone!

Edit: English is not my native language. If I misspelled something please tell me.


** I once had an idea for a oneshot in which Harry goes indy!, but then it all backfires and he was wrong about everything, it was a good!Weasleys and reasonable!Dumbledore all along. He was just being a massive paranoid twat, and got suckered into a scam by the goblins.

So the idea of a normal and/or good Ron having to play the straight man to a bunch of indy! bullshit is pretty appealing. I'm not sure about the interdimensional travel part, though.

*** Ron is just /assuming/ he is in an alternative dimension. It kinda makes more sense to him than everyone going crazy.

Maybe he will pull two random sane versions of his friends if he manages to figure out dimension travel, like an Auror Harry and a time tuner user thirteen year old Hermione or a Minister of Magic Hermione and six year old Harry. Then he sends them back (in case of six year old Harry he just send him with adult Hermione to have a better life than the one he had at the Dursleys) and decide to better send himself to another more normal dimension. Landing in this other universe like a Deus Ex Machina before third year and saving the day.

Another end: He puts Harry and Hermione in therapy, he doesn't know what therapy is, but he has heard Hermione say that helps people with issues, and his friends /REALLY/ need help, so he asks a random muggleborn or Hermione's parents. Maybe everyone acting indy is a magical disease that Ron is immune and/or asymptomatic, maybe a magical artifact that Ron activate by accident caused it all, and being away from magic just reverts people to normal. Who knows?

I have more scenarios playing in my mind, but this is getting too long I have to sleep in half an hour because tomorrow is a test-day to me!

Don't get me wrong, bashing /any/ character gets tiresome as hell, but he literally walked out on them because Harry got trapped in a death tournament and /again/ because the food sucked. And yes, I know he was being affected by the amulet, but so were Hermione and Harry, and neither of them turned on the others.

***** Ron is /mostly/ a good friend in canon. And in this promt they are in /Hogwarts/ so the Horrocrux incident hasn't happened.

The worst thing Ron /did/ to the date was left Harry during the start of the Triwizard, and while I'm not justifying what he did I think he has a little of an inferiority complex that got the best of him.

In the Horrocrux business I can't say a lot to defend him, but I think the food was only /one/ of the reasons, the Horrocrux could have been poison him in others aspects other than /food/.

Let's not forget that Ron has something to go back to, like a loving family. He is a pure blood, so he knows that he wouldn't be treated too badly even if he is poor, and he's afraid. He can be discovered camping with the most wanted man in wizarding Britain and what would happen to his family?

I'm not saying that's Harry and Hermione were /not/ afraid, but what did they have to come back for? They were basically orphans fighting for people that the great majority of them were assholes to both. (Harry with public constant ridicule and Hermione in fourth year as basically a declaring her whore through the Prophet). The only thing they have to fight was their rights to live, which can be a pretty good motivator.

Like I said, I'm not trying to justify what Ron did, left them like that was a pretty shitty thing to do, but he was a kid, an afraid kid, and afraid people do stupid things, maybe the food was the last straw and he was just afraid and want to go home.

I don't actually like Ron, I'm just analysing his possible motives, but I don't think of him as a /bad/ friend.

In my fic I use the Horrocrux episode as a "I don't think I can trust you as much as before and I don't think I can still be your best friend, but I think being just regular friends is okay." before breaking they friendship completely with sending Ginny to Azkaban for a crime she didn't commit and Harry not defending her. (He didn't jump in her defense basically because his actual best friend commit the crime in question and Harry sticks with her rather than Ginny. Also, they were going through a not very friendly divorce. In my fic being the host of an Horrocrux let's lingering effects, emphasizing their worst characteristics and/or copying Tom Riddle ones. My Harry will let Britain burn and not raise a single eyebrow if you are not a very close friend of his and are in the burning pile.)

Note: I don't think my syntaxis is all all right, but me and my self study in the english lenguaje are trying.
