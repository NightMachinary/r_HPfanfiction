:END:
Hi, I've been looking for a fic I read for a while, basically Fred and George found Pettigrew at Hogwarts (on the map I think) and represented Sirius at trial, each chapter was from a different characters point of view (Barty Crouch Sr was one of them I remember), I just haven't been able to find it again Thanks


** sounds fun,I want to read it

** I'm not sure about the fic, but I should mention, the flair 'Request' is for when you're asking for new stories. 'What's that fic?' is the one you should be using right now.
