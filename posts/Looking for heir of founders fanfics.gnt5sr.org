As long as they are complete that's all that matters. Can be any pairing. I also prefer bad Dumbledore aspects. Thank you!

** There was an old fic where Harry and co including Luna and Neville spend the summer trying to get stronger in order to keep up with Harry who has gotten the sword or gryffindor as His zanpakto (bleach reference) and is going to be learning from it. It was actually quite an interesting fic where crossover powers from various anime and books were used without full crossovers
