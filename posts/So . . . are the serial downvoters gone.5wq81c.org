****** This is not at all fair. Nobody called him a rapist. People have consistently criticised the way he presents serious and sensitive topics in his writing, which is valid - if he just admitted it was rape porn and stopped pretending he was trying to do the world a favour by writing this stuff there wouldn't be a problem. People have tried to give him tips and advice for writing things more sensitively, and have explained to him that writing shocking and edgy content is naturally going to provoke strong reactions from people. If he can't handle that, he shouldn't write about those topics. He doesn't like the criticism, obviously, but his response has been childish and attention seeking multiple times, including flouncing off the subreddit and creating multiple accounts. (The watch list request thread was created by an account that seems to have been made specifically for that purpose and hasn't posted since. It was almost certainly GT stirring up drama)

As it happens, I do think people went a bit too far in provoking him, but I think it's completely unreasonable to suggest that anyone drove him to near suicide. That's a really serious allegation to make and I think would only have justification if any of this had affected his personal life or people had been sending personal messages. As far as I am aware this did not occur. If somebody genuinely were to commit suicide based on responses to their Harry Potter fanfic, they have a lot more going on in their life; no one in this community is responsible for that, but many of us did actually reach out and encourage him to seek professional help.

There are a very select few who can be described as bullying him. Most of them aren't. He writes stories that include many horrible things and justifies them in a way that baffles and upsets most people. Nobody has told him that he can't do that, many have told him that he shouldn't. He clearly doesn't understand the topics that are, in many cases, the focal points of his stories. He is playing the victim card and he is not the victim. What you casually ignore is that many of those posts that you claim criticize, bash, ridicule, or mock him, tell him that he needs to step back and seek help if things are really as bad as he makes them out to be. It's a constant cry for attention with him, nobody else has started multiple threads about themselves. He needs a different kind of help than this board can provide him and expecting all of us to treat somebody with kid gloves who writes about morally repugnant things in a way that focuses on sexual gratification instead of the affects of abuse is ridiculous. People suffering from any kind of mental illness, be it depression or something more clinical, are still responsible for their words and actions. Being criticized is not being bullied.

This all comes back to the original post that I replied to, which was an out and out lie. Nobody said that he deserved bullying to the point of suicide, they said he deserved criticism for his disgusting portrayal of rape in particular. There was no circle jerk of hate or bullying.

******* People tend to specify 'no slash' in a lot of requests.

As an lgbt person, that's a bit disheartening. It feels a bit like segregation.

Tbh its also a bit unexpected (at first) because fanfiction has traditionally been an open community with proportionally more women than men. In a sub survey we did a while ago we found there's significantly more men than women here, and as such, attitudes towards gay people are different from what those of us who are lgbt are familiar with in most ff communities.

That is, more like in mainstream media, lesbians are accepted (ish, but only as titillating), and gay male relationships are, if not frowned upon, talked about as something that everyone would prefer not to have to see or acknowledge.

I'm not sure if straight male fans are aware that this is the feeling created when they make requests phrased that way, which is why I'm bringing it up.

EDIT: I have to say, the flood of downvotes that this and my other comment on the matter have received, from being +5s earlier in the day, only makes me feel more strongly that there's been a shift in this community. Forgive me for suggesting that requests are able to be phrased in a less blunt manner.

I treat requests as a boolean search basically, list my specifics(post war, canon complaint, Hermione, Wizarding law), exclusions ( Ginny bash, Dumbledore bash, HG/DM), and anything not excluded is fair game (major character death, fem slash, AU, Mary Sue).

Requests and LFs are inherently segregated by design. People are asking and searching for specific kinds of fics the community can help isolate organically for them. Whether or not and how a OP filters their request is up to them. Also whether or not the sub chooses to follow the filters is also up to them also.

Making certain requests with filters like /canon, slash, AU, character, etc/ is also learned behavior from well beyond a year ago. FFnet, AO3, etc also all teach us to filter and sort our searches there, why this sub should be any different I'm not sure.

In the nicest way possible, maybe you (and others in your position) should take that into account when phrasing requests.

Your expression of what is to you, a preference, when expressed that way reads as a rejection, even an exclusion, to those of us who are lgbt individuals in this community. You don't want to see evidence that we exist. You'd rather only consume a world where we expressly don't.

********** That doesn't make any sense. He's specifically talking about LFs and Requests - and those /are/ a community driven search engine.

For example: You (as a heterosexual male) want to read a story where Harry and Snape both are protagonists of the story. As this category is mostly populated by slash fics for some reason, it makes sense to exclude them from your request, as you aren't interested in reading them.

And that preference is not (like you imply) because they'd rather read a story where lgbt individuals don't exist, but because they don't want to read stories that were written for a target audience they aren't part of.

Erotic stories only work if the reader finds the content erotic. A heterosexual reader won't find a homosexual love scene to be erotic, so why would they read it?\\
Same for romance: Romantic stories only work if the reader finds the content romantic. Reading the description of how a guy secretly fantasizes about another guy might look romantic to a female heterosexual reader or a homosexual male one, but for the heterosexual male reader it's just a passage of words where you think “okay, I guess?“, because you can't really see the appeal yourself.

But the question is are they just for the OP? Lots of people on this sub will see a thread like that and think "Hey I'd like to read that too!" including people who read slash.

In your example it makes sense to say no slash because the request is basically for two specific people who aren't in a relationship. Just like if someone wanted fics where Harry and a girl are best friends but not together. But recently it seems like most of the requests say no slash, even when the request is for some random scenario that isn't likely to get lots of slash fics.

For example, a few days ago someone wanted Snape to be killed by Lupin in the Shrieking Shack. I had a fic I could have posted if it hadn't said no slash, but I didn't post it because it had a bit of Remus/Sirius in it. Even if the OP wouldn't want to read that, it could have easily been skipped over, and other people could have enjoyed it.

I guess the feeling is that people who read slash can't really avoid het, so it's unfair for the sub as a whole to avoid slash. That's probably one of the reasons why [[/r/HPSlashFic]] got made, because people were tired of seeing no slash at the bottom of every request. That's not to say no one should request things without slash, because it would be unfair on someone who didn't want to read slash if most of their thread was filled with slash. But most requests wouldn't get huge amounts of slash recced if people didn't say no slash.

And to those who say they don't want it because most slash is bad, that's basically saying you don't trust our judgement to decide what's good. Like people who read het can decide if a fic is good enough to be posted here, but if you read slash, you can't be trusted. It does make me a bit sad.

Anyway, I think I went on a tangent, and not all of this was directed at you, it's more to the community in general.

which is why I talked about Requests and LFs, but you seem to be talking more about the community in general. Which should see inclusion from all sides, but it is nearly impossible to not offend someone in the unknowableness of reddit. I mean your exclusion/rejection point can be applied in reverse to het people or really any group of people. In same way someone might request /slash only/ that excludes or offends anyone with a recommendation that isn't slash.

I do agree that you might be looking into requests too much./opinion/ I would be more concerned with the follow up to someone's perceived offensiveness.

I didn't mention if I read slash or not, because I would rather you read a comment and not look into. Its seems maybe you assumed I didn't read or like slash and preferred not to be bothered with lgbt existence because I'm a straight guy. It probably didn't cross your mind that I would find your last assumptions hurtful, which is not your fault we don't know each other. If you did, you would know I was walking down Halstead St into Boystown, Chicago or that liked to read Marauder and Snape character exploration fics that tend to have a fair bit of slash.

TL;DR - You can't account for everyone that will read your request, but can be aware of people in discussions.

It may well be the case that we come from different cultures which has also affected the way I read or perceive comments or requests. To bluntly state 'no slash' reads automatically to me as an almost aggressive statement.

Which is why from the beginning I phrased my comments in terms of how phrasing can make readers /feel/, rather than directly attacking what it is that is said.

It just feels like a double standard. I don't think I've ever seen a request from an lgbt reader stating bluntly 'no het' or the like.

****** I've never seen a problem with slash. While I think gay sex is a bit disgusting, that doesn't mean I hate gay people or dislike stories with slash pairings. If it's a good story, I will read it. I don't care if Harry is fucking a girl, guy, centaur, dementor, his mother, or his cat. I'll never understand why people are averse to reading stories where Harry isn't heterosexual.

******* I just hate them because they all feel badly written. Maybe I am a cold blooded, black hearted prick without an ounce of empathy, but I literally cannot believe almost all the slash stories. Oh, look, Harry is gay and feeling awkward, Malfoy is super gay and bullies Harry before making out with him, and then they live happily ever after.

Maybe there is something wrong with me that I find it easier to believe in magic than in romance.

******** I have (mostly) limited myself to slash fics of quality, namely in writing and plot. Athey's, for example. I stay away from poorly written/formatted fics no matter the pairing/plot. Has this kept me away from the more poorly written fics?

******** Isn't that summarising like saying in canon Ron bullied Hermione and then ended up marrying her? Its true, but it completely deletes everything in the middle that took 700,000 words to go from the bullying to the marrying. If long fics were made to be judged by their beginning and end cobbled together into an awkward generalizing sentence, then most fics that this subreddit calls good would be the exact same thing.

It feels like less of a 'coldhearted' thing and more of a 'I can't be arsed to read a story so I'll see the beginning and the end and summarize it' thing.

******* I don't know. I don't care. I knew from the day I came to this sub that it wasn't home to many people who like any romance other than Harry 'white-knighting' with a girl. Its dumb, but it is what it is.

******** Its not about that. I don't mind slash if its well written. But most often its smut, and the pairing makes me sick. Harry x Snape. Snape x Draco. Voldemort x Harry. Well, some Voldemort x Harry fics aren't terrible, since they have the pairing as part of the story, instead of the main purpose. I don't mind Harry x Draco if its done like a proper story, like with plot development, and buildup, same thing with more rare pairs like Harry x Theo or Harry x Blaise. But as a het, I just can't get behind smut slash with disgusting pairings.

** Isn't there something built into reddit that downvotes threads. I think it does it over time to artificially move the newer stuff forwards but it might have something that downvotes a thread until someone posts, like an anti-spam filter thing. Or I could be talking out my arse, happens sometimes.

** I agree with boomberrybella, but I personally sometimes go on a "downvote" spree, mostly if I've just been burned by a specific fanfic. An example that comes to mind was this out of nowhere Harry x Snape pairing, which made me go through the reddit posts and just downvote anyone asking for a Snape centric or Harry slash story. I've got nothing against slash, but this just feels like paedophilia.
