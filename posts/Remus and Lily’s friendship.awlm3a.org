In a bunch of Marauders-Era fics I've read, Lily and Remus are super close before Lily and James get together although Lily at that point thinks James (and probably Sirius) is an “arrogant toerag”. I guess it sort of makes sense, as they were likely both prefects. But I also think that's kind of weird, because the thing Remus cared most about was his friends and befriending a girl who hated his best friend doesn't seem like a thing Remus would do. So, what are your opinions? Were Lily and Remus close or just acquaintances before seventh year?


** I never understood making Lily Remus's absolute closest friend, since he never mentions her to Harry. He always talks about James. It's always him. The only person who talked about her was Slughorn. And she doesn't speak a world to him in OotP, no request to help her or anything of the sort, nor did he try to help her if she was indeed very close friend, best friend or even just a friendly acquaintance. Even if they were prefects together that doesn't mean they were best friends forever. We don't even know if they had any shared interests and Lily seemed to despise James's group. People confuse the movies with the books, nowhere does he ever say that Lily was there at a time for him when no one else was.

If anything, that person is James. Remus and James's friendship is so overlooked in the fandom for some reason. This guy befriended an outcast - not just in school - but also society. Being even slightly related to him in any way shape or form would raise eyebrows but he still supported him financially, was his best friend and offered him a home to live at. James doesn't get nearly enough credit. He even became an Animagus for him. One of my biggest pet peeves is to trash that all in favour of making Lily his bff based on a quite that was in the movies and not many people might consider canon, just because you might not like James and want to make Lily seem even more perfect by giving one of James's good qualities to her. It reminds me of what people do to Ron and Hermione, giving Hermione all of Ron's qualities and leaving him nothing. No wonder some people think James had little to absolutely none redeeming qualities.

Even when Harry said he heard his parents, Remus didn't whisper 'Lily?' he said, clearly, 'You heard James?' he didn't even indicate the fact that he knew her at all. No 'Lily and James?', just James. Which is even stranger when you realise the movie made her seem like his fairy godmother while James was a crappy boy with a crappier haircut, whom he doesn't speak of at all.

It's canon fact that James and Remus were extremely close friends, there is not even any sort of indication that Lily and Remus even liked each other or got along at all. In her letter, she mentions James, 'Wormy', the Mckinnons, Harry, Dumbledore, Bathilda Bagshot (someone she barely knows) and the cat, as well as Petunia, who hates her. Remus who? Her best friend forever of course, based on a quote in the movie that isn't even canon. He was never mentioned.

I don't even think she was a prefect, contrary to what people believe. And even if she was a prefect, that doesn't mean they ever got along working together, let alone an indication that they were childhood best friends. It's never stated in the books that she was. He says he was a prefect and he never mentions Lily being one to Harry. What's even stranger is that he doesn't even mention her and James being Head Boy and Head Girl. Why would Remus miss an opportunity to tell Harry more about his parents?

Of course, there's a slim chance they might have indeed been best friends and Rowling forgot to mention that fact or indicate it at all. However, I don't think it is that likely. In an AU that would work and people are free to write it as such, but it's often times treated as the word of God, when it's really not.

*** Yeah, I definitely agree with your points. James was Remus's best friend, not Lily, and even if they were friends it probably would have been a Harry/Dean kind of relationship. You also brought to my attention that Remus barely ever talks about Lily. The only time I can recall he does is when he and Sirius are talking to Harry through the fire in OotP, and all he says is something like “Your mother and James started dating in 7th year” and nothing else. And about Lily not mentioning Remus in the letter; we know Sirius was very suspicious of Remus around that time, and the letter was written very close to Lily and James's deaths, so maybe that's why she didn't mention him. Maybe Lily was suspicious of him as well? Which provides further evidence that Lily and Remus weren't close.

i think jkr soft-retconned james and lily being head boy and head girl. it's *only* mentioned by hagrid in the first book, in and out of canon written by jkr, and likely before jkr decided what the marauders' personality would be like. it's kind of silly to make james head boy when he wasn't a prefect, and was a bully for five years. it can be played off as hagrid being mistaken in canon

not even slug, who constantly boasts about lily, mentions her being head girl

***** So much stuff in that chapter is so wildly out of line with the later books, even Chamber of Secrets (also I love that book, despite what others might say about it). So I don't really mind this dialogue, especially when it's the usual talk about parents being awesome that is found. In. Every. Single. Book. With. An. Orphan.

Which gets so boring so quickly. James was finally thrown off his pedestal which made me love him. He actually has potential to become a complex character now that we know his flaws and if you want to flesh him out. Lily however, not so much. Which is frustrating because she's pretty much the only female in that era that we know of and she's a symbol instead of a person.

***** i don't think he was lying. the watsonian reason is that he was mistaken/misremembering, which is my headcanon to make sense of how it's never mentioned anywhere again, and what we know about the characters. maybe he read about them being heads in some piece written about them after they were killed by voldemort and harry became a celebrity, and appended that onto his knowledge of them

the doylist reason is that i think jkr soft-retconned/forgot about it.

it's somewhat similar to remus not contacting harry, or being in the photos, pre-poa. i think the doylist reason is that he just wasn't invented yet, the watsonian is that he's avoidant etc.

** I think they were acquaintances at most. I'm basing this off how Lily talks in DH when Snape implies Lupin is a werewolf. She doesn't focus on Lupin at all. When using his 'ill' excuse, she doesn't say Lupin claims to be ill. She says "they" said it. It's not something he tells her himself. Plus, in PoA, Remus noticeably reacts different to Harry hearing James' voice compared to Lily. That's when he reveals James was his friend.

I know they added their friendship to the movie but, even after 7th year, the books don't mention a close relationship between them. We only know that Lily wrote happily to Sirius (and trusted him enough to leave her family's life in his hands) and seemed concerned about Peter. There was no mention of Remus (and she might have suspected him just as James and Sirius did.)

I don't think they were supposed to be close.

** nothing in canon, or written by jkr, indicates that they were particularly close. he doesn't talk about being prefects with her, nor bring up her skill at potions when harry talks to him about the hbp. iirc, he doesn't really talk about her at all, her personality, or any relationship they might have had, outside of her relationship with james.

  The downfall of Voldemort, such a source of jubilation to the rest of the wizarding community, marked the beginning of a long stretch of loneliness and unhappiness for Remus. *He had lost his three close friends* and, with the Order disbanded, his previous comrades returned to busy lives with families.

** At that age, Remus wants to be accepted more than anything. I can't really see him thinking too much of the fact that Lily dislikes James and Sirius, beyond saying something like "Lily, they're not that bad" as a response to occasional rants about them. He did not stand up for James or Sirius' harassment of Slytherins, so why would he stand up to Lily about her dislike for the other Marauders?

I can see them both decide mutually to not badger each other about their other friends despite their dislike for them (Other Marauders for Remus, Severus for Lily)

** There is this from Rowling:

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm]]

Lupin was very fond of Lily, we'll put it like that, but I wouldn't want anyone to run around thinking that he competed with James for her. She was a popular girl, and that is relevant. But I think you've seen that already. She was a bit of a catch.

---------

That doesn't mean they were particularly close, but I think it suggests at least something of a relationship. I don't put a ton of weight on him not talking about her because the earlier books go through major gymnastics not to reveal the connection between Lily/Snape until the final climax. I've also always interpreted Lily's “they say he's ill” as her knowing damn well Sev's theory is right but not being willing to blow up Remus' life, and so conveniently hiding behind the nebulous, authoritative “they” rather than escalating things by citing what Remus specifically says.

My thought is they were casual friends in early years. Not super-close, but probably on better terms than she was with his rowdier friends.
