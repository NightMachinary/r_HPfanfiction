It's been awhile since I read this, but I'm fairly sure there are entire chapters (or at least large chunks) throughout that describe LV's rise.

and recently found this one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11015768/1/The-Dark-Lord-Exposed]]) Seems to be what you're looking for, but I haven't read it yet so... no guarantees.

  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.
