:END:
As the title reads. The only things I remember are that Sirius (or Remus) finds Harry nearly frozen to death on a park bench, and that they bring Harry back to Sirius place. There might have been a scene later on where Harry and Ron are kidnapped, but I could honestly be confusing that with another fic.

  Lily and James survived Voldemort's attack, but their infant son was believed dead. Twelve years later, Harry Potter is found and brought home, but the real struggle has just begun. Ensemble fic about a family's recovery as old enemies return.
