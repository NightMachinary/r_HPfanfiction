The only things that I can remember about this fic is that Harry was apprenticed under Flitwick, studying dueling. I think that Flitwick's previous apprentice was Dolohov, but his previous apprentice did become a death eater. Harry may have competed on an amateur dueling circuit as well? My main interest in this fic is that Flitwick described several dueling styles. He may have used a pensieve to demonstrate these styles? If anyone knows which fic this is, or any other fics that name and expound upon dueling styles I'd appreciate it. Thanks!
