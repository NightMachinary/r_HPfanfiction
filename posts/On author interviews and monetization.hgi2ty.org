Hi, everyone,

I run a podcast called FanWorks Studios (which can be found on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts) that serializes select fanfiction in audiobook format with the permission of the associated authors.

I'm considering making a sister podcast (FanWorks: Interviews) under the FanWorks umbrella where I interview fanfiction authors and talk about their work.

I'm curious to know if anyone would be interested in being interviewed for this, but I also have another question related to this.

Would it be ethical to monetize the second podcast?

If I did this, the authors interviewed would receive a cut of the earnings (say, 20% at minimum) for a week after their specific episode went up.

I welcome your opinions.

Thanks for reading.

** Honestly, 2-3% is kinda insult territory, unless you think you can make more than 10k+ per episode.

I would rather get nothing than $2.

If you really want to do something, send them either a pizza or flowers or sth, but for < $200 it really becomes uncomfortable otherwise.

If you don't like that, give a real cut (10-30%) to a charity of the guest's chosing.
