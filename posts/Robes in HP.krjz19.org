A thought occoured to me about something I never thought to question today. Why in god's name do wizards and witches wear robes? Like, I get the whole "mysticak sorcerer in robes and a pointy hat" gimmick, and no doubt that is the whole reason it actually exists in canon. But when you think about it from a pure worldbuilding standpoint it makes almost no practical sense. Wizards are exposed to everthing from open flames, extremely dangerous chemical concoctions/potions to bolts of energy that tear off people's arms. These are all things you should seek to avoid striking your body. And as anyone who has ever worked with power tools could tell you, baggy clothing is very very dangerous in those situations. It would be like if fire-fighters wore only long flowing dresses. And while I recognize that formally, people wear weird impractical clothing, this is the standars fare for wizards, or at least for students, who are perhaps even more likely to make a mistake and injure themselves.

Edit: I should also add that this is brought up alot in muggle-wank fics. But the thing is, as far as I know robes were never a common fashion choice in the muggle world, not even in the backwards time period technology that wizards are stuck to, robes were mever a practical choice.

Not in the general population, no. But at least according to the brief research I did, scholars (and also clergy, though that's less relevant) were wearing robes as early as the 12th century, when the first universities were getting started. That's pretty contemporary with the founding of Hogwarts, so the founders could have put everyone in robes for the same reasons other universities did, or they could have been added to Hogwarts later to follow the muggle trend. And magic is usually seen as a scholarly pursuit, so it makes sense for witches and wizards to keep wearing robes after graduating to reinforce that idea.

It's also very possible that robes were a way to basically tell the muggles "I'm better than you because I don't need to do any manual labor so I can wear these impractical clothes."

** 1. As a status symbol (as with all fancy clothes) to differentiate themselves from muggles
2. They'd likely use more practical clothes for dangerous activities. You probably wear eye protection when using power tools, but not when walking down the streets. Many policemen use bulletproof vests while at work, but not when playing a sport with their friends.

** Uh. Magic?

And naturally robes were common thing once. The most simple garment you can think of is two sheets of fabric sewn together at the top with a hole for the head. This would qualify (more or less) as a "tunic", and if you close the sides, and add two sleeves, you have a "robe". In other words, before any and all dresses were a thing, people wore tunics and robes, and any one-piece-dress evolved from this most simple piece of clothing.

The advantage of both tunic and robe is that you don't need any fastening: Generally, if you want something to fit over the head /and/ fit closely at the neck (and ditto for any other body curves, e.g. hip vs. waist), you have to developed an adjustable opening. Pins, buttons, lacings, all that is more complicated and came later; in Europe during the Middle Ages (buttons and lacings). Before that, everyone literally wore a bag with holes, maybe with sash/belt/rope tied around the waist for more comfort.

Wizards appear to remain stuck at that point, for whatever reason. Really, the biggest bummer for me when writing isn't the dated fashion per so, but that a "form-fitting robe" is an oxymoron. A bag is a bag, there's nothing form-fitting about it. I like to pretend wizards have a different definition of robe, simply meaning any kind of one-piece outer garment, in particular also those with an adjustable opening so you can have corsages, lacings and all the nice stuff. But that's just my take; there's no indication for that in Canon.

.

Anyway, the most important takeaway, perhaps, is this: When you hear "robe", don't think bathrobe. Think monk's habit. The latter is the kind of garment the word means.

** When I lived in Qatar and vacationed in Oman, I saw that people there wear essentially medieval-looking robes most of the time. Their clothes are basically rectangles with sleeves. For special occasions, they wear even baggier clothes, squares with holes for neck and hands. The expat workers may have worn more fitted clothing, but the locals all wore medieval-looking robes.

I don't understand your argument about practicality. Wizards don't have to labor like mere muggles, all they have to do is wave a wand. And despite fanfic's fondness of tight sexy dueling robes (I'm guilty of this myself) I think baggier clothes would be more practical, since your opponent wouldn't know what to aim at. If a jelly-legs jinx has to hit your actual legs to be effective, you'd want to hide your legs in a big shapeless robe so your opponent is more likely to hit empty fabric than flesh.

** I'm guessing that robes evolved from cloaks and dresses that men wore in medieval times. Remember that many pure bloods are traditionalists and still wear robes for that reason
