  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire]] has Hermione as the fourth champion instead of Harry

Its on portkey, so make sure to download and view the html because the italics are broken on the site.

#+begin_quote
  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

*** Btw im Darklordcomp on ffn so I've commented on alot of your recent chapters, but to the OP read this fic, especially if you like Starwars. Raven does a fantastic job with the lore of both Star Wars and Harry Potter and makes me honestly believe that Harry could have been a Jedi
