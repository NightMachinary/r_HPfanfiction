Looking for a specific story \where Harry is a duelist and goes to a foreign tournament and gets an OC girlfriend - it is possible either girlfriend or her friends are Muggles, and later they get attacked by Death Eaters

Hell, it may not even be a dueling tournament, I just remember Harry in a foreign tournament and meets an OC girl

** Goddammit, I know that fic, but I can't recall the name.

It is a dueling tournament, final is Harry v Draco, and Draco tries to kidnap Harry with a portkey. His girlfirend is a part-siren. Umbridge gets arrested for torturing Harry via blood quill, Sirius adopts Harry, et. etc. etc.

EDIT: Go see [[/u/godoftheds]] comment, that is 100% it.
