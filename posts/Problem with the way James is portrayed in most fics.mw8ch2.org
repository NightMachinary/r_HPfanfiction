Most marauder era fics portray James as an irresisteble god who all the girls fall for. Where did this ever come up in canon? Sure he was popular, but he was never described as very handsome and girls were never fawning over him like they did for Sirius. It's said that James looks exactly like Harry but with different eyes. Was Harry every portrayed as an irresisteble, handsome man who all the girls fall for? Also the way most fics make it so that he asks Lily out like every day is annoying and unrealistic.
