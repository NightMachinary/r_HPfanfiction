What is bookish you might ask. I want to read stories that actually feels like I am reading a book written by professional author, not a 12 year old with harem fantasies. Stories with well-thought plot, impressive character build and awesome explanations about the nature of magic are more than welcome. I wanna feel like author didn't just wrote what came to his mind but actually thought about where this story is going and planned accordingly. I hate harem and I don't like smut much. Slash is ok, crossovers and OC's are ok, harems definitely not ok. BTW, if you recommend something with a lot of favs from ff, I probably read it but recommend it anyway.

PS. English is my second language so no flames if you dont know more than 2 languages

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** linkao3 (294722)

This one goes into the nature of magic a little more as you mentioned. It is one of the few fics I read where I was dying to know what happened next.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) It'll look massive, and it is, but keep in mind that it doesn't split the books into separate fics and so it's 3 books in one fic which is why it's so absurdly large.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
