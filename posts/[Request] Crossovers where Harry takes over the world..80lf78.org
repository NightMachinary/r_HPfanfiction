I've read the wizard of harrenhal but any crossover is welcome as long as Harry takes over the world.


** linkffn(7718942) and linkffn(8516157) fit the bill. In fact, many of the Star Wars-HP crossovers end up having Harry take over the world. That's their favourite trope, I guess.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
