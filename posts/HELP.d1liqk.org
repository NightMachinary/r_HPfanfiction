:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic I vaguely remember where Harry is a playboy and he makes a bet with Draco that he won't get off for 30 days. I am desperate to find it. Please help. It's a tumblr fanfic but I don't remember the author. The tagline was "I am so sick of good little perfect! Harry" or something like that.
