**** Pretty much. I think I've actually read one or two. Annabeth and Hermione hit it off immediately, trying to figure out each other's worlds. And Ron, Grover and Hagrid become pretty tight. And Harry and Percy are wary of each other. At least, that's how I would write it. Looks like tonight is a fan-fiction night!

*** pffft hahahaha Percy can barely read, and was considered an average student. Even less. And Percy in this fic is a freaking genius?! WTF?! The list of accomplishments he's managed to gain in the first freaking few lines had me clutching my sides!

*** Cliche betrayal fic. Trained by Dumbledore? Yeah... no. That sounds unbelievable. The idea of Dumbledore training anyone unless said person was as brilliant as he was, just as Flamel was, is highly unlikely. And Percy is NOT highly intelligent. Sure, a savant when it comes to battle? Yeah. Oh yeah. Studies? Erm... no.
