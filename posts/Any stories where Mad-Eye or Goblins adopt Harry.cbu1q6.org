Hello all, Do you have any links that have Harry adopted by either Goblins/Mad-Eye? Hopefully novel length stories, taking Harry to Diagon Alley & Gringotts.

  When Harry was left on the doorstep, he was picked up by Mad-Eye Moody. The two of them then move about Australia, and finally Harry ends up in England. Includes Nazis and multi-Animagus forms!

  Dumbledore, against his better judgement, decided to allow Alastor Moody custody of the Potter scion. Years later, he has to reap the whirlwind. Oneshot.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?

** There is the fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337][Gringott's lesser known branch]] (which is quite interesting in my opinion, as long as you like world building and are ok with AUs). The other parts are crossovers, apparently, of fandom I'm not really familiar with, so I've put it off for the moment. However, from what I remember, the first part can stand on its own, anyway.

** I haven't read it yet but I think linkffn (Harry Crow) might be one where he's raised by Goblins.

*** It's a bit Gary Stu, a bit "friend of the Goblins" and a bit weird with the "everyone meets their soulmate at 12" thing, but my main issue with Harry Crow is it's just so looong and half of it is spent describing parties and conversations between characters that basically acts as exposition of things we already know or could figure out for ourselves.
