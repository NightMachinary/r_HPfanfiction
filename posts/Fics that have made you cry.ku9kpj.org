** I just finished Broken by inadaze22 (ffn & ao3) Its extremely long, when I say slow burn I mean slow burn. Each chapter took me half an hour to read. It made me cry so much, which is saying a lot, believe me. I can't give you a summary because it would defeat the whole point. The plot is just a big twist. But I will say this: when I saw the title my first thought was: “How basic. How many times haven't I read a fic where the characters could be described as broken beyond repair? And there was never the need to title them as Broken” But I was so wrong. It's called Broken for a reason. If you think you've read a broken Hermione... it will not compare. Not in the same way.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

Behind the Rainbow by relative1983

It was one of the only fics that made me sad, not angry and cringing. It's not very intense or anything but the plot itself is just so sad, peaceful kind of sad. For my standards, it's not really long (43k words) so do try it, it's one of my favorites.
