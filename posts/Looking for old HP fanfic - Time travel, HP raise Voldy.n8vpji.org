:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fanfic that I read nearly a decade ago. It was a fanfic where Harry went back in time to raise Voldemort. It was two "books" long, each with quite a few chapters. I remember thinking it was large enough to make two actual books. The name of the series was Harry Potter and... I don't remember the rest of the book. I do remember that Harry actually got a job in the past while raising Voldemort, pretty sure it was an Auror. That is just about all I remember about it, I don't even remember for sure what the website I read it on was.


** It /might/ be Altered Destinies and the abandoned sequel Balancing Destinies? He marries an OC, raises Tom, and is basically the magical version of MI6 I suppose. The first bit is pretty painful, but the author improves as they go. A bit of a stretch though, since the title doesn't match. Do you recall if he ends up back in the 90s during book two?

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

*** Oh my God, yes! Thank you! I guess I was wrong with the "Harry Potter and the" title. I don't remember much, but I do remember liking it.
