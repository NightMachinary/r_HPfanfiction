#+TITLE: LF a fic where Luna has an older sibling (not adopted, ie: Harry or Hermione) and because of it, she's different and reacts different to the bullying. Can be OC centric, Luna Centric or even Harry Centric. Just not Hermione as a main character.

Just to be clear, I don't want a fic where the focus is like on those crap fics with Harry being bullied by everyone and then he suddendly grows a pair and starts being "snarky" and whatnot. I'd also like to not have a bashing fic, about anyone, except maybe Snape, if it fits, but I really abhor bashing in general.
