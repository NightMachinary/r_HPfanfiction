  Ever wonder 'Why don't they just do that' "A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic." Harry and Hermione, however, were raised in the muggle world and are therefore fully capable of thinking things through...A collection of of one-shots

  These magical folk do seem to have a problem with sensible thinking, and 'wizard logic' just isn't an excuse! Not anymore, anyway. Join me, on my cynical and nit-picking quest to make a general nuisance of myself, in...

** Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of Slytherin) actually does a really good job of this in my opinion. It's a wrong boy who lived story, with all the tropes that entailed. So there's . . .I don't know, 6-8 chapters setting up all the tropes. But then the author starts explaining the tropes and the reasons behind the actions of the characters. A really well done fic. Books 1 and 2 are finished.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
