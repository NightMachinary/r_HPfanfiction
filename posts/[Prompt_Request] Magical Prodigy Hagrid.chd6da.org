In the first book, Hagrid attempts non-verbal Human Transfiguration on Dudley with a /third year education./ Send me your fics and write your prompts about a magical prodigy Hagrid, with his canon personality.

â€‹

An Example:

"It's harmless Harry," Hagrid said as he was playing with fiendfyre. "You just have to know how to tame it."


** **second year after Hagrid's return\**

"Harry, don't you think Hagrid been acting a bit strange since he got back? It's been a bit... um, shifty I should say."

Ron snorted, "Merlin Hermione, he was in Azkaban. Dementor's will have anyone acting a bit strange."

Hermione shakes her head, "No, that's not it. He's been like this before, I just can't quite remember when..."

Harry shrugs, "What's a Dementor anyway?"

Hermione begins lecturing, "Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life."

Ron shudders, "Horrible monsters really."

Harry eyes his friends, "Er, horrible monsters? You don't think...?"

Herminone suddenly remembers when Hagrid had been acting like this before, "Oh, he CAN'T!"

**the trio burst into Hagrid's hut\**

"Rubeus Hagrid!" Hermione practically screams, "You did not bring a Dementor back with you from Azkaban!"

Hagrid looks up, startled, as he wandlessly directs a solid silver beast that looks suspiciously like Fluffy to corral the floating grimreaper wannabe as it tries to evicerate Hagrid. Hagrid looks sheepish for a mere moment before he grins and gestures to his new pet, "Ain't he a beut! I calls him Smokey."

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** I am fairly sure that the idea is that immediately enrolling Hagrid as assistant groundskeeper after he was expelled was a ploy by Dumbledore to get him to stay at Hogwarts, where he completed his education in secret with Dumbledore for a mentor.

*** It's a very plausible theory, coupled with fact Dumbledore repaired Hagrid's wand in canon (snapped wands can only be repaired with the elder wand and Pottermore confirms Hagrid's wand was repaired.)

Of course, he also didn't have the elder wand until 3 years after Hagrid was expelled.

I just want to read an OP Hagrid story :P.

**** Between the magic he demonstrates, his awesome giant spider friend/son/familiar, and his being inherently super-strong magic-resistant for being a Half-Giant, Hagrid /is/ OP already.

It's just that no story ever dares to have him as the protagonist because his accent is a pain.

** The closest thing I can think of is linkffn(7512124). The premise is that Hagrid must be an Occlumens; otherwise Voldemort wouldn't have needed to use his ploy with the dragon egg to figure out how to get past Fluffy.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** Inspired by this post but slightly different

Tom Marvolo Riddle, Known to the world as lord Voldemort was not a man to consider himself have any friends well apart from one person one person who shared his love of pushing the boundaries of magic. That person was Rubeus Hagrid. Voldemort had Become Friends with a Younger Hagrid during the time they shared at Hogwarts. Voldemort had found the young Hagrid looking after an acromantula. Voldemort had intially planned to pin the chamber of secrets death on hagrid but after an amazingly refreshing conversation about the limits the ministry had put on magical exploration. Voldemort quietly changed that plan

Voldemort knew that some of his death eaters would be disturbed that he considered a half giant to be right hand man, and only friend but they where foolish and constrained. Hagrid was the person he could spend countless hours talking about magic with. though he had to admit Hagrid over the years had acted as a moderating force for Voldemort own violent tendencies.

Voldemort had read that a young dumbledore and a young Gellert had struck up a friendship though he was happy his friendship with Hagrid had yet to end poorly Hagrid was quite content exploring the breeding and study of magic creatures, Voldemort found it amusing that his friendship with Hagrid had altered him so much.
