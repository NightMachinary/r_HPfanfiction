Just a thought in my head, not yet an actual full plot. But I just wondered if anyone would be interested in that.


** Wow what an interesting idea! I think it's definitely worth exploring because I don't think anything like that really exists so it would be fun to put something different out.

About the Weasley twins being MoD, right off the bat I feel like being Death is almost the opposite of what they are and preach to the world (fun, full of life/life of the party, jokes, laughs). Death represents the party coming to an end, or remembering something that makes a joke not funny, and sorrow and despair.

But the Weasley twins are also mischievous and can be dark in their own ways when they take things too far. I feel like Death, likely being unaffected by the lives they take, probably wouldn't be against adding some fun to their otherwise grim job.

That being said, I would 100% read your fic! In fact, if you write them as darker characters I'd be even more interested because it's so refreshing to see different takes to familiar characters!

** That would be /awesome/

I'd love to read a fic like that, go for it if you want!

What genre? I can see the basic idea going well over a variety of genres, but is there one you're aiming for?

** Oh for sure sounds like an awesome read, although the twins could possibly go too far but has potential. 'We solemnly swear to send our enemies to the afterlife'?? My god the chaos could be amazing!
