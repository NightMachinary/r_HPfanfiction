  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

#+begin_quote
  Cassiopeia Black may prefer research to family politics, but she refuses to allow her family name to be ruined after the events of fall 1981. With the help of a routine obsessed house elf, Cassiopeia sets out to spin the Black family's largest PR nightmare in 100 years with a lot of old magic, some luck, and her Squib brother's family... the Grangers.

**** It is not so bad. Yes, there is admitting Hermione as the heiress of the Black family (Sirius is still in Azkaban), but this is mostly about politics and large scale stuff, not much personal stories.

** I quite enjoyed To Bow With Pride. Weird, inexplicably-in-the-past Harry semi-accidentally becomes tutor to the Black Family Sprogs. There's an attached One-Shot called 'Three Times Narcissa Tries To Match Make' that's quite fun as well, though it's less about Sirius and more about the rest of the fam. :D

  Oneshot. Three times Narcissa Black tried to match make Bellatrix and their tutor Harry and one time ... Side fic to my other fic, To Bow with Pride. No pairing.

** Hi :)

I'm currently working on a story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936][Circinus]], which is set in an AU in which Walburga decides to work to free Sirius from Azkaban and secure him a trial - not that he wants one. It's main themes are Sirius coming to terms with what happened in 1981 and also around reconciling with his family. I'm currently nine chapters in, with a view to it being about 25. I also have a fair few other shorter stories centred around Sirius and his relationship with his family. I hope you enjoy :)

Alternatively, I highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721/chapters/34243049][In the Black]] and it's sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15457248/chapters/35881359][Black Mask]], by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/izzythehutt/pseuds/izzythehutt][Izzythehutt]], which also centres around Sirius reconciling with his family and is absolutely the inspiration behind my own stories. It's a brilliant series :)
