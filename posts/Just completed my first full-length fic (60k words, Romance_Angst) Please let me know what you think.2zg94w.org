Hi everyone,

I finally finished my labour of love, which is nowhere close to the length of some epics, but still more than what I would consider a short story. I started this fic around four years ago before abandoning it after chapter 5; since about a year ago, I began updating it again, which is why the story may not really find its voice until after that point. In any case, I'm truly glad to finally check the "complete" box on this story, and I'd love to hear any and all of your feedback.

All the best,

mnidl

+P.S. On a side note, does anyone know how to mark a work as complete on AO3?+ Thanks, [[/u/RosevalleyNB]]!


** Is there a link to your story? With checking off a finished multi-chaptered story on AO3 you need to hit the edit button. You'll see a section where the number of chapters are stated. Replace the question mark with the final number. So, for example, chapter 19 of ? should be changed into 19 of 19.

** I dig it so far! I've kinda been slacking off at work reading it so it's held my attention for a good few hours. I even find myself rooting for certain ladies at times. I just finished the 15th chapter, it definitely took an unexpected turn. I'm looking forward to see how it all wraps up. Anyways, thanks for providing a fun distraction today :)

**** You know it wasn't what I was expecting but I liked it. Not my absolute favorite fic but I certainly enjoyed it! It made me wonder if there are any Choose Your Own Adventure fics? If not you should think about writing one! Could be fun. Unfortunately I'm not a writer, just an avid reader so the best I can do is give people ideas haha

*** One of the (few!) benefits of writing fanfiction is that I can write whatever I want :D I had the ending planned out from the beginning because I like closure for all the main characters.

** Honestly, not my cup of tea so far. It's written well enough, but the progression of the relationships feels a but rushed and forced. The first interaction with Daphne is like "ooh how I /loathe/ him;", then they talk for five minutes and suddenly it's all " I'm gonna get me some of that!". Now, I get that the theme of this story /is/ attraction and dealing with temptation (based on the Honks pairing and you stating that it's not harem), but still, to me it comes off as a bit strong right out of the gate.

Also, on a tiny side note that bothered me more than it should have; why would Harry as an alumni of the school need to ask what house Gabrielle is in when he knows the house system and it should have been obvious from her uniform since they were in class? Like I said, it's a small thing but stuff like that tend to break the flow a bit (for us nitpickers at least).

EDIT: Still a commendable effort to finish a fic this size, and I will read it to the end as fics can surprise you later on once you have the whole picture.

I hear you regarding the Gryffindor robes - that was an oversight on my part.

**** Oversights happen, like I said, I'm a nitpicker. I chose to read it at first because I'm a huge Haphne fan, so I'm anxious to see where it (they) lands. I also like that you went with a more "traditionally Slytherin" Daphne than making her the most agreeable person ever right off the bat, makes for a more dynamic story I think with more natural conflict points.

***** If conflict and a Slytherin-like Daphne are what you're looking for, then I think this story might be for you after all :)

*** Mate, Philosopher's Stone is only about 77k, and plenty of famous novels hover around 60k (Brave New World being a notable example). How is it /not/ full length?

*** Well it's 136 pages in size 10 font, single-spaced on letter-sized paper, so I consider that to be substantial enough. I think the super long epics that go on for years and years skew our perception a bit regarding length, especially since fanfiction is typically read quickly.
