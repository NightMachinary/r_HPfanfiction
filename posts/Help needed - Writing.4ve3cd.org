** This sounds like a story I'd like to read.

#+begin_quote
  5) I can't start. I can't write the first chapter.
#+end_quote

Then don't start there. Can you find a moment that seems easy to write? If so, start there and see how you do. Sure, you'll have to come back and do some edits to make sure it fits with whatever you've written before, but it's not a big issue if your first completed chapter is in the middle or near the end.

I'd also highly recommend lurking on [[/r/writing]]. Many of the regulars there have excellent ideas and love helping out.

*** Thanks a bunch! It's been two days since I've posted this, and I already wrote a couple of chapters (will probably get fired). I'll try to find a way for a great opening soon, but I guess there's no need to rush

This is a great attitude to have. You're not running a race.

** 1) It sounds ambitious, but that means you'll learn a lot more in this story than in a one-shot or something much more linear. As you long as you plan and take measures not to be overwhelmed (i.e. planning out all the subplots, writing character profiles to keep everybody in check, etc.) you'll do fine. These ambitious stories are definitely the ones you should outline beforehand.

2) It sounds like a lot of subplots going on, but that doesn't mean it can't be all in one story. It just means the story will be longer to accommodate all of that. Look at Game of Thrones. Those books are thick, but that's because we multiple stories going on at the same time as the main one (becoming King/Queen). Be ready to devote a lot of time to this fanfic.

3) Up to you. I'm writing my HP crossover fully before publishing it because I want to make sure everything runs smoothly from beginning to end. I'm currently at 32K, and I already have some heavy revisions to do on the beginning chapters. Others like to have two or three chapters ready to go so their updates aren't late. Others post chapters as they finish them.

Remember that your first drafts will be shit. They won't live up to the epic story you had in mind. The description might be lacking. The dialogue will seem boring. Don't worry! That's why we go back and revise! Write that first chapter, get it out of the way, and continue on to chapter two. For now no one will see it but you.

*** 1) That's really great advice, I have separated character profiles into different folders, but I never did it with the subplots. Thank you! 2) I am a huge fan of SOIAF, so I get what you mean. I guess my skill of combining it all together is a little weak, but I'll work harder on that.

Thank you for taking the time to help me, I really really appreciate it.

**** I actually shelved a WIP because my subplots were getting out of hands. I hadn't planned them well enough by themselves, so it was a just a mess. Planning would have made everything go much smoother.

Good luck! Already thinking about what you need to plan for your fic is a great step in the right direction. :)

*** Oh, you mean this?

#+begin_quote
  Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter. Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant *as though she was going to smile*, said, “Let him down!”
#+end_quote

Funny how you mentioned it, because it's exactly why I've decided to start the story around Easter holidays (Easter Sunday fell on April 18th in 1976). I want to have a proper introduction to her fighting the urge to smile and him using the M-word. Whether people believe it or not, boys and girls being friends at the age of fifteen/sixteen can have some pretty nasty fights which include name-calling, especially if one one them has, well, one-sided affections. I have it all planned out, and it's neither Potter or Death Eater related.

#+begin_quote
  “(...) *walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can* --- I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.”
#+end_quote

I think that he and Sirius both hexed /specific/ people, not necessarily Slytherins. However, I highly doubt she was close to either of them to understand the reason behind hexing, let's say, Bertram Aubrey (who in my story is most definitely not in Slytherin). My point is, it wasn't random at all - they wouldn't be popular if they were /that/ mean, would they?

Oh, Hermione. No, no, I have something else in mind. Rivalry - a pureblood (OC) has to work extremely hard to keep up with a Muggle-born blessed with 'pure talent' (this is Lily yep). I like to think that Lily sometimes left her homework for the night/morning before it was due because she fancied doing (insert hobby, not Quidditch or translating Ancient Runes) that weekend, a bit like... Harry.

***** I'll publish on ffnet. And I'll send you a PM regarding your question, since I have a couple of them for you (in case you're writing a time-travel fic and so on)
