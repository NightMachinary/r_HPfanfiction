Seems like I've been reading the same thing lately and it's been tiring. Slytherin Harry? Read a large majority of them. Severus raises Harry stories? Read those too. Harry ends up in an alternate universe/dimension? Read a large majority of them.

It's like the same basic thing after same basic thing, if there's a plot that I'm familiar with it's likely I know what's going to happen or close to it.

So I want something different. No time travel stories, no Slytherin Harry, no Severus raises Harry or mentors him, no Harry traveling to a different dimension/universe /(Unless there are certain ones that are really good that aren't recommended a whole lot)./

But yeah, just trying to get out of the rut I'm in with reading the stories, maybe the deal is reading stories with Harry as the main character, if there are any well written stories where someone other then Harry is the main character let me know.

I don't care what the plot is (as long as it's not something I mentioned, or if it is something I mentioned then it goes an unexpected way).

Would rather not have rehash stories. Unless the rehash is extremely different from canon. Would actually prefer the characters as 17 or older but they don't have to be.

Would rather be thrown in a loop, not knowing what happens next.

NO Character bashing. No Harems. No making Harry super smart or super powerful a little smarter or a little more powerful then he was in canon is fine just don't make it unbelievable.

Any Era, Any Rating. Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, any other pairing is fine.

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. Anyone can be the main character, not just Harry. (Would actually welcome the change, although I'd rather it not be Hermione because I've read quite a few Hermione as the main character stories myself).


** Ok, here a some fics for you

** Well, if you want different, here's some shit that pops to mind

linkffn(Wit of the Raven by japanese-jew): A very AU fic that features the only borderline-acceptable version of magical cores I have seen. Abandoned.

linkffn(Exile by bennybear): A completed, canon-divergent, Draco-focused, post-/DH/ fic.

linkffn(Super Saiyan Defence Against the Dark Arts): It's short, incomplete, but is easily different. An OotP fic where, well, just read the summary.

linkffn(The Children of Set by What-Ansketil-Did-Next): A one-shot, not super long, but is /literally/ the only HP/Conan (as in, the Barbarian) crossover on FFN, which I find to be criminal. Riddle-centric, and definitely different than anything else I've read before.

linkffn(Amulet of Gold by KevinVoight) and sequels are a very interesting post-DH trilogy. First one takes place largely (IIRC) from Ginny's point of view. Very cloak and dagger, with some [[/spoiler][eldritch shit going on]]. Technically a violation of something listed in your third paragraph.

And that's all I got off the top of my head.

** Wow I honestly didn't expect so many stories where Harry isn't the main character, thanks you guys. Will check all of them out. If anyone knows any more let me know.

(Note, it's fine that Harry is the main character or in the story, just make it interesting with him if he is the main character).

Again thanks you guys, appreciate it! If anyone knows any more let me know.

  AU, gen, Harry and Draco friendship. In a world where wizards and witches can sense each other's familiars but no one else can, Harry's impressive familiar makes an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy take more notice of him.

** This is only a oneshot that I wrote (about 4K words, marauders era) but it's not a plot that I've ever seen before and I'm really proud of it. Any feedback would be appreciated! Linkffn(12485818)
