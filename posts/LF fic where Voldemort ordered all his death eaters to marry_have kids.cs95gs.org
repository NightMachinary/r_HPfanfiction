  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** That is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]].

The fic starts out with Voldemort regaining his sanity after his resurrection in the graveyard. He realizes that his wars have actually had the oposite effect of his original goal, which was to protect and improve magical society.

After that he completely changes his methods and considers ways to revitalise the depleted magical population. That includes encouraging his followers to look for spouses and/or adopt orphanned 'muggleborn' children.

That's a subplot, though. The fic is mainly about Harry, Voldemort and others learning to cope with a reality in which 'Lord Slytherin' is not an evil force to be reconned with. The fic is a well written example of wizarding politics and pureblood culture done right.
