I'm sure most of you by now know that I am a Harry/Ginny fan. I'm looking for any 19 year Harry/Ginny stories with a few exceptions. Ginny can not be dumb: she can not decide Harry is cheating on her because the paper says he is, She can not be playing quidditich while pregnant (if she quits/takes a break the moment she finds out that is fine), and she can not have a miscarriage. Yes, I am that strange. Lets see if you guys can find some I have not read. :)


** Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. Both sort of write in their own universes that happen after the war.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): very nice Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009. There was also a murder mystery thrown in.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): although listed as a R/Hr fic, Harry and Ginny carried just as much weight. It's fully Epilogue compliant, but they had to fight hard in an alternate dimension to prevent a disaster. Harry and Ginny were total bad asses in this story.

*** So, Children's Crusade is a sequel. How imperative is it to read /Stop All the Clocks/ when it comes to understanding the Crusade?

#+begin_quote
  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
