It occurs to me that of all the characters in the Harry Potter universe, Percy is the one who bears the most resemblance to Tom Riddle: the model student, incredibly ambitious, and from a long standing but impoverished pureblood lineage. Are there any stories out there where he dabbles in dark magic or becomes a Death Eater?


** I remember there was a story out there with a Death Eater Percy who was killed by Harry with a wandless /Diffindo/, can't remember anything else I'm afraid, sorry.

** I remember there being a pretty funny MTG crossover where Percy becomes Phyrexia's agent, and Yawgmoth's hand on earth, while Harry teaches his minions how to manipulate mana. Probably not what you're looking for, but it's worth a mention.
