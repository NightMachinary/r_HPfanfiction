Rotten on the inside might honestly be the most beautiful fanfic I have ever read. Especially the last chapter. I normally hate fanfiction that isn't happy but something about it just hits different. It has some elements I enjoy in fanfiction, Hermione being honestly an amazing friend, Snape being exposed for the scumbag he is, etc. I honestly might be hard pressed to think of another fanfiction I like more. I'd probably put Allure Immune Harry, That Universe Over There, Whiskey Time Travel, or Double Back in a category above it but I feel like people don't talk about Rotten On the Inside that much. but I seriously cannot recommend it enough.
