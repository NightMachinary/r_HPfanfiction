since reading a piece of bellatrix, and the op explaining her reaction and such I've gained a sense to understanding her character somehow and recently just thought of a sickly yet interesting plot; the female!oc being neville's girlfriend, with her attractive forming for bella with attending to the ministry of magic and first seeing bellatrix. though I do have flaws with the timeline on how to lead them to actually have more than just minor interactions when there are only two sections I can make it possible --- until dh where I can make bellatrix into a professor a hogwarts--- but i'll fear of making it messy and rushed with only a few chapters until i can make everything to fall into place.

constructive criticism is welcomed as always, would also like to hear what people think of the plot with the oc being neville's girlfriend.


** My main comment on the Neville's Girlfriend thing is simply 'think about why'. What does that add to your story? What influence would it have on the development of the OC-Bellatrix relationship? Does it have an actual impact on your planned plot or character development?

(In my opinion), there are no bad ideas, it's all about what you do with them. So basically, think about what you'd actually do with that idea and work out whether you like that or not. If you can create some interesting developments in a character with it - maybe the relationship breaking up motivates Neville to do something - or write an interesting plot arc or something, then keep it. Otherwise, try think of some impacts that idea can make on your plot or characters. If it doesn't do anything at all, then it might read as pointless to your readers and that could get people less invested in it.

Not to say that the developments or impacts need to be all drama and angst, mind. They can be positive or negative or even both!

*** when deciding on it i realize it would definitely give character to the story, and angst, and just something not in the waters because for neville past with bellatrix. i have not fully decided but i was thinking of the oc having dark inside of her that isnt been awakened, and bellatrix helping that side of her come out. i have the outline of the plot and working on to make everything realistic and in character as possible. the oc's relationship with neville represents the good, light and innocence, while being bellatrix represents the complete opposite. i am myself interested to see on how i path this out and see it fall into place.

**** So, it's kind of a Seduction-Corruption 'Fall to the Dark for Love' story, huh? That could be fun.

But yes, that's exactly the kind of thing I meant when I said think about why. So, keep 'pathing' it out and asking why your ideas might be the way they are in that world and either finding an answer or adjusting your logic and then you'll find a story.

Just... don't be afraid to drop ideas if you can't find a logical way to fit them in. Remember, every idea you don't get in this story is an idea you can set at the centre of the next one!

Might be a good idea to look at the TV Tropes pages on Face-Heel turns or Shades of Conflict for some inspiration. They both cover writing advice and tropes (in the actual sense of the word, not the one this fandom commonly uses) around the idea of good vs evil and good falling to evil.

****** Glad I could help.

Oh, and on the pacing note - you mentioned in your first comment that you were worried you'd end up making your relationship messy and rushed - I'd say make a basic 'roadmap' of the relationship. You don't have to plot the entire thing out, but make a note of some events you want to happen to develop their courtship.

Generally, something like:

- The Meet Cute (how the two come into contact for the first time)

- The second meeting (always good for a callback or a 'deepening denial' moment)

- The First Temptation (basically the first time your OC feels 'Want' for Bellatrix or the Dark)

- The Crescendo (Technically a series of events, but basically flesh out your character's argument on being dark/bonking Bella and set up the final thing that'll make your OC fall)

- The Griping (Oh, woe is me, I can't like a maniac like her/Oh, woe is me, I can't want to maim and murder people)

- The Final Temptation (Basically the catalysing incident that sets the final fall brewing, maybe your character gets put into a situation where they have to make the choice to do something dark to survive/escape it)

- The Fall (the moment your OC goes dark and/or goes for Bella)

******* roadmapping is very useful and important for fanfiction for characters like bellatrix, so thank you for reminding me to do that. i do have fears of lack of creativity to bring context to said scenarios, and how to bring opportunities for the oc to see how she does desire the darkness. her desire and want for bellatrix is prominent as soon as she sees her, but rather ignores, though she falls to accept it sooner and easier than admitting of the want of the dark. pureblood superiority does come into play as soon as bella is officially introduced into the ocs life, and bellatrix definitely helps with giving a slight nudge to the direction that the oc always had in the back of her mind.

thank you for your advice once again, you really brighten up spots and give me a lot to work with. ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤

******** Eh. Creativity is overrated. So long as its well-founded and interesting, you'll do aight. Just keep questioning the situation - why would this happen, why would she choose this, why would she react in this way to that, etc. Once you know the whys, you'll find it easier to find ways to reveal them and ways to provide context to the scenarios in which you do.

(Apologies for the delay in response, btw. Life is hella hectic rn)
