Apologies, I'm new to this subreddit. Very keen to find a fan fiction that, if I remember correctly, saw both Ginny and Harry losing their memories (I think), but they both live as muggles and meet and fall in love. Later they find the truth about their magical past. Any help appreciated.


** I believe that's an hgfan1111 fic - the author took down all of her stories a while ago, but I think if you do some googling or asking around you should be able to find copies.
