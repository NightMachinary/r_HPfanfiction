** In short: the Dursleys send Harry to an orphonage, and Remus tracks him down there a few years before Hogwarts. He helps Harry fit in better to the magical world, and slowly turns into a father figure.

This work features pre-Hogwarts and all of first year. The second part taking place in second year is underway.

I really enjoy reading it for many reasons. The writing is good. Harry and his friends are written as realistic eleven year-old kids. No super-Harry here, even though things are a bit easier for him. Some characters are taking a different path from canon (most notably Draco), but the character development is done well enough that it feels like it fits the original series.

Finally (SPOILER), and this is always a favpurite of mine, Sirirus eventually gets to prove his innocence.

Has anyone else read (and enjoyed) it? Do you have similar works to recommend?

*** How is magic written? Do plot follow canon or does it diverge?

**** Magic is written similarly to canon. No miraculous discoveries or magical cores etc (yet).

The plot follows the canon, losely. It's AU from the start due to harry not living with the Dureselys and meeting Remus, but the main events come back - the Philosopher's Stone is hidden in Hogwarts, Quirell is possessed by Voldemort etc. But there are enough changes that you truly wonder what will happen next.
