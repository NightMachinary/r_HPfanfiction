:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This one's driving me crazy... I'm looking for a fic I read a while back that had Slytherin Harry making tons of trades/deals across the school. I think there was some kind of like vow/binding magic around them, so everyone's forced to keep top the terms. Also at some point he gets ratted out to the teachers who make him end all the deals, so he loses most of the status he got in slytherin.

Can't find it at all and I'm starting to worry I dreamt reading the thing!


** As it happens, someone just asked for this same fic yesterday. You are thinking of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/][Antithesis]] by Oceanbreeze7. linkao3(7322935)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
