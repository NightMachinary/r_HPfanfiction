Okay I know this fic sort of sucks, but its like a guilty pleasure fic for me. So I'm looking for fics like this with Slytherin!Harry and manipulative!dumbledore with some OCs that are.. well, better written than this one.

In Trust... the fic premise is very interesting but the author just mangles grammar and has run on sentences galore. And there's the whole, “I am so smart that I can disrespect my elders and be complimented on it” nonsense of Harry's personality. I don't mind a bit of “I'm so amazing” Harry but I'd like it to be milder.

Thanks and any slytherin Harry fics in general would be welcome too!
