  It's as if every Harry/Multi fic is written by horny teenagers that never dated girls or something.

Maybe the firebird trilogy? I am not 100% sure but I think they stayed hetero. But I warn you: it's not a happy fic, it takes place in a dystopian world and is "realistic" (no fairy tale style happy endings). I found it brutally honest. I liked it, but I don't think I'll ever be able to re-read it.

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]] ) This is the first book.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk) is eventually a hetero multi, (Harry/Hermione/Daphne/Fleur specifically) but it is a very slow build, and very much H/Hr until like 300k words (out of like 750k). But since you invested close to that before, I thought I'd mention it. Lots of really cool world-building and plot, especially politics on the way there though.
