I know this has undoubtedly been posted before but I just wanted to hear it from everyone. What are the biggest regrets? What are some stories that you read and to this day you regret every minute you wasted reading? And what made it so dreadful?

One of mine was a story where Harry entered a relationship with Professor McGonagall but only when they were both in their tabby cat forms. Story mainly consisted of cats having sex and there wasn't much in the form of a plot. I think I read a few chapters and even now I regret wasting my time with it. As well as the mental scars it has left.

Knut for your thoughts #2


** Most stories with super Harry and flagrant bashing. For Love Of Magic by Noodlehammer, The Green Girl by Colubrina. I was new to the fandom when I tried these, and would probably give up and read something else now.

One fic that I really regret reading for as long as I did was Looking Beyond, which failed to live up to it's title, and was basically canon with a female Harry. Another was Umei No Mai which was a really slow crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn, so slow that I barely remember anything but the name of the fic.

**** For the first two stories I mentioned, it was hard because I liked some aspects of the stories but not others, which kept me going in addition to the newness factor. I later realized I prefer dramione when Draco is the one to put in more effort changing himself, and I don't care for harem fics at all.

** linkao3(5103614)

I muscled through it my first time reading it and this will be one of the few stories I never re-read. I'm still not sure what made it so terrible to me, but I feel like I could've skipped all the chapters from 20-50 and not missed out on anything important. There is information pertinent to the main plot in those chapters, but the rate at which it's given is dreadful (in my opinion) so it just keeps dragging on and on. So, I guess pacing? is my main problem.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Great premise, terrible execution. I made it to the halfway point before abandoning that trainwreck of a story.

Characters completely OOC, rampant sexism, stereotypical portrayal of everyone non-English and ridiculous plot points are just a few of the things I hated about that fic, but I ultimately abandoned it because I couldn't stand its glorification of child soldiers. Several of my elderly relatives were child soldiers in the last days of WW2, and the way DAYD deals with the topic is absolutely tasteless and offensive.

*** I haven't read that story so I'm not opposing what you said but isn't child soldiers kinda what Harry Potter about? I mean Harry and his crew do all the fighting since year one. Colin coming back to fight in Battle of Hogwarts is another child soldier thing. I love Harry Potter but all of the book glorifies child soldiers. Of course, this is only my opinion and like I said I haven't read that story so I don't know how author portrays child soldiers.

**** It's another quality in DAYD. Dumbledore's Army is written like an actual guerrilla army, with Neville acting like some sort of commander. It's all very militaristic.

In the books, Harry usually ends up saving the day, but he is never treated like a soldier. Actually, Dumbledore tries (and fails) to shield him from Voldemort for as long as possible. Children/teens saving the world is a common trope in youth literature and doesn't equate glorifying child soldiers IMO.

But in DAYD, one member of the DA (who is like 13) is murdered by Death Eaters, and the DA hold some kind of ceremony praising his noble sacrifice or some bullshit like that.

As for Colin, him participating in the battle is very much not portrayed as a good thing. Instead of praising his heroism, it is depicted as an avoidable tragedy.

** I remember the time I was into Harry&Snape relationship, where Snape is Harry's father or mentor. There was popular theme, where Snape discovers Harry is abused, and helps him grow and mentors him, and they both getting better through their new relationship.

Now I can't remember the name of the fic, but it was quite on the top recs, and had huge amount of likes&comments.

Oh, it was horrible to read. Because Harry was a-b-u-s-e-d by Dursleys so. much. The author went for details of mental and physical torture Harry went through. Every single chapter, huge portion of it was about abuse. I tried to go to the 'good part', where the comfort and healing comes into the play, but I never made it. Too much of hell.

There were also similar fics, going through very detailed description of Harry's abuse. Some of them in sexual manor (remember, it was before Hogwarts, so the boy was like 11 or less). Just no. I learned my lesson, and just closed the tab asap.

** For The Love of Magic by Noodlehammer. Made me so angry in the last three chapters I gave myself a migraine, can't believe I read 800k words for it to end in such a shitty and abrupt manner. That's not even touching on the numerous shitty questionable self insert powerwanking bullshit and racism and other implied -isms.
