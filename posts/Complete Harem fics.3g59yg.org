  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

*** It is exactly what it says: a fanfiction featuring a harem.

If you don't know what a harem is, it is a male character being in a relationship with multiple female characters.

  One year ends and another begins. During this year, Harry Potter studies under Nicolas Flamel, is forced to deal with a Vampire Princess, and learns there is yet another danger lurking within the walls of Hogwarts, one that's been around since the time of the Founders. What's a poor student with perfect memory to do? Sequel to Gift of Memories. Warning: Character Death!

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.
