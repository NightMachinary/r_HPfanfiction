:END:
I read a story last year that had Harry repay the damages to Gringotts by getting them a new dragon. He had to go looking for specific ingredients to be able to read a book by Merlin that enabled him to speak to dragons. Draco at one point healed him using the elder wand because he was the last owner of it or something. Really want to read it again. I hope someone can help
