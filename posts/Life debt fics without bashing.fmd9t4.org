Harry being owed one or multiple life debts. Doesn't matter from whom. But please, no bashing.


** In linkao3(Train to nowhere) he's owed one by his classmate who he saved during Quidditch practice. After that, his other classmates are not okay with that bc before that event they all were equal and now Harry has power over someone which is not cool

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Linkffn(Life Debts by arekay). Author's blurb says, "Slight amount of what might be considered bashing." I enjoyed the story, but YMMV.

Linkffn(Vanquishing the Wizengamot by raspberry dreams). The story hasn't really stuck with me.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veela Life Debts by jojobevco). I haven't read this one yet, so I can't say anything about it.

Linkffn(The Debt by mjimeyg). Fleur comes to Hogwarts in Harry's 5th year to fulfill the life debts owed by herself and Gabrielle. Others owe debts, too.

Linkffn(If I Knew The Consequences I Wouldn't Have Done It by raspberry dreams). This one may contain bashing, but I don't really remember. Dumbledore tries to take advantage of the life debt that Ginny owes Harry, and not to Harry's benefit.

  Different Ending to HBP. Harry's leaving school but doesn't want Ron and Hermione to come with him. Find out why. Rating it T just to be safe. Will probably be a oneshot. Not a Ha/Hr. Slight amount of what might be considered bashing.

  Voldemort was defeated but little changed as the purebloods remained in control of the Ministry of Magic. In one desperate act to save himself Harry changes Britian's wizarding world forever.

  When enmity between two civilizations causes Harry to save a young girl's life, a bond forms. When a dangerous task causes Harry to save another girl, another bond forms. These bonds put him on a path that could change the world. Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle

  Harry is surprised by the side effects of having saved Ginny in the chamber. Turns out people he trusted were lying to him. There were many people who wouldn't have done what they did if they could forsee the consequences of their actions and Harry's reactions.
