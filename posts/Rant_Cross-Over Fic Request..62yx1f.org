  therefore anything said or mentioned about it in a book must be false because he hasn't given any interviews
#+end_quote

Ahh, the good old "Look how sensible and smart my Harry is" rite. I think everyone who wants to write a smart Harry writes this by default, because it sounds so intelligent the first time you hear it, yet completely disregards that whole "Magic leaves traces"-thing if you think about it. I think it's usually a sign of the author wanting a smart Harry, but then using the same old arguments because they can't come up with their own smart stuff to say.

#+begin_quote
  Also, I'd like to find a story where the author's RL political views don't leak into the story.
#+end_quote

This one happend with canon, and a lot of fiction in general actually. Look at how Rowling portrays the political establishment and the liberal views the main characters have (Hermione and house elves just to name an example)

#+begin_quote
  one suggestion after another that the Death Eaters are Conservatives
#+end_quote

The "Pureblood only"-agenda however is more on the right / conservative side - going against minorities arguably is up their alley. (See: current politics in general), and death-eaters do that. They are closer to 'conservatives' than 'liberals' in morals and views, so I can see where that is coming from. The suggestion that every conservative is a death-eater however is wrong.\\
And sure, a few stories make this mistake, but look at how the average fic portrays the Greengrass family - never joining Voldemort, because they are the Good Conservatives^{TM.}

#+begin_quote
  Is everyone forgetting how many characters in the Harry Potter world are Pure Bloods, and that a lot of them are the good guys?
#+end_quote

"Pureblood" vs. "Blood purist" is an important distinction, which some stories don't make. Simply don't read them.

#+begin_quote
  showing absolutely stupid amounts of hypocrisy by then singling out anyone and everyone who is a Pure Blood, and suggesting that they are all evil, and out to steal everyone else's "rights", just to name a few examples.
#+end_quote

Hypocrisy usually comes from the author not thinking things through, and taking them to the extreme - which is common for youths. The author thinks (or at least would like to think that) he's smarter than he actually is (I certainly did). Not thinking things and the plot through is also a common theme in fanfiction.

However, the whole 'blood purist' thing it itself is rather ridiculous - discrimination on blood status is dumb either way. If you are a blood purist, you are taking the rights of muggleborns away, for no apparent reason.

** How about a story where people don't automatically alienate 1/4 of the population by classifying them as untrustworthy and evil? Being cunning, resourceful and ambitious doesn't equate even remotely. All they do is create a self fulfilling prophecy. Treat them that way from the age of 11 and they will become that way. People who embody the qualities of Slytherin house are much more likely to go far in life. Making enemies of them isn't a smart idea according to me.

Also, Stories that use the 'Sorting Hat gives you a choice' thing to stupid levels. "A true Slytherin wont be in Slytherin". Okay, then why does Slytherin house exist? If you have all the qualities of a Slytherin, but then tell the hat that "being in Slytherin will be a counter productive to my plans so put me in another house", then whats the point of a hat that can read your mind and personality? Might as well just walk up to the House you want and sit there. It can be believable if multiple houses all EQUALLY apply and the hat takes your feelings into consideration, but otherwise it's just shit.

Okay rant over. The shitty house system always irks me.

Third path to the Future is the only HP/Marvel crossover i have read. Not sure how it will hold up to your expectations, but is doesn't have Hermione in it, which is one of the reasons i read it in the first place.
