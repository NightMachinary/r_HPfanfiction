I'm looking for fics that are messed up but don't have Harry as it's protagonist.

**** Perhaps "Do I Look Like Your Hero?" on AO3 fits your request. It's a Slytherin-Hermione fic where she eventually joins Snape as a spy in the Death Eaters, if I remember correctly by seducing MacNair to get the introduction. Her muggle-hating persona that stands up to Voldemort's mindreading is built around her memories of her cousin and parents raping her and her parents forcing her into prostitution as a kid, all of which is detailed through the first half or so of the story (guess how she recognizes Gilderoy Lockhart?) So, definitely messed up and not about Harry.

** Black Ink, Red Rose by BolshevikMuppte99 qualifies. It follows an extreme corruption of Ginny following the destruction of the diary, leading to her eventually joining the Death Eaters
