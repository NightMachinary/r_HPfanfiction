:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe it was a Harry/Susan p√†iring and it was slightly political

And that one of the parents made a comment that the potters falling for redheads/or intelligent woman is only a myth

But then the child corrects them because it was one of the truths that was taught as an example when they where younger.

Sorry I can't remember anything else


** Its beem awhile but was it linkffn(not the only redhead) Iirc it starts in4th year

  Harry asks Ginny to the Yule Ball. Everyone believes Harry is destined to be with a redhead. There is more than one redhead in Hogwarts, though.

** I don't know if it's got the "Potters fall for redheads" bit in it, but linkffn(Journey Through the Dark by Earl Lonsdale) fits the other parts of your description.
