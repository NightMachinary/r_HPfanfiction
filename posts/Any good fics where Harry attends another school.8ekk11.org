** In HP and the Irish Choice, Harry leaves Hogwarts very early on to attend a school in Ireland.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** I haven't got any for those schools, but have you read these linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi; The Magnate by Halt.CPM). Both are centred around Drumstrang and The Magnate has a few early similarities to HPatBWL due to the fact that it's one of the best fics in the fandom (imo), but quickly comes into its own. Unfortunately it looks like both are abandoned but still worth it anyway.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry

** I can think of two off the top of my head, one called “Anarkia” I believe and the other one I can't remember, however I do remember it was centered around blood magic and a school where death was normal, if anyone else can figure out the title
