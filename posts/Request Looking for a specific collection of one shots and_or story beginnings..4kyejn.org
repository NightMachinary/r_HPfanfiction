The only story I remember is one starting in the Goblet of Fire, with Harry's name coming out. He publicly curses(figuratively) the person who entered his name. The one who did it was voldemort, but in reality it was the female version of him, where she cast a fidelius on her real name, and became a student in slytherin using the last name Gaunt. She reveals to harry that she entered him as she wanted to see behind the mask she saw him presenting to everyone. This female Tom Riddle may have been related to the diary horcrux coming to life in some fashion, but I"m not 100% on that.

The post yesterday about Fem!Harry/Tom Riddle stories made me remember reading this but I don't remember exactly where I read it.


** I found it.

  This is not a story, only a repository of several ideas jumping around in my mind. Feel free to be inspired or adopt, should you want to. Nothing is abandoned, only very delayed, because of reasons. Please, enjoy and feel free to comment. Pairings, mostly Haphne.
