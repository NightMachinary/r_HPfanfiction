If not, are there any other information based spells? As in spells that give you some information in a direct manner, much like Tempus is believed to give time?


** No, Tempus is a fanon invention and has been around since forever.

That made me think about your question seriously and there aren't that many spells that give/display information directly.

Specialis Revelio is an information gathering spell, that shows magical properties/ingredients. There is the Point me spell, which makes the wand act like a compass. Then there's the Priori Incantato, which shows the last spell cast with a wand. There is the Protean charm, which works kind of like quantum entanglement, where two objects are linked together and the information about any change to one object is transferred to the other.

There may also be some other spells that gather and display/relay information. I'm thinking of Homenum Revelio which shows all humans near the person who cast the spell, or the supersensory charm which improves the senses. Finally I believe there's also some kind of spell to detect (magical) disguises, which is used by the Ministry at their entrance.

**** There is a whole branch of magic about information gathering. People dismiss Divination too much. There is huge potential there.

** nope. Canon magic always almost imposes some physical change - rather than heating charms, the characters make fire with magic to heat themselves, stuff like that

some mist shit showing up with the time doesn't really fit in

*** The prior incantation spell (I don't remember the words) makes a mist come out of someone's wand. That's sort of similar?

** Wizards use watches to tell time. They generally get them when they come of age. I don't know what younger wizards do, maybe Hogwarts has a lot of clocks
