A fan-fiction where the good antagonists are painted in a more sympathetic light most often Dumbledore and the order. Protagonist preferably someone else than Hermione or Harry. Please no steamrolling. Conflict and bad times for the protagonist is a must. I don't know if any fic like this exists.

Thank you.


** Death of Today works, but it's slash and the protagonist is sort of Harry (different Father and completely OOC with a different name but well written)
