Hi everyone!

So, I'm searching for fics with really great parents/parental figures. All kind of relationships are welcome! Maybe someone who adopts Harry (or someone else?) in their younger years, or when they start Hogwarts. Or maybe something entirely different, I'm open to everything.

I wish for the the relationship to be really caring and sweet. So, just good parents? The fluffier and wholesome, the better!❤️

I can't wait for your recommendations ❤️

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** The It's Tea Time series has Harry working on being a better father the year after Cursed Child and Ginny being a great mother the whole time. The third fic in the series has the Next Generation Potters (James/OC, Lily/OC, and Albus/Scorpius) being great parents to their children, and is probably the closest to what you're looking for out of these. The latter two are also really great adventure/mystery fics. linkao3(Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time) linkao3(Put Your Curse in Reverse) linkao3(Set Fire to our Homes)

But my absolute favorite of what you're asking for is linkffn(Grow Young With Me), a Harry/OC slow burn that takes place a year or two after Ginny's death. Harry's interactions with his three young children (& Teddy) are really adorable and wholesome to read.

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

  As Albus and Scorpius begin their life together, Albus discovers that married life is every bit as wonderful and difficult as he always anticipated it would be. Life is better now that they're free from the looming threat of a Dark Arts resurgence, but Albus quickly realizes that there are plenty of other threats, too, like aggravating bosses and unexpected bouts of baby fever. Meanwhile, officials within the Ministry unearth a rapidly-worsening problem: for reasons unknown, the frequency of Squib births has quietly and suddenly quadrupled, leading to serious concerns over what might be prohibiting wizards and witches from passing on their magical genes-- and what that might mean for the coming generations of Wizardkind. While James and his new Ministry department struggle to deal with the societal impacts of an unprecedented amount of Squib children, Lily and Albus find their jobs--and their lives--intersecting in an unexpected way.
