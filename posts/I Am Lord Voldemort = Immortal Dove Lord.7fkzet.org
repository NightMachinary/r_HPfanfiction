** I am still waiting for a fanfic story where 'Timelord Dr. Molavo' travels back in time to change history. It isn't shown who he really is until someone argues with Dr. Molavo that Voldemort was before his time.

** Years ago, I made a wizard rock/electronic band from the perspective of Ron in fourth year, when he is jealous of Harry for entering the Triwizard Tournament but before the dragon task. Ron, in a fit of jealousy, decides he hates Harry and will become his own dark lord. Ronald Bilius Weasley anagrams to I Was Lord Elbin Ausley. I played one show even.
