He was blind and crippled, too, or something but he was a hard-ass. It was kind of dumb and he made an entrance like Moody into the Great Hall on his first day at Hogwarts or something.


** Edit: I misread the thread and thought you were looking for any dragon fics. I'm starting to think I need glasses at this point.

  - It's one long fight between a girl who slowly turns into a dragon that gets stronger the longer she fights and the rest of the world's superheroes. Probably one of the greatest things I've ever read.

  - "Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange new symptoms while taking part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could these two things possibly be connected?"

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter the Dragon]]

  - "It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned. "

  A disabled Harry comes to Hogwarts story. Everyone expects him to be like his dad, but how can he be with such a different past? A Slytherin Harry takes on Hogwarts in an unusual way.

      I own nothing\.  Less than nothing, even\.  They \(i\.e\. \- Harry, Snape, etc\.\) aren't mine, but should any OCs make cameo appearances, I will claim them\.  :\)Oh and Etherian is my beta; so if you run across any glaring errors, they're probably mine\.  :\)
