1.  What if he hadn't trusted the one guy who's an expert occlumens, might have a reason to hate him and is way too involved with Dumbledore? Unbreakable Vows exist for a reason (funny how that complaint also applies to Dumbledore, both are idiots of the highes measure), yet for some reason only scared mothers are smart enough to use them.

2.  What if he sent a muggle assassin to Little Winging? Or just kidnap Harry on his way from buying groceries or whatever? The good old "whack him over the head and pull him into a van" maneuver?

3.  What if he had an actual plan for the DoM incident instead of relying on a bunch of coincidences and things going wrong for Harry? Oh and for the sake of all that is holy, why personally enter the Ministry at the worst possible moment, when before you decided going there personally would be too risky?

4.  Similarly Crouch Jr. invading Hogwarts for months, risking discovery each and every day is the dumbest plan ever (though that may be on Crouch, but I tend to think that it has been sanctioned by Voldemort).

5.  What if you don't play with Harry Potter in the graveyard and just kill him instead? If you absolutely have to stroke your own ego remove any possible means of escape (PORTKEYS!!!!) beforehand.

6.  What if his inner circle was actually composed of accomplished wizards and witches instead of entitled pure blood snobs who are defeated by actual school children?

7.  What if he created /one/ spare Horcrux that isn't stupidly easy to find (toss a rock in the north sea)? Optionally maybe hide them better? Things haven't exactly been going great for you dude. Just take some sensible precautions for your huge ace(s) in the hole. Or - I don't know - check up on them from time to time? YOUR DEFENSES ARE SO BAD, THEY GOT DEFEATED TWICE! WHY IS THERE NO SILENT ALARM? Maybe use some of that incredible magic of yours to observe cave entrances for disturbances? He knows that Dumbledore found one of his Horcruxes (Diary) and might figure shit out, right?

8.  What if he made the very obvious connection between a prophecy, an odd metaphysical connection to Harry (btw, he also talks to snakes), AND attempting to create a Horcrux during the murder of the Potters? I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? They also have the same wands by the way, which is its own can of worms. Nothing to worry about here. All perfectly normal, a-ok!

9.  Harry and his best friends are mysteriously absent in 7th year and Ron has "spattergroit". What if Voldemort realizes that his biggest threat, Harry, might actually be doing something threatening and instead of waiting around to be defeated kidnaps all the Weasleys that he can get his hands on? He then starts removing limbs one by one until Harry surrenders himself or Ron delivers Harry.

10. For some unfathomable reason Arthur Weasley is still working at the Ministry during DH. How about Voldemort actually makes use of the Imperius or Polyjuice for something useful instead of the usual mustache twirling bullshit. Arthur blasting Molly in the back during the Final Battle could have given old Voldy a good chuckle. Holy shit, even craven Draco could figure that crap out.

11. How about they don't do that silly siege on Hogwarts thing, okay? Those rebels standing against them are all outcasts and in exile. Let them come and assault Voldies stronghold if they want a fight. Or let them rot in Hogwarts and send retarded Potterwatch radio transmissions until they run out of food if that's what they prefer: "Day 215. Harry is looking a bit haggard, but he claims he's still in tip top form for his soon-ish duel with the Dark Lord. Viva la restiance!"

Feel free to post fanfic recommendations with non-moronic Voldemort (the only ones that come to mind for me are HPMOR and DP&SW).

** Well, wouldn't the argument be that Voldemort split his soul? We know from the books that he delved into Magics that changed his appearance into a snake-human hybrid, and if the soul is the seat of our being, it's reasonable to assume that by making horcruxes he reduced his mental capacity and went insane. Insane people are not usually capable of being rational or making intelligent choices.

There's also the argument that said Harry would be Voldemort's equal. How? In terms of magical power? Sure, but raw magical power isn't going to do anything against decades of skill and experience. Age and experience trump youth and enthusiasm every time. (Not to mention no equality was necessary to make Voldemort's curse rebound). So maybe they're equal mentally. Let's face it, Harry was not the smartest person in Hogwarts and regularly ended up in Voldemort's traps. That would make more sense; if Harry is an irrational, hormonal, emotionally stunted teenage boy, and Voldemort has an equal mental space, is it really any wonder that he has convoluted and frankly ridiculous plans?

** Well, Harry would be dead, he would rule the Isles and we would have no books. Or they would be a lot closer to the Diary of Anne Frank. Given that the Ministry under Voldemort enacted their own Nürnberg laws and turned Azkaban into a concentration camp, I would say that the comparison is pretty accurate.

Sure, I get that. I'm sometimes just frustrated that JKR couldn't contend herself with a magically powerful but insane / completely bonkers Dark Lord. No, that wasn't enough. He also has to be Head Boy, charming (even though he's never shown as charming, he's always incredibly creepy) and super intelligent (even though he's demonstrably stupid).

I know that people usually claim "well he's just flawed and arrogant", but if you're so arrogant that it clouds your entire judgment, making you incapable a single rational decision, you cannot be called smart anymore.

Maybe more Hitler parallels? Charismatic, able to build a reign of terror which almost was successful (if not for Land-Lease or Churchill), judgement clouded by hatred, a desire for more which lead to ruin, bouts of anger ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM42YTY62rA][cue the NEIN, NEIN, NEIN, NEIN, NEIN!]]), a distrust for his underlings and a weird fixation on someone technically harmless which lead to ruin.

It may be selling Hitler a bit short though: I know that Hitler's abilities as a military commander have been mocked a lot in hindsight, but at the time they called him the Gröfaz and I don't think the magnitude of Voldemort's failure really compares. Voldemort is just fighting a bunch of incompetent school teachers and barely-adults, not Russia and the Allies. I have no idea how he can lose, considering his main opposition has ZERO operational security and his side has no moral reservations at all about anything.

Seelöwe was doomed to fail since there was no way the Germans could have kept the Royal Navy out of the Channel for long enough to conquer the UK. A successful invasion would have only doomed the men on the beaches. Invading Russia was entirely unwinnable without the ability to blockade them, which would include the Pacific ports and the land routes.

Hood was revived after Voldemort attacked for the first time because of a spell prepared by an Unspeakable Seer in the 19th century. But his visions were a little off - he expected an undead dragon, actually - and his spell did the best it could, sort of, by grabbing the closest thing to the Bismarck.

In which Voldemort comes back saner, and/or he pursues his goals with intelligent political maneuvering:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] (53k+ words, updated within the last month)

In which Voldemort wins (or at least doesn't lose so pathetically):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] (155k+ words, complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12885827/1/The-Ward][The Ward]] (23k+ words, ~6 months since last update)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][Beyond the Curtain]] (42k+ words, frequently updated)

In which Tom Riddle never crosses the moral event horizon in the first place:

- Many of The Carnivorous Muffin's fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] (152k+ words, frequently updated), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/11/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] (53k+ words, complete)

- Voldemort is cautious the night he goes to murder the Potters. Rather than kill Harry, he abducts him and begins to experiment with ways to avoid fulfilling the prophecy.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]]* (53k+ words, updated within the last month)

- After his death at the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort finds himself waking up in his teenage body at Wool's Orphanage the summer after he opened the Chamber of Secrets. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat the errors that led him to such an ignominious fate.

This is a Regulus/Hermione pairing. It will be interesting to watch where it goes.

Similarly, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12959277/1/Paradox][Paradox by olivieblake]] is an AU where Voldemort has hidden a number of Horcruxes throughout parallel universes. This is Dramione. I really enjoyed it, although there are some definite OOC moments, olivieblake is really good at world building.

  But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.'

  ‘She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once. ‘She doesn't give a damn -‘

  ‘But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him. ‘She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.'

  ‘I still don't -‘

  ‘While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, whilst you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.'

Lily's sacrifice was needed for Dumbledore to place the charm he did on Harry, which Petunia then sealed by taking Harry in. But even if Lily's sacrifice is made void, Dumbledore's charm will stay. The protections aren't the same thing. They're connected, yes, but Lily's sacrifice is carried through Harry's body, always with him, while Dumbledore's charm works only in certain conditions.

*********** Yes, I can accept that, but the charm itself works on the blood so it would recognize Voldemort as Harry's family just like Lily's protection does. Pay attention to what exactly he said..

/Your mother's sacrifice made the/ */bond of blood/* /the strongest shield I could give you/ / */her blood/* /became your refuge/

At least that's how I understand Dumbledore's explanation. Lily's family blood seems to be the unintended backdoor into the protection.

************ The charm itself works on whether or not Harry accepted Petunia's home as his own and vice versa. The charm is based off of Lily and Harry's blood, yes, but it doesn't continue functioning off it. It continues working based on whether or not Harry lives with Petunia.

Harry couldn't have lost Lily's protection in the third book, but he could have lost Petunia's when he ran away from home. It's because they work differently.

But that's Minecraft, where the only blocks that obey Gravity are sand and gravel.

******* I'm not sure... AFAIR Dumbledore was pretty vague on the details... but I'll try to look it up tomorrow, a bit too late in the day now for me.

Just one more question: So do you think none of the remaining Death Eaters ever tried anything to take revenge after the war? They definitely wouldn't have been ordered by Voldemort and would have done it on their own imitative.

  "While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you."
#+end_quote

From Order of the Phoenix. It's implied pretty heavily that it's meant to protect from Voldemort and not just all harm.

Eh, probably, but they still would have tried doing it /for/ Voldemort. Death Eaters are pretty much just an extension of Voldemort. They're even branded.

** It's a consequence of a common failing in the Wizarding World - reliance on magic makes wizards complacent, deteriorating their ability for critical thinking. Many, many problems there are the result of wizards not being able to think beyond their comfortable mindset.
