Hi,

As you have probably noticed, the depth in magic in canon is quite shallow. The only duel that is slightly interesting is the one in the Ministry Atrium in the 5th book between Albus and Voldemort.

So, I would like some recommendations of fanfics where there is exceptional world building, where magic has actual depth and the main character is quite competent.

I don't really mind who the main character is, but I don't like Hermione-centric fics.

Thank you ðŸ˜³


** This might not be what you're looking for but it has amazing world building. It's on going bit really worth the read. It follows Percy as the main character, but has alot of nice bonding moments between the weasleys.

Description: A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746)

This story goes and adds some real depths to Lily's sacrifice for Harry and does so in a very entertaining way. Characters have good dynamic and the story never hits a boring part.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.
