Ehm. And I quote.

"This is terrible. Its not even funny. Lots of authors work hard on their stories and its not fair for you to make fun of that. Youre just being awful and mean."

-angry person, 2020

Excellent.

Please note: This was a very light hearted parody. Barely even a parody and I only wrote it because of someone on this sub and they liked it soooo...


** Good job.

** If you find it OK to criticize other people's work (even in the form of a parody) you should find it OK that other people might criticize yours too (even in the form of an angry response). If you cannot stomach other people's criticism, you should not do it yourself in the first place.

*** I mean... I'm pretty well pleased with the comment. It means I did it right. As evidenced by the "excellent."

Also its not criticizing anyone's work. It was just a cute little way to poke fun at tropes in general

**** Poking fun is still a way to criticize something because it means you disagree with those opinions.

***** Uh... I think you might be misunderstanding this. I actually have fics that fit some of the tropes... which is mentioned at the end of the fic.

****** I haven't read your fic but I think I understand what you mean. I think (and emphasize the word) you believe that you wrote a cute tongue-in-cheek story about some tropes. However if you would have whole-heartedly agreed that those were your headcanon, you wouldn't have mocked them. I apologize if my interpretation is incorrect.

Here. If you'd like. I think you're right in theory. And again I'm not upset at the criticism. I quite enjoy it.

***** And what an awful thing it is to disagree. Dude, chill out, he's criticizing tropes, not concrete fics.

****** I am quite chill. I actually was explaining my view of the interaction between a critic and a critic of their criticism. You have to accept it just like you expect them to accept it.
