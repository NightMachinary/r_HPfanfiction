So I spent some time hearing about the world's problems and need to see some terrible fictional world be hopeful for the future. Or something like that.

Preferably long. And it has to be complete because abandoned fics are the most hopeless things of all.


** This is a weird one but honestly? The Seventh Horcrux. The premise, that the Horcrux's personality overtakes Harry's on Halloween 1981, sounds dark but the series is really funny and has a fantastic ending.

*** Its not really weird at all, honestly from all the fics I know this is the only one which isn't just goos, but also has a satisfying ending.

** All my fics have a happy ending, with the world a better place, but the way there might be dark. All but the current WIP are finished, too.

*** I'm already reading The Granger Principle. Don't usually read two from the same author side-by-side. Your stories are great.

** Well, The Arithmancer series is pretty hopeful and very long linkffn(13001252)

linkffn(8581093) is pretty hopeful.

E: accidentally posted the last installment from the Arithmancer series. Search for the first one on the profile of the author.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
