** Not sure what you mean by "work for" but /Grow Young With Me/ has Harry slooooooowly developing feelings for an OC muggle woman. It's probably one of the most realistic and organic relationships I've read in fanfiction, honestly. He's not slaying dragons or rescuing her from a castle, but they don't just trip over each other and find themselves in love, if that's what you mean.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  It's the summer after the Department of Mysteries and Harry Potter's about to do something drastic, something nobody expects, and he may not be alone. Following the lives of Harry and the Order as they battle against each other.

**** Came here to rec this. There are some slow spots and its not perfect but this fic has, imo, the best Harry/OC relationship of any I've read.

*** I recently re-read this one and it still holds up well. Easily one of the best in the HP fandom. I will say that it needed an editor for grammar, character names, and length, but otherwise top form for romance fiction.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** Nothing new really besides [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5mizp5/if_you_havent_read_contractual_invalidation_a/?st=ixn256u4&sh=3e9c2ee0][this thread]] which I liked but it definitely had some suspension of disbelief problems. The politicking is quite fun imo.

Then there's always the stuff like Perfect Situations and Matroyshka Vignettes by Jeconais but you've probably read that.
