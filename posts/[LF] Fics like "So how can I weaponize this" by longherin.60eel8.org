Okay so I love how this fic took the conventions and threw them through the window. I liked the munchkining and the integration of ideas from games etc. Anything like that?


** JKR was known to invent 'cool' magical devices to advance her plot.

Repeated uses of these devices, such as the Time-Turner and Unbreakable Vow, would actually break her world. Even 'less powerful' devices such as Magical Trunks and Imperius Curse could easily lead to extinction-level events.

The Fidelius Charm can remove the knowledge of a location from every single individual on the planet.

If the stare of a Basilisk works when it is young a Parselmouth could carry it around and have a death ray. Want to make your dark wizard debut? Large sports stadium would be a great place to start.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

** Step 1: go to florida

Step 2: buy couple hundred cloaks and leave them laying about a generally untraveled area

Step 3: wait for all cloaks to be replaceed by lethifold

Step 4: stitch them together save a small ring in the middle

Step 5: use misty patronus to prevent your own demise and give mysterious mist effect

Step 6: walk into MoM and murder everyone

Final result: nobody even thought to use the patronus cause wizards are all dumbasses

** Your gonna have to give some examples. As in some stories so i get a better idea on what conventions and what your title means. There is no context here.

*** There is plenty of context. Munchkinry is context, so is the rec'd fic.

To the OP: Fanficauthors' Jeconais wrote one called Blue Steel. [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/]]

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.
