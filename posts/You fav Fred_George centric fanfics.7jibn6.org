** I'm quote my last comment since I said it all already. They are all in character from what I can tell.

  Seriously. Despite the Twins' popularity, these fics are insanely hard to find.

  Anyways, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]] by plutoplex is one that I vouch that has decent writing and storyline. I really love how the author emphasizes the Twins differences but still kept the Twins' bond.

  Basically, they are in their 6th year attempting to get their names into the Goblet of Fire since they are not of age yet. Fred and George tried creating something that would age them, however they instead ended up in the Marauder's era.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
