** Instead of a horror story, I'd take an antisocial, sad/depressed Harry but with an insanely cute love of puppets and dolls who come alive due to his magic. They are happy to play with him and keep him company but are insanely protective of him due his abusive relatives and isolation issues. When he goes to Hogwarts and makes some tentative new friends who are initially apprehensive of the puppets and vice versa but both eventually accept each other.

*** Feel like I prefer the horror version, but that may just be because I prefer horror over fluff.

**** It starts out with Harry & his adorable puppets being loved by strangely cooperative Dursleys. Draco quickly loses his abrasive personality from their first meeting. Hermione, who'd annoyed Harry, soon begins to follow him around. Snape spends all of class staring in silence. When Ron wins against Harry in chess, he soon loses all motivation to be anything but "a supportive friend".

What better way to protect Harry than by neutralising /everyone/ before they can cause him harm?

**** Yes, I would prefer horror version. Wouldn't it be cool that the "power the dark lord knows not " is not a crummy love shit but ruthless puppets that shoots spell and slay your ass?

** Do you think that him running out into the wilderness would stop the entire magical community from finding the chosen one who is the only one who could basically kill hitler?

Interesting story though. You could write this, you could easily make it original if you want to take full credit for it. Cool.

*** It's a fanfiction. If its possible make super godpower Harry, its sure as hell possible to somehow make the community dumb enough to not find Harry.
