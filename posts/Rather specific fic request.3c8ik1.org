I'm just getting back into reading HP fic after years away. I'm very persnickety about my reading material and would love to find more of the good stuff.

I'm mostly looking for long fics, with very high standards of writing. I like postwar fics, I like a lot of detail and realism, and I /really/ like fics which examine wizarding society with a bit of a critical/adult lens. I don't care much about ships, although really out-there pairings will annoy me if not done exceptionally well, and I really enjoy UltraCompetent!Hermione fic.

My favorite HP fics are anything by AJ Hall, and Amends, Or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky.

Thanks in advance for any help, I'm bedridden for at least the next couple weeks and fic has been a great help in warding off boredom.


** linkffn(The golden age by arsinoe de blassenville) is great.

*** OP, this meets all your criteria. It is such a clear progression of the canon characters for me that every other postwar fic is a letdown (and I say that as a big fan of pre-Xmas "Truth and Reconciliation"). The Ginny chapter, in particular, is heartbreaking, and the final chapter gorgeous, terrible, and inevitable. Read this before anything else.

**** Thanks for this rec. I'm halfway through it, and while I find the writing style a bit choppier than Hall or Rozalsky, and some of the events get handwaved pretty fast; it's laugh-out-loud funny ("Goat cheese? Gilbert and Sullivan? Who knew?") and the characters are very believable and interesting.

***** ...and I finished it. Damn. I still prefer TaR for the writing style, but this was a powerful story. Those dreams at the end...I really expected a Dollhouse-style 'Oh, and from these seeds came the apocalypse' ending.

** So I'm way late to the party, but since Rozalsky and A.J. Hall are also some of the best stuff I've ever come across I'd love to have seen more suggestions here. Arsinoe de blassenville is great but a bit dark for my tastes by the end.

For general commentary on the Potterverse you might be interested in [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/potterverse.html][J. Odell's stuff]]. Odell seems to have run in the same fandom circles as the authors you mention; some of their work is hosted on the site.

You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/Cry-Out-Curlew][Cry Out, Curlew]]. Disclaimer: it's frustratingly unfinished and like many fics starts to wander a bit towards the end. That said, it's well written and has a well-characterized competent (but not cardboard/superpowered) Hermione as the protagonist and some interesting worldbuilding re: the politics of the wizarding world.

The so standard it's now clich√© answer to "good post-DH stories" is to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] both of whom are well written canon-compliant continuation fic writers. Not a whole lot of critical analysis of the Potterverse worldbuilding, but still interesting stories. They avoid superpowering any characters or random bashing, though they can get a little fluffy at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/An-Interview-with-Justin-FinchFletchley][An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley]] - This is relatively short (~20K words), framed as a radio interview, a fascinating take on the post-war judicial process. Well done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] This one is also very commonly recommended. Short atmospheric one-shot about Colin Creevey's photos and the consequences of the war. Evocative and sad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5713064/1/Little-Red-Courgette][Little Red Courgette]] A pastiche of the BBC sitcom Yes, Minister through a Potterverse lens. Draco/Harry slashy but tolerable to me because the story is so fun. This one's for you if you enjoy Yes, Minister's cynical take on governance or are just interested in its amusing take on magical bureaucracy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/insurgere][insurgure]] Another evocative little one-shot, this one featuring a Hufflepuff Tom Riddle. Well done, I think it works so well because it's so short. Makes its point and is done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8821224/1/Hatred-burns-stronger-than-determination][Hatred Burns Stronger Than Determination]] - One-shot with a competent and ruthless Hermione. A dark take on what wizarding prejudice might have wrought.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons with Hagrid]] - Funny crack one-shot where Harry learns Hagrid's special kind of occlumency. None of the crude sexual humor of most crack-fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] - This one is not as well written as my other recs, unfinished, and IMO shares the common fanfic mistake of dragging on too long. That said, one of the best CharacterX-in-Slytherin fics I've come across, and features competent|Hermione as the protagonist.

Bonus extra fic recommendation: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/106190/chapters/146600][Carpetbaggers]] - After Aslan leaves the real work begins. Takes a critical look at what might have happened after the end of C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

** I loved Spellcaster by SGCbearcub.

I also like Ron El Greco by SolticeMuse though Hermione isn't ultracompetent in it like she is in Spellcaster.

The Birthday Present by ExcessivelyPerky is nice and long.

** I can't really throw any specific HP fics at you, since I know so many good ones. So I'll direct you to my fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3049623/thelegendarysupernerd][profile]] page to look at my favorites. There should be more than enough to keep you busy for some time there.
