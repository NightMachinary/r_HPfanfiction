What are the tropes people like the least and /why/ do you dislike them? Please do include your reasons.


** Marriage law, just fuck this shit

If you like to hear my reasons, here is the short version:

This atrocity is so repugnant that even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to push. You have to go as low as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide][Khmer Rouge]] to find anything similar in the real world.

Barons are a thing. Earls. Viscounts. Counts. But nooooooooooo, it has to be Lord Potter, not Count Potter. And I refuse to get started on the social interactions in those pureblood wank fests.

** The idea that everyone must meet and get together with their True Love™ while at school, and that those people will be together forever and ever, never imagining the fact that people in their 20s are a lot different than those same people in their teens.

I would love it to see a fic where a teenage romance is handled realistically, eg they aren't talking about marriage and kids at the age of 15, there's awkwardness and inexperience to deal with, the first time having sex is not great, etc etc.

Anybody who's not a teenager knows that school romances rarely last.

True love. It's dumb in real life, it's not going to be less dumb in fanfiction. To clarify, I mean the idea of two people being destined for each, perfect together, and all that shit. I do think love exists, just find the idea of 'your perfect someone' moronic.

*** No list is safe.

>Dumbledore being evil for the sake of the plot with almost no reedeming qualities other than "the greater good"

Jeremy Bentham called, he wants his catchphrase back.

>Lordships, owning ridicolous amounts of money and land across the world, and Harry suddenly having a seat (or several) or a say on the Wizangamot as a 12 year old

The world would be a better place if twelve-year-olds had a say. Or /drastically/ worse, but I'm an optimist.

>Underage Harry insulting, threatening adults such as teachers, and official members of the ministry while nobody bats an eye, or just reprimand him as he has his wand pointing at them. Worse is when he actively attacks someone like Snape or god forbid, Dumbledore and nothing happens to him.

Well, they can't prosecute the Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Wylt-Dagworth-Granger-Evans-O'Malley-O'Carrol-O'Reilly-O'Brien-O'Sullivan-Smythe-Smith

> 12-year-old Harry talking and acting like a politically hardened adult with decades of experience

*/Politics/*

Fanfic:

'Dumbledore doesn't understand that this is a war, and sometimes you've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.'

Reality:

'I'm surprised you haven't considered the outcry from cauldron manufacturers over a new standardization of cauldron bottom thickness. Especially after last year's Cauldron Purity guidelines forcing better quality metals in cauldrons.

>When authors decide to use childish and insulting names for characters, often having Harry saying it to their face (dumb-as-door, snakeface, voldyshorts, etc...) and use Avada Kedavra as a synonym, or in prose, or shorten it to simply AK ("Avada Kedavra eyes" come to my mind)

'His eyes were a bright, emerald green. Killing curse green. He looked dangerous, and I loved it'

>11 year olds having sex. Simply dating, or having romantic feelings/attractions are fine. 14-15s having sex or fooling around is somewhat fine too, but anything younger is no-no

Because apparently puberty starts at 10 and finishes about 1 month later. (I was going to write a scene but replace all the descriptions with 11-year-olds, but I threw up halfway through)

>Any adult pairings with literal children (and yes, Tonks and Fleur are both adults)

Why set a story in the future when you can turn characters into pedophiles?

>Male pregnancies

Shitting babies or passing like a kidney stone, either way, that sucks.

>Goblin ex Machina

Don't you know? They've spent 100s of years hunting Horcruxes because Goblins hate phylacteries. For... /reasons/, apparently.

>Comically abusive, borderline murdering or rapist Dursleys

Again, the three Bs.

>Ridiculous, godlike animagus forms

His animagus form is Kyubey. Or: Don't you know Harry has such a /unique/ connection with death? Of course he'd be a thestral.

>Harry being written from a first-person perspective

You're not Rick Riordan. You will never be Rick Riordan. Fanfiction authors should take note.

Because the way to be rational is to ignore everything that disproves your position.

Freud was right!!!!!!!!! The sky is falling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because wandmakers are obviously a personification of Death. Yep.

It's just one small step from intellectual superiority to trying to prove your physical superiority.

** Independent!Harry that's a series of shopping montages, multi-family inheritances, and discovering of utterly game-breaking lost family magicks.

Death Eaters being revealed as "not so bad" by the protag listening to them talk, without questioning biases. They're terrorists, idiot, of course they'll lie.

Poorly done bashing fics. Ron, the twins, Dumbledore, Snape, and the Malfoys all have flaws that merit horrifying and bloody deaths (the last 3, anyway. Weasleys still fought for the right side, so a little embarrassment is ok).

DE!Ron fics that have him doing so for simple little vengeances, and not real reasons, like how listening to Dumbledore gets his family killed with nothing in return.

***** Yeah, but apparently he's a spy. Despite JKR never choosing sides for Snape, his death suggests he was meant to be on their side the whole time. Which regardless of failings I personally think is better than being murderous assholes who swapped sides because they lose. I think Snape is a character fans have they make their own decisions on them, because JKR couldn't.

Disclaimer: Hyperbole present

>I couldn't give less of a shit about Slytherins if I tried.

Is there a trope here?

>Ginny being a slut because she dated two boys in three years

'She unbuttoned her collar one more button, how /scandalous/'

>Harry (and sometimes Gary Stu!Neville) being the only datable guy in the castle seemingly.

Have you seen Matthew Lewis? He makes everyone else less datable because they have to compete with him

>The general attitude that the richer you are, the better of a person you are.

The formula is /m^2=c^2+l^2./ Where /m/ equals moral goodness, /c/ equals liquid capital in galleons, and /l/ equals landholdings by the square kilometer.

>Convoluted reasons for Harry to somehow meet Hermione before Hogwarts.

Don't you know that there is only one dentist in the UK?

>Friendly goblins

Remembering a Goblin's name? /It simply isn't done/, no matter how impractical it makes daily interaction.

>Daphne (she would be # AllLivesMatter let's be real)

Ah, neutrals, where tradition is more important than human rights.

>Every Ravenclaw bullying Luna, always led by Cho and Marietta

They needed a hobby.

>'It's not bashing, it's how they are in canon !'

Don't you know Ron was always a raging homophobe? It was quite clear. Pg. 103, HP and the Philospher's Stone.

>Neville replacing Ron and basically being the same person with flaws removed.

Well, I mean, Ron and Neville are the only characters who go through a character arc, so they have that in common.

>Comically over the top Dursley abuse. Like the ones where they eat Hedwig for Christmas dinner.

I've coined the term, 'the three Bs'; Bat, Belt, and Buggery. Because again, criminal negligence isn't horrible abuse.

>Slytherins getting praised by the narrative for nothing

Praised for a properly pawky pontification on how prejudice is perfect.

>Magical Cores

'Honestly Harry, there hasn't been a theory which has postulated a magical core since the 1700s.' - Seventh Horcrux, Emerald Ashes

>Weasley bashing in general

See the above formula for moral goodness.

>Using characters as your mouthpieces

Someone ought to tell NoodleHammer

>Luna being a flawless goddess

She is, she's the Harry Potter version of a waifu

>Greg, Vince and Millie

That's too much personification for things I suspect to be particularly clever trees

>ZOMG Ginny looks just like your mom !"

Because hair is the only defining feature of a person. Nevermind those silly things like cheekbones, or the jaw, the nose, complexion, build, eyes, the height of the temples, the width of the face, overall height, arm length proportion, inner leg measurements, waist circumference.

>Dumbledore/Weasleys/whoever the author doesn't like getting enslaved for life in Gringotts life as punishment for being so EEEEVVVILLLEEEEE. Usually ends with a dragon shitting on them.

Because slavery is right if it's done to those for whom you have a personal distaste.

>First Year study club.

They call it a study club, but we all know what they're really doing.*

>Harry having an all-caps temper tantrum every other chapter, where he complains about how shit his life is, and then proceeds to insult everyone in the room, and then leaves without any repercussions.

>Wizengamot factions that literally have "light" or "dark" in their names

According to article 13, section 7, subsection B of the Fanfiction Accords: 'Moral Ambiguity is prohibited without a proper license, and if found, should be replaced with terms, 'dark' or 'light', 'good' or 'evil', or some combination thereof.
