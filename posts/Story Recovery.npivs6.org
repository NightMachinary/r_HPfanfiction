I feel like I've hit the wall. I don't know how to recover after reading Debt of Time and the Eighth Year Universe. I love those so much, and feel like I can't get past them. Of course I read fanfic constantly, but I just keep searching and can't find anything similar. Any suggestions? I'm looking for finished works, they can be pro dark or light, but I can't read any main pairing with Snape or Ron/Harry. I just can't do it haha. I know this is so broad. I have very diverse tastes, I've been into pure blood politics lately because I'm basic and can't help myself.


** I've got a few fics for you, but I've never read what you listed, and am just listing things I always recommend.

linkffn(11762850) Harry Potter and The Accidental Horcrux, by The Imaginizer. Scarcrux, grey!Harry, no bashing, Gen, Harry is friends with Tom (and knows hes Voldemort.) The second work, sadly, is abandoned.

linkao3 (14074770) In the language of flowers, by dwellingondreams. Petunia is the witch, not lily. Sirius/Petunia, Lily/James. Covers Marauders-era Hogwarts, the First Wizarding War, and the aftermath.

linkao3 (11457669) a life of smoke and silvered glass, by dirgewithoutmusic. Severus apologizes for calling Lily a mudblood, and things change (and things don't.) They stay friends. Gen, mostly, but with the usual Lily/James. Long oneshot. Beware of tears --- you might cry.

linkao3 (19309174) The Potions Mistress, by myrskytuuli. Role reversal, Lily is the angry potions professor. Mostly gen, follows the several Hogwarts years and canon material, while changing due to Lily and dropping hints on the past. Don't worry, they've answered all your questions by the end.

linkao3 (24003130) The Ordinary Life of a Sidekick, by tea33. Ron is bitten by a vampire a few weeks before sixth year, and struggles. Diverges from canon, (not the main premise, but Ron/Hermione) doesn't focus much on the canon material, either.

linkao3 (20196385) A Cuckoo in the Nest, by Limited_Edge. Ginny is successfully possessed by Tom. Sort of crackish, but does focus on the plot too. Gen (I think, haven't read it in a while, to be fairly honest) and hasn't updated since mid 2020. I still hold my hopes, though.

linkao3 (11270490) you belong to me (i belong to you) by Child_OTKW. Harry timetravels to the 40s, Tom Riddle era, and wakes up in the body of Slytherin Nathan Ciro (original character, his family is too, but doesn't take away from the canon material that the author goes off) and Tom senses something is up. Fairly gen, though Tom and Harry kind of have a ‘vibe' going. The author swears it isn't slash, but I hold my stance.

Anyways, hope I helped.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.

  Ron Weasley was a sidekick. He knew what everyone said, despite many believing him to be stupid. He was Harry Potter's best mate, a part of the supposed Golden Trio. So nothing too bad would happen to him, right, being a sidekick and all? He'd always be there, ready for the next round. Wrong. Ron is unprepared when he is attacked by a vampire just a few weeks before sixth year.

  Instead of confronting Harry in an epic snake-battle showdown, Tom instead takes complete possession of Ginny's body. Now, hidden among his new 'family', he bides his time, waiting for the moment to strike- the moment to kill the Boy Who Lived, and the Weasleys as well for good measure. It was the perfect plan... ...As long as he didn't get caught up in the act of being Ginevra Weasley.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. Seeking answers to his strange predicament, Harry returns to Hogwarts, and causes quite the stir through staff and students - especially when they come to realise he is not the same boy as before.He tries to avoid suspicion, but as his quest for the truth draws more and more attention to him, Harry begins to think that he might not like what he will discover.
