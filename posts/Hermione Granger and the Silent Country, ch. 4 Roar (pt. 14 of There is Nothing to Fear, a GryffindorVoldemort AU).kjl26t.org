The latest chapter, "Roar," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/69330477][here]]. CW for Violence.

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."
