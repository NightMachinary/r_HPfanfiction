I've seen a lot of fics where Harry or Hermione are sorted into Slytherin, but is there anything good where they are both sorted into the house of the snakes? I prefer Harmony or Haphne, as I don't find Draco redeemable at all, but a Hermione/Theo pairing isn't bad. He's kind of like the male version of Daphne Greengrass in that authors can do whatever they want with him.


** You could try The Anti-Heroine. I don't think I'm allowed to link it tho, bc of underage stuff. The first half or so is great in my opinion and I love the concept, but I had to stop reading because there was just so much unnecessary sex going on and I didn't like skipping chunks of the story at a time. It starts out as Harmony and then turns into a three-way relationship with Harry/Hermione/Tom (diary!Tom). Not hate towards the author, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe you'll like it tho. It's on AO3 you can just look it up.

*** I've looked at that before. While I enjoy a dark Harry and Hermione story as much as the next fellow, I can't past the idea of them actually being with a version of Voldemort. For one, would Harry really want to be with a guy would one day go on to murder his parents and send him to the Dursleys. So I think I'll give it a pass. Thanks for the suggestion though. :)

As far as I remember author either didn't decide or wrote the pairings.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
