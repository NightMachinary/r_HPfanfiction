So I was just reading a fic that had a good premise. It started with a bold heading of the characters name. That should have been my first warning...

That's me out. I really really battle to make it very far in "first person" type stories


** Harrison Potter Peverell Ollivander Slytherin Hogwarts Evans Gaunt Pendragon. Also he has spells that are way too overpowered that he randomly found in the Hogwarts library, learned at 13 and is now able to kill dementors with holy fire with the blessing the God Emperor of Mankind himself.

He has some random wood that sounds cool as his wand with a dual core of Phoenix feather and Basilisk venom. It symbolizes the way he was reborn when Voldemort attacked him or whatever.

** Bashing is the big one--"bashing done right" is an oxymoron. Well-written antagonists or antagonistic characters should already be something a writer strives for. If you don't like a particular character or a particular viewpoint, either use your narrative to /respectfully/ create a discourse on that topic or avoid it altogether.

"Fate's plaything," "Fate's chewtoy," "Fate's bitch," and variations thereof. I don't /inherently/ hate "woe is me"-type characters, but deft handling of narrative framing and character depth is key to writing such a character well. Without that, it's just draining to read. These phrases are especially egregious if they're used to describe Harry after Voldemort's final defeat--Harry spends nearly all of HBP and DH /away/ from the worst parts of the war and then lucks his way to success throughout most of DH.

*** About bashing- I think it's sometimes necessary.

Like, I was writing a fanfic where Harry is decidedly stronger than he was in canon. But the thing is, if I just follow canon stations, the story will suck as a result of that. The stronger the mc is, the harder the challenges he face should be. So I thought, oh hey I'n just gonna make everything just a little bit harder, add new conflicts.

The problem with that however is that it can't be Voldemort who is making it even harder. Harry is safe for the entirety of summer because of op protections. And he is at Hogwarts for the rest of the year. At that point I had a choice.

Make it so Voldemort can do more than convoluted ass plans to get to Harry, making Dumbledore look like even more of a useless idiot than in canon, and stomp on the idea that Hogwarts is an impregnable fortress. Or create a new antagonist.

I hate reading about OCs, so I don't write OCs unless I absolutely have to. And I sure as hell won't be making an OC my story's main antagonist. So... Dumbledore was all that was left, really. And it's perfect. All the protections Harry has around him, from the Dursleys to Hogwarts, are under his control. So if you want to make Harry really for work for a happy ending, Dumbledore is the best choice.

**** You're examples have failed to convince me that bashing is in any way necessary.

I do agree that protagonists should be challenged according to their power level. That being said, it's good practice to consider nerfing the protagonist if the author feels they need to universally raise adversity to maintain stakes. Early game power creep can easily push the author into a corner.

Why can't Voldemort be the one who makes it harder? Harry's physical well-being is /far/ from the only thing he can threaten. Harry being at Hogwarts /canonically/ doesn't do much to stop Voldemort and others who mean him harm from getting at him anyway.

Dumbledore doesn't automatically look like an idiot if Voldemort infiltrates Hogwarts. As long as Dumbledore and Hogwarts's protections are competent, I think most readers would be willing to give a pass--defending against terrorism is much harder than committing acts of terrorism.

I'm not a fan of OC antagonists either, but that doesn't necessitate jumping to bashing Dumbledore. A major antagonist doesn't have to be defined by magical prowess. There are any number of canon characters that can take up that role. Even if Dumbledore is made into an antagonist, he certainly doesn't need to be bashed. If need be, have him be an antagonist worthy of respect, either due to his capability, ideology, or both.

******** Both the light novels and anime are great, but if I had to choose one for someone new to the series, I'd recommend the anime. There are two main reasons for this.

The first is that it's a KyoAni adaptation, and KyoAni has a track record of going above and beyond with their adaptations. Many of them end up better than their original and this anime (no disrespect meant to Tanigawa Nagaru) is one of those.

The second is the achronological storytelling. Both the light novels and anime do this, but in different ways. The light novels have the major story arcs told in chronological order, with smaller stories filling in the gaps achronologically between those arcs. The anime mixes things up more thoroughly to great effect in both maintaining setup and payoff and creating dramatic tension. Depending on where you're getting the anime from, the episodes may be rearranged into chronological or some other order, so I'd make sure to check that. My recommendation is that you watch both seasons in Broadcast order. In general, I think that people should read at least one series with good continuity blind and out of order at least once in their life. The anime is a good way to do that without having to scramble the order of a series yourself.

(There's also a movie that's a direct sequel to the anime and adapts the fourth light novel. It's great too, if a bit melodramatic.)

(If you decide to rewatch the anime, that's when I'd recommend watching the entirety of the two seasons in chronological order.)

(There's a notorious section of the second season called "Endless Eight." It is a lot to get through, but I recommend you watch all of it at least once. I personally love it, especially for the challenge of spotting the differences.)

As opposed to relentlessly tearing apart Ron Weasley as a human garbage disposal who is jealous of everybody. This doesn't advance the plot at all. This is useless bashing.

Personally, I don't care if Ron/Dumbledore/Hermione/etc are good, evil, or died at childbirth. As long as the writing supports their given position in the fic in a way that is believable.

In some fics though that doesnt happen and all that evil is just thrown in without a thought. I actually read one where dumbledore was a blood purist and perfectly ok with snape kidnapping and keeping muggleborn students as sex slaves on a regular. As an offhanded remark. What the fuck is that.

First is if the fic sticks to canon like the plague for no actual reason. Every fic that just retells the books "with a twist" is a no from me, simply because I've read so many at this point.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9644209/1/Kyoko][Kyoko]] is not a HP but a Katekyo Hitman Reborn fanfiction and the author just completely changes the canon so much. But it was extremely interesting and with over 700k words one of the longest fanfictions I've read (which probably isn't that much for some of you lol)

Canon rehashes are just so boring and uncreative and more often than not I don't see the point. Sure, if it's a character study that focuses more on the emotions than on the action, using the canon is cool but if the story is the main focus I don't get why you would write basically the same story JKR wrote.

** -Yeah first person is also where I nope out.

-Also fics in which characters just suddenly become "good" or "bad" without anything to explain that change in behavior.

-Fics in which characters are just not in character. Some OOC is really good if the character is well written, and the decisions and motivations of the MC are relatable.

-Mary sue. Just no. Mostly I avoid fics in which there is a female OC because of this. I feel like many fics who have a (female) OC who is involved with the MC('s) are basically just the author writing a "cooler" version of themselves into the fic. Male OC's are usually not that often used for this but I tend to avoid these too.

-Harry Potter suddenly finds out that James Potter/Lily Potter aren't really his parents and that he is a Pureblood Deatheater child and Voldemort is all fluffy bunnies. Sometimes I like to read these good old cliche fics but I like to think that my tastes have improved overtime. I would even enjoy these kinnd of fics more if Voldemort still continued to stay somewhat in character. By which I mean he kills people and goes on raids.

  English isn't my first language so usually I'm pretty lenient on spelling. One thing that does bother me is long paragraphs. You know, when the author just forgets to start a new paragraph and creates a wall of text. It makes reading more difficult because the lines sometimes start blurring.

  Story- wise: Pairing the good guys with Death Eater scum makes me nope out pretty quickly. Draco and Snape are somewhat redeemable, I suppose. With *lots* of work. And this work needs to be done by the author, mind you, to convince their readers. Far too many stories just have canon Draco and Snape without even an attempt at redeeming them. But Bellatrix and Voldemort in any sort of romantical or sexual situation? No thanks.

  Romance and/ or sex can be pretty boring when the story is centered around them. There is plenty of smut and cheesy romance novels out there. I read Harry Potter for the cool, out of this world stuff like magic, battles, flying, magical creatures, etc. Romance and sex can be boring compared to that since most people can and do experience them in their day to day lives. And the worst thing someone can do is write about boring day to day stuff. I want the interesting stuff that I can't experience- space flight, combat, aliens, wizards, lasers, wands, etc. Compared to that romance is just- meh.

  Oh, evil Harry is a big no-no for me as well. Dark is okay if it's done well and he still fights Death Eaters and Voldemort.

  I'm also not a huge fan of stories about the kids from the epilogue. Partly because I don't want to acknowledge the epilogue, but mostly because I can't be arsed to remember all their stupid names. I probably would remember them if they were somewhat original but all the kids are named after already existing characters and it can get confusing real quick.

****** You can name your child anything you want, but Harry isn't a typical short form of "Harriet", and even less likely as a given name than as a nickname (which is already pretty uncommon).

Harry is traditionally a nickname for /Henry/. It's true that Harriette is a feminine form of Henry (or, more accurately, a variation of Henrietta), but that doesn't mean that Harry is a traditional nickname for Harriette. Harry is so strongly associated with boys that it would be very unusual to give it to a girl as a given name, and pretty unusual to give it to a girl as a nickname. Hallie, maybe, would be a nickname for Harriette.

You must have access to a baby name book somewhere, even if just at the local library. Take a look sometime, see where Harry is listed.

** Puh there's so much, it probably would be easier to describe what I read üòÇ so I don't like...

... bashing

... 2nd person (I prefer 3rd person. I don't have a problem with 1st person, but inexperienced writers tend to choose the first person so it's usually not that great)

... terrible grammar/spelling

... a story in which the only goal is to get 2 people together. Like Harry travels back to the past and the only difference is that he's suddenly dating Hermione/Draco/Snape/Luna/...?

... OOCness

... I'm also not a fan of OCs because that's also something beginners like to do and it takes a lot of skill to make it interesting

** - Sometimes I can bear first person (especially if it's an OC main character). What I hate is first person POV changes, even less when it gets changed several times per chapter. One fic I've read had first person with POV changes after every few sentences and then suddenly changed to third person for a few sentences and then back to first person again.

Hell, it wasn't even necessary to change the POV, everything could have been told from one perspective. Or if the author wants to show everything, third person omnicient is the way to go!

I noped the fuck out of there.

- Harem (but that's just my preference). On AO3 I can exclude pairings I don't like but on fanfiction.net it's not always obvious if it's a harem.

- Snape/ one of his students. If it's a time travel fic where the students gets to keep their older body that's okay buf if I read about this 35 year old man getting together with this 14 year old teenager, I'll rip my hair out.

- OP Harry because that's done to death. Usually you can see from the summary if you will like something or not, but sometimes it has an interesting summary with a pairing you like and then in the first chapter that whole Gringrotts-Lord-insert-30-names-here clich√© plays out with the even more clich√© shopping trip and I either skip all that or click away.

- Honestly, when the fic becomes stagnant and the author then admitting that they don't have that much fun writing. I don't wanna feel like I'm forcing someone to write and I hsve much more fun reading something if the writer also has fun writing it.

- Genderbend character just so that the pairing isn't gay. If being genderbend either doesn't change the character at all or changes them into a stereotypical always blushing girl, then I don't see the point in making them genderbend. Genderbend is a pretty interesting concept, especially in worlds where boys and girls are treated vastly differently and diving into how the character would be as the opposite gender could be really inreresting. But just so that your pairing is hetero? Just make them gay, man.

** 1. Changing the gender of characters (fem!Harry etc)

2. Excessively long authors notes at the beginning and end of each chapter. It's not always an automatic nope but I have a low threshold to tolerate 1) AN's demanding X number of reviews before updates 2) AN's which respond to a large number of reviews individually.

3. Incomplete. Unless written by an author I've previously enjoyed with a history of updating regularly and completing stories. I enjoy longer stories and hate getting invested in them only to learn 100K words later that there is a low likelihood of completion.

4. Not a fan of crossovers or songfics.

** Harry taking shortcuts to power that likely don't exist. Harry goes to the bank and finds tomes of family spells that give him just what he needs to beat Voldemort. Or Harry finds a hidden library in the Chamber of Secrets with hand written lessons from Salazar Slytherin himself. Or Harry finds "Power Rituals" in the Hogwarts Library that "strengthens his magical core" to put him on Voldemort and Dumbledore's level. Harry Potter ain't a shonen anime, but people keep trying to make it one. And I mean, that's their right, I guess, but it's boring.

Also, Harry going to the bank in general. Because more often than not he's not going there to withdraw money or steal a cup, he's getting emancipated (do banks even do that?) or investing in muggle companies or befriending goblins or withdrawing the aforementioned family spell books; basically anything other than withdrawing money or stealing a horcrux cup. Unless capitalism is gonna help him defeat Voldemort I don't wanna see it.

** Really only 2 things make me nope out.

1. Writing that is so bad it makes me have to reread parts over and over to understand it.\\

If reading something feels more like a job, I don't care how much I like the premise of the story, I simply can't read it. And its not even about a specific language, or even grammar, but also about simply how something is written. Ive come across poorly written stories in terms of someone knowing the english language or having poor grammar, but yet it was still easily understandable and flowed well.

1. Fics with obvious excess.

I actually don't mind things like polyamorous fics or fics where harry has a few last names, or is more powerful than Voldemort and Dumbledore, or is one of the top 10 wealthiest wizards in Britain and the like. But there is ALWAYS a limit before it starts getting stupid. A harem of 20 women for example. Stupid. 10 last names. Stupid. So OP he can wipe out life with his pinky finger just by thinking impure thoughts. Stupid. Wealthiest wizard in the world able to buy anything he wants ever for any price. Stupid.

--------------

While I am sure there may be other things that can bother me enough to abandon a fic, those 2 are without a doubt ways to make me abandon the fastest. I am also fairly sure both are the 2 most common reasons why folks would abandon fics.
