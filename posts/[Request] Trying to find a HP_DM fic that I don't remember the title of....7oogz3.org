So, I do remember it was Hogwarts era and that somehow Ron and Draco had switched bodies I think? And Ron (in Draco's body) and Theo end up into each other somehow. I remember a couple bath scenes. Maybe it was related to the Tri-Wizard Tournament? And I remember that Draco and Theo were close friends. Any ideas?
