** You might like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]]). It doesn't really go into Harry's childhood beyond a few flashback sequences, but he was raised and trained in secret by Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, [[/spoiler][Snape]] and [[/spoiler][Nicholas Flamel]] before going to Hogwarts.

It's one of the best fics I've ever read. It also hasn't been updated in three years and probably never will be again.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

**** N-No....! I turned off the subreddit style and read those spoilers ;(

Also 3 years? more like 2 years, it's not '18 yet! too bad it's not completed though but sure I'll check it out and share my thoughts on it once I've finished :)

although I'd have preferred it being more or less canon in which Albus doesn't hand Harry to the Dursleys but raises Harry himself in secrecy with some help by his trusted fellow wizards and witches :)

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For]]) Dumbledore and Sirius train Harry as a warrior in secret until he makes his public appearance at the end of Year 5. The story is not about the raising, but what happens after though.

*** Oh, pity I was looking forward to Harry being raised to being trained to being made public and engaging with the public and helping to finally living the rest of his life after the war ends :) (or sequel to adult Harry w/ Snape & Dumbledore alive in rebuilding the Magical Society in England from the ground up)

Thanks though! Am happy to see it's completed :) will let you know what my thoughts are when I'm finished!

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
