I've always been into the HHr scene, and I've never really delved into this sort of a fic. Looking for fics where the team is a really close group of friends, and spend a lot of time together. HHr is a huge plus :) Thanks!

*** 3 weeks and I just had time to start it. Thank you for sending me this. I haven't been addicted to a story like this in ages. On chapter 5. Sleep probably won't happen today.
