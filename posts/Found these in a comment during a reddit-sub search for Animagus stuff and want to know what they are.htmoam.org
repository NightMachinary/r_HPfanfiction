:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, yeah. I was looking through some old posts on Animagus fics and found these with no seeming links attached to the original comments, so I thought I'd ask if anyone knew what fics this person was referring to - I'm very curious. And yes, the three things are quoted directly from the comments.

#+begin_quote
  "A giant sea serpent. It was pretty much a leviathan. Harry (or was it fem! Harry? Idk) got sent back in time or something and islands in the Caribbean started worshipping him as a god."

  "There was this totally serious one where some character ended up being a giraffe. It wasn't Harry, but I thought it was funny."

  "My favorite one was probably one where Neville turns into an ent, and Hermione names him Groot."

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus. Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Severe Ron bashing ahead.

*** 'With the love of a good woman' is such an odd turn of phrase. I'm not sure what it is about that phrase, but something about it just makes me tilt my head and frown like a confused puppy. :D

Thanks for finding the fic, though! :)

  Harry Potter had always loved the water. This is a tale of what might happen, were Harry the heir to a legacy older than humanity and greater and more terrible than the very gods themselves. Rated for descriptions. AU.

** I don't have the link, but the forst one may be one called "a new monster"... A crossover with pirates of the Caribean.

It is entertaining, but kind of meh (specially the akward sex scenes)

*** Could be. Flicked through the chapter and it definitely matches the description, so thank you. :)

Not sure if the fem!Harry in it counts as a minor or not, so probably best not to link it.
