** Turns out Hogwarts only let's people start at age 11 and there's no formal magical training available.

You may be a mage, but you'll have to teach yourself. Also, wands and books don't come cheap and like all students, you're broke.

To make things worse, the wizarding world seems to have some sort of dark lord problem at the moment so evil wizard attack is a legitimate concern.

Do you buy some more spell components and practice magic in secret after your mundane classes? Finally drop out of your mundane degree and start learning magic full time? Accept that with great power comes great responsibility and live out your dreams of being a superhero?

Or just blow this weeks earnings from your part time job stacking shelves at the pub with your friends.

*** Option E: I learn just enough "accidental" magic to be the most valuable employee possible and pay off my college tuition without a hitch.

Forget all that evil wizard nonsense.

**** I mean, you're in England so the education is free, but ignoring wizard society in favor of hanging out in the muggle world and being the only one with cool powers seems like a good idea too.

A lot of interesting stories can come from complications stemming from that plan.

** I just finished a story where somehow Harry could not be tracked by the magical community after the Dursley moved so he grows up as a Muggle, and one day while going to work at 16/17, he his stopped by Hermione and Co. and they tell him that he is a wizard and in danger because death eaters are looking for him. Ensue an Harry on the run, learning magic and plotting to overthrow the government.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
