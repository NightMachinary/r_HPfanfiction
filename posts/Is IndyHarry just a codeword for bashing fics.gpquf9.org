I swear at this point it seems nearly all of these fics about Harry being "independent", as though he wasn't already pretty much on his own in every book, are really about bashing Dumbledore, Hermione, and/or the Weasleys at this point, requiring all these characters to act wildly OOC to justify them being controlling or manipulative.

The first story is technically about Petunia. She's a squb and instead of marrying Vernon she goes off to Cambridge I believe, and becomes an archaeologist. She supports Harry on her own and works with Bill Weasley. It's actually really good and there's an even better sequel with the Trio following in her footsteps.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

*** Agreed on the sentiment of Yes but No.

If an author wants Harry to be independent then Harry needs someone to be independent from and a reason to be independent.

In canon the only characters with authority over Harry that he really has reason to be independent from are the Dursleys, and in the end they are basically non entities beyond third year.

So authors give Dumbledore more authority over Harry, and more control, and then Harry needs a reason to buck that control and have reason to be independent, so they give him those reasons. Theres essentially no way to do that without exaggeration and conjecture and bashing. Hence, manipulative Dumbledore is controlling Harry's whole life and manipulating his relationships etc etc, so Harry "goes his own way"

England is one of many magical countries, and the world is watching. How will Harry manage in the context of rapidly escalating conflict? Lots of action and an early departure from canon.

** It's easy to write a character blaming someone else for their shitty situation. Strange how it always seems to be the Weasleys or Dumbledore that take the brunt of it, instead of Voldemort. Of coursing, some line has to be drawn between the author not liking characters and bashing them, and there being in-story reasons.

I will say, that at one point of time it felt like indy!Harry fics made up half the fandom, but you'd always been able to find ones that didn't have bashing. I've never liked bashing, but that was never the problem I had with indy!Harry fics, the problem being how they all felt the same, with Harry suddenly being made aware how much money had had, getting the Potter/Black manor, getting a new wand, learning the "truth" behind dark magic... it just grew old. And that was a decade ago.

It's not like indy!Harry fics set out to be bashing fics, but it really facilitates the plot if they are.

I've read some fics without bashing, but they're all fics where Harry is either superpowered and adult-like (so it makes sense for him to strike out on his own), or fics where Harry is only really independent from Dumbledore, who gets merely substituted by a mary sue OC/canon OC or some peggy sue character while Harry gets sidelined completely.

** Funnily enough, I think that the most bashed characters in Indy!Harry fics is Harry himself.

In pretty much every fic with this trope, Harry do the following things:

- Begins to work harder in school, and get amazing grades "because his parents were very talented after all"
- Discharge all his previous friends because "they betrayed him for reasons"
- Start to hang out either with Death Eater spawn or "the 3rd side" (usually composed of Slytherins who are also racists but since they are not actively for the genocide of mudbloods they are ok)
- Form a relation with a pureblood girl, sometimes in favor of Blood Purity (honestly, either the Super Model!Fleur or NotTooRacist!Daphne)
- Discover that Death Eaters just wanted to protect their culture because mudbloods like Hermione want to force their muggle views on them.

So, in the spawn of some weeks, we have a hero who begin to believe that talent comes (at least partially) from blood, that abandon all his mudblood or blood traitors friends in favor of Pure Bloods and that also start to share their views in the "protection of Magical Culture". So at this point, what's the difference between him and a Death Eater?

*** I don't doubt that there are some fics like that out there, and maybe they're not your jam. Death Eater Harry is an interesting take, but not really my jam either.

I do, however, understand trying to explore different angles in fic. If we held everything true to canon, what would be the point of even writing fic?

I can see the romanticism in "I'm only a teenager but I'm going to make my own way even if my situation isn't to my benefit". It's an alluring thought, isn't it? Going your own way, swimming upstream, doing what you want? Doesn't translate well to the real world, but then again, I don't think HP was ever meant to translate to the real world.

Your views on "the 3rd side" are interesting. Do you think there was no other way for the war to play out than how it did? For "good" to triumph over "evil" and call it a day?

Personally, I think people can grow and change, and presenting a third side to the war might have allowed that to happen for more of our beloved characters. Yeah, there would have been ideological disagreements between those transitioning from the two main factions, but I think everyone involved could learn from everyone else. There's also the "muggles have nukes, they could blast us off the face of the planet" and the "we all know how very well the witch trials went last time /s" angles to explore.

It's interesting that there might have been some elements of magical culture that were dying off or being altered due to an increase of muggle cultural influence. It's just sort of what happens when any culture begins trade with others. Lines blur and elements are borrowed from one to another. For instance, seeing JK's "stereotypical purebloods" writing their homework with biros would rock my world.

Muggleborns would also take some elements of wizarding culture back to their muggle families, which would inevitably leak out into the rest of the world. JK missed an excellent opportunity to show how the two cultures (magical and muggle) might blend and affect one another, and instead kept them impossibly insular. Of course, HP was supposed to be a kid's series, so maybe she just didn't consider it worth including. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

** In my opinion, Harry in HBP and DH is pretty independent. Dumbledore only gives him the relevant information to defeat Voldemort. Whether Harry chooses to kill, what magic he uses to fight, it was never influenced by Dumbledore. He makes decisions on his own, while taking advise from more intelligent, experienced people.

The idea that Indy!Harry as written in 'bashing' fics actually stands a chance of winning is very stupid. One person, no matter how 'strong', cannot fight on multiple fronts simultaneously.

At best, these fics replace the Weasleys, Dumbledore and rarely, Hermione, with goblins, or over-helpful Slytherin Princesses, or 'modern' muggles which arrogant wizards overlook.

This establishes, or seeks to establish, a dynamic which basically demeans Rowling's world.

No, kids can't take over a political body after a summer of coaching, nor can they take on experienced, battle-hardened fighters after an year of fighting against wooden constructs in the Room of Requirement.

No, goblins are not helpful. They are greedy, conniving, selfish and have a very different worldview when compared to humans. They don't give a shit if you remember their name.

Powerful!Harry fics which show him working with friends/allies are frankly more interesting than a Harry who operates alone and does everything himself. He needs people to help him in areas which are not his speciality, he needs advise when he is throwing himself into a new, shitty situation. There's nothing wrong with it.

They couldn't stand up to Death Eaters directly. They ran around a lot, they got lucky potshots in, but a majority of the Death Eaters were taken down by the Order and Dumbledore. Only Rabastan Lestrange was stunned, one other got his head stuck in a time loop and Dolohov's partner got caught in a Body-bind.

This is true for the first two and a part of the third book, where conveniences and plot holes are more visible than the rest of the series. We actually don't see a lot of the background work which the Order does. The Ministry is obviously corrupt, sure, but the Order probably did a lot of useful stuff. Death Eaters seem to be wary of atleast a few of their members, Remus said that they did kill their enemies at times, and even after the Ministry was taken over in DH, the resistance didn't immediately crumble.

The fact that /experienced, battle-hardened fighters/ weren't able to neutralize children is quite concerning. That Harry survives that could make sense in a way for the others however... Death Eaters and Riddle are cartoonish anyway.

#+begin_quote
  This is true for the first two and a part of the third book, where conveniences and plot holes are more visible than the rest of the series. We actually don't see a lot of the background work which the Order does. The Ministry is obviously corrupt, sure, but the Order probably did a lot of useful stuff. Death Eaters seem to be wary of atleast a few of their members, Remus said that they did kill their enemies at times, and even after the Ministry was taken over in DH, the resistance didn't immediately crumble.
#+end_quote

Usually, one of Rowling greatest weaknesses is that she tells and not show. With the Order, she didn't even bother to tell much. You would actually think she would use the Order but she doesn't all. Guarding the prophecy as they did it in HP is totally stupid when she could have used the Order to help retrieve it and destroy it before Riddle heard it and so making them look a little competent. She could have shown them smuggling Muggleborn out of the country but nothing at all. Rowling has ideas but she doesn't know how to use them.

  I know I can't change your mind, but I can tell you this - It is easy to mess about with what's already written and established and add a few elements on your own, than to build a whole fictional universe from the scratch and actually make it work.
#+end_quote

I agree with you that it's easier for fanfic authors. However, that doesn't change the fact Rowling wasn't able to do it, and unfortunately for her many published authors were able to do it. She didn't even put much work in it since she basically took our world and added /magic/ after anything. The Department of Mystery was a good idea that she forgot at the end of the book... But I understand what you're saying and you're right.

** Yes basically. I've seen a few where he is independent and not a total dick to everyone he meets but normally it just serves as a median through which they bash Dumbledore for being a control freak who's plan was to kill Voldi after harry dies, Ron trying to mooch off of harry's glory, Molly and Ginny trying to set Ginny up with Harry through either love potions or force of will to steal all his money, the Order for being pussies, Percy for existing, occasionally Lupin for being on Dumbledores side.

It can get really tedious.

** Yes, sadly, although I've seen a few that were enjoyable regardless. Bashing in the HP fandom tends to be a bit... extreme. Instead of just making the characters Harry's enemies, they turn them into absolute /morons/. Regardless of plot, I would read the hell out of a well-written fic Independant Harry fic where Dumbledore truly is the master manipulator they show him as. Not the frothing angry typical Manipulative!Dumbledore, but one that actually /acts/ like a master manipulator.

Like my main gripe with the independant!Harry fics is that whenever Dumbledore tries something, he approaches it in the dumbest way possible, while mumbling "i'm evil" under his breath, and is shocked when it inevitably fails because Harry has six top lawyers, the entire somehow-alive Black family, Amelia Bones as his godmother/aunt-in-law/wife and the entire Goblin Nation at his call. Give me a fic where Harry still wins, but Dumbledore actually gets some shit done.

** In theory, no. It's absolutely possible to write "Harry takes a leadership role" without bashing anyone.\\
Put Dumbledore in the role of an advisor and a source of information on Riddle's early life, and you're pretty much there - it's usually Dumbledore who gets the brunt of the bashing, everyone else gets hit by proximity.

In practice, it sure as heck seems like Indy!Harry=Bashing - and not just that, but it's usually all the worst bash-tropes rolled into a single keyword.

** It isn't necessarily about bashing, only about seeing him go out on his own, the premise has some potential, but it is left mostly unexplored when it's pushed to the side by adding ‘Lord Potter' bullshit, ‘Bashing N characters', ‘genius/super' Harry... It is petty rare to see a fic that is only indy!Harry or that can make good use of a mix.

And yeah, even though all the books including CC try to sell the idea of friendship and union being the key to success in practice it really is not what we see (Dumbledore, Grindewald, Voldemort, Harry, Hermione, even Neville-generally when they do something big it is either them doing it alone or having others following their lead) many people don't like that Harry is following someone else's lead for so much of cannon even though as a standard 11-17 years-old he has no realistic way (or motivation) to go out fight the war on his own. It is actually something derived of him being the protagonist and so much of the significant things that happens to him being done more to move the plot along rather than developing his plot-line.

Don't remember many good ones that happens during cannon time or the war in general (although there is a time travel in which he goes back with Teddy and Andromeda while in his older body that is good), the ones that happen post-cannon tend (relatively speaking) to be better, ‘the archeologist' and the Xover with SPN ‘supernormal' being prime examples of this.

We all saw what happened when he used sectumsempra spell on Malfoy without testing. What if Snape forgot to write 'for enemies' or decided to trick anyone who stole his book and writes 'to heal dark curses' instead?

And regarding Draco she doesn't believed in Malfoy. She believed in Dumbledore and thought Voldemort had no use with a kid. It's not like Harry is a great judge of character or anything.

And worse in indy!Harry fics he gets friends with Malfoy and/or other pureblood fanatics from Slytherin with whom he never had a single conversation.

Yes Harry saved Hermione in first year and she paid him back with her loyalty. She had bo reason to save Sirius using Time turner or go to DoM. Without her I don't think he would've survived the tournament. We saw no one helped him during the tournament except Hermione.

She sets Snapes robes on fire, goes against McGonagall orders in first year, drugged and impersonated another person, set a trap for Umbridge with Centaurs, destroyed public property(ministry), broke in to a bank, obliviated her parents and imprisoned a human in a jar and blackmailed her.

** I've commented on this matter in a Dumbledore Bashing Post asking the same question specifically for Dumbledore. So that part will be slightly shorter.

I can only read Dumbledore as insanely incompetent or extremely manipulative. As I chose to believe the latter (also worth noting it's the reason I like Dumbledore), he's not wildly OOC.

Moving on to the rest. I haven't actually seen all that much Hermione bashing (of course with the exception of betrayed Harry fics but I classify those differently from independent Harry) so I can't really talk about that much. The only thing I recall is too trusting to authority but that's not really OOC imo. I also see Hermione bashing as much as Hermione still being with Harry so idk.

Weasleys I do have an answer for. They are simply so close to Dumbledore it can ricochet towards bashing the family. However, I think we can go into more specific reasons for each. First, the twins. They are rarely if ever bashed, to the extent I've read Weasley bashing books that left them out. Next in the seldom bashed is Bill, and Charlie. They're never really present so it's easy to leave them off. They're normally caught in the crossfire of being a Weasley. I notice Arthur bashing the next least (guess we're going least to most). I honestly think it's because Molly is just more of a presence. Arthur seems to just be Molly's support and/or oblivious to reality, he's never really bashed as much as the others (who get really bashed). Next Percy, low hanging fruit. Nobody really likes Percy and given his canon actions isn't not difficult to hate on him. I'm putting Ginny next. This is typically bashing Ginny as some sort of stalker or obsessive fan girl. While Arthur can be argued to be a little OOC, this is the first big one. You'll notice Ron hasn't been mentioned, an I believe him second most. This is mainly because he's the most common Weasley. Now for bashing reasons, he's stated and depicted as a foul-weather friend. So him not having the best relationship with Harry once things start going good for him isn't all that OOC. He's also depicted as jealous and rather petty (GoF). Finally we have molly. Molly gets the short end of a similar stick to Dumbledore. Molly treats Harry as one of her own, if Harry has a fallout with Ron she may be bold enough to try to reprimand him, but she's the real ricochet target for being too close to Dumbledore as many fanfics depict her as the one that's really involved with the Order and as an overbearing mother type. Something that doesn't really work with independent Harry.

Weasley summary. I don't think many of them are OOC but it does certainly show the flaws of each character more. Molly suffers from the same incompatibility with this type of Harry as Dumbledore does.

So is it possible to find a book without it. Of course, most untrusting Harry books I find tend to avoid bashing to any major extent, but especially if it takes place in later years it can be difficult for an author to avoid. Sidenote: it does also matter where you draw the line for bashing. I've seen fics marked as bashing that is literally just Harry having a distaste for a character and a full on feud against the Weasleys have no bashing marks whatsoever.
