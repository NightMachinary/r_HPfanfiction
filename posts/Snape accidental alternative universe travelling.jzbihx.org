:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Severitus fic where Harry dies of an illness. Snape tries very hard to find a cure and I think Harry leaves Snape a letter.

Snape has visions of canon Him treating Harry the way he does before he ends up in canon universe


** It's this one! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24726043/chapters/59769655]]

** That sounds super interesting! I'm glad you asked that question so I could read the story (thanks to [[/u/heresy23][u/heresy23]] who already found it).

If you liked that one, you may also like [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3415][If Only by Jadzia Love]]. After Snape's canon death, he is shown what would have happened if he'd acted differently in various scenarios. It was written for one of the Snarry Games, so if that pairing is anathema to you then give it a miss.
