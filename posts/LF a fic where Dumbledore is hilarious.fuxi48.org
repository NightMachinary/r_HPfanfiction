It can be any fic, serious, drama, crack, whatever.

I remember one specifically where they are doing the Christmas snowball fight and Percy gets Dumbledore, which makes him join the fight.

Dumbledore at one point says whowever hits him gets 10 points for his house, which prompts Hermione to say, "But we are all Gryffindors!". Dumbledore just replies, "Exactly!".


** He's hilarious in canon. However, all his jokes are from Edwardian-era music hall and fall horribly flat or make him sound quite mad to modern ears. The "I should just like to say a few words" was an absolute /standard/ for music-hall comperes, and at least once he does the bit about setting up for a quite obviously filthy joke and then not telling it, which Little Tich absolutely /slew/ with back in 1910.

*** Since I have been asked: I don't have references or sources, sorry to say, just a now-deceased great-grand uncle who was a /massive/ music-hall aficionado with a collection of recordings (some of the exceedingly famous Little Tich, and there's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtkzdhFv1Kg][one on youtube]]) and it's a particular style of humour that survives in faint echoes in what nowadays are called 'dad jokes'. One suspects that JKR had an elderly relative or acquaintance like my great-granduncle who she drew on for Dumbledore's dialogue.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

#+begin_quote
  Now he was stuck in his office filling out forms instead of being able to move around the castle at his leisure. He really missed acting mysterious in front of students for his own amusement. There were few things more amusing than silently appearing behind a student who was clearly in the middle of breaking the rules, then offering them some meaningless and often baffling platitudes while his eyes sparkled, then vanishing. It was Dumbledore's biggest guilty pleasure, and therefore he could never, ever let Minerva find out about it.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

Not centered on Dumbledore, but he's definitely hilarious and shows up at least once or twice per chapter.

Basically, everybody else is normal but the Weasleys, who turn magical Britian on it's head. So while everyone else is having a conniption a day with a side of just being done with everything (and an extra side of heavy drinking for the one's who are especially done with everything) Dumbledore seems to be having a fun time.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** In Harry and the Shipgirls, Dumbledore has quite a few moments, including fleeing from an enraged Shipgirl on a magical Segway (which can go up/down walls etc) and teaming up with said Shipgirl to troll another one by dressing entirely in gold (gold jacket, gold shirt, gold slatted shades, gold threads woven into beard) and driving a gold Pimpmobile while playing a rap song about money.

The one moment that got McGonogall the most, though, was when Harry was caught in a prank which resulted in him having to cross-dress for a week. Dumbledore recognized Harry(et) instantly and didn't react in the slightest, much to McGonogall's shock and annoyance.

As it went on, he started turning it into a story rather than an essay-in-story-form. It's curious that you say the tropes of OP Harry and Lord Potter were played straight, since they most definitely weren't. Harry has no real inherited titles, no collection of wands and artifacts, only a flat number of galleons, all of which he immediately loses at the first opportunity. It's not critiquing canon much at all at the latter half, but I suppose it is easy to see a pattern where one no longer exists.

******** No, this is literally how HPMOR works. It starts off being funny because it's about a rational character in an irrational world. That's the /whole/ point. But the plot isn't exactly about rational!Harry versus Quirrelmort or, if you prefer, rational!Riddle. It's this sprawling mess of standard fanficy ideas like crazy wards, Lord Potter style political machinations (isn't there a life debt that Hermione ends up owing the Malfoys and Harry buys them out which is why he has no money? there's something crazy like that there) combined with a very earnest "everyone should live forever" message which is /really/ weird in the context of a canon series where that trait defines the bad guy. And it's why the fic evolves from, in some sense, poking fun at canon into an outright critique of it. In short, it becomes something very, very different from what the reader started out reading. That's the author's prerogative, but if you're actually sitting there thinking the humour doesn't come from the didactic take I really don't know if we were reading the same thing.

That second paragraph means you're not paying attention to what defines Lord Potter Black shenanigans and instead fixating on one particular interpretation of it (crazy rich Harry). HPMOR is hardly the only fic to give blood status or familial membership actual political importance but it's really strange in the context of a fic that started off as a "what if X" crack fic because it's a massive divergence that has nothing to do with "Aunt Petunia married a scientist".

Rational!Harry's actions can lead to absurd outcomes and that doesn't go away (e.g. all that stuff with the Weasley twins, Blaise and the man in the hat or whatever his identity was) but it's subsumed in service of "immortality is good" rather than "this world is irrational, what happens if someone rational joins it?"

It could, btw, have stayed as its premise. Voldemort is notoriously irrational. Look at Seventh Horcrux which flanderises those aspects of Voldemort. Hell, even canon Harry points out how dumb it is to make the horcruxes meaningful objects. Only downside of doing things this way is no Quidditch replacement. Although, I guess, an irrational Quidditch hating Voldemort that really likes teaching might be contrived into coming up with that too (but for different reasons to Quirrelmort).

I expected more experimentation with how spells worked, and more scenes like the one where he made his own potion, not just munchkinning the mechanics of existing items, but for me the sheer quality of the story offsets that quibble.

I don't understand your objection to the scene where he sacrifices his fortune. That's completely antithetical to the whole idea central to most Lord Potter fics. You try to give some explanation of why it still counts, but it makes no sense. Mind clarifying?

That Harry gives up his fortune isn't even weird in the context of wider sense of what people do with aristocrats. Throwing away/sacrificing wealth or titles in the name of nobility (or, at least, ignoring them) is practically a cliche. If all you expect in a Lord Potter fic is Harry to be fabulously wealthy and calling himself Lord Potter, you're using my term to describe something other than what I'm describing. If you want to call what I'm talking about something else, fine. But it should be obvious that the phenomenon I'm talking about isn't the one you are... the onus is on you to say what you think I should refer to this by in order that you and I can be on the same page.

The anti-death message. Jesus, dude. Understand the criticism. The problem is not the message. The problem is that it's a total rejection of the stance taken by canon.

Also, it's not a genetic fallacy. For one thing, we're talking about contrived literature where the authors are in total control of /why/ things are the way they are. In your example, it would be as if Stalin was the /only/ person who needs to eat and no-one else does. Obviously, in the real world, everyone needs to eat if they want to live. In contrast, Voldemort only wants immortality because he was designed that way... everyone else is pro-mortality (again, by design). The main thing, though, is that this misses the point. The criticism is saying "the fic evolved from being a rational person in an irrational world into its own story using ideas that have no place in the irrational world we were initially promised". That the story is anti-death is just one more example of that, alongside OP!Harry, Lord Potter, super!wards and anything else I might have mentioned. The message isn't being brought up in the context of "living forever is bad because a bad guy wanted it". The message is "the main theme of HPMOR is one of several fundamental aspects of what it became that don't follow from its original premise". It's also, "the main theme is one more reason why it started off funny but became serious" (which is where we started).

The "weird fixation" is more repeatedly having to try and explain why this came up to /you/.

To say otherwise misunderstands what those kinds of stories are all about, and HPMOR's central theme is a bunch of (perhaps justified, that's up to you) wankery around a set of ideas, not a single person. At every opportunity the author sets up scenarios such that the main character is successful by virtue of those ideas. You're correct in that Lord Potter fics usually have Harry /using/ his wealth, but they never have him blow his load in one go in a situation where it turned out the best outcome would have been to simply do nothing.

The anti-death message is a refutation of the canon one, yes. It's fanfic, what's your point? If you're going to insist that fanfic should adhere to the themes presented in canon, I'm going to start laughing and not stop until I pass out.

I don't care.

The only thing that matters is whether or not you think HPMOR works like that (it does) and if you think Lord Potter is an accurate description of what happens in it. If you think a different term describes it better, as I said, provide an alternative term.

Most Lord Potter fics are what I'm going to call power wank fics. HPMOR has aspects of that but for different reasons. I maintain that what matters to these fics is that Lord Potter, familial political machinations, House Potter etc. etc. exist. How they are specifically used is unimportant. Especially when the point is that they've got nothing to do with "Harry's raised by a scientist". Maybe you can argue that HPMOR is trying to take pot shots at the typical Lord Potter fic (hence blowing his fortune when she should do nothing), but it started off as a satirical or parodical take on canon (not other fanfic tropes).

#+begin_quote
  from any sort of rational stance, death is bad.
#+end_quote

Not even remotely true. The opposite is more true, but that's got nothing to do with anything. Consider, for example, euthanasia. No, not good enough for you? How about this... the number of living persons is vastly outweighed by the number of dead people. Let's say that they all live and never die. Okay, cool. At which point are the youngest people able to pursue the lives they wish? There's no space. There's no food. And no-one can die. And that's assuming we're talking about eternal youth /as well as/ eternal life. Not the same thing. Oh, and if we're just talking about a select few individuals who can live forever? Now... let's see, there's a reason "who wants to live forever" is not just a song but also a cliche.

Dying before you're ready is, from a rational point of view, bad. That's not even in the same universe as "dying is bad" though, and even then it's got all sorts of caveats.

The problem, therefore, is that no rational character should desire immortality... it's an irrational goal... and this is then compounded by the specific way this is done. We're talking about a fic that started off trying to live within the bounds of canon and poke holes in it. This then evolved into something completely different whilst preserving the advertising that it was "rational".

Fanfics can be AUs. Fanfics can have completely different themes. They can do/be both of those things. Hell, I like muggle AUs. Hard to get further from canon. What they shouldn't do, and what HPMOR does do, is start off as a "what if..." AU satire (perhaps just plain parody) and then become an earnest advocate which has nothing to do with its original "what if" premise. It is, at a minimum, two completely different concepts in a single narrative. It gives it a very clear character of "started funny, didn't end remotely funny". Which is all I've ever been saying.

Rational fics have a long and terrible history of having rational characters not do rational things. There's a Sherlock Holmes story, for example, where Holmes' argument for what is logical and therefore must be what they should do is a classic game form in game theory. Holmes' conclusion is wrong. Don't make defending the rationality of HPMOR's rationality a hill to die on. It's got nothing to do with what I started off saying and what you somehow took issue with (i.e. that it was funny and became not funny).

#+begin_quote
  Well. That says everything about you that I need to know.
#+end_quote

You have spent this entire conversation not bothering to ask the fundamental question... "why write *this"? You have been told, and I do mean told, that what's important is whether or not you recognise the phenomenon I am describing. The actual term is not salient. Your response to this is to explain not what you'd call what I described but, instead, to describe what you understand by Lord Potter.

There's a phrase for this: "not even wrong". You're nominally carrying on a conversation and trying to demonstrate a point but even what you ought to do is pointed out to you... you don't. That's why I don't care.

#+begin_quote
  And yet your response is that you don't care.
#+end_quote

No, my response to it is this:

#+begin_quote
  you're using my term to describe something other than what I'm describing. If you want to call what I'm talking about something else, fine. But it should be obvious that the phenomenon I'm talking about isn't the one you are
#+end_quote

It's probably not surprising you didn't understand this given you didn't understand this as a critique of HPMOR either. That is, it's set up as a critique (of sorts) of canon, but it later deviates from canon in a way that means its (later) critiques don't hold.

On the other hand, it's there in black and white with no room for misinterpretation.

#+begin_quote
  Any conceivable form of immortality would allow the prevention of that suffering without death.
#+end_quote

Are you insane?

Let's suppose you're an immortal being suffering from locked in syndrome. Well, that sounds /awesome/. Let's suppose you're an immortal being who lives in constant pain. Well, now, that's just brilliant.

Euthanasia literally means "good death".

#+begin_quote
  Overpopulation Is A Capitalist Lie. W
#+end_quote

No. Economists do not care about overpopulation. I don't know why they'd/you'd think capitalists think it's a lie, but there you go.

Of course, it's got nothing to do with what we're talking about, either. What we're talking about is a system in which people don't die so there are orders of magnitude more people around. What we're talking about is the physical space that's required... and when would we have hit this, incidentally? I mean, maybe we could travel into space if we were immortal, but we can't IRL.

I'm sure we can contrive as many rules as we want to demonstrate why immortality /could/ work, but at that point we're not talking about humanity any more.

Incidentally, I don't know why you keep trying to throw in these ideas which aren't relevant. We're not talking about the world as we understand it. Unless your stupidly titled and stupidly long video is, despite its title, also talking about a world where everyone is immortal its logic cannot be relevant to our situation. Now, that's not to say the conclusion is wrong... it's to say that the conclusion can only be right by coincidence. After all, I can consult a stopped clock and obtain the right time of day. But just as how anyone trying to get me to use a stopped clock to tell the time is making an error, it is a mistake to use logic which /by definition/ cannot apply to try and dispute this case.

#+begin_quote
  the reason is that it feels clever to say something so supposedly counterintuitive
#+end_quote

No, the reason is because everyone you know and care about dies. Repeatedly. It's not counter-intuitive at all.

Of course, if you don't care about any of the "normal" things people care about then it really is counter-intuitive.

#+begin_quote
  If you go up to a spacefaring civilization where everyone is immortal and tell them all about the great benefits of non existence,
#+end_quote

I'm not sure you'll understand this but, by all means, talk to the author of HPMOR because I'm pretty sure he does understand this and maybe he'll explain.

There's an argument that the probability of life in the universe we exist in is 1. This does not mean the probability of life existing is 1.

Once you condition on a set of parameters (e.g. a spacefaring civilisation) you fundamentally alter the nature of your conclusions in a way that cannot logically be extended to the unconditional case.

It's all terribly ironic when you remember that HPMOR's definition of rational is (allegedly) about Bayesian Updating. That's /all/ about conditional logic/probability.

#+begin_quote
  It's actually held up a primary example of a title that is completely irrational.
#+end_quote

Since you weren't paying attention I'll direct you back to what I said:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fics have a long and terrible history of having rational characters not do rational things.
#+end_quote

In other words, you are literally trying to take what I'm saying and criticise me with it. That Sherlock Holmes isn't particularly rational is my point and their point. My point is that authors try and fail.

Now, this may be a sensible thing to do, but given you've spent this entire conversation misunderstanding what I'm saying/trying to do, I'm going to go ahead and say you haven't actually grasped some deeper truth that I've missed and, instead, have once again failed to understand.

I guess you could be trying to say "actually Sherlock Holmes isn't even trying to be rational" but you didn't write that, did you? (To be clear, you did not.)

Did you just not read? You even quoted it: "Any conceivable form of immortality would allow the prevention of that suffering without death." I'm guilty of, apparently, misunderstanding some of what you've said, so here to reword, any realistic path to immortality would forbid anything such as locked in syndrome from existing. Either from bio engineering or directly messing with the neurons of your brain.

Again, check out the link, or even do an iota of research. To give you a hint of how wrong your assumptions are: "Standing shoulder-to-shoulder, the entire world's population could fit within the 500 square miles (1,300 square kilometers) of Los Angeles." Overpopulation is a problem that is easily solved even without space travel.

#+begin_quote
  It's not counter-intuitive at all.
#+end_quote

Uh, yes it is. Go up to someone. Ask the question: "Is death good?" Not "is death necessary," not "does death give us some meaning," just, is it good. Do that for a hundred people to get a good sample size, and tell me what you find. (Hint: the answer most people will give is 'no'.)

#+begin_quote
  There's a stereotype of Deep Wisdom. Death: complete the pattern: "Death gives meaning to life." Everyone knows this standard Deeply Wise response. And so it takes on some of the characteristics of an applause light. If you say it, people may nod along, because the brain completes the pattern and they know they're supposed to nod. They may even say "What deep wisdom!", perhaps in the hope of being thought deep themselves. But they will not be surprised; they will not have heard anything outside the box; they will not have heard anything they could not have thought of for themselves. One might call it belief in wisdom---the thought is labeled "deeply wise", and it's the completed standard pattern for "deep wisdom", but it carries no experience of insight.

  People who try to seem Deeply Wise often end up seeming hollow, echoing as it were, because they're trying to seem Deeply Wise instead of optimizing.

  ...

  And I already held to the developed philosophy of transhumanism. Transhumanism also has cached thoughts about death. Death: complete the pattern: "Death is a pointless tragedy which people rationalize."

  "Death hurt us, so we will unmake Death. Let that be the outlet for our anger, which is terrible and just. I watched Yehuda's coffin lowered into the ground and cried, and then I sat through the eulogy and heard rabbis tell comforting lies. If I had spoken Yehuda's eulogy I would not have comforted the mourners in their loss. I would have told the mourners that Yehuda had been absolutely annihilated, that there was nothing left of him. I would have told them they were right to be angry, that they had been robbed, that something precious and irreplaceable was taken from them, for no reason at all, taken from them and shattered, and they are never getting it back.

  No sentient being deserves such a thing. Let that be my brother's true eulogy, free of comforting lies.

  When Michael Wilson heard the news, he said: "We shall have to work faster." Any similar condolences are welcome. Other condolences are not.

Now the rest of what you say is just nonsense, really. It's just a bunch of rambling with vague accusations that have nothing to do with the conversation. Feel free to reorganize your thoughts so they are more comprehensible.

To me that is perfectly clear. If it wasn't, I would've written something else.

You should.

Arguments have an objective existence. Every claim you make has some sort of burden that must be supported for your claim (argument) to be true. It's not, as some people imagine, a subjective thing. To say Y, really does mean you /ought/ to do X.

#+end_quote

Firstly, what the author intends and what the author did is not relevant. You've just been saying this yourself (see: your language is meandering and hard to comprehend). Secondly, what I said is critique (of sorts). That's important. I was getting really fucking tired of having to write out

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

because it's a real mouthful. /This/ is why my language is "meandering". It's because, it seems, most people don't pay attention to specifically what is said. The smallest little slip is used as a 100% proof. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH7ktvUWaYo][No Holes, No Holocaust,]] if you will.

In other words, that I've spent all this time being really fucking careful should allow me to say something like "critique (of sorts)" without this bullshit. But it doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  Did you just not read?
#+end_quote

Clearly you didn't. Remember when I wrote:

#+begin_quote
  I'm sure we can contrive as many rules as we want to demonstrate why immortality could work, but at that point we're not talking about humanity any more.
#+end_quote

Yes, it's theoretically replying to a different part of your post but your statement is a complete fucking nonsense. You have just read a conceivable version of immortality where that's not the case. In fact, spoiler, the locked in syndrome is from a TV show called Forever and the latter case is from Greek Mythology (Chiron but Prometheus works too).

You're not talking about immortality. You are talking about perfect health forever. They're not the same thing /at all/.

#+begin_quote
  "Standing shoulder-to-shoulder, the entire world's population could fit within the 500 square miles (1,300 square kilometers) of Los Angeles."
#+end_quote

Yes, because a rational person should be happy with this.

Of course, it's now perfectly clear that you're not bothering with clothing, food or waste in your definition of immortality but there you go.

Economists do not care about overpopulation. They/we care about something called the fiscal cliff. Or, in lay speak, economists fret about /underpopulation./

#+begin_quote
  You don't have to watch that video specifically, just take five minutes to look up the general idea of what you're talking about.

And what are we talking about? Is that video actually about a world with your bullshit version of immortality? Yes or no? Because its title suggests it isn't but you need it to be discussing the consequences of your bullshit version of immortality.

#+end_quote

Holy fucking shit. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ttvnPRTxFyru9Hh2H/against-nhst][Read this.]] Pay attention to who wrote that.

The question can only be framed as "is living forever good?"

#+begin_quote
  Now the rest of what you say is just nonsense, really.
#+end_quote

Considering that your massive paragraphs have nothing to do with conditional reasoning, I'm going to go ahead and say you don't understand what you're critiquing.

The point, because you missed it, is that asking a spacefaring civilisation that is immortal about whether or not death is a good thing, cannot give us a valid answer about whether or not a non-immortal and non-space faring civilisation ought to think about death. This is no more likely to happen than we can find a dog with spots in the set of all dogs without spots.

Which I already pointed out explicitly before so at this point I'm washing my hands of you.

  why you find it unclear.
#+end_quote

You seem to have several points, and repeatedly tell me off for missing them. That's rather hard to do when you don't make them clear. And ironically, you're not being clear with your request right here. I have no idea how to answer a /why/ statement about the subject.

#+begin_quote
  To me that is perfectly clear.
#+end_quote

Right, yes, because you're the person who typed it. However, not all of us share your brain and its associated thought processes.

#+begin_quote
  Every claim you make has some sort of burden that must be supported
#+end_quote

Every /positive/ claim, yes. So point out, in quotes, which positive claims I'm making that I haven't supported.

#+begin_quote
  what the author intends and what the author did is not relevant.
#+end_quote

Sure, but you're ranting on about how the fic did it a few times, so the fact that it strays from that is a bad thing, somehow. I ... /disagree/. Something being a critique doesn't make it automatically worthy of consideration, or able to be dismissed for that matter. Unless it's a positive claim with no evidence behind it, of course.

#+begin_quote
  it started off as a satirical or parodical take on canon
#+end_quote

The problem with all this is, of course, that this statement is false. The fic made a few jibes at canon, and you can subjectively consider it a parody of canon, but looking at the purpose of the fic, and the occurrences of canon-sniping versus rationalist-wanking, the latter /by far/ outweighs the former.

#+begin_quote
  You have just read a conceivable version of immortality where that's not the case.
#+end_quote

And then you immediately generate a case from fiction. It's an interesting fact that when we were talking about what's conceivable or realistic, we were talking about the real world. Maybe we were talking past each other, but it sure seemed like you grokked that we were discussing real-world possibilities there.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because a rational person should be happy with this.
#+end_quote

You're ignoring all the times I stated that this is a /problem to be solved/. One solution could be to go further on the path of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface][brain-computer interfaces]] and require that everyone live in a virtual world. That solution isn't perfect, of course, but it's one I thought of in three seconds so the idea that /solutions exist/ should be there.

#+begin_quote
  Economists do not care about overpopulation.
#+end_quote

The problem with blanket statements like this is that if I find a single fact that disproves this then your entire line of argument falls apart. And ... would you look at that?

#+begin_quote
  Thomas Robert Malthus was a famous 18th-century British economist known for the population growth philosophies outlined in his 1798 book "An Essay on the Principle of Population." In it, Malthus theorized that populations would continue expanding until growth is stopped or reversed by disease, famine, war, or calamity. He is also known for developing an exponential formula used to forecast population growth, which is currently known as the Malthusian growth model.

  This theory was criticized by economists and ultimately disproved. Even as the human population continues to increase, technological developments and migration have ensured that the percentage of people living below the poverty line continues to decline. In addition, global interconnectedness stimulates the flow of aid from food-rich nations to developing regions.

  Because its title suggests it isn't but you need it to be discussing the consequences of your bullshit version of immortality.
#+end_quote

Okay, so you don't understand what realistic paths to immortality look like, and you don't understand that modern economists have settled on saying that overpopulation /isn't a valid problem/. I'll just wait for you to look up the salient facts before continuing this line of discussion.

#+begin_quote
  Holy fucking shit. Read this.
#+end_quote

What do you know---I have. A simple, non-scientifically-rigorous experiment is meant to draw out the absurdity of your statement. Instead of nitpicking, how about you actually attack the point at hand?

#+begin_quote
  The question can only be framed as "is living forever good?"
#+end_quote

There we go. Now, this is obviously wrong, of course, because people often conflate 'living forever' with 'a tortuous form of immortality you can't end' like you did. This is, of course, absurd.

#+begin_quote
  cannot give us a valid answer about whether or not a non-immortal and non-space faring civilisation ought to think about death. This is no more likely to happen than we can find a dog with spots in the set of all dogs without spots.
#+end_quote

Ignoring for a moment that you're attempting to compare important factors to sapient civilizations with spots on dogs, a more advanced civilization actually would be able to tell us something useful about the issue, so long as they have at least somewhat similar moral frameworks, since we'd be able to use them as a point of comparison if nothing else.

Your holier-than-thou arguments really lack substance. To sum up, you've done some minor nitpicking, lying (or just professing of ignorance, if we're being charitable), and come up with a series of nonsensical comparisons and non-sequiturs. If you don't want to actually engage with the argument at hand then that is fine, but don't pretend you understand what you're talking about.

  There's no space
#+end_quote

Nonsense. First up, if everyone has an average of 1 child per couple, then an immortal society caps out at 2x the population size., without any hard restrictions on anyone having children. In fact, anything under an average of 2 children per couple has a finite size, and even with current mortality rates anything over a childbirth rate of 2.1 will have an infinite population growth.

Second up, for physical space everyone is packed into cities, physical space is not remotely a constraint unless we get to trillions of people; the problem is far-and-away /resource use/.

For resource use our main problem is we're massively wasteful, not a fundamental limit. There are tons of methods that would each get us a 2x limit fairly easily, like improving hydroponics (literally 1-10% of farmland space and freshwater consumption, main constraint is electricity). It's not /easy/, but it's mainly a sociopolitical problem and in a counterfactual world where we stumbled upon a method of immortality, resource constraints/"there's no room" would /not/ justify a mandatory execution of old people upon reaching age 120.

#+begin_quote
  Euthenasia is good

No, it's just the lesser of two evils for people who are suffering incurable unbearable pain, and are extremely likely to die after a couple of weeks anyway. Euthenasia is a /stopgap/.

#+begin_quote
  What if you're stuck in an "I have no mouth but I must scream" situation
#+end_quote

The problem in those situations isn't the lack of options for death, but rather the lack of /any options to make the pain stop/. In those situations, people are choosing death as a means to make the pain stop, not as a fundamental desire to die.

If you're advocating that death should always be an /option/, that's - debatably - fair. If you're advocating other people's death be mandatory regardless of whether they want to die or not, then you are literally a pro-murder advocate.

Most old people don't want to die in my experience, they're just aware they have no other option currently.
