I find it hard to write action squences/duels and battles in fics when i dabbled in it myself. So just wondering what people look for in duel or action set peice in a fic? Also do you have any fav paragrahs of action or an entire action/battle based chapter or fic in general?


** Here are a few advices I have collated from my searches and little experiments on the subject:

​

* Where: Set the scene of the fight by pointing out RELEVANT information. We don't need to know every little variation of elevation or texture, nor a detailed description of every small obstacle on the battlefield, but we need to know what's there. Especially things that will be integral to the progress of the fight. Ex: The fountain in the Dumbledore/Voldemort fight of OotP is setup well in advance (chekhov's gun) and its nature and location is well described before the fight. We also have a general idea of the atrium's geography, Harry/Dumble arriving from the elevators, Bella/Voldy on the opposite side of the fountain, the floos on another side, etc. (it can be useful to draw a little map when creating a fight)

​

* Who/Why: Before your characters start beating at each other in a glorious ode to violence paid in blood, sweat and tears, you need to make sure that the reasons and stakes of the fight are clear and well understood by the reader. It doesn't mean that you have to explicit it bluntly by way of exposition dialogue ("Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."), but at minimum we need to understand who is fighting, why and what would happen if one won over the other (these can be fairly implicit and logical in the flow of the plot). Sometimes these can be fairly straightforward (Ron Weasley/ Drunken excess of testosterone/ Nothing really)

​

* Choreography: The sequence of events (again, in a complex environment, it's a good idea to use the drawings of your location to map the approximate positions of your characters through time). In describing actions, it is (perhaps counterintuitively) better to remain a bit vague. The principle is very simple: words are boring. The reader's imagination will make 100 words of directions into a more badass fight scene than you could make it in 1000 words of painstakingly detailed description. ex: (Jumping forward, Harry threw all his weight into his elbow, wincing at the sickening sound of the masked man's nose turning into paste.)/(Bracing himself, Harry folded his right arm to his chest and started forward. Pushing against the ground with all his strength, he jumped slightly to the left of the man and sprung his arm to the side, his elbow connecting squarely with the masked man's nose.). By the way, for obvious reasons, this principle also applies to smut. After all, how many times did you find yourself reading through an excruciating number of cringeworthy details during a sex scene written by a young amateur writer? It's the same thing really, the power of suggestion will always prevail... we should call it the love and war principle.

​

* Sensory information: It's generally a good writing advice to use all of your character's senses to ground the reader into the story, this also applies to fight scenes (and smut). Sight is the default sense to describe an action, sound (Whooshing spells, exploding impacts, breaking bones, raspy breath, people insulting each other, a dying man calling for his mum, etc.), smell and taste (Harry tasted blood, the air tasted electric as pulses of magic exploded everywhere, the smell of death permeated the battlefield, Harry could taste the dirt), touch and pain (he felt the sweat dripping down his brow, menacing to reach his eyes and blind him at any moment, every step he took sent a searing flood of pain from the base of his foot to the back of his neck, etc.), and why not a magical sense too? you can pretty much use whatever you want as long a it's vivid.

​

* Pacing and climax (also applies to... yeah, you get it): Have the dramatic tension ebb and flow, end with a bang. ex: (SETUP) Harry arrives near a cliff where the bad guy stands /BUILDUP/ they begin to fight /BUILDUP/ Harry is stuck against the edge of the cliff (RELEASE) Harry uses a badass spell \DOWN\ He manages to get away from the cliff /BUILDUP/ Harry's arm is broken by a spell /BUILDUP/ He looses his wand (RELEASE) He throws himself to the ground to catch his wand \DOWN\ He gets it and return to a defensive position [...........] /BUILDUP/ They exchange blow for blow, Harry is desperate (CLIMAX) Harry throws himself at his opponent, tanking the Crucio he sent at him and puts a knife through his heart.

​

That's getting pretty long now xD, I don't really have an exemplary fic in mind, but I hope this helps a bit. Just keep your eyes open when you read good fics , good books or even watch good movies and you will find these principles (and probably more) applied everywhere.

** There are some pretty good scenes in linkffn(Significant Digits by adeebus). /However/, it's rather a long story /and/ it's a sequel to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is far longer, rather divisive (many love it, many hate it), and doesn't contain much of what you're after.

If you're OK checking out just the action scenes in Significant Digits without knowing all the background, then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/36/Significant-Digits][chapter 36]] through 38, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/52/Significant-Digits][chapter 52]].

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

** In linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall), there are a ton of fight scenes that are easy to follow, but yet not simply just 2 duelers player tennis with their spells. There's a scene where Harry and Dumbledore both fight Bellatrix and Voldemort and the fight is choreographed well and it is easy to imagine what is happening.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** I never had any issues writing these scenes in which Magic is conjured not only from their Wands but also from our minds.

To me, these scenes of fightings must be grand. There must be a fluidity in them and the writing too, and it must, essentially, feel like a few minutes stretched into hours, without the tedious fillers of thoughts, conversation or some-such! - Other people may certainly prefer writing the sort of battles that are over with quickly. But, and that's what keeps me in this HP-Universe, its the magic that attracts and the magic that keeps.

I can't rightly say I have any favorite when it comes to these scenes, though.
