:END:
​

Like the title says i am looking for 2 fanfics that I just cant remember the names of

The first one is sort of similar to “Make A Wish” Linkffn(2318355) in the aspect that harry leaves Britain for most of the story. In this fic he is joined by Luna and I believe Sirius the only other things I know for certain about this fic is that at one point they meet the Mafia and visit a necropolis and find a cursed book.

Of the second story I try to find I only remember that harry was incredible overpowered in the graveyard scene. First he is mocking Voldemord and his DEs and then he summons some sort of Astral Projection that terrifies them.

I would really appreciate of anyone can help me find these Stories.


** The second one is this I think, Harry Potter: Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135

**** It was a good story with a deep plot. But it has the largest harem I've ever seen. So if Harem is not your thing it's not worth your time. It also has a dark harry.
