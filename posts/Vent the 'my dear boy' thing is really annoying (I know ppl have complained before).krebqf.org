I know this has been complained about before but I keep seeing Dumbledore say this in so many fics and it's really annoying me. Maybe with one of the kids once or twice it's okay. But he says it to Sirius and Lupin in some fics constantly which is irritating. They are in their 30s in Harry's school years-I know they are young to Dumbledore, but they're fully grown adults and despite Sirius's immaturity they are in no way 'boys.' If I were them I would find it condescending and patronizing as hell. So fanfic writers, can we minimize the use of that phrase? Thanks...


** "You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed. “Above such brutality, are you?”

“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, my boy,” Dumbledore said calmly.

That would be Harry rather than Dumbledore, but it fel relevant

**** Lol, I feel Dumbledore insulted a lot of people without them realising it (Minister Fudge but I can't remember the precise passage), or in a way they realise but can't retaliate (Lucius Malfoy, CS, near the end before Harry gives LM the diary).

** I mean, that's kind of a trope - old people being patronisingly nickname-ey to younger people. I can't vouch for it in real life personally since nearly all my grand-family are dead and the only one still alive is my great-aunt who is formal as heck and the very idea of her ever using a nickname is bizarre, but I have seen various tumblr posts and such talking about patronising nicknames from old people.

** The point (usually) is for the reader to actively dislike Dumbledore anyway. The writer knows that it's annoying, but do it anyway. Maybe to show how bad and invasive Dumbles is, idk.

I'm not a fan of fics that do that

** All the variants of 'my boy' are terrible. Conversely, it is also terribly annoying in fics when Harry constantly calls Dumbledore 'old man'. It seems like both occur in the same stories.

** As annoying as it is in fics where it's (over)used to characterise Dumbledore as an out of touch, patronising jackass, it's /way/ worse in fics where he's meant to be portrayed positively, but for some reason goes around implicitly calling his 30+ years old friends and employees children.

** I hate it cause evil dumblydore doesn't need to kill puppies, condescend to everyone, and generally be a bond villain. You can just make him evil and act like he does in the books, problem solved. It's so annoying. It's shorthand for authors who want to write stupid dumbledore or evil dumbledore, because either way they have a massive superiority complex
