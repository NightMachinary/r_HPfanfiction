** Linkao3(Correspondence by seekeronthepath)

Correspondence it's an epistolary series in which Harry ends up as Neville's foster brother from second year forward. We only really get a close view of their relationship in part five which is focused on the correspondence between Harry and Neville after their Hogwarts years.

Overall the series leaves you wanting a full-on writing of the events you can get a glimpse through the letters you read, but it manages to leave you satisfied with what you have nonetheless.

  After graduating from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger was offered a job as the personal secretary of Augusta Longbottom, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. This is what happened next. (This work runs in parallel to both 'Apprenticeship' and 'Whatever Happened to Draco Malfoy?', and will cover some of the familiar characters we haven't seen much of in those works, along with plenty of screen time for the badass ladies of 'Age and Wisdom'.)
