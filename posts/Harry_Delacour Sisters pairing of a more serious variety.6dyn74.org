This may be asking too much because I am guessing most Harry/Delacour sister fics are "super crack" fics, or full on smut fics.

However I am curious if there are any Fics where Harry ends up paired with both Fleur and Gabrielle Delacour. Perhaps it is for political reasons or a political move to unite France and England. Perhaps it is due to a combination of marriage contract or life debt and something else. Perhaps it is simply a Veela thing where sisters share each other and a mate.

Now obviously this must either take place later on (post Hogwarts or late Hogwarts), or Gabrielle needs to be "aged up". Ive seen it done before where they simply make Gabrielle Harry's age so shes only a couple years younger than Fleur. But I am not looking for a pairing with a super young Gabrielle here. I am also not looking for a "simpleton" Harry captured by Veela allure or some such nonsense.

I am hoping to fic is at least a decent length and semi interesting. Again I am not really looking for pure crack or smut only fics. Its fine if it has smut in it, or even a little crackfic-ish, but it needs to be focused on a believable and decent plot line.

Again.. perhaps asking to much but Ill never know if I dont try ;)

Hope to see some recommendations in the morning and thanks ahead of time.

Also... you emphasize T rated... does this mean its kinda a kiddie story with little in the way of sexual aspects or violence or combat? Aka less serious more about childlike romance?

**** It's definitely not a kiddie story, it's a bit dark at times. However, there's very little sexual aspects and innuendo for most of the story. There's a decent amount of combat towards the end of the story. (last 10-20 chapters)

Take this comment with a grain of salt, given the fact I haven't read this story in a long time.

**** I find it interesting that you feel a story needs sex, violance, or combat to be serious. Throughout history there are tons of stories that lack much of those things, and they would rarely be called childlike.

***** They were just examples of things that would usually prevent a T rating.

I find that much of the time aiming for a T rating actually holds back a piece of fan fiction from reaching its potential. Its more often than not, a sign of an author censoring themselves for whatever reason, usually in an attempt to reach the largest audience, or for fear of a possible ban, or simply for their own personal beliefs.

This is NOT to say that T rated stories cant be amazing or serious. And if you read what I wrote, that's not at all what I said or what YOU implied.

***** Yes i believe its complete and even has an epilogue.

When i read it (in 2013-14 or something) it was not complete though and I have not had a chance to go back to it, so I don't know much about the ending and if the story arc is truly complete or might have a sequel.
