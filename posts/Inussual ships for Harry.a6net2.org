** I was going to say there are fics pairing him with personifications of Gringotts and Hogwarts, Death, that ice chick from Final Fantasy, and the devil chick from Disgaea.

But if it's someone his age there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][his own female counterpart]], the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][sister of the bully Pierse Polkiss]], fem!Dudley, and some fish in the Black Lake.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
