I've read both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581954/1/Mental][Mental]] by Sara Holmes and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594792/1/Gold-Tinted-Spectacles][Gold Tinted Spectacles]] by Beren and I really enjoyed both stories, thus I'm looking for more long good slash fanfics. Everything is fine, except Harry/Snape. Bonus points for Umbridge bashing.

Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo is pretty popular. linkffn(Saving Connor) is mentioned from time to time.

This description for Saving Connor would've been better for the OP.

If the OP would've read Saving Connor specifically hoping to read slash, they would've been disappointed because that story doesn't contain any. The two stories following Saving Connor don't contain slash either, and there's no slash yet halfway through the 4th (where I am). It's all pre-slash (working towards a relationship but said relationship hasn't happened yet).

So yes, the mammoth Sacrifices Arc series contains slash but the story Saving Connor (which was rec'd here) does not.

****** I suppose it depends on your perspective. Is so-called 'pre-slash' NOT slash? It's fairly clear where it's going, and for the first three books they're non-sexual children anyway. I do agree it would have been better to recommend the entire series, though, rather than just the first one. Especially if you then don't explain that it's part of a much larger series.

One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

  PLAYLIST SONGS MUST BE OPENED IN NEW WINDOWS MANUALLY because AO3 is dumb and won't let me modify the properties of my hyperlinks. Ugh, right? As of 13 May, 2015, all playlist links should be working. If you come across a broken playlist link, please leave a comment and let me know! I will dispatch my highly trained team of computer-using monkeys to fix it.This story will eventually get quite dark, and as such it comes with a HUGE TRIGGER WARNING for graphic depictions of torture, physical violence, and murder. If these might trigger you I absolutely cannot recommend reading!Further, in an effort to be spoiler-free, I cannot guarantee a happy ending (though by the same coin, I cannot guarantee a bad one, either).

** linkffn(2529586)

Broken mind fractured soul had some really interesting elements to it, develops a H/D friendship and later romance (romance I think was either late in the first story or in the sequels). There are some disturbing scenes of abuse, however, but I think there were warnings in the chapters where it was depicted.
