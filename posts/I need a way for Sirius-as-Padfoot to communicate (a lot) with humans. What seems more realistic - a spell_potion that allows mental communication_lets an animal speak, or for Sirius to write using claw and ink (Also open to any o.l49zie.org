#+TITLE: I need a way for Sirius-as-Padfoot to communicate (a lot) with humans. What seems more realistic - a spell/potion that allows mental communication/lets an animal speak, or for Sirius to write using claw and ink? (Also open to any other ideas.)

** Can I ask why?

Is it remotely or is he in the room with the people he's communicating with? Because if he's in the room, whines and tail thumps as confirmations work? Dogs can look confused and angry and can point. That feels the most realistic

Remotely, maybe Legilimancy? Can you legilimens a dog? Sure why not. You decide how legilimens works it's decently flexible. That's all mindreading and would work if it's adults he's talking to.

After that, if it needs to be anything more indepth, scratching out basic words probably feels best? Talking dogs are odd to me but that's a completely personal opinion.

*** Guess it might've helped if I detailed this in the post.

So, Sirius has been cursed so that he can't turn back to human, but it's also an AU where everyone still think he betrayed the Potters. After escaping Azkaban, he manages to kill Peter, which is when he gets cursed, then goes to live as a dog with Harry (who has no idea who he is) until Remus finds out, at which point Remus wants to kill him, but of course Harry's not going to stand by and just let this random dude (he's never met Lupin before in this AU) murder his pet dog. The fact Sirius has lived with him for years and not tried to kill Harry or gone back to the ressurected Voldemort makes Remus pause long enough to want to find out why, and Sirius is going to want to clear his name. Thus the need for communication.

**** Oh that is fun!!!

For tension I think the imbalance of communication between Remus and Sirius might work in your favor here with Harry as a mediator. It would be interesting to see how Remus can ask the right questions to get the answers he needs. Sirius growling and showing emotion in response.

Especially since we assume Lupin has some experience communicating with Padfoot from school so he might be better than you'd expect at just understanding dog. Getting easily annoyed and bickering at stupid answers or actions.

Legilimancy would work too? Especially if Sirius's dog thoughts are a bit disjointed, again adding to the tension and mystery.

If Harry likes reading, finding passages in books to point at would also be good? Song lyrics or titles? Again, a lot of effort on your behalf but that's a way of communicating?

I like this idea! I think, play with the limited communication as much as you can before resorting to two way conversations. More interesting. But if you want to drag it to a longer story then there's probably a potion Remus and Sirius could both take which allows them to hear eachother? That would probably work best. It would then be fun if it's just Lupin who can hear Sirius and Remus has to try convince everyone else on his behalf. Sirius can be getting better at scratching out things during this time since he's starting to get used to talking to humans again.

***** This is all useful, thanks. I'd wanted to go with two way conversation but you make a good argument for keeping things limited and I think I'll go with that.

****** Writing is not that farfetched if he is in the beach and can write with his paws in big letters... Otherwise, yeah, something else like Legilimancy makes more sense

*** The animagus could legilimens the human too, Harry could feel Snape probing his memory, so I'd assume Sirius can simply pick what memory would represent his intention. Also great for hilarious exchange :

"You dog! I'm not going to do that for you!"

*transform back*

** It depends on whether the Animagus (or Sirius under this particular curse) can still use his magic (other than turning himself into a human). Maybe you can add to the tension by Sirius teaching himself how to perform wandless nonverbal magic in order to communicate telepathically with people. Or you could have the nonverbal communication style of the dogs. It would be very rudimentary at first but then they could also write by tracing their paws in the dirt.
