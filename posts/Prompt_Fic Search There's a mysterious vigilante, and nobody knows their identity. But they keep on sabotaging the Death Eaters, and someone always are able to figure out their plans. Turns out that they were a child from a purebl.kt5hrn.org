Can be a vigilante or a vigilante group. A good comparison would be Zuko's 'blue spirit' persona from Avatar: The Last Airbender.

If there are any fics similar to this, please link them below.

** There are fics about Snape being a sneaky saboteur spy; I remember one where he created a potion for Voldemort that destroyed the dark lord slowly from the inside (can't recall the title). However, I can't seem to remember any where Snape or another Pureblood becomes a full blown vigilante.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

** Pretty sure there are some where regulus does that. Can't think of any names off the top of my head though, sorry

Would love to read one where it's Pansy, Millicent or Theo, tbh
