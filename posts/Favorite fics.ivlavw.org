*** Wanna counter Prince of Slytherin as a first read. I think a lot of it's value and humor comes from being familiar with other tropes in HP fic, so I don't think it'd be as fun as a first fic, though it's one of my favorites. OP definitely read this after you've read a few, but I'd save it for then.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

You might be getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of recommendations so I recommend checking out the filters and tags in Archive of Our Own. You can search specifically for or exclude characters, relationships, tropes, or other other common elements. I enjoy Wrong Boy Who Lived stories and Slytherin Harry stories. My sister likes magical tattoos, BAMF Harry, and soulmate AUs.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

**** Came here to rec this and that's my favorite one of these too. It made me cry a couple times. The author's writing style is really unique and is a brilliant counterpoint to the “show, don't tell” mentality. They're telling this story in such a sad but beautiful way. Melancholy and haunting. Some of these are uplifting and funny too, which shows a real range.

OP, please also check out their series on the women of HP who don't get enough sympathy or props. It's a fun blend of essay/fanfic that I think would be great for someone just dipping their toes into the community. My favorite is the Pansy Parkinson one.

One of my first HP fics read. After this one it was hard to find any other to match that one though. I recommend it wholeheartedly.

** My Unordered Top HP 20 Fics: a copypasta.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

Ongoing: Before I read Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. A classic.

Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: Astronaut!Ron, CleverGirl!Hermione, and the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a few things I take issue with, like the whole age line thing for instance. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and because I'm Hinny trash.

Finished: That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]]) is the only crossover in this list, that being with Doctor Who. That being said, you don't need to know a thing about Doctor Who to enjoy this story. Essentially, one of the most powerful monsters from that show is Harry's boggart, and the monster has some unique attributes that make them immune to the Ridikkulus spell. Honestly, the less you know, the better. Enjoy the thrills!

Finished: Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/]]) is a classic comedy fic. Instead of the main character being Harry, it's the part of Voldemort that became the Scarcrux. Hilarity ensues because Harry's insane, but not evil.

Finished(sort of): Like A Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/]]) Harry has red hair, and so is mistaken for a Weasley. They don't mind, and in fact, they adopt him. A classic crack fic, that's basically a fever dream crafted by Fred and George, and McGonagall is close to having an aneurysm.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Three's the Charm by MissCHSparkles linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

Ongoing: A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14041326]]) and it's sequel by Shrikanth1808 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14082594]]) is tagged as a “reverse parody,” in which it takes the premise of Umbridge finding and reading out loud to Hogwarts the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, and attempts to takes it seriously. There are a bunch of fics out there like it, but this is by far the best executed.

Ongoing: Strange Visitors From Another Century by Izzyaro linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/]]) In an accident in the DoM's Time Room when their trying to rescue Sirius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up stranded during the time of the Hogwarts Founders. Salazar doesn't have a good time when he learns what the future thinks of him. They learn that there have always been and will always be Dark Lords. The version of the Founders in this fic is my official headcanon.

Ongoing: The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/]]) is a fic where Harry, and then eventually Hermione and Dean all either live at or become a common visitor of a Muggle facility for disadvantaged kids. Only for both the doctors and the kids to realise they can do magic. McGonagall doesn't know what she's in for when she arrives with letters.

Abandoned: Second Chances by Mara Rome linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4564794/1/]]) is the only traditional Severitus fic I can say I've completely enjoyed so far. Harry and Snape aren't related in any way, thank god, and it has all the things I love so much in hurt/comfort fics. It's set in the summer between GoF and OotP, and it all starts off when Harry uses a glamour charm when he gets checked on by Arthur. Cue warning from Ministry, Snape wants to catch the brat red-handed, only to find very familiar bruises.

Finished: Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/]]) in which Luna steals Ginny's diary and become friends with. Naturally, Tom hates every minute of it, and it's great. Not only is it funny to see the lord of evil just BSoD at all of the Luna he has to deal with, but it also has a really heartwarming ending.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks.

** One of my favorites is a rather short one that discusses the (purely platonic, student teacher) relationship between Luna and Snape. It doesn't pull any punches with Snape as an asshole, but it doesn't demonize him either. It's one of my favorite writings of Luna in fic, completely in character with her book portrayal. I think she's one of the hardest characters to write well, and this is a spectacular example.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love]])

My personal favorite long fic is linkffn(the arithmancer) or anything by whitesquirrel generally. This one is “if Hermione were a math prodigy instead of just a bookworm” but the part I like best is that it really delves into the concept of Arithmancy as a basis for spellcrafting and the way it treats magic as something that can be understood, but also something that can't. The final battle is one of my favorite action sequences in all of fic. (E: I think this is the only one on my list that has any romance, but it's a background point, pretty minor, and not at all the point of the story; nothing smutty, nothing beyond a kiss.)

Some of their shorter ones are also amazing: linkffn(justice, justice shall you pursue) is about what would happen if the muggle government was competent and got involved, and linkffn(petrification proliferation) is about what the response should be like if a basilisk really were set on a school.

My old school long favorite is linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom), which is about a world in which Voldemort won the first war. Lots of fun Celtic magic and stuff, plus a delightful amount of international politics that really drives the story forward. Basically nothing plot-wise is taken from canon, so it's really like reading a whole new book. Warning: abandoned at the end in the worst way, but there are still > a million words to enjoy.

linkffn(the Snape chronicles) is my favorite story that sticks to canon relentlessly. It's a biography of Snape from his POV that does a masterful job taking small details from the books and making them into major plot points, and I think the author must have grown up in England in that era because he seems so familiar with what the world actually would've been like during snape's childhood. It's a bit more sympathetic to Snape than I usually like, but that didn't super bother me. Background characters are really fleshed out, and his relationships with the other Hogwarts teachers are hilarious and poignant and beautiful.

Since you asked for OCs, one I've seen recced /a lot/ but haven't gotten around to reading (because I just wanna be in Hogwarts) is the Alexandra Quick series. Linkffn(3964606).

** Linkffn(The Curse of Truth)

Linkffn(Travel Secrets)

It's one of the first fics I've read, several years ago, and I still like it.

P.s. I've found so many forgotten fics just scrolling down my reading list.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
