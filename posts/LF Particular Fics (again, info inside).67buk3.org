1. The houses are unified in a social group that puts on a play, I think of The Tale of Three Brothers. Cedric features. Their meeting area has a magical spyhole/ window of some description that was transfigured.

2. Fem harry is in Hufflepuff and their common room includes an underground pool

Ringing any bells?

Best wishes and many thanks...


** Second one is /Alexandra Potter/ by Taure, no longer on FFN, but one of the mirror sites probably has it.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
