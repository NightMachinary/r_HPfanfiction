I have demolished They Shook Hands three times already and most recently was heartbroken upon finishing book 6 of Leos Inter Serpentes (a very good Mentor!Snape ish series) and realizing there was no book 7. It's not abandoned but.... I'm now ficless. Anyone have any good, lengthy, completed 7 part AUs?

Please no crossovers, fem!harry, OC!Harry, etc. Im honestly not picky except I want it to be as time consuming as possible, and involve Slytherin (even though im open to non slythering reccs if it means I get to spend weeks reading good work).


** I dont have a link cause I personally didnt find it to my taste but it was really well written; but The R series, the philosophers stone retransmuted etc. Complete au as tonks is in Harry's year andnthe meet before harry starts getting his letter.

*** I just finished reading the R Series. And WOW. That was SO good. I wish he would have continued on with that Book 8 he seemed to start but never updated again.

***** Im not sure where you stopped, but I was REALLY hesitant when Leon was introduced (basically to replace Ron). Its good. Its really good. It goes VERY towards BasicallyGod!Harry in 6 and 7 but its very....tasteful and self aware? Very impressed with this work. Very sad I'm done lol.

******* Ahhhh yeah 5-7 are probably the best. 1 and part of 2 are where the writer was getting things set up and it was kind of a drag.

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?
