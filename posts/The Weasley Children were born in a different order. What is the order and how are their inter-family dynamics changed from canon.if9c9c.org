For instance: if Ginny was born first and Molly simply had more children because she loved having children. Or if Bill hadn't been the eldest and hadn't set such a high standard for his other brothers to follow. Fred and George weren't twins. Or: they were both of them twins, but not to each other, and were often mistaken for identical twins because of how alike they appeared. Their actual twins could always tell them apart.


** I think Ron's Personality would change a lot if he wasn't the youngest son. He was insecure and always felt overshadowed, and felt like he couldn't live up to his brothers, and that would change greatly if he was, for example, the middle child. I feel like everything would really change if the birth order was different. I like to think that ginny is how she is because she grew up with /6 older brothers/, but would she really be different if she was the oldest? Also, how would this impact the war? Obviously the golden trio wouldn't happen if Ron doesn't befriend Harry and Hermione, but i can't really imagine any other weasley in his place. The trio is perfectly balanced, i like to think, and someone else in Ron's Place would mess it up.
