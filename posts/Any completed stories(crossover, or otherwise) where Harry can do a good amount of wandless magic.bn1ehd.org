By completed, I mean actually fully completed, not just part 1 of x completed, but the whole story is completed. I'm sick of reading a 100k+, 200k+, 300k+, etc... stories, and then finding out that it's only part 1, and the other parts aren't completed yet. I don't mind incomplete stories as long as it actually says as such in the summary, but for right now i'm looking for wandless Harry stories that are complete so that I can ride through my food poisoning.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** If you like obscenely powerful Harry with a Harry/Gabrielle pairing you could enjoy [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]]. It's very good written with a decent plot. Definitely one of my go to fics.

** *self promotion alert*

In the second Book in the Last Mage of Krypton series (Book [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][4]]), Harry learns how to use Kryptonian Battle Magic which relies on manifesting the sigils of the 23 Great Houses of Krypton and deploying them in various configurations to adjust their effects.

The method is explained in-story (along with the limitations and dangers) and although Harry doesn't use it many times, the fact that one spell (Zu Da Ur) effectively creates a miles-wide magic-free zone causes considerable worry in-story.

Details of the magical system (plus some of the combinations) can be found [[https://www.deviantart.com/honorablebaldy/art/Worldbuilding-Kryptonian-Magic-681127769][here]].

*** Oh i've read your stories already(actually am currently in the midfle of this whole obscural arc you've set up. Interested to see where you take that), and am greatly enjoying them. I've always enjoyed Superman stories, and have always been interested to know how powerful a fully grown kryptonian with magic would end up. Although I have to disagree with the whole less magic resistance you gave him. The comics never say his magic resistance is less than a normal persons is. It's always been stated that he is /just as vulnerable to magic as anyone else/. Taking that into account, it would mean that a Kryptonian with magic would have all the same benefits as a human with magic. Sorry just the way I see it, and one of the few things I disliked about your story.

*** I mean there are many different versions of Superman, all with different ways that the writer writes him, but before the whole new lot of writers came in, and started massively changing things, Superman was originally not invulnerable to magic, it effected him the same as any other human. Now all these new writers take 'magic can hurt Superman' to mean it's like Kryptonite, and he's especially vulnerable, even though that was never the original intent, and that's the way I always liked it.

** One I'm currently reading is called A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight on AO3. Little tidbit if you do not like Snape then I don't suggest reading it because he is a main character but Harry does obtain the ability to do nothing but wandless parselmagic after an incident. I'm not done reading it yet and I know there are follow up stories. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072%22%3E][A Year Like None Other]]

Basically stuff happens, Harry nearly dies, Snape basically becomes his father because they learn to get along and like each other during Harry's healing time, Harry is blind and magicless for a long time before he heals in both ways, and Draco is a brother in all but blood and name. Also Dudley redemption!!

** Well, how do you feel about partially completed series? Book one of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is complete, but book 2 isn't. Harry runs away at age 5 and is adopted by the Grangers, and he and Hermione both learn a moderate amount of wandless magic (enough to trip an opponent and retrieve a wand during a duel, for example).

*** By book 2 do you mean COS, if so then no. Like I said, I in general hate incomplete stories, but if storie got to at least the OOTP I could still find interest, but stories that never get past the TWT are frankly absurd, and of little interest to me, because of the thousands(literally) of incomplete stories i've read.

**** Part one is year 1-4 and part 2 is year 5 onward. Currently it's complete up to valentine's day in 5th year and it's probably going to last until 7th year. It hasn't been updated too much recently since the author has been working on Annals of Arithmancy but that one has recently been completed so it's getting updated regularly again.
