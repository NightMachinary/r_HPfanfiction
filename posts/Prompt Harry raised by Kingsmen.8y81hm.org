CQC, firearms handling, all that good shit.

I want to see Harry beat up Draco with a fucking brolly like it's no one's business.

Honestly, how has no one done this yet? There are more fics with fucking /Ace Ventura/ than the Kingsmen.


** “Magic,” Harry said calmly, reaching up to do the first lock. “Maketh,” the next lock. “Man.” He pushed up his glasses and turned around to face the baffled death eaters. “So, are we going to sit around all day, or are we going to fight?”

**** Never heard or read the fic. My concept revolves around an obselete SAS style aggressive special forces that became a mercenary group due to the disarmament of wizarding military forces. So essentially a sizeable group of highly trained soldiers.

**** It's actually refreshing. There's a lot of the classic tropes--Daphne Greengrass, a smattering of politics, etc--but I loved it because Harry's still completely an eleven-year-old boy.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

  HPxKingsman. WBWL. Running away at the young age of 10, H.J.Potter felt unloved. His younger brother had everything given to him on a silver platter. His parents forgot he even existed sometimes. He was alone, until he was taken in by a man named Merlin. Guns, women, whiskey and magic. No longer will the world see him as Harry James Potter, he is now Hades.
