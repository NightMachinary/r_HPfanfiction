Purebloods think they have a good enough grasp over what dragonpox is to have strong opinions on whether the current plague is dragonpox and what the right thing to do about it is.

To analogize with current events: the people denying Covid understand that people can die of infectious diseases, they just think they know better than the experts whether the death rate is worth worrying about and whether or not taking precautions is worthwhile.

** Corvusdraconis wrote a story called “Eye of the Dragon, Hair of the Cat” that included a subplot similar to this. A certain muggleborn became the equivalent of Typhoid Mary (but with a highly virulent strain of dragon pox) because they didn't recognize the symptoms, but several purebloods refused treatment as their superior bloodlines would save them... Highly recommend anything by this author. So much fun to read!\\
She also has a few other stories that have some plague-ish subplots. I think “Symbiosis” had a truth plague that was pretty amusing.

Edit: Also “One Step Forward, Two Decades Back” included a hilarious werepoodle outbreak where hateful, bigoted ideas spread the disease... basically, the death eaters turn into poodles and are contained in Azkaban. Definitely a touch on the crackish side, but the fix is still an amazing epic-length journey.

*** I think is a fun way to both point out flaws in current life in a way we can reflect on without having to be to serious about it, yes fanfic is an escape, but quite a few use real life situations and current trends as influence for story. It's a way to express a person's view through parody, without necessarily attaching political or social weight to the topics we find interesting or decisive.

*** Voldemort as Donald Trump is an... interesting idea. Like, is he an evil genius playing 4D chess? Or a vain, charismatic moron???

Actually, nevermind. It's been a long 4 years. I have zero desire to have this bizarre reality bleed into my fiction reading.

That being said, Fudge is the Trump of HP.

** Doesn't dragon pox only affect pure blood wizards. And therefore with Slytherins being at higher risk with more Slytherins being pure blood. Why would they refuse to quarantine?

  'Yes.' Arthur glanced up at Harry. 'It rather depends on your blood-status to be honest,' he said with an embarrassed shrug. 'All purebloods get it. Usually between the ages of four and six, although some don't get it until they're ten or so. Sometimes they get it later than that, and it's a bit more dangerous, then.' He rubbed a finger over his eyebrow. 'Muggle-borns never get it. Half-bloods...' Arthur held up a hand and waggled it from side to side. 'Depends. Kind of a coin toss. If one of your parents is Muggle-born, like you, then you're probably not going to get it. If both parents are magic, and you have one or more Muggle grandparent, chances are you'll have dragon pox.'

*** Because it's a ploy from Dumbledore to seperate them from everyone else, and so Dumbledore could train "in secret" all the other Hogwarts students against purebloods, while Slytherins and other pureblood such as Weasleys are in quarantine.

Well, it teached the blood-traitors. See how ungrateful those mudblood lovers are and they just wants to see Purebloods disapears, even if the pureblood were on their side.
