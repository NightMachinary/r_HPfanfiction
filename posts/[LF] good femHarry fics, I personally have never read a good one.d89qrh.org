Title says it all and the reason that I've never read a good one is probably because I have only read like two that I found on like the first page of ffn

Thanks if you did recommend something


** I really enjoyed linkffn(Holograms) and linkao3(Dawn of a New Century). Sadly, they haven't been updated for a while.

  You won't believe me when I tell you who I was reborn as, but I'll tell you anyway. There was no Harry James Potter. Instead, there was an Adaline Lily Potter. Yes, you read this right. I was reborn into a female Harry Potter. Go me! Not really, if you remember what all Harry had to go through before he got his happy ever after.

  There seems to be an infestation of ghosts? or was it memories? roaming around Hogwarts. Classes get disrupted, meals get postponed, teachers and students get walked through; there is chaos at Hogwarts that year, but is it only happening in Hogwarts; that is what the Order of the Phoenix are trying to figure out. All they know, is that it is about the future. FEM! Potter

** Linkffn(Son if Potter, Daughter of Black; Season of Change; A Fair Life)

These are all "Harry is turned into a girl" stories, with Harry being born a girl but was transformed into a boy for whatever reason. The first two are seemingly abandoned, but I'd still reccomend reading at least SoP,DoB. A Fair Life is relatively new and receiving regular updates. They're not the most well-written stories, but they're decent for the most part and I really enjoyed them.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

** Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) this one's also really good, and complete. Harry goes back in time but it's an alternate past where he ends up in an alternate, fem-version of himself.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
