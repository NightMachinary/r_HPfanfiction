And are you writing a HP fic or a story about something else?

I'm ~thinking~ about doing it since I'm not in school this semester but I have no ideas so far.

If you haven't heard of National Novel Writing Month, go to [[http://www.nanowrimo.com]]


** Me! I want to get a good start on my next WIP and have it more finely polished than my other stories. I have never managed to complete it before, but I'm currently between jobs so it should be a nice project between job hunting.

** I'm thinking about it! Haven't written anything in awhile, but I'm doing my internship year and I actually have this magical thing called free time. After so many years in school, I had forgotten that most adults don't do more work until all hours of the night after working all day (grad school nearly killed me). Unfortunately, November has both the new Pokemon game and Fantastic Beasts so there will be tons of distractions. I also need a story idea

I won once in 2012 with an original idea.

** I am in awe of anyone who does it. I shall watch from the sidelines, eating crisps and cheering. I might try and make a bit of a push with my own story to show willing, but 50k words in a month . . . Makes me tired just thinking about it.

** Not officially (50K is a bit much, especially with other life things going on), but I hope to get a novella-length fanfic churned out in Nov. I've got a pretty thorough plot outline in place, I just need to sit down and type.
