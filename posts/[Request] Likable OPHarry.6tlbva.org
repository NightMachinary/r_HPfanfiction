I'm looking for stories like linkffn(Core Threads), linkffn(Barefoot), and, to an extent, linkffn(Blindness). The common feature of these stories is that Harry is enormously OP (I don't believe there has ever been a more OP character in fanfiction history than /Core Threads/'s Harry), but still childlike and likable. The main flaw of most OP!Indy!Harry stories (which stems from the bashing, but can exist independant from it) is, I think, that we too often end up with an "angry" Harry who, even when not nominally "Dark", will be ruthless and often quite cruel in his treatment of his enemies (be they an evil Dumbledore or simply old Voldy). Apparently this fulfills some people's fantasies, but it instantly loses my sympathy, which is a bit of a problem when the whole point of an OP!Story is a wish fulfillment fantasy where you identify with Harry. So. Do you have any other (preferably humorous) stories with a /nice/ OP!Harry?


** There's the old, sadly unfinished classic C'est La Vie. The author removed all of her works from FFN a few years back, but it's still up on AO3. It focuses more on Harry helping others with their problems rather than him simply curb-stomping his way through the plot like most OP!Harry fics. It's near the top of my "drop everything if this ever updates again" list.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

**** C'est La Vie can be found [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668][here]] if you haven't already seen FanfictionBot's reply. After re-reading the OP I should mention that the Harry in this fic is an involuntary time/dimensional traveler, not a child, in case that affects whether you'd want to read it. I'd still highly recommend it either way. :)

I read Vaults of Stone a few years back. I barely remember the plot, but I do recall liking its interpretation of an Intelligent!Harry that actually acts like a child (looking at you, Methods of Rationality). I'll have to reread it one of these days.

** linkffn(Harry Janus Potter - Dances with his Destiny) is a great crossover fic in which he becomes the benevolent Emperor over our local group of galaxies. It's wonderfully geeky at points and Harry will sometimes express child-like excitement at scientific discoveries. How OP is a multi-galactic emperor?

linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) is a different approach to becoming OP!Harry in that he experiments on himself to get stronger. It's a cool fic that I find myself coming back to read again pretty often.

linkffn(RuneMaster) is one of my favorite fics of all time. Harry is a savant when it comes to runes and becomes OP!Harry due to his runic creations.

**** At least a passing knowledge of Stargate would help, but Harry often has to explain things to the people around him about the nature of the technologies involved as well as the Stargate bad guys he has to fight. If you like sci-fi in general though, you should be able to keep up.

As a long-time fan of Stargate, my bias is quite skewed in this regard. If it helps, it later crosses over with Battlestar Galactica a bit and then majorly with Star Wars towards the end. So it ends up as a multi-crossover sci-fi fic.

"A brown-eyed bushy brown-haired girl just sat transfixed in amazement of the boy. "He's so handsome," she thought.

** Not sure I would describe Harry as nice in Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, but childlike does fit. She (It's a fem harry story) is certainly not ruthless in the way OP!Indy harries typically are. Best way to describe her would be extremely precocious.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** I don't actually have a recommendation, just responding to your challenge of finding a more op Harry.

in linkffn(fates gamble) Harry becomes absolutely open, like planet busting tier. It's also a crossover.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
