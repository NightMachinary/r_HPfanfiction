Text says it all! I prefer D/G but want to dip my toes into D/H.

I prefer Hogwarts era but will read anything if it's good.

Thanks!


** Here's a mix of my top fics, but not necessarily following the Hogwarts rule. IMO, if it's long and smutty, and has stood the test of time, it's worth reading.

[[http://dmhgficexchange.livejournal.com/315755.html][The Nothing Fights]] by somandalicious (DHR) Light R, short story

I hate short stories, but that one's excellent. Now on to the real list.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544208199][Water]] by kissherdraco is the ULTIMATE Dramione, Head Boy/Girl story. This is the one to read! M, novel length

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544185495][The Family Jewels]] by Narcissa Black, this is the first fic I fell in love with. It's sloppy, it's old school, but it's what got me into Dramione and Dramionaise. Full length, M, with all the pairings, warnings, slash... Hogwarts-Era

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600008567][Contrast]] by TomFeltonisKindaHot (DHR) M, full length, incomplete. Another classic, but one of the foundation DHR fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1907079/1/Growing][Growing]] by Atruwriter (DHR) M, 250K

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5853767/1/Hunted][Hunted]] by Bex-Chan (DHR) M, ~200K

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4115179/1/The-Science-of-It-All][The Science of It All]] by provocative envy (DHR) M, 25K+

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600022131&chapter=1][Her Shoes]] by margaritama (DHR) M, mid length

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7812115/1/Difficult][Difficult]] by provocative envy (DHR) M, 87K+

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5292162/1/The-Radiant][The Radiant]] by fury-shashka (Lucius/Ginny) M, 125K+. This is the only Ginny-related story that I love love. Once you get used to Draco, you'll get used to Lucius. :).

I second Claiming Hermione, Beautiful Things Can Come From the Dark, Broken, Silencio, Isolation, and the Fallout.

** Ok. These should be fairly simple to search for. I have mostly D/H but they're all over the place from comedy from dark. If you give me more of an idea I can star some of them. Right now, I've marked the ones I remember being at Hogwarts but there are probably more.

** Not sure if it is what you're looking for but I just published the first chapter of a new one of mine. It's D/H starting in first year and follows them up to the end of the series. Give it a look if you want to. It would make my day. :)
