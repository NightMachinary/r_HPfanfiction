** Somebody pointed out in a comment recently that this was one of the things that JKR "broke" in canon: first she says that it's a difficult spell and makes Harry special because he is able to learn it at an unusually young age (even some aurors can't do it)... and then has Harry teach a bunch of students down to 4th year how to do it two books later.

That said, my take on what makes it difficult is that first, one has to have a happy enough memory. (I've seen some angsty fics where Harry can't do it because he doesn't have any happy memories.) Then, one has to be able to bring that emotion forward to actually feel the full emotion from a memory. Thirdly, one has to be able to do this under the pressure of an approaching deadly and a terrifying creature that can entrap and smother you (lethifold) or can literally consume your soul (dementors).
