  But he definitely knew how badly he'd fucked up, how bad he'd left the omega wounded. He'd never forgive himself for hurting such a sweet soul and his mind became flooded with the thought of how he only deserved the best things in life but he was too angry to imagine someone else making him happy.What he didn't know however, was on that cold night, a new tiny life began its journey inside of the omega that was no longer his. Four years later. OrJimin and Jungkook go through a nasty break up and manage to cross paths again after four years. But Jungkook is unaware Jimin had his baby. A chance encounter in a stripclub allway changes their lives all over again. This story is super angsty and fluffy and smutty, Idk how to summarize I'm terrible at it:)

** Depends on what you mean by rare.

I'm fond of Harry in a romance with Padma, which is relatively rare outside of one shots.

I'm also fond of Harry with Angelina, which is quite rare in my experience, mostly just some harem fics that never completed.

Harry with Millicent has some potential too. You have the Slytherin angle and the contrasts and the fact Millicent has to deal with being large.

**** One of my favorites is the Peverell Legacy. It's more or less done, the author is doing a few epilogues with future stuff, but still. Basic premise is Harry ends up in the past after a time turner explodes. Right before he's about to marry Padma. Cue him adopting Harry and her showing up in a huff in her wedding dress 'cause she found out and didn't bother to change before going back, as she wasn't going to let him be trapped in the past alone.

linkffn(13132678)

This one is a harem, but Padma's got a pretty nice part in it. Premise is Harry has no date for the Yule Ball, some people decide to "help him" and suddenly he has way too many.

The first is good for competative-tension-becomes-romantic-tension without as many moral hangups as the more popular enemies-to-lovers tropes in this fandom.

** Hermione/Tonks.

It would be a good case of opposite character traits attracting each other without being fundamentally different. It would also draw out a lot of moments where Hermione would be breaking rules, which are generally some of her best moments (like everything she did surrounding Umbridge and the DA).

Likewise, I would love to read a Hermione/Luna fic where they both influence each other for the better, but sadly that does not happen often (usually Hermione is completely wrong while Luna is close to a Mary Sue, usually ending in them finding one of Luna's creatures).

And I second Harry/Padma, although with the caveat that it should not be a "foreign magical culture and society are superior to everything", which is quite common in a lot of fics dealing with things abroad (although usually with native American or aboriginal magic).

***** I mean, I get redemption arcs - but they usually need the villain to be redeemable/ redeemed anti-hero acting edgy in the first place. Snape and Draco feature in so many fics for a reason.

But we are talking about death eaters and Voldemort now. Literally all of them are 50+ year old terrorists (Snape is probably the youngest of the lot). They are ugly, unsympathetic and murderous maniacs.

90% of the Hermione x Deatheater/ Voldemort pairing fanfics are marriage law fics where Hermione is forced to marry these bastards, gets raped and Stockholm Syndromes' herself into falling in love with them.

**** For me, I think there's several things to it

1 -- for a rare exception (such as Hermione or Neville for example), the more JKR writes about a character, the less I seem to like them. So the most of ‘good guys' fall in one of two categories for me -- boring or unlikable. DEs/Slytherins, on the other hand, were mostly names with just a shadow of personality. Why not focus on ‘good guys' that were just names too? Well, that's just my taste in characters in general, I guess. I don't really like ‘funny', ‘heroic' and ‘honest' types that would ask a jinn for world peace; I've always preferred ‘ambitious', ‘sly', ‘intelligent' and even ‘morally ambiguous' types that look out for themselves first. In HP fanfiction these usually fall into Slytherins/DEs category.

2 -- canon pairings were one of the largest disappointments for me and the very reason I even went looking for HP fanfiction at all, so I tend to read fics that focus on relationship (romantic or otherwise). I did read many canon compliant (minus canon pairings ofc) fics in the beginning. But... relationship between two ‘good' characters... there's no conflict in them, no obstacles to overcome, no growth for either character to be achieved. And if there is, it's something so horribly mundane and domesticated, they're just boring and frustrating to read. Plus if I wanted such ‘realistic' plot I would rather go and read some classics or even original modern books that focuses on describing how miserable and depressing our ‘real' day-to-day life is. At least they're better written.
