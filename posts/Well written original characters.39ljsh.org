I don't think I've ever seen an original character done well, more often than not it's an excuse for a self insert, or the character just doesn't fit with the canon characters and their presence feels forced. And they never do anything that couldn't have been performed by an existing character.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] is an obvious inclusion. It's 100% OC and downright brilliant. Alexandra is a bit maddening sometimes as a protagonist because she just ain't give a damn about anything, ever, but it makes her a strong and interesting character.
