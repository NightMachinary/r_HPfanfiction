Does anyone know of any good Remus raising Harry stories? I found one where Lily entrust Harry to Remus and Remus in turn turns them into wolves fulltime (it was weird) but I would much prefer to read one where they are human.


** Linkffn(The closer you look)

Harry is still stuckwith the Dursleys, but he meets Remus when he's like 8, and Remus becomes a mentor/maybe a bit of a father figure to Harry. Still lives with the Dursleys though

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

** Remus and Sirius raise Harry together in linkao3(Stealing Harry) that story is part of a larger series and I think they are all really well written.
