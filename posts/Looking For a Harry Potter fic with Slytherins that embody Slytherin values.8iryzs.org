Slytherins in the HP universe look so /shallow./ Honestly, the only character with any sort of depth is Malfoy, and that's because of the whole support-Voldemort-to-protect-his-family thing. Other Slytherins are portrayed as evil Gryffindor hating people who just don't like muggles for no reason.

Personally, I feel like Slytherins embody cunning and ambition. I wouldn't expect most Slytherins to fall at the feet of Voldemort. In fact, I'd like to think that most Slytherins are willing to explore and rebel - to go to the muggle world to have fun and explore or party even. I think they'd be the ones who /create/ secret passages to go outside to the Hogs Head to smuggle in Firewhisky and I'd think that Slytherins would be the ones most likely to see the economic damage Voldemort would create, as well as the damage to old pureblood families - and old magic - because they lived through the aftermath as the losers of the first war.

I want to find a fic where Slytherins are actually people and have traditions to uphold and are a family - not spineless cowards like the HP books portray them to be. Where Blaise Zabini is a player and proud, who goes clubbing all the time but protects the firsties because /they're Slytherin and that's their job/.

An example of a fic is Duality by Anda Faith - where Slytherins actually plot to defeat Voldemort and do have their own ambitions - not some generic "we want to be pureblood rulers of the world"

** Part of the problem is that the series mostly deals with schoolchildren. There isn't much a kid can do that's cunning and ambitious as a 14-year-old student besides going to class on time, doing your homework, and being friendly toward the groups of people you think will be useful to you in the future.

*** I completely agree - there's a limit to how wise schoolchildren can be. It can be incredibly unrealistic - kind of ruins some good plots.

That being said, I think that not being wise or as mature as Dumbledore doesn't mean that you don't have any character. Even schoolchildren aren't that shallow, especially given the character traits in people like Ron, Hermione - even Ginny for that matter. Like Ron being jealous, but growing up and being willing to sacrifice himself. I think these innate values and characteristics are also present in schoolchildren, and shouldn't be trivialised down to 'evil 11 year old'.

I think magic opens up a lot of possibilities - as teens we might not be as capable, sure, but with magic the question of age becomes less important that what we can contribute (the same way money magnifies our ability to do things).

I agree that there is a limit to how mature and evolved you can develop it, but I don't think that teens are single dimensioned individuals - many people in the HP universe weren't and it's a bit of an insult to make them so.

Yes, of course Slytherin schoolkids aren't generally evil. Slytherins are a quarter of the population. But schoolkids are still schoolkids, and they're stuck at Hogwarts, where they can only talk to school staff and other children.

What kind of ambitions will they have? Bold, unnuanced ones, probably. How much can they work toward those ambitions? Not much.

In the past, we've had people start working at very young ages. Starting an apprenticeship between 10 and 14 years old was normal. Starting to work on the farm at that age was normal. After the Industrial Revolution, we rethought our attitudes toward child labor. Today, it's unheard of to do any sort of labor beyond basic household chores before you turn 14, and uncommon to work more than a little before the age of 18.

The fact that magic lets you do more work at a young age is kind of beside the point. We didn't get rid of child labor because children are bad workers; we did it on moral grounds.

***** By "what we can contribute" I didn't mean forcing them to work haha - a parallel is to how the advent of technology causes kids today to be more well-informed - we have 16 year olds coming up with cost-effective and accurate ways to detect cancer. Similarly, magic just expands the boundaries of what we can do. In the past, kids are generally too weak to effectively carry logs in farms (as an example) but with magic, the capabilities are expanded as well.

No forcing kids to work though - that's morally wrong

Sure they won't be able to work much towards their ambitions, but they do have characters and personalities that shouldn't be watered down just because they need to provide sufficient antagonism towards the main characters.

** Most of these kids have probably been living in a continuously reinforced bubble since birth, being told that mudbloods steal their magic and muggles are barely sentient. Even if there are a few halfbloods in Slytherin, they most likely go with the flow in order to keep themselves out of trouble.

#+end_quote

You're forgetting that a good majority of teenagers are driven by hedonism. I think their exploration would result in imbibing hallucinogenic potions and rebelling would entail wearing robes considered a bit more scandalous and sneaking out at night. Not rebelling against their social circle's deep seated beliefs.

That's not to say that Slytherins automatically follow Voldemort. It's just that the majority probably realize that opposing him would equal suicide (see all the families he wiped out), so they basically coast along, hoping not to get noticed.

*** That's true. The power of echochambers, especially with regards to a society as conservative as Britain's Magical World, is definitely going to limit the type of exploration that they do. It's a shame though, because I'd think that ambition and cunning have to be tempered by an understanding of their own personal beliefs and assumptions. When you believe wholeheartedly in the sort of pureblood prejudice (or any other belief to be frank) it definitely impacts every single action you undertake. For a Slytherin, who wants to best achieve their ambition, recognising their own beliefs - especially where they might differ from others - is key. I wish the Slytherins in the HP universe understood that better.

About the sort of rebelling they'd do, I think we have to recognise that the magical world is also fundamentally different from the Muggle world. Like to Muggles you can only explore so much, but to the Magic world you literally have an entire world to explore at your fingertips - especially one where magic can protect you (or at least that's the prevalent belief). Personally I think that it's a part of teenagers to want to explore, especially with the taboo of the muggle world that's spread in the pureblood circles.

That being said, I think that the mindset that "I'll be unnoticed" is the most UnSlytherin one you could have in a war. The casualties of wars are mostly innocents, and having grown up knowing all the families he wiped out, Slytherins should be the first to recognise that they won't get anywhere with this guy. That mindset is just hoping that you land in a windfall and don't die. I think the self-preservation (of yourself, your family) meant that you'd want to guarantee you achieve your aim, not just hope to be lucky. Even in a world where Voldemort wins, what changes could he bring that would be beneficial to Britain? Other than killing out Muggles - and probably all the Purebloods too, that is. Survival means changing the system, not anarchy - I believe that the house in Hogwarts most likely to understand this is Slytherin. I think that's part of the reason why I was really disappointed (well relatively speaking - reading Harry Potter for the first time as a seven year old vs when I read it for the eleventh time as a thirteen year old really lets you get perspective) in JKR's character building because she reduced the traits of cunning and ambition from laudable goals that give insight and perspective to 'evil brainwashed kids' which is pretty sad.

** You could try the Leo Inter Serpentes series

Also linkffn(7937889) is very long but gives a very in depth look at Snape and his backstory, which might be something you're interested in.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

*** Personally I'm more interested in fics dealing with Harry's time in Hogwarts - just a personal preference. That being said, I have read some brilliant next gen in Hogwarts fics, Marauders era fics, and Pre-Marauders era fics (mostly about the blacks). I'll definitely give it a shot though, thanks!

** I just read linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) and it's a collection of short stories about a group of Slytherins the year ahead of the Trio, just their day to say problems and experiences. It's not a canon rehash or anything, but of course major plot points like quidditch and the triwizard tournament come up. Do recommend:)

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** Agreed. The shallowness of Slytherins in canon is always frustrating for me. It's cool having an antagonist, but it gets ridiculous. They are not the house of ambition and cunning, not even the house of Pure Blood traditions... they are the house of stupid evilness.

*** I think it's especially in upper year Slytherins where they're more likely to want to create change or influence. Having that hindered by a dark lord seems pretty counterproductive.

It's a brilliant universe, but this really is one of the most underdeveloped parts...ah the beauty of fanfiction, in building characters where it otherwise would be 'antagonist A so that Harry seems like a /cool/ guy'
