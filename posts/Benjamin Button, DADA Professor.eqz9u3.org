I had an idea for a prompt. For those who don't know, Benjamin Button is a character who ages in reverse. So, I thought, what if a DADA professor taught backwards? His students join the school at first year and move through 'til leaving in seventh year as standard reality would suggest. He, however, meets every student for the first time at their graduation and is stuck watching them get younger, less knowledgeable, and less familiar with him until they get sorted and disappear.

He beats the DADA curse because he's already lasted the year from a forward-chronological perspective. He could be doing this for the first time, or be on his hundredth year of doing this. I think it'd be an interesting fic to write, but I haven't the time at the moment to do so myself.
