I had read a fic where harry travels to a dimension where he died as a child, and james left Lily because he blamed her for Harrys death. And Harry is known as a dimension traveller to everyone in the new universe. Its also Harmony shipping. But I can't remember the name of it anymore. Does anyone know it?


** Could be Through the Looking Glass by James Spookie but I'm not sure. It is Harmony and Lily is a major character. Don't remember that bit about James though.

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex
