**** Because he's an idiot. Also, he's been living in a cubbord for years before he got into Hogwarts, benefit of any love or friends. If that doesn't have psychological effects on a prepubescent child, then I'm the Prince of Westeros.

Oh, and because Harry decided to become the pig that get's slaughtered all for Dumbledore's plans.

** Not exactly mentally ill but there is a fanfiction called “The Eyes” by Shadenight123 were Harry grows up in an asylum until Dumbledore comes to pick him up. It's inspired by the Cthulhu mythos and if you enjoy cosmic horror you'll definitely like this while witnessing the mental deterioration of all the characters you love.

“I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

  Everyone said Harry was different, but what if the differences were more than just surviving the killing curse? What if Harry had Autism? How would the wizarding world react and adapt to The Boy Who Lived?

*** I just read your actual post rather than just the title, and realized I never did when I originally posted this. Abuse did cause his mental illness in this one. My bad...
