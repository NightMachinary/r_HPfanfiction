** linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) is much longer than just this (and it is a bit too smutty & BSDM for my taste, but it is a way more than that), but it is one where Harriet (which is what fem!Harry is named) decides against being an Auror in the end, and there is a lot of thinking about their future, marriage, family etc.
