I don't mind slash. Keep it T rated or lower, unless there is no smut (I'm not into that) and please link completed fanfictions.


** I'm currently writing a fanfiction where Snape gets bit by Remus when the prank in sixth year takes place. I'm not finished it, and I won't be for a long time, but it seems to fit what you're looking for.

Also there's another story I enjoyed where James gets bit by Remus.

  What if Severus was bit by Moony before James could get to him? What if everyone's favourite Potions Professor had to face the prejudice about being a werewolf? Follow the Marauders, Snape, and Lily, throughout their sixth and seventh years after Severus is inflicted with lycantropy.

*** Wasn't it fifth year? Lily and Snape were still friends at that point, as I recall.
