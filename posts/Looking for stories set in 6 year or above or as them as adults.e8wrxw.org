As it says looking for stories set with them as young adults or adults in general.

It doesn't have to be Golden Trio Era, it can be Marauder, Next Gen, or another ERA, as long as it's in their 6th year, 7th year or as adults.

If it's Golden Trio Era: NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Dumbledore and/or Weasley Bashing

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine


** Consider reading linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

#+end_quote

The protagonist and nearly all other named characters are adults

  If it's Golden Trio Era: NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione
#+end_quote

It mentions Ron/Hermione as a pairing

#+begin_quote
  No Dumbledore and/or Weasley Bashing
#+end_quote

It pokes a little well done fun at Dumbledore, and it's treatment of the Weasley clan is explained, justified, and eventually forgiven within the narrative.

#+begin_quote
  Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash
#+end_quote

Features het and brief mentions of femslash

It is regrettably incomplete with the last update being posted around March 2017.
