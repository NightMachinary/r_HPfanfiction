"Hah!" Lord Hadrian Potter Black Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw exclaimed. "I knew you were a manipulative old man Dumbassdore!" He then slammed a stack of papers onto his desk. "For the last time Harry that's your tuition fee." Dumbledore said tiredly


** I did read one like that. Can't remember the title off the top of my head, but it does have Dumbledore often thinking about how he *thought* of doing things the way Harry just described, and being glad he didn't go through with it.

**** It may or may not be the one where Harry describes the the alternate universe theory as the two legs of a pair of pants (pretty sure he says pants and not trousers), because that's the "dumbed-down" example Hermione told him.

**** Haven't found the one I was thinking of, but I did run across this one where Dumbledore dies and is sent to another dimension to straighten out his counterpart, and is appalled at some of the choices he made. It's the counterpart who is the canon Dumbledore. linkffn(9824342)

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** There's nothing I can think of exactly like this. One story had Hadrian sent to a canon-ish world but Dumbledore had already died.
