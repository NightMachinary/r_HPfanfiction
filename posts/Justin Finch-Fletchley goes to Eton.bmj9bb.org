I reread CoS and I've been wondering what the magical effects of Justin going to Eton after the basilisk incident/petrification. He would've only been a year or two above Prince William, if my math is right.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Ten years after the defeat of Voldemort, Lee Jordan asks what life was like during the Death-Eaters' reign for the Muggleborn son of a prominent Tory family, and what he learned as a member of the commission which investigated how they came to power.

** Assuming he leaves Hogwarts at the end of the second year, he'll lack two years of schooling. However, he'll have also have missed the entrance exams for his year group so would presumably go back to his old Prep school to catch up and then take them a year late - most public schools allow this, but only for children one year older than normal.

I disremember whether it's canon or fanon about muggle-born Hogwarts drop-outs being obliviated.

That's complete fanon. I don't think we hear about a single instance of memory charms being used on wizards in any sort of sanctioned manner.

*** That's true! He might have to enter at 16, if he can't get in earlier. I think!

I don't think there's anything in canon to support that theory. And to be frank, it sounds a bit silly. Maybe it'd make sense in America (since they've got such a tight hold on wizardry) but I can't say I see it happening in Britain. And isn't Hogwarts non-compulsory?

*** He did expect to go there, though? McGonagall likely convinced his parents sending him to Hogwarts was better than sending him to Eton.

"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she has begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family."

***** He.. Literally turned down going to school with the royal family to go to Hogwarts. That's /book/ canon, not just Twitter canon or movie canon. That's a literal quote from the book. What use does he have to lie about potentially going to Eton? Purebloods and (most) halfbloods wouldn't know what he was talking about.

He evidently doesn't care about his social standing, since any connections he had would be useless in the Wizarding World. He's willing to work fairly for a positive reputation, which is why he's a Hufflepuff.

***** Except it is not 'some random boarding school'. It is the premier education institute for wizards and witches in Britain and has a historical pedigree that rivals that of Eton.

Eton has about 1300 students, the chance that a random student, two years above will have any interaction with the third in line for the throne is vanishingly small, so that would probably be a negligible consideration. And the kid has magic, it is probably necessary to get some practical and theoretical grounding in that stuff and that is best do e by enrollment in this old elite institute where he can also mingle with the best and brightest that the magical world has to offer.

******* The kid has magic. A possible hit to their reputation might very well be a cost they are willing to pay.

And while my own interactions with the British upper classes are far and between I have gotten the impression that the wellbeing of their children is highly important to them, just like regular people.

And while Eton is a reputable school, it is not the only reputable school and attendance is not necessary to maintain a certain reputation. The HMS, most of which are perfectly suitable for the upper classes or upper middle classes (both the current archbishop of Canterbury as well as the Duchess of Cambridge didn't went to Eton), consists of more than 300 schools, so claiming attendance to a school that is not attended by children in their direct social circles should be fairly easy, as would claiming attendance at a school in the United States, the Continent or elsewhere in the world.

Seriously, Britain isn't some caricature of mediaeval Europe.

***** McGonagall no doubt had her work cut out for her, when she went to convince the Finch-Fletchleys to enroll Justin in Hogwarts. I imagine that the Hogwarts representatives are not above using any means necessary to convince reluctant parents that their children would be best off attending Hogwarts.
