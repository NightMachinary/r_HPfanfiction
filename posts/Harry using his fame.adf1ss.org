Any fics where Harry is smart and uses his fame as the chosen one to make money or get stronger.

Props if he acts like Voldemort in the seventh Horcrux


** Oh God Not Again!

24 year old Harry goes back in time to his first year. Starts a fan club. Trademarks a lightning bolt. Talks to Lockhart for marketing advice.

*** Speaking of Lockhart - linkffn(Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly). Harry gets sent back in time but ends up sharing Lockharts body. His Harry half makes Lockhart a genuine hero, while his Lockhart half handles marketing. Also gives his child self assistance in using his fame

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
