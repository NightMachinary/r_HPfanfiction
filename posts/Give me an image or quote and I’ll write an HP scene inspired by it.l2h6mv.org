*** Ooooooo such a good prompt. I took it literally, because why not.

Setting: Voldemort survived the Battle of Hogwarts. The war wages on. Malfoy and his friends have switched sides.

------------------------

It begins with a cloud.

It‚Äòs good weather for a battle, steady sunlight with a soft breeze. The worst part is that it wasn't meant to be a battle at all. Pansy's boyfriend's older sister was caught by snatchers in the early hours of the morning. She called Pansy for help, then the Snatchers called for help, then Pansy called for help, then Yaxley called for help, and now it's the worst fighting any of them has seen since the Battle of Hogwarts in ‚Äò98. It's bad enough that Kingsley gave Theo and Blaise the okay to raise the dead. It isn't much, just an inferi here or there, but it saves lives.

Harry doesn't notice the first cloud. He's a bit distracted that an undead Death Eater just took a killing curse for him and trying to focus on the third wizard that's joined their duel. The conditions are excellent, but the setting is terrible. They're fighting in a flat, neverending plain in the middle of Wales. There's nothing to use. Nothing to duck behind. Everyone on both sides have paired up with someone proficient in Transfiguration. Thick walls of soil erect from the ground and the tall stalks of grass transform into sharp blades. Spells fly high and wide because there isn't anything to stop them. It's a fucking mess. So Harry's a little too busy to notice the first cloud.

Then a second, larger one appears and he's a bit relieved. Some light rain might be nice. He's starting to sweat and Malfoy knows that wicked curse that transforms rain into poison.

The third and fourth appear soon after- a bit too soon, but Harry's a little too busy to notice- and he thinks, ‚ÄúFuck, a storm's coming through,‚Äù and finishes off the last Death Eater with an overpowered cutting hex. He casts a quick impervious charm on his glasses as he barrels across the empty space, aiming for the flash of a golden arm band in a sea of black.

He shoves himself against Terry Boot's side and immediately shoots off a flurry of curses. The Death Eaters flinch back, raising shields almost reflexively. Some idiot cries out /‚ÄúProtego!‚Äù,/ and Harry's yelling ‚ÄúDuck!‚Äù before he knows what he's doing, and bellows /‚ÄúBOMBARDA!‚Äù/ in the next breath. The idiot dies in an explosion of sludge and blood, even as Terry hacks off another's leg. It's a quick win after that.

‚ÄúWhere's Hermione?‚Äù Terry asks, transfiguring the ground around them into a curved wall. Spells crash against it with dull thuds.

‚ÄúHQ.‚Äù

No more than three of the Order's best are allowed on the same mission. They've learned the hard way that it's more important to win the war than the battle. Hermione isn't a horror on the battlefield like Harry or Kingsley, but she's too valuable in other respects to lose.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he curses. ‚ÄúThen where's Malfoy?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno, I saw a flash of blonde somewhere over there. Why? Look, we've got to get a-‚Äú

‚ÄúSomething's happening, you dolt!‚Äù Terry yells, pointing up at the sky.

Harry finally notices. He notices that is cooler than it was before and substantially darker and the air has taken on a heavy, tingling quality. The clouds are too low and solid and almost /boiling/. His stomach turns, twisting in on itself in dread and horror. Voldemort is here.

Sometimes, when he's desperate, Harry misses the Horcrux. It was awfully convenient at times, no matter what Hermione says. Like now, for example. It would have been very bloody convenient to know that Voldemort had decided to show up.

He casts a sonorous on his Terry's throat. It won't do for Voldemort to know that Harry is in the vicinity. If he dies again, it'll be for the last time and he isn't quite ready for that to happen.

‚ÄúFALL BACK!‚Äù Terry orders. ‚ÄúPHOENIXES RETREAT! FALL BACK!‚Äù

Others take up the call until it is a strange echo. They retreat in pairs or groups, at least one shielding while the others run. Some cast patronuses to help herd them together. It's hard work and too many drop like marionettes with cut strings, but they finally gather together.

‚ÄúPROTEGO HORRIBLIS!‚Äù Kingsley is roaring. ‚ÄúCAST PROTEGO HORRIBLIS!‚Äù

Harry obeys immediately. Fifty wands raise, all of them pointing at the sky. The shield forms a perfect shimmering dome around their ragged cluster.

He always thought it would be loud when the world ended. Instead, silence reigned. They watch with heaving chest and shaking hands as the clouds begin to boil angrily, a dark crimson sheen rising from their depths.

Ollivander comes to mind. He's been thinking about what he said a lot lately. Theo and Blaise do terrible things, but there's something wondrous about what they do. Each time a corpse rises or someone's skin melts from the bone, Harry is reminded of Ollivander's wise voice nearly whispering, /Terrible, yes, but great./

But the horrible things that Theo and Blaise do is nothing compared to this. They are nothing compared to Voldemort. There is a sort of beauty in the destruction he reaps.

Harry's throat goes dry. His heart beats hard enough to jar his teeth. A warm hand clutches at his own. Harry squeezes back.

/'I'm not alone this time,'/ he thinks, even as the first ball of fire rains down from the eerie clouds. /‚ÄòI'm not dying alone again.'/

**** I pulled it out of thin air. That being said "fire raining down" is not an uncommon description of bombs and volcanos.

The silence reigned was a fun little pun but I liked the idea because people always expect disaster to be loud and chaotic. But usually, at the moment of impact everything is shocked quiet.

** Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.
