Just sick of wizards being awe struck by moon landing


** I love this as a prompt, a crack fic where magic is so hax, that most wizards ignore it cause it's already been done or there is no real point.

Hermione: "Atlantis is real!" Ron: Yeah where do you think merpeople come from? No body goes there really, everything is underwater and it's not like we would buy anything they have that we already don't. Plus what are you to talk about, fish?

Hermione: "Heaven and hell are real!" Ron: Um yeah but no one really likes visiting there anymore you know, angels are all wishy washy, and your never sure what they are talking about, kinda like centaurs, plus there are those flaming ring ones covered in eyes, it's bloody creepy. And demons are right jokers like Fred and George, but you can never tell if thier talk about flaying the flesh off your skeleton and consuming you soul is flirting or not. Old Aunt Muriel got propositioned by a helllord one time, he gave her a puzzle box and told here he'd tear her soul apart.

Hermione: "King Arthur is still alive!" Ron: Oh yeah, Merlin made him and his court immortal, he is still king of Camelot and all that, it's all the way down Diagon Alley, on the second left exit of Essential Alley. We took Ginny there once when she was a kid, they have that game, what's it called, josting?- anyways it pretty boring otherwise, all they do is hold weekly feasts, and the knights sometime duel each other. They never use magic though, honestly it's not as exciting as it sounds.

** "Merlin wasn't the only one, either. I read up on it once - was looking whether I could be the first wizard in space, but it's not even that impressive a feat."

Hermione was dumbstruck. Harry couldn't tell whether it was because she'd honestly forgotten just how much of a cheat magic was, or because Ron admitted to having read something.

"/Not that impressive?/" Hermione shouted. Before she could continue her rant, however, Ron continued.

"Well, yeah. All it really takes is three spells - Bubble-Head charm, Cooling Charm, Apparating. One of the spells isn't even O.W.L. level, all three of them are a mandatory part of the curriculum - just have to do it at night so you can see the spot on the moon you want to Apparate to."

Ron took a breath, and continued. "The invention of the telescope made it loads easier - Merlin splinched himself the first time."

That, in turn, took the wind out of Hermione's sails. Harry privately thought he saw the recognition in Hermione's eyes, that she'd had another "There's no wood" moment.

"But if it's that easy, why don't more wizards do it?" Hermione continued, her momentary outrage replaced by the genuine interest with which the conversation had started.

"Well, there's not really much that's interesting about it, magic-wise, other than the fact that magic considers it to always be a full moon on there - and really, not many werewolves want to /permanently/ be a wolf." Ron supplied. "Those that do, you're usually better off forgetting the Bubble-Head Charm on them."

"Ron, that's horrible." Harry supplied. He could just picture Remus suffocating up there. The way he did die was bad enough - the Battle of Hogwarts wasn't pretty, and in fact was still a sore spot for the entire Wizarding World.

"Well, it's true - I'm not exactly talking about the nice ones, like Moony. Only Fenrir Greyback would be perfectly happy just staying as a wolf, and I can personally attest to the fact that he deserved much worse than what we did to him back at Hogwarts."

"Still not very nice. At least everyone at the Battle died quickly." Harry opined.

Conversation continued for a while, after that - onto other experiments Hermione wanted to try, now that she'd officially graduated Hogwarts. Going to the moon just wasn't one of them, anymore.

--------------

Hermione strikes me as a researcher-type, so I turned the prompt into a snippet of conversation about her going to the moon as an experiment. It started off slightly bash-y, but I think I've turned it back around.

EDIT: Moon hot. Vacuum of space cold. Edited (for reference, I initially stated he'd need a Warming Charm).

**** There's quite a few fics that pretty much do exactly that as a "solution" to the werewolf problem. My headcanon is that there's paperwork, fees and such attached to Apparating across national borders legally, and the magical world has some absolutely horrible punishments for doing it /il/legally.

Also the only 2 werewolves in canon either have a very good reason to stay in Britain (Remus, who gets roped into being a teacher and stays on Order business) or just plain don't give a toss (Fenrir Greyback). There's nothing really stopping the other explanation, which would be "yep, that's one way they actually do it."

Other options: Svalbard, Norway has pretty much continuous sunlight between April and August - that'll save you a few trips, and it's a popular enough holiday destination that you can just claim to be doing the touristy thing. The North and South Poles have half a year of continuous sunlight each, plus the benefit of there being no-one around for miles (so no danger of breaking the Statute of Secrecy, and also most likely no paperwork/fees).

Like they could skip one full moon if they really needed to but the next time they transformed it would last longer or they'd have even less control. And if they tried to do it every month it would keep building up to the point where it affects their day to day behaviour and eventually they'd transform on a night close to full moon.

But yeah that's just my theory because otherwise you're totally right, there's just too many travel options in the magical world if all you have to do is avoid the moon one day a month.

**** The Bubble-Head charm keeps the bubble around someone's head at breathable pressure, as per "Cedric and Fleur used it to swim in what's stated to be a pretty deep lake". It's fair to reason that it'll work for exceptionally /low/ pressure as well, given magic seems to work on a conceptual level rather than "specifically have this effect".

Radiation could /become/ a problem eventually, but it's nowhere near instant. At 60 microsieverts an hour ([[https://www.space.com/moon-radiation-dose-for-astronauts-measured][Source]]), it'd take about 2 years to violate modern guidelines for lifetime exposure - plenty of time to work with there.

We can assume that one of the problems, namely the formation of "air bubbles" in places you don't want them due to de-pressurization (decompression sickness/ebullism), doesn't pose as much of a problem for wizards, based on the fact that Harry swam out of the Black Lake the way he did with no adverse effect.\\
In real-life, even scuba diving in a relatively shallow lake, you have to ascend pretty carefully or suffer from some heavy decompression sickness. While that wouldn't be the cause-of-death on the moon, it is part of why it happens so quickly.

** "What!?" Hermione looked genuinely flabbergasted, Ron took another bite of his sandwich.

"Merlin, did what?" Harry couldn't help himself.

Ron swallowed and continued, "He went to the Moon, had to fight off something that was there, at least that's how the tale goes, he enchanted King Arthur's ship." He frowned at Hermione's still surprised expression." It's not easy I reckon, Dad says most Wizards don't bother, though I heard Bill say the ones over in Asia like going there, good for doing some kinds of magic."

"Merlin went to the Moon?" Hermione said faintly, her whole worldview changing, "hundreds of years ago."

Ron, looked at Harry, who looked to be frowning at his juice before turning to Hermione, "You read so much, have you never read about Merlin? He did lots of stuff like that, even went to Mars once."

Hermione paled "Mars..."

At this moment Neville appeared, looking at Hermione with concern, before turning to Harry and Ron, "What happened to her?"

Ron shrugged, "I just told her how Merlin went to the Moon and Mars."

Neville nodded with confusion, before looking at her, "Haven't you read about that Hermione?"

Hermione seemed ashamed for a moment before shaking her head, "I saw some references but I thought..."

Nevile sat beside them, "Well, Gran says it's true, we have a book home about it, Merlin wasn't the first though, Wizards and Witches have been traveling to space from Ancient Times, but she said they had to gradually stop since the Muggles started building better telescopes."

Hermione nodded still a bit dazed, "They must have recorded so much..." she would never diminish the accomplishments made by the Muggles, since they managed to do great things with fewer resources and without magic.

"See, told you, guess they don't do that anymore because the Muggles have lots of telescopes now." Ron concluded.

Neville seemed to frown before saying, "Yeah, I guess people just lost interested, probably had to with all the warnings and stuff that happened with a few of the Wizards who went to farther places in our Solar System.

"Warnings? What happened."

Ron shrugged, "Some came back raving mad, saying lots of stuff about not going back there, Dad said it was all the time inside a boat, makes one barmy."

Neville nodded, "The book says it's best to not go too far, not safe."

Hermione turned to him and asked, "Why?"

Neville shrugged, "They never said why, guess it's the distance."

Hermione frowned, "Probably."

*** My headcannon: magic doesn't break the law of physics, its just that muggle physics doesn't consider it as a force as they don't recognise it and construct experiments that aren't influenced by magic because of that. Because of that, experimentally discovering magic is like trying to figure out the gravitational acceleration but you're not allowed to lift the ball from the ground. You can include magic in physical experiments, of course, and come to the same conclusion when using Arithmetic formulae but not using spells in the formula ('Set the magic to zero') . But that's as pointless as using the maths for relativity for construction of houses when Newtonian physics suffices.

And anything magical looks like hacks because converting magic to kinetic energy (for instance) yields a lot of it, similar how nuclear fission generates a lot of energy because of E=mc^{2.}

***** Chemistry and its adjacent physics is a fun one. We know the fundamental micro reasons for many things, we know macro level observations and patterns, we often can't connect the two in a way that we can use the fundamentals to predict macro data.

An example: everyone learns what a refractive index is in high school. We know the physics behind why different materials bend light differently. And yet there's not a model that you can apply to a new substance that's accurate enough that you can calculate its refractive index. Instead, you have to actually measure it to know. (that's last I heard, at least).

** The fundamental issue on those topics is that Canon -- that is, the factual basis, notions of what is true, correct and possible -- in itself is not neutral. On the scale of "wizardwank" to "mugglewank", Canon is far into "wizardwank" territory. Just about any bar you can think of, Canon clears it.

This is not actually an issue on surface, but some people end up tying moral judgements to it. So if one says, "wizards are superior", because they can do anything Muggles can, and also things the Muggles can't -- a position which is an accurate reading of Canon -- a number of people immediately jump on deriving moral worth from that, which is entirely not the meaning, and in fact the literal /opposite/ point Canon makes, where your moral worth is /not/ your abilities, but your choices.

All of which makes Hermione (i.e., the author) harping about ballpoint pens and moon landings and whatever else is supposed to denote Muggle superiority rather ironic, because that's far closer to Voldemort's philosophy than Dumbledore's -- power and ability is relevant.

Ultimately, and taking into account the thoughtful argument that I didn't consider before today, of how such stories can be written by marginalised groups trying to project a sense of agency onto a character in a similar situation to theirs, I can only conclude that HP is not the ideal fandom for this. The world just doesn't lend itself to it, because it is far more tilted (factually so, not simply due to bias) against Muggles and Muggleborns than the real world ever could be.

Of course, that is what AUs are for. But you are definitely starting to change very fundamental aspects of the series if you tackle that, and should certainly be aware of that.

  The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up his nose, moved his torch closer to the book and read:

  /Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognising it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises./

I completely respect your reading of this bizarre little stock chapter though and you raise a lot of good points. I see how badfic has the potential to turn 'enlightened' muggleborns into white saviors without thinking.

"Mugglewank" is usually, at least in my experience, considered to be stuff like "hurr durr my old revolver/sniper rifle/minigun beats your Shield Charm", or deriding the Wizarding World for not having modern Muggle science/clothing/military doctrine/etc.

Edited to add:

There is of course also "Wizardwank" which usually consists of all kinds of sick explanations to justify the enslavement of house elves, the supremacy of Purebloods, the bigotry against non-humans etc.

But an opposition to "Mugglewank" does not equal "Wizardwank" and vice versa. At least in my experience this sub is generally predisposed against /both/ of them, but of course there are also people here who like either or both.

But my experience on that matter might be biased, I tend to just not click on threads about shit I don't like and then quickly forget that they exist at all...

Because that is the thing, isn't it: The sum total of social norms, of habits, behaviour, appearance, values, define some sort of standard against which everyone is measured. It's a very vague standard with a lot of leeway, but at a certain point, there is a noticeable difference between you and others, and the "noticeable" part means people are aware of it. In a certain sense, it's the difference between a tourist and a resident. Are you /visiting/, or do you /belong/?

What I was trying to ponder was the caveat: You can be and do whatever you like /provided you accept the treatment you will receive afterwards/. Isn't that the core issue in the contemporary debate of how marginal groups ought to be treated?

In terms of HP: If a hypothetical Muggleborn Hermione was outspoken and obviously Muggle-ish (wearing Muggle clothes, using electricity, writing with ballpoint pens, etc. pp., you get what I mean), /and/ she was fine with being regarded by general public opinion as, say, "not a real witch", there would hardly be any conflict. Everyone would live their lives in parallel, without any further issue.

The *conflict* arises out of the combination of these two claims:

1) I am very noticeably behaving in and expressing different (i.e., Muggle-ish) ways

2) I am one of you (i.e., a witch).

And the /reason/ this creates a conflict is that the second one unilaterally redefines a term that affects *everyone*: Namely, here, what a "witch" is.

This goes back to my earlier comment of how this can't be solved except through (slow) change and dialogue. Eventually, the definition of "witch" will change, and the element you brought into the culture becomes a part of it. But until then, just as you have no obligation to change to fit in, everyone else has no obligation to accept you as part of them if you don't.

Because /just because/ someone is from a marginalised group, does not make their opinion right oven more relevant by default, even -- or perhaps especially? -- when it pertains to /them/, not when it also makes demands on everyone else. Such opinions -- or derived moral /oughts/ -- can only be agreed on collectively, or not at all. Which favours the status quo, granted, but as there is all the evidence in the world that societies can and do change their collective opinion, insisting on change /'right now'/ based on /'objective superiority'/ is off-putting and impudent.

Or, at least that is one way to see it. And the best stories contrast exactly those POVs, instead of presenting inane bashing or simplistic fix-its. I suppose feeling a need to "prove" something and projecting that onto the characters is a valid reason to write, but it also makes for a shit story in literary terms.

But while your average Joe Wizard might think, "Wow, our society is so much more advanced then those backwards muggles!" your average werewolf living in poverty for having a chronic illness might be thinking "What the fuck are you talking about?" and your average house elf is being /literally/ enslaved, and your local muggleborn student might be thinking "Wow what the fuck I am being called slurs by rich kids."

***** I didn't say anything about awareness /or/ rights, I talked about whether the opinion derived from such awareness is a priori more than just another opinion. Naturally, marginalised groups will have very different views on things than groups that aren't. The solution, then, is to get into a dialogue, not declaring one opinion superior before even having that dialogue.

Incidentally, this is what I meant, and why all those Muggle-FixIts story are terrible, as stories: The problem is not that (say) Hermione comes in and declares wizards are backwards and need to change. That's a very interesting kind of character, and potentially a great plot. The problem is that there is no counterpoint, as would happen IRL, where her opinion is subsequently discarded and ignored, because people are (naturally) unconvinced by the merits of that opinion.

A good story works through the characters, presenting different POVs through them, while the author receds behind them. A /bad/ story whacks the reader over the head with the author's opinion or self-inserts or projections (think, say, Atlas Shrugged, for a typical example).

******** I don't think he has a reason to in this case, and anyway, Taure posted another quote that corroborates it.\\
Also, the bus appears and disappears from their sight soon afterwards, but if you had magical house visible 24h on it would be a different situation.

********* Taure's quote was iffy evidence at best. Any sane person would think they just lost their keys instead of thinking it was enchanted to shrink. It's just like how most muggleborns (and Harry) ignore their pre-Hogwarts magic.

The bus blasts objects away, so even if Muggles only see the Knight Bus for a second or so, they should still see the effects of it, right? They probably just ignore it and rationalize it away afterwards.

**** Is this really such a dominant view here? I have of course seen some people say shit like that, and have seen such fics recommended, but it never seemed to me like it is more than a (maybe slightly loud) minority.

***** Roughly half on each side guessing from experience and not always concentrating all the points, generally if someone is arguing that magic is superior to muggle technology (and I personally think it is) they keep it petty constantly, you can't say that magic is infinitely better and then turn around and say that it can't do half the things that muggle technology can.

The impression that there is such a widespread cognitive dissonance mostly comes because of both the fact that prompts are right alongside discussions and sometimes there is some bleeding of one over the other (and in prompts even if it is something that doesn't fit into your HC and theories about magic you still can make a prompt on it, there is no reason someone should keep themselves from speaking about an idea they find interesting just because it doesn't fit with other ideas they /also/ find interesting). And also because many (myself included) don't even bother looking at the name of the user unless it is something that /really/ caught our attention and generally not in a good way, so there is rarely someone keeping track of what specific people posted unless you go look at their profile, plus in a discussion it is not rare at all to start a discussion with someone and not notice when someone else takes up the other person's side of the discussion.

Then there is the fact that in HP in particular the limits of magic and how certain spells/enchantments/whatever work are not really that well defined which causes many discussions about if magic could or not do something and about if certain things we see through the series fit into certain real world categories, a prime example are house-elves, cannon really never went too deep into /why/ they serve families and from there we as a whole extrapolated many realms of possible theories ranging from brainwashing, slavery and magical compulsion to they just like it (blue/orange morality) they get magic from the Wizards and that they are essentially a biological robot, meaning that they work because Wizards have literally created them from base materials with this programming for a lack of better terms, and then when the discussion goes there it is quite common for us to become protective of our head-cannons, no one likes having their ideas dissed as stupid, even less so in a setting where we just don't have enough of a framework to be able to accurately say whatever is or not possible.

/Then/ there are those who make generalizations like “but Wizards are idiots” and “but muggles have no discrimination at all” and that frequently pisses the other side of the argument off real bad, it is really annoying to be defending the capacity of a society only to be dismissed because they supposedly are not smart enough as if this society was formed either by a single entity or by copies of said entity instead of a great variety of individuals.

*** Thank you for writing this. It explains a lot of the more troubling differences I've noticed between this and other fanfic communities. I'm used to fanfic communities being safe havens for everyone, so I had no idea the demographics were skewed so much in this sub compared to others. It also explains some of the wild ass responses you got on this thread. :-(

**** I'd like to second your thank you. Especially in this past year, it's started to seriously disturb me how many direct, straight lines can be drawn f/ common and widespread tropes in the HP fandom to harmful, real-life rhetoric. Funnily enough, my experiences w/ other fanfic communities are quite different. Most of the other fandoms I follow are animé fandoms, so I'm well-accustomed to having to inure myself to sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, &c both f/ my fellow fans and f/ the original media itself (obvious disclaimer that this is not a blanket statement condemning all animé and their fandoms), though I am trying to be more vocal in my objections to that kind of stuff in the fandom spaces I frequent.

** Ehh. I like that there are things that muggles do that wizards haven't done and it makes them be in awe. Wizards constantly underestimate muggles so them hearing about things muggles have done that they haven't is cool imo
