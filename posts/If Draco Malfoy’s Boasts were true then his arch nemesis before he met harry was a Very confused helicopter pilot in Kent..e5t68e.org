** I always thought it was was funny how Draco's rival is Harry. Like, does it not actually register in Draco's brain that Harry's rival is freaking Voldemort?

**** For some reason scenario reminds me of the fic where Draco won a quidditch game. So Harry went back in time to seduce Narcissa. If Draco is never born, he can't beat Harry in quidditch.

**** Even better - he's just killed Voldemort, and he's /about/ to claim leadership of the Death Eaters to become the next Dark Lord...

Then Harry gives him a handshake, then a hug, thanking him for defeating the man who killed his parents, and apologizing for ever thinking that Malfoy was 'the wrong sort.' Draco realizes he's guaranteed whatever position of power he wants, the Dark side of the Wizarding World is terrified into obedience while the Light side practically worships him, and Harry Potter keeps inviting him over for tea and pickup Quidditch games. Mostly by accident, he has everything he could have ever wanted.

Then he gives one handshake too many and gets carpal tunnel.

  Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.
