Looking for fics that take place over Halloween. It can be at Hogwarts or not as long as it focuses on Harry and co. or other students. I would prefer the plot being werewolves or potentially Voldemort coming back on Hallloween. Can be one shot or multi chapter (but preferably few chapters as possible). Thanks.

*** That Avengers one-shot was a great laugh. ðŸ˜Š /Especially/ as a reader of both fandoms. I'm assuming the 'maniacal man' was Loki?

  Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit.

**** I'll give them both a shot. Though I don't particular know a lot about Naruto or a fan. The Avengers one looks promising though. Thanks. Edit: The Avengers one gave me a good laugh.
