I'm looking for the spells people forget from canon, the fanon spells that make sense, the coherent magical theories, and viable warding logic. I want to see fanon magic that makes sense and fills out canon properly. What d'ya got, fanficfolk?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friends sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. And another dead fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still very good read. And of course it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984][The One He Feared]] - Harry gets Dumbledore's memories up to his duel with Grindewald. The more canon-like in matters of magic from the Taure's fics, sadly it died just after the end of the introductionary arc.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] introduces a few types of magic that are based off of canon (but factor much more heavily into the story).

(For context, PoS starts with the canon+WBWL premise and tries to make sense out of it, like why weren't aurors called during Chamber of Secrets, why are 11-year-olds so well spoken, and why does Snape teach the way he does?)

Normal Magic: In the book normal magic requires a specific wand movement and incantation. As long as you can do both (and can channel enough magic) you can basically do any normal spell (so most of the normal spells we see in canon).

Esoteric magic (which is based off of the canon Patronus charm and Cruciatus curse, just generalized) requires a specific mindset to be able to be used. For example, Riddikurus requires you to feel like laughing. The author expands this category significantly and it actually explains a lot of the canon plot really nicely. Like [[/spoiler][why Horcruxes are so evil compared to normal murder, and why Fiendfyre is so dangerous]].

Wild Magic (which is a huge part of the series) is used by the author to explain a lot of world building. In this series humans used to only be able to do accidental magic (called "wild magic" because it follows no rules), but it was so powerful that Wizengmont was created to "bind magic to spells and potions". Examples include prophecies, and a set of spells so dangerous that they're locked away in something called "the Anthema Codex".

The author also has his characters make extensive use of "natural magic" like Legimency, Occulmency, Metamorphmagic, Luna's ability (called [[/spoiler][Heliopathy]]) and Parseltongue.

I really like the magic system, and it seems much more well organized than Rowling's. As a result, it neatly explains many thing from canon that didn't make sense in the original books.

**** It's the kind of story that sets up all the cliches and then slowly subverts them. But that requires setting them up in the first place. The first half of Year 1 is pretty bad, but the end of Year 1 and all of Year 2 more than make up for it.

For example, Harry's name is Hadrian Remus Potter (which in most fics is a big no-no). The author picks this because it's a huge cliche, but then (later on) explains it with some nice world building:

#+begin_quote
  Harry nodded as he took that in. "You say one of your Marauder friends was someone named Remus? Is that where my middle name came from? I'd assumed that Jim's middle name was Romulus and you called us that because we were twins."

  James laughed. "No, no. Although if my mother had lived to see your birth, she'd have thought twin names like that would have been adorable. No, Remus Lupin was part of our little four-man band. He was both a very good friend and the brains of our quartet. Unfortunately, he suffered from a medical condition that made it impossible for him to serve as godfather to a child and especially one from an Ancient and Noble family, so we decided to honor him instead by naming both you and Jim after him. Your full wizarding name is Hadrian Remus Potter, Hadrian being the wizarding name of your great-great-grandfather who was Minister of Magic around the turn of the century."

  "And Jim?"

  "Iacomus Evan Potter. Iacomus is the Latin equivalent of James and is also the name of another of our prominent ancestors from the 15th century. Evan is a Welsh derivative of John, which was Remus's middle name, and it's also close to Lily's maiden name. Outside of official wizarding legal documents, Jim is just James Evan Potter, Jr. We only added the Junior for some weird social reason that I can't even remember, but it doesn't have the same importance for wizards that it does for Muggles. You would never have had Junior after your name even though you were firstborn because generally it's considered socially improper for a wizard to name his Heir after himself."

  James grimaced in annoyance. "Honestly, the whole thing was kind of a mess. You see, we weren't expecting twins. Neither Lily's family nor mine has a history of them, and while Healers can monitor the health of an unborn child, it's very difficult to magically determine gender or the presence of multiple fetuses. Something to do with how a magical baby, or babies in this case, growing inside a magical mother screws up diagnostic spells

  ... We had to scramble to name you both because our family's Wizengamot charter has a bunch of stupid rules for the naming of Potter children and I didn't want to screw up anyone's inheritance rights by putting the wrong thing down on the official birth certificate. Your middle names could be anything Lily and I agreed on as long as you were named after a person we both considered important, but the first names /had/ to be Latinized names associated with revered Potter ancestors."
#+end_quote

The author does this with a bunch of other cliches (give what looks irrational a rational explanation) but the problem is you don't get these nice little "world building moments" until Year 2 (the quote above it from the middle of Year 2, long after the reader learns Harry's full name). I think it's worth it, but know that it does turn some people off (to have to slog through 1/4-1/2 of the current story to get to the good parts).

****** I mean if you don't care about spoilers,

James sent Harry to the Dursleys because [[/spoiler][one of his ancestors received a prophecy spelling that once two Potters who were supposed to be one were born (and one received the title of Prince of Slytherin), it would spell the end of the world.]]

The reason the author did this is likely because [[/spoiler][they needed a way to justify sending Harry away and acting like they didn't love him. Basically for the entire first book James is having a mental breakdown as the son who he thought was a squib for a decade is prophesized to basically end the world. (In this series prophecies are elaborated on much much more, and the magic behind them is explored a decent amount.)]]

The author also uses this to handily explain why [[/spoiler][the Potters would hate Slytherin so much. To be honest, it makes sense for Sirius (whose parents abused him; elaborated on more as to why in the fic), to hate Slytherin, but why James? Wouldn't some Potter eventually end up in Slytherin? Well, if you were Charlius Potter and you were told the day a Potter is in Slytherin it'll spell the end, then wouldn't you make it so your kids hated Slytherin with a passion, so they'd never go there? Fast forward a few generations and you get James basically bullying Snape and holding an irrational fear of Slytherin.]]

The reason Lily went along with this is because [[/spoiler][she actually hates the magical world. Her parents were brutally murdered the day she married James (to send a message to uppity mudbloods trying to marry out of their proper place in the social order). There's discrimination left and right against Muggleborns (which is talked about more in the fic), and most wizards hate anything Muggle. Like James, her husband, thinks her Chemistry textbooks are a "fun pastime", when it's her favorite subject.]]

Also, after Harry was attacked by Voldermort [[/spoiler][it appeared that the event drained him of his magic. He passed all tests Dumbledore did on him and Jim and Dumbledore himself thought Harry was a squib. Lily decided she would rather have a son survive in the Muggle world than risk staying the Wizarding world and being used against Jim or living a miserable life. So she decides to send Harry away out of concern for him.]]

Note that the fic is only at the beginning of the 3rd year right now. The prologue shows them hating each other but as of now [[/spoiler][they're on relatively good terms. Jim and Harry are actually on good terms, Harry and Lily talk to each other, and James clearly loves Harry even though he tries to get over his ingrained bias against Slytherin.]].

I'm the kinda of person that likes seeing logical explanations, and (given the premise of WBWL), this seemed like a logical explanation that doesn't make everyone look foolish. The issue is that to "fix" the series, a lot of these explanations exist (which I can see how you might feel they weight down the story).

I can't think of any other HP spell that creates a visual illusion in that manner. Fanon loves to talk about "glamours" and "illusions" but in canon almost every time wizards want to change something's appearance they use transfiguration to alter its actual physical composition.

So my preference would be for "tempus" to conjure a pocket-watch.

** I have a theory about house-elf magic, actually:

What if the use of magic (or even the presence of wizards/witches) leaves a certain form of residue, or perhaps ambient magic, and house-elves are able to make use of that magic? That's why they decided to bond with magical families, especially households with several adult wizards/witches, so that they would have an ample and constant source of ambient magic. The bond also helps them to control their innate magic, which tends to be raw and difficult to use for more complicated tasks. Ambient magic, on the other hand, is much easier for the house-elves to use. The source of the house-elves bonds with wizards is actually a desire to trade service for power and control. Since house-elves have some different needs and wants from humans, they do not consider it a bad trade /except/ when the members of the human household become abusive.

Thus Dobby is able to be a free elf and still have his powers due to working at Hogwarts, which obviously has more than enough ambient magic to go around. His friendship with Harry also functions as something similar to a bond. On the other hand, Kreacher was left alone in Grimmauld Place with no humans in the house, which should usually mean death for normal house-elves since even the ambient magic will run out or run low eventually, but there was something else that produced magical energy - the locket Horcrux. We all know how strong the negative effects of the Horcrux can be, so it's no surprise that Kreacher ended up in a really bad state after so many years of being exposed to toxic magical residue.

I think it's a fairly reasonable theory overall? /shrug

** Here's an idea, which isn't really a magical theory but rather an observation+extrapolation based on canon details:

Harry seems to have a knack for picking up spells after having seen them only once. He was able to perfectly cast Episkey after Tonks used it on him once, and there was no mention of him practising the spell. He also learnt other spells like Expelliarmus, Stupefy, Petrificus Totalus, Impedimenta, etc rather quickly, some of which appear to have been learnt after having seen the spell only once as well. However, he isn't described as learning spells very quickly in class, unlike Hermione who's usually the first to learn a new spell in Charms and Transfiguration.

This might just be the author's conservation of detail, but it can also be interpreted as an actual skill Harry has - kind of like Sharingan from Narutoverse, without the actual eyes of course. It's also possible that Harry has a knack for combat-related spells, and can pick them up pretty much instantly. That would make the most sense, since he initially had trouble with Accio, but got the gist of Expecto Patronum fairly fast and picked up Expelliarmus/Stupefy/etc pretty much instantly. Minor healing spells like Episkey could also be seen as combat-related, since if he needs to be healed he obviously needs to be in some form of combat in the first place (unless he walked into a wall).

tl;dr Harry has pseudo-Sharingan for certain spells.
