** The thing is not staying out of canon, but out of character. Then, using over used tropes.

I don't thing people would complain of fanfics where Daphne has more personality than "Ice Queen" and where she is not involved with a marriage contract and making everyone start calling each other Lords and Ladies.

** I have pretty much never seen a story get considerable hate just because it drifted away from canon. Also the sentence

#+begin_quote
  Like for example Harry/Daphne ships get some hate because Daphne may as well be an oc
#+end_quote

doesn't make sense as an example in this argument. If a fic with Harry/Daphne pairing gets hate, I don't think it's because practically OC character is somehow OOC

*** Sorry, as I said I kinda jumbled through the second half of the post because I forgot what I was trying to say exactly. As for Harry/Daphne I primarily used that as the example because because of the few posts I'd read the past week, hate might've been too strong a word. I guess the point I was trying to make is its fanfiction what does it matter if someone strays too far from canon. I'm not the best at typing out what I'm trying to say and I want to avoid the whole “if you don't like it don't read it” argument.

** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  I like when fan fiction steps away from canon especially canon that I hate.
#+end_quote

This sub is pretty likeminded, so while most might like deviation from the canon they hate, they do enjoy a lot of what makes up canon if the survey is anything to go by. We all dislike different things about canon and, as Hellstrike said, we all have different rules from can and can't be broken in fan fiction.

Daphne is interesting. I think most here like Daphne, which has a lot to do with the fact that she's usually written as anywhere from nice to Hermione to up her ass. I've never seen HP/DG where Hermione is against it because of the bits of info JKR gave us.

** Why on earth is Daphne an OC? She's one of the main characters in canon, up there with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

*** I didn't say she was canon, I haven't read anything from things like pottermore and I don't remember her being mentioned more than once in the books but it has been a while since I read them.

**** I admit that it can be hard on a first read to see how Daphne and Harry's relationship develops over the seven books. It took me quite a few detailed re-reads to spot their relationship. Still though, you can really see how daphne is Harry's one true love.

****** Daphne was mentioned a whopping one time. In Order of the Phoenix when she gets called with Hermione for the OWLs. So clearly suuuuper important. Plus, she's Draco Malfoy's sister-in-law, which means she's Scorpius' aunt, which means she could be Scorbus' aunt!

******* Clearly I need to read the books again. I feel so stupid for missing such an obvious major character. Thank you.

*** She's a canon character who's *effectively* an OC, because there's literally nothing about her in canon except her name. She can be tall or short, blonde or brunette, green- or blue-eyed, smart or ditzy... anything! So you can avoid the dreaded OC tag and still make her anything you want.
