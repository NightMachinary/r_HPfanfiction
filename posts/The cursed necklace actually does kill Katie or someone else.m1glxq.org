** Would have been terrible, but Dumbledore's passivity and his policy of "wait and see" would /have/ to end. (Or maybe it wouldn't end even then, Rosmerta was cursed with an Unforgivable and Draco was still free to give Death Eaters access to the school.)

I think I would really like this story. Curious to see what could have happened.

*** You made me check for it and I realized I didn't have it saved either. The fic is For the Lack of a Beazor and it is excellent.
