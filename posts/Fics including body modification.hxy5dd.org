I just got really nostalgic when I remembered all those fics which have a section where Harry or Voldemort or any other character does some form of ritual or multiple rituals to enhance their body. If any of you would be kind enough to recommend fics like that I'd be very happy. Just gotta scratch that itch.

The fics themselves don't need to be centred around the topic of Body modification or even have it be a big part. An example of a fic which has body modification as a big part would be the art of self fashioning.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

** This series has bloodmagic rituals that are used to enhance the body/mind etc. It's really interesting, and it introduces a lot of other interesting aspects of magic.

*** God I love(d) this series. I hate that it was never completed. I check back from time to time in case the author ever decided to finish it.

Still very worth the read and there are 2 complete stories.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
