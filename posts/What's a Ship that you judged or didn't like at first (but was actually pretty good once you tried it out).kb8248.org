** Fred/Hermione but now all I've been reading for the past week are Fred/Hermione fics. Before I started reading these FF I didn't think they'd be a match because in canon Hermione was always scolding Fred, and I didn't think he would like her in that way. Now it's amusing when the twins help her indulge her rulebreaking/troublemaking side and you see him develop feelings/be vulnerable.

The fics are super fun to read.

**** Oh is it that Arithmancer one? Everyone talks about it.

Okay, this one is a ton of fun/hilarious. It may spoil you for all Fremoine ones though. It's not super long (sadly) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2074348/1/Just-a-Harmless-Joke]]

And the following two are quite similar but quite good, a large emphasis on the events of book 4, both closeish to canon. Both are slow burns. I like the one by Fairylightsinthenight better, think it's more of a realistic portrayal of teenage feelings and just good all-around characterization of Hermione. Plus Fred is more believable. It's long but unfinished but the author said she'll update by Christmas:

Love this one:

Fairylightsinthenight "What if" [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18268010/chapters/43229228]]

This is good too, you see Fred's POV more. Sadly this is also unfinished.

  Being soulmates means to have a special bond, one that can be a deep, true love or a pure, strong friendship. Hermione Granger is eleven when she first hears about soulmates. She is fourteen when she falls in love head over heels. And she is fifteen when she discovers who her soulmate is and that heartbreak is awaiting her. Slow, slow burn

People /love/ Slytherin house in fanfiction, and the only Slytherin girls in Harry's year we know are Pansy, Millicent, and Daphne. Since Pansy and Millicent are both not conventionally attractive (Pansy is pug-nosed and Millicent is burly) and in the Inquisitorial Squad, the only Slytherin girl left is Daphne, who we know nothing about besides from Rowling's interviews. It's basically Drarry (since Fanon Draco is fundamentally an OC) for people who dislike slash.

*** As someone who used to like that ship exclusively, and liked the much-derided fics which I don't need to mention, I can understand why many people don't like it.

Part of it is the bashing which is off-putting (unless you are bashing JKR; go for it in that case). The other is how they are the perfect standards which makes them seem abnormal outliers. Difficult to connect with.

Harry/Daphne is inexplicable, really.

** My top 3 pairs for this are:

Harry P. / Amelia Bones @ MarauderEra, I didn't get this one at first because in my mind shes just a copy clone of a more aggressive Susan Bones. There is a story where he travels to the past after his trial and falls in love with Amelia and then it goes back to the present and they still fall in love with the age difference and he loves her even though shes older. I've read a few interesting stories about this pair and now I wish there were more.

Harry P. / Lavender Brown, I hated the won-won stuff so I figured it would be some stupid no sense making puppy love pair but after reading a few Post-Hogwarts and 5th year + where she has PTSD after the war its a really good couple in my mind now.

Harry P. / O.C., Muggle or Magical these stories are super hit or miss. Harry finding love on privet drive with a muggle or abuse/comfort fics where he gets adopted by another magic family and falls in love with their daughter (example Daphne, Susan) or sent to another school and falls in love with a witch from a dark family. The one that really made me accept this as it could be cannon is the one where he decides to switch schools and James/Lilly are alive with a brother and sister and ends up at durmstrang to learn more magic because he didn't make a single friend and meets a dark witch Calypso Rosier. Shes manipulative, spys for her grandfather, seduces him with mixed intentions, she teaches him dark magic and they end up partners every year where they try to do year projects which is the best part of this story imo.
