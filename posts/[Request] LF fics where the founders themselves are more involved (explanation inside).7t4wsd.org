Hey there! I am looking for a fic where the founders themselves are more involved instead of only being the original lords of the houses Harry inherit. for example, I read a fic that revealed that Harry was the son of Godric Gryffindor and Lily Potter once and Godric himself as a ghost was a part of the fic. My request is that the fics will not involve slash as well as a backward time-travel unless it's done really good but forward time-travel (a founder arriving at Harry's time) is fine. Harry can also be a founders reincarnation like in Darth Marrs "Harry Potter and the Four Founders" story which done this in a very good way. I would also really appreciate a Harry x Rowena or Harry x Helena as well as Harry x Helga (of course they will time-travel into his time) It can also be a story where Harry and 3 others are the founders' reincarnation and they regain their lost memories of that time.


** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance) is a very good ongoing story where Hermione is the reincarnation of Salazar Slytherin --- and he/she is /not happy/ about what Voldemort has done with his/her legacy.

**** Is it good? Because the idea of Hermione being Slytherin's reincarnation is probably the most crack I have seen in a Harry Potter fic. If you could recommend more fics that focus on Harry and one of the founders and not only Slytherin I will greatly appreciate it.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.

** Some good backwards travel storys are from teddylonglong (most of the time with overly sick Harry (it's on fanfiction.net))

Relatively good Godric is a Ghost story "Scion of Gryffindor" Crys.fanficauthors.net/scion_of_gryffindor/1_meet_godric

There are a few others I read and forgot the name of them. If I remember them I'll add to it.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

**** I never read this fic but I do have a question. Is there a particular reason it says "Harry Dursley"? I mean is Harry in a good relationship with the Dursleys here? 'Cause I'm not a fan of those tbh lol.
