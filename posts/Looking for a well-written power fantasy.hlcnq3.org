I admit that I enjoy the BAMF!Harry and SUPER!Harry subgenre, but a lot of them are really badly written, have Harry with a dozen girls, and have no concept of plot or conflict. Can anyone recommend me well-written ff where Harry is powerful but not OP and actually has to deal with problems?

  English story; girl!Harry. It had been four years since Malfoy had changed her... four years since the War had ended. It was time for her to come back.
