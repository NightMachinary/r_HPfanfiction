I'm writing to thank everyone here, especially mods & subscribers, for your collective mentality of gracious sharing, support, wisdom and exceptional critical thinking abilities. Since the start of my Reddit membership (fairly recently), I have read the content of this sub, and quite a few of your recs, and I've enjoyed the journey immensely! Honestly, I feel as if I am discovering HP fanfic all over again, and I have benefited from the sub more than words can adequately articulate. Within the past two years, I've become severely disabled, lost my job (read: identity, you know?), relocated. I am taking action to heal, but it's been a nightmare at times. And when I need to get my mind into a completely different place---and avoid or escape reality!---I often turn to you folks and your views & your favorite fics,\\
You've kept me going in many ways; I'm grateful to you all.


** Come to the Discord! Then you can see where the real magic happens! :D

Glad this sub has been able to help you on your journey towards a better you.
