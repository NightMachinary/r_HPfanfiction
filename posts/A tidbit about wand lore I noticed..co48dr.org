** I always took the Elder Wand transferring to Harry as it actively wanting to be his (didn't mean to make it lowkey sound like a thirsty bastard oops): he owns the other two Hallows, isn't a punk bitch (I'll come back to this in a mo'), and, if we take Dumbledore's interpretation of "Master of Death" as the intended canon explanation, then Harry is definitely better suited to it than the only other person actively seeking it out (that we know of).

Depending on how aware and intelligent wands are (Olivander kinda dodges the question when Harry brings it up), the Elder Wand might have been aware that Dumbledore intended to break its power by dying undefeated, and thus jumped at the chance to switch its allegiance to Malfoy in HBP. Since he's kind of a pathetic loser, though, it ditched him at the earliest opportunity, that being when Harry disarmed him. (Then Harry came up with a different plan to break its power and it instantly regretted all of its life choices. Or, alternately, since Harry was, however briefly, the owner of all three Hallows, it deemed him worthy to make that choice and decided to roll with it.)

** The Elder Wand doesn't follow normal loyalty patterns. Remember that the first Peverell brother was killed in his sleep, not dueled or disarmed at all. The Elder Wand only seems to care about who 'defeats' the owner, no matter who the owner is.

Practicing Disarming doesn't matter, because the owner of the wand intended to be Disarmed and there was nothing at stake.

** Now I want a story how a muggle knocks out the owner of the wand in a fistfight or by smashing a chair over his head from behind and snatch the funny stick up that he guy used to point at his friends and then he just disappears into the muggleworld and the elder wand in it as well and used for some stupid mundane thing and really desperate tries to get back to the magical world

*** That kinda makes sense that the Elder wand doesn't want to be loyal to a loser, no matter what fight occured. For this to work I can't believe all wands do that. Maybe just the really power hungry ones.

**** Loyalty changing with a single defeat is probably unique to the Elder Wand because it is very disloyal.

Other wands can change owners but only if the new owner uses it for a long period of time AND if the wand chooses to accept the new owner, just like it chose the original one. The wand of Neville's father never worked that great for Neville, but it worked good enough that nobody noticed something wrong. Harry's replacement wand worked well enough for fights because it accepted him but he still preferred his original one that he was used to.

The Elder Wand immediately chooses whoever defeated its previous owner. Other wands choose wizards in rather mysterious ways which is why finding a good one takes so long.
