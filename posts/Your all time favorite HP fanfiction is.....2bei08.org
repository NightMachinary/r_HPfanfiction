Pick one, just one and tell us about it. I've noticed recently that there are so many fanfictions out there that don't really get a lot of recognition because they are unusual pairings or cross overs. So heres your opportunity to share your fav fiction.

For me it would be The Pureblood Pretense [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

Great story, it's a cross over (borrowed ideas mainly) from Alanna the Lioness. Lily and James are still alive and Tom Riddle is a politician.

Anyway I won't say more, I really recommend reading it.

Tell us your one favorite fiction.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
#+end_quote

The description doesn't do it justice. No main characters, but all of the characters are great: Harry, Neville, Hermione, Luna, Remus, Lily, Sirius and Snape are the "main" ones. Includes the best Luna ever. It'll make you laugh, and you'll get your doses of angst, but most of all, it's plain awesome.

edit: also, best story around 100k words by far... so it won't take too much of your time, but isn't just a short tidbit. Actual plot exists, and is great.

I really love the take on the unspeakables in this. It's well written with some awesome characters and I absolutely love the Harry/Tonks pairing.

This is also the first fic I read without cannon pairings and like the third fic I ever read so it has always stuck with me, no matter what when I start reading it I always have to finish it.

***** Crap I have to agree, mostly, I'm on chapter 35 right now. Harry is a bit crazy for my taste. That acid scene almost made me stop.

On the other hand there is real emotion in chesleyb's half blood. Where renegade mostly relies on characters interrupting each other and slamming things. Hands, fists, wands, brooms. It sometimes, oftentimes reads like a cop movie script. Intentional I'm sure, but does nothing for the Harry Tonks relationship. It renegade it just kind of happens, which isn't realistic, half blood it grows.

On the note of good relationship stories, there is a particular one I can't recall the name of, but its post hogwarts and canon, but harry and hermione have an affair and go to the opera? Or something? If anyone is looking for feels find that story.

The authors have included drawings/photos and handwritten notes personalised to each of the characters. There is a good consideration for canon whilst exploring the Marauder's more in depth.

Year six and Harry needs rescuing by Dumbledore and Snape. The resulting understanding between Harry and Snape is critical to destroying Voldemort and leads to an offer of adoption. Covers year seven and Auror training. Sequel is Revolution.

Neville, Ginny, and the others survive their year under Snape and the Carrows. Very dark at times but always enjoyable. Just wish I could say the same about the sequel.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]]

This is the story that made me change from rather neutral towards Snape (an unpopular opinion about this polarizing figure) towards him being my favorite character. It's slow paced, methodical, well written, book compliant to the letter, and pays ridiculous attention to details. The descriptions of poverty in the 60s UK down to the working class accents are amazing, the reasoning for the actions is amazing, the descriptions of Occlumency and what it actually is are surprisingly profound, and just all around rich in detail.

Hagrid and Dumbledore stand out as amazing, but also: James ends up being a rather decent bloke in seventh year, Lily doesn't just turn her back on Snape and never forgives, Moody is a bastard but actually rather lovable, and even minor characters like Avery and Flitwick are great.

But first and foremost, Snape is a rational man, has his blind spots, but really is just trying to do the best he can in a given situation. No unnecessary angst (though his life is not happy, and there is some of that), no big romance (though there is a touch of that), but this is possibly the greatest character study in fandom history. No character bashing, no shock for the sake of shock, and avoids nearly all the cliches of fan fiction.

If there is one story about Snape you should read, this is it.

Both are very non-canon in terms of the actual story, but they follow the general plot of HBP & DH fairly well. It's been over a year since I read Momentum, but basically it's about a man from another planet coming to help Harry defeat Voldemort.

It sounds dumb. I am terrible at summaries and I'll apologize now. I've stuck with this story for around 4 years now and it's honestly so enticing. The author updates usually once a month, but I always get so excited when I get an email saying there's a new chapter. Please read the first few chapters before you judge!

Harry decides to be neutral, the Order has lost it's flipping mind and dammit Voldemort, you aren't supposed to be that hot! Harry/Voldemort, Lucius/Severus, Fred/Draco/George, Hermoine/OC, mpreg, and lots of baking.

It has like all the ships I like and mpreg. You know how damn hard it is to find a good long mpreg fict? With Harrymort? That actually focuses on the pregnancy and doesn't handwave it? AUGH. Also it's really slice of life. There aren't really any good slice of life ficts in fanfiction which is a shame. Not all ficts have to be action or whatever. Just have characters meet up and do what they do sometimes, please?

Pet peeves about this fict is that it's either unfinished or not marked as complete. I mean, it's 30 chapters long and the last chapter has the birth of the kids so technically it is complete but I wish the author would properly mark it as such or say if she is continuing it. Also there evil!Ginny and that is not good, especially her using Ron as her lackey. I am not a Ginny fan but really I am getting tired of the ficts that call her an evil bint out to capture Harry.

Anyway, all that said, it doesn't get as much love as it should as a great fict with great characterization, smut and more dark fluff than you can shake a stick at.
