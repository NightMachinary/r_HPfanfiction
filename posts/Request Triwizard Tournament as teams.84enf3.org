Are there any fics where the Triwizard Tournament ends up being school teams vs. other school teams?


** I believe this happens in Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) where 13 people are chosen from each school.

*** That summary seems completely wacky yet I just know I'll give it a shot when I get home from work. xD Are there any pairings? Given the length, it'd be nice to know before I got too far in and ended up annoyed by the pairings~

No pairings, as far as I could remember. I think Cedrick was interested in Hermione?

Anyways, romance doesn't have much of a presence in that fic. You should be able to read it without being annoyed :)

  Sequel to Fugitives of Azkaban. Incomplete and probably abandoned. Harry and Sirius have escaped Azkaban and against considerable odds survived, but Harry can't escape his fate. Warning, big parts of this are missing in the middle and it has yet to be complete, but I have not touched it in years so figured I might as well post it as is and maybe get inspired to finish it.
