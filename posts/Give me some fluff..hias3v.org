With all the shit going on in the world right now, I just want to read something nice and fluffy. No wars or death eaters or teachers trying to kill Harry. Romance or not is fine. Preferably not slash.

** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Most of the canon events are still /present/, but are thoroughly defanged to the point of never really being a threat. As a result, 99% of the fic is fluff and silliness.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Aragog was the giant spider in the second Harry Potter book/movie.

** Not fluff, but more really funny:

- linkffn(3124159)
- linkao3(20364421) and its sequel linkao3(20403121); the sequel is slightly more serious (and longer), but both of them are really good

  Marietta Edgecombe and Cho Chang have unleashed an unimaginable catastrophe upon Hogwarts in the middle of the Triwizard Tournament -- freedom of apparition. Showing all the common sense that wizards are known for, the students can't wait to start practising, and those in Gryffindor Tower are no exception.With chaos in the corridors and the teachers stressed to breaking point, Harry Potter is focussed on just one thing -- not looking like an idiot at the upcoming Yule Ball. That requires a date, but as he finds out, with just the right company, sometimes your problems almost solve themselves.If only the teachers could say the same.Imported from SIYE. Written for their Apparition Challenge (2016-1).

  As the mayhem resulting from the lifting of apparition restrictions at Hogwarts settles down, Harry Potter is trying to survive the last few days of term without going mad. His best friends are behaving strangely, Malfoy is being a git, and, most importantly, he has to learn to dance before the Yule Ball. He's not the only one with problems, however, and somewhere amidst all this he needs to help Neville Longbottom in his search for a way to restore Luna Lovegood to normality after her avian apparition aberration.If there's one person he can rely on to keep him sane amidst all this, it's Ginny Weasley, his best friend's little sister... and now, his date for the Ball. Oh yes, her twin brothers are very interested in that development.Harry may be in even more trouble than usual, here.A sequel (and very definitely the finale) to Wondrous Apparition Provided By Magician. You probably need to read that for this to even begin to make sense.No ducks were harmed in the writing of this fic, although one was severely inconvenienced and extremely confused.
