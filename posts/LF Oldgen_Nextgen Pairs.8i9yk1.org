i would like to read more fics with this content. Fics that have Scorpius, James, Albus or Teddy paired with Hermione seems quite tempting, but Ginny would also be good. I know that there is "Finally 17!" with Harry and Rose. But other fics featuring the older female and a younger man or vice versa would be good. Aside from "Finally 17" i dont know any Fic that has Harry or Ron paired with a younger lover. Archiveofyourown comes in mind, when there is a request for smut fics, which are also good, but i want to know if there are some slice-of-life fics.

"Scenes from an Affair" is a Hermione/James Sirius fic annd good written in my eyes, despite the affair thing.

"The Morning After" is Ginny/Scorpius and also good, but again an affair.

"Rise and Shine" is Teddy/Hermione and there she is divorced, so no "barriers" that hold them from "having fun"

"If Wishes were Horses" , "Running Water" and "Making Good on His Words" are also Hermione/James fics. The first Fic shows the Crush and admiration of a Teenager for an older/Mature Woman (although sexually), while the last one pretty good shows what could be....possibly resulting in the 2nd fic.

"Taking Chances" is a cute Hermione/Scorpius Fic, unfortunately a oneshot.

Anyway, i would like to read more slice-of-life Fics with such Pairs. Im not rejected by affairs, but i would prefer that they have no "barriers". I accept both, though. Oh....i would also like fics where a new Villain like Voldemort or something like that appears, but its no requirement.


** Someone linked a fic yesterday that was Hermione/Teddy. It was in an unusual pairings post. I also read a pretty good one shot that was Lavender Brown/Rose. But it was far too short

** You didn't say anything about slash. Yes or no?

I have a James Sirius/Neville somewhere that I can dig up if you are interested.

*** Oh, sorry. I admit, that i kept the slash thing at the back of my mind, as i was writing this Thread, but then it slipped completely. Yes, this is also for Slash.

  Every year Ginny reminds James to give Neville their love, especially since his divorce. But what would happen if seventeen year old James took her words seriously and through unsigned love letters tried to win his Herbology teacher's heart?
