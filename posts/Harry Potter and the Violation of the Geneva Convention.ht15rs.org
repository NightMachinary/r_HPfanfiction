  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening.

** Step one: Take a really big rock. Step two: Enchant it to be a bit harder so it stays in one piece. Step three: Enchant it to be weightless, but only temporarily. Step four: Launch it up. Step five: Wait for the weightlessness to wear off. Step six: Enjoy your asteroid strike.
