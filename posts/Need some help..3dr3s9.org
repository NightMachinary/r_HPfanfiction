So I either just came up with the idea or I read this before, but it's a crossover where the 10th Doctor takes Harry and they meet Daphne and another girl that are supposed to marry Harry. But The Master shows up and The Doctor chases him, and next time he sees Harry and the girls is way into the future when they're near death. Harry comes up with a plan to go back in time to catch The Master before this future happens. Any ideas or did I come up with an idea for a story?
