** So, I read it.

The good

- You kept the PoV on one character (something I have some problems with)
- There Weren't any glaring spelling errors that i noticed
- The plot itself is good ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys][Bad boy]] meets [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] its a classic of the romance genre.\\
- There where /some/ good characterization of Draco (/If there is anything Draco loves more than his wealth, it's complaining./ made me smile it is so Draco)\\

The Bad

- Some OOC for characters, (Narcissa Shouting?)\\
- A lot of telling instead of showing\\
- the whole present tense thing rubs off me\\
- some contradictions\\

  - Draco can't aparate legally but, but can go get wasted in a pub?
  - There are no House Eleves to help him pack but a moment latter there are two helping his mother?
  - Draco mentioning that cruise are based on muggle stuff when he /is/ a pureblood bigot is kinda weird

The story has potential, if done correctly It all would depend on how you write Luna and her interactions with Draco.

I'm assuming this happens before Draco leaves hogwarts, where is Voldemort? if its juts an AU where he didn't exist or something? not important for the plot i guess but just a curiosity of mine.

** So, I gave it a read and it's pretty interesting. The idea of the tough, strong, stubborn man getting together with the light-hearted, fairy-like, but also adorably stubborn female is an interesting and fun pairing.

I will give constructive criticism first, but be warned, I have been known for being a tad...harsh? Yeah, harsh. But in a good way, I promise. So please don't feel like I'm being a bit mean, I'm simply editing the same way I would edit my own work.

- We'll start with the basic: commas. You seem to have the concept of commas down, but there are several places where commas are used that are not needed. Example: "His wand had gone missing, and he suspects his parents have taken..." You do not need the comma before the "and" in this case; it is a complete sentence without the comma. If anything, the comma breaks up the sentence and makes it feel a tad awkward. You do not need to put a comma before "and" every single time you use it, however; you do tend to put in a comma prior to "and" in the majority of your sentences. If you're really not sure, say the sentence out loud. It can really help you determine where a comma needs to go.

- Tense. I agree with another poster in that using the present tense seems a tad awkward. I tend to stray away from using present because, despite the assumptions that it might be easier to work it, it can actually complicate things. I also recommend using past tense; it can be easier to work with, provides a bit more flexbility in sentence structure and comes across as more mature than present tense.

- "Sadly he's always had a fucked up expectation as an only child that obligates him to do everything with his parents" - the structure sounds way off here and the sentence is awkward. I assume that you're trying to tell the reader that Draco's always obliged and expected to spend every moment in his parents, so I recommend something along the lines of: "Unfortunately, as an only child, Draco was stuck with the obligation to do everything with his parents." Or something along those lines.

- "his mother shouts from outside his door" - I wouldn't really classify Narcissa as someone who shouts. I recommend using "calls" instead. Shouting doesn't really seem to suit her personality.

- "Draco yells, his face turning red with frustration"- Draco yelling at this point seems like he's really jumping the gun emotion wise. He seems more frustrated and irritated rather than peeved, so I recommend switching "yells"with "snaps."

- "...luxury cruise like this." she says, crossing..." - Either switch the period with a comma, or capitalize "she". I recommend putting a comma in place of the period and ending the sentence at "indifference". Remove the "and" and have "Draco rolls his eyes...sockets" be a new sentence.

- " "You need to adjust your attitude Draco," - put in a comma after "attitude" or remove the comma following "Draco". It can work either way.

- "Lucius inquiries" - "inquires" not "inquiries". Recommend: remove "inquiries", use "demands" or "asks".

- "Lucius' scowl deepens if at all possible" - remove "if at all possible". Unnecessary.

- "...so hostile, Draco!" his father growls" - remove the exclamation mark and replace with a comma. Lucius is growling, not shouting or making an exclamation.

- "You're coming with us..." - Maybe remove the contraction and keep it as "You are." Lucius has not used a single contraction so far and I feel like he is someone who would rarely, or never, use them. Furthermore, Lucius seems extremely aggressive, even for him. I would remove the entire section where he grabs Draco by the shirt and instead change his voice and stance, making him colder and more condescending. So perhaps try: ".. "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now," Lucius sneered, staring down at his son with a look of cold disappointment. "It is not like you will be doing anything proactive this summer and you clearly lack a sense of direction, so we have provided you with something to do. You are coming with us," his eyes hardened and his lips curled, "and you are going to act as if you enjoy it." ..." Maybe something like that, but I would not have Lucius physically touch Draco. He is a verbally abusive man, not a physically abusive one.

- "Narcissa inhales sharply. // (new paragraph) "Perfect!" His mother claps her hands together..." - Recommendation: "Narcissa inhales sharply and claps her hands together, "Perfect!" Draco flinches with irritation at the sound. "We ought to leave now then so we are not late." " - something along those lines.

- "The ship is impressive" - omit the italics on "is". Unnecessary.

- "cruise" - does not need to be italicized. The first mention was for emphasis, now it's unnecessary.

- "caviar and truffle risotto" - I feel like you just chose the most expensive things you new about and threw them together. It actually sounds quite unappetizing. You could keep it as a "truffle risotto", but I would not include caviar.

- "her voice tainted with annoyance. "You are...all week!" " - Narcissa seems a bit OOC at points. Here, she's immediately irritated. I would remove "her voice tainted with annoyance"and then have her say "Your father will not be pleased if you hide in your room for the entire trip." Narcissa will coddle him, he is her baby and she will try to protect him. I see her being more annoyed that Lucius will get pissed, rather than annoyed at Draco.

- "awkwardly sitting at the foot" - Recommendation: "sitting stiffly at the foot..."

- "giving him a smack on the leg"- much like Lucius, I don't see Narcissa as being a "hitter". I would instead focus on her facial features and posture changing, getting something like: "..."Get up, get out, and do not come back until you have fixed your poor attitude,"she snaps, turning to face him. Her lips are pursed in discontent and her eyes flash with frustration. They stare for a moment before she breathes out and turns away, shoulders sagging just the slightest. Her voice softens with disappointment and guilt, "My biggest regret is how much your father and I have spoiled you throughout the years." ..."

- "Draco's jaw is...wants to go home" - up until this point, Draco has been incredibly childish. Even more so than usual. I think that around here, especially following the scolding he just received from a mother who never once told him he was wrong, may act as a slight reality check. Especially since she states that she regrets spoiling him. Keeping Draco's aggression in there is great, but I would love to see a slight hint that his mother's words have struck a chord and he some guilt over his behaviour.

- Just curious, where are they? You mention the temperatures being cold for summer, but where is the cruise? The reason I'm asking is for being able to imagine the surroundings of the ship.

- "but Merlin knows he feels as though he's a specimen being studied under spectacles" - Recommendation: "but, for Merlin's sake, he felt like his every movement was under constant scrutiny." - something like that.

- "He reluctantly turns around, to find" - omit the comma.

- "..."Oh great," he sneers... terrible vacation" - Recommendation: Reformat as: "He blinks twice in disbelief. "Oh great," he sneers (grumbles) as he turns back to the water, "just my luck." This really is a terrible vacation."

- "why she still here" - "Why she was still here" - forgot to add "was"

- "Draco rolls his eyes and continues, finally staring her square in the face." - switch the period for a comma, as it is a continuing sentence.

All done.

Sorry if it seems like a lot, I do tend to nitpick. In some instances, I put down "Recommendation". What I mean there is that those are adjustments that I recommend, but do not necessarily need to be done. It's more like a "this is what I would do" bit rather than a "DO THIS!!!" edit. You make the final decision on whether you want to implement these recommended changes or not.

Overall, it is interesting and I'm keen to see how Draco and Luna develop their relationship. I'm especially keen to see how you characterize Luna. I do still feel that Draco's coming across as too cranky, so he's becoming a bit more annoying than expected. Narcissa, too, seems to be a tad OOC in that she is softer spoken, calmer with her emotions, and more of an enabler for Draco. Lucius, as well, is more of a cold, condescending man who lets his words and disappointment do more damage rather than physical blows. But, it is a nice start and pushes the characters to meet right off the bat.

I do very much love Luna's bird's nest. I can totally see her doing it and look forward to seeing more of her interesting outfits. I would love to see some nautical ones, like a Captain-based one, or have her dress like a mermaid.

Anyway, I believe that's it. I apologise for making this so darn long and I hope that you understand that the criticism/editing was not meant to offend or demean you in any way or form. I can't wait to see how the fic develops and I hope that I was able to provide some good constructive criticism. :)

** Ho-hum... (Not necessarily in order, or complete.)

- Writing in the present tense is a dangerous decision... I'm not such an expert at English that I can describe why, but I've always preferred to read stories written in the past tense. Still, it's a minor thing.

- I feel as if there should be a lot more contractions in the narration--"it's" for "it is". The narration feels a little stilted with so few of them.

- "Only-child" shouldn't be hyphenated, I rather think.

- "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now.": "Children", "you", and "man" probably should be italicized.

- "You are to treat your mother and *I* with respect" should be "You are to treat your mother and *me* with respect". Both Narcissa and Lucius are the /objects/ of the verb "treat", and so take the /objective/ case. (It'd probably sound better as "me and your mother", actually.) (Ditto for "ruin this wonderful excursion for your mother and *I*".)

- I think it's a little dangerous to call it "beluga caviar"--the average reader will assume that you're talking about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_whale][the beluga whale]] rather than [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_(sturgeon)][the beluga sturgeon,]] and get angry at you for thinking that whales are fish. (That's certainly what /I/ did, before checking [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caviar][the Wikipedia article for caviar!]])

- "*Lay* around and mope in your room" should be "*lie* around and mope in your room". [[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/notorious/lay.htm]["Lay" is transitive, and "lie" is intransitive.]]

- "You are going to act like you enjoy it": Technically, "as if you enjoy it" is more correct. I'd expect /Draco/ to use "like" in his dialogue (and he does so later on--"Like I care"), but I'd expect /Lucius/ to bother to use "as if"--and Lucius is talking, here.

- Missing commas: "Yes father" should be "Yes, father"; "Very good then" should be "Very good, then"; "/is/ impressive though Draco" should be "/is/ impressive, though Draco"; "He mutters and" should be "He mutters, and"; "Well you are" should be "Well, you are"; "Well the captain" should be "Well, the captain"; "Draco it wasn't my intention" should be "Draco, it wasn't my intention"

- "Lucius hands Draco his wand, and the Slytherin fights the urge": They're /both/ Slytherins, though--so this word doesn't help the reader at all! Maybe "young man" would be better?

- ""Perfect," his mother claps" would look better as ""Perfect!" His mother claps"--it smacks more definitely of the sharpness of the sound, and doesn't accidentally imply that Narcissa is saying "Perfect" in some kind of clap-based language.

- "In walks Narcissa without warning, her smile fades into a frown when she sees her son.": /Either/ this should be two sentences (change the comma to a period), /or/ "fades" should be "fading". As it stands, this is a run-on.

- "He's been making a point to wear a scowl for the past few hours.": Should be /either/ "He's been making a point of wearing" /or/ "He's been making it a point to wear", I think.

- "Her voice tainted with annoyance": "Tainted" doesn't sound quite right, here. Maybe "tinged" would be better?

- "Smells like +the+ peppermint"

- ""Yes, mother," *He* says" should be ""Yes, mother," *he* says" (no capitalization) (ditto for ""I'm fine here, thanks," He mutters")

- "Looney": I personally prefer the spelling "loony", but I guess it's debatable.

- "It is you!" should probably be "It /is/ you!" (italicization for emphasis)

- "Summer time" is one word, I rather think.

Overall, though, the English is definitely above-average!

  "Children whine, Draco. You are a man now.": "Children", "you", and "man" probably should be italicized.
#+end_quote

Depends on the intended emphasis.

#+begin_quote
  "You are to treat your mother and I with respect" should be "You are to treat your mother and me with respect". Both Narcissa and Lucius are the objects of the verb "treat", and so take the objective case. (It'd probably sound better as "me and your mother", actually.) (Ditto for "ruin this wonderful excursion for your mother and I".)
#+end_quote

This one's kind of interesting. For one thing, the whole idea that 'and I' must be used for subjects is wrong. No matter how much some people want English to behave like Latin, it doesn't. However, pedants bang on about it so much that hypercorrection has become common, to the point where both 'and I' and 'and me' sound natural to me when used for objects. I kind of love that. It must piss off grammar nazis. tl;dr just because a phrase is used as an object, doesn't mean it'll necessarily take an objective form because language is complicated.

#+begin_quote
  "Lay around and mope in your room" should be "lie around and mope in your room". "Lay" is transitive, and "lie" is intransitive.
#+end_quote

Again, this is trying to impose arbitrary rules on dialogue. As a native English speaker, both sound totally normal.

#+begin_quote
  "You are going to act like you enjoy it": Technically, "as if you enjoy it" is more correct. I'd expect Draco to use "like" in his dialogue (and he does so later on--"Like I care"), but I'd expect Lucius to bother to use "as if"--and Lucius is talking, here.
#+end_quote

"as if" is no more correct than "like". However, I do agree that it sounds too informal for Lucius. I'd put "as though" in for consideration.

#+begin_quote
  ""Perfect," his mother claps" would look better as ""Perfect!" His mother claps"--it smacks more definitely of the sharpness of the sound, and doesn't accidentally imply that Narcissa is saying "Perfect" in some kind of clap-based language.
#+end_quote

To be precise, quoted text only ends in a comma when followed by a dialogue tag.

**** (Background: I'm a native speaker of English, a firm believer in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription][linguistic prescriptivism]], and a longtime lover of the Latin language.)

I prefer a language to lack opportunities for confusion. Synonyms increase opportunities for confusion. If "I" and "me" become synonyms--if "lay" and "lie" become synonyms--if "compose" and "comprise" become synonyms--it becomes harder for people to understand each other. Rules imposed on a system from above may be arbitrary--but, without those rules, everything would be chaos.

Aren't you annoyed when you go to another country, see that it uses [[http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/8/85/Plugs.png/400px-Plugs.png][different electrical plugs]] from the ones in your home country, and are forced to buy an adapter so that you can charge your phone? Would you be happy if every state in the United States (or every first-level administrative division in whatever country you inhabit) had speed-limit signs in a different unit (mi/hr, km/hr, yd/min, m/s)? In these situations, when a centralized authority imposes regulations from above--however arbitrary those regulations may be--confusion and hassle are reduced.

It really doesn't matter what you prefer, language always has and always will have ambiguities. Grammatical English is and will always be the language as spoken and understood by people, not some externally imposed platonic ideal. Furthermore, none of the examples you gave create difficulties in understanding. No fluent speaker is confused by "You are to treat your mother and I with respect", nor by the intransitive use of lay, nor by the conflation of compose and comprise.

The distinctions you want to preserve are so completely arbitrary, as well. English used to have a medial-distal distinction (that vs. yon), a T-V distinction (thou vs. you), locative adverbs (hence, hither, et al.). Do you think English speakers are less able to convey meaning without them? What is the one true English we should be using, Elizabethan English? The English of Chaucer? /Is þis þæt riht Englisc?/

Language changes, trying to stop it is utterly futile.
