Prologue, Cursed Child

The diary levitated and whirled through the air as the young man waved his wand in a most curious manner. Plucked out of a shallow pond, water dripped off the beaming, black leather cover. It was an old book with a rather odd aura about it, and he simply could not help himself from opening it. Who could have known that Riddle had written a second diary, a diary serving an entirely different purpose than his first? He did not intend to prolong his life, to seek immortality, and so there were no traces of his soul to be found. This was not a Horcrux. No, this was something entirely different. Riddle wanted to preserve a secret; a secret so dark and so powerful, only he knew of it. The moment he encountered the child that would be cursed, he came to the realization his immortality was no longer guaranteed and that he may some day perish at his very hands. And so what he could not confide in a single soul, he wrote in a small black book, and proceeded to hide it in the deepest reaches of the Scandinavian mountains, thousands of miles Durmstrang. If he were to one day die, he thought, someone should continue what he started. No matter how long it took, someone would one day find this diary, for no secret is ever truly safe in this world.

“The forces of magic subtly compel people into performing minor actions that have been predetermined, and through these minor actions, major consequences are triggered. This essentially leads the universe to its one true fate. In this regard, the forces of the Dark Arts seem to be the most powerful in their ability to influence the course of events that shall occur, more-so than any other magical force” - Professor Sarsgaard, 1988 , Durmstrang Institute.

   As he opened the cover, Riddle’s magic began to permeate throughout the air, creating a fog of unease that settled around him. Still, though feeling quite unsettled, the young man could not help himself from continuing on. It seems Riddle has always had a way of manipulating other wizards - his magic was just too intriguing, and even in death it remains so. He turned to the first page, where there was but a single sentence written. “Would you like to hear a secret?”  The young man quickly conjured his quill and wrote his response. It seemed Riddle had succeeded. The world was now one step closer to the fate Riddle once sought…and a cursed child would be chosen once more.
