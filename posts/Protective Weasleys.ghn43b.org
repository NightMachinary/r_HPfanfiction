I want a fic or a one-shot where the Weasleys are really protective of Harry and Harry is really small and maybe more abused than in canon. Maybe also without Ginny or something so Harry is the youngest. And all the Weasley boys (and maybe Ginny) treat him like an younger brother and are just really protective of him. Please


** "More abused" because starvation, child labour and living under the stairs just wasn't enough

*** I'm now imagining a bunch of Harrys from different universes/fanfics comparing how bad the Dursley's were.

‚ÄúWait, so who here wasn't beaten by Uncle Vernon on a regular basis?‚Äù

Canon Harry and that one Harry with a dead Vernon raise their hands.

Not very protective, more of a chaotic dream team.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Here's a bunch of little moments I thought of:

- Molly seeing Vernon ditch Harry at King's Cross then stepping in to take him to platform 9&3/4.

- Percy showing Harry and Ron the way to all their classes.

- Ron telling Snape to stuff it when he picks on Harry.

- Fred and George warning Harry about the Cerberus in the third floor corridor.

- Ron dragging Harry to the Hospital Wing after he complains about headaches during DADA.

- Percy making sure he goes to bed at a reasonable hour.

- Ron immediately following Harry when he pursues Malfoy during the Flying Lesson.

- Fred and George suddenly becoming really serious during Quidditch practise when Harry joins.

- Ron panicking when he realises he just agreed Harry's stead for the midnight duel.

- Percy noticing Ron and Harry missing during the troll incident, running off to find a teacher. He finds them all in the girl's bathroom. When they all leave, he suddenly hugs Ron saying ‚Äúdon't scare me like that. All three of you.‚Äù

Dammit, now I kinda want to write this.

** In linkffn(Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) there is very protective Weasley family around Harry (and angry Mrs Weasley tearing down Dumbledore is just pure gold), but in the end it is just a Severitus.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** Well, the thing about Dumbledore is that he's flawed, well-meaning but flawed. The best way for this to start is that something happens before Harry gets to Hogwarts, something horrible between Harry and Dursleys that Dumbledore's /very guilt-ridden conscious/ can't live with happening again so he takes Harry out of the Dursleys for good.

‚Äã

The Longbottoms are still in a right mess because of the Lord and Lady of Longbottom are still stuck in a hospital room barely themselves at best, Sirus is still in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit (and everyone with more intimate knowledge of Sirus having doubts of the entire 'Sirus betrayed the Potters' bit, probably a certain /rat/ made his lies basically mind-control grade memetic for most people), Lupin is a werewolf and likely unable to do anything by /law/, so the only real family that would be available would be the Weasleys...
