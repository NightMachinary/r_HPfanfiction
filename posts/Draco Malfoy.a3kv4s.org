Hey guys, I was wondering could you link me the best Draco fics? It can be just Draco or him in any parring, the only thing I care about is that the fic is /finished/ and well written. I do prefer longer ones but I can settle for shorter as well. Thank you!

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man who Lived]] has got to be one of my absolute favourite Draco fics. Amazing. A believable redemption fic. 253k words. Complete. And the writing is good enough to be a published novel, in my opinion. I read it ages ago and still find myself thinking about it every now and then.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

**** I've found that with ff.net. Ao3 has a good rating system so i use that. Helps me avoid the cringe. Search this sub for recs as well. Some people have put up great lists.
