Or would it be limited to divination stuff? If so, what could be?


** Perhaps Arithmancy isn't exactly about mathematics, so much as the meaning of numbers.

Qabbalistic numerology ascribes certain qualities to each numeral. I've built up a headcanon about it somehow addressing how certain magic interacts with other magic. Rather than be saddled with the arbitrary meaning of letters in names = factors, I figured that magical arithmancy was about typifying spells and substances to better understand how they interact.

It would have grown out of the intuitive understanding discovered in potion-making over the centuries, but might not have gotten a regimented treatment until the 1800's, when scientific method began to help weed out inconsequential aspects of magic ('while standing in a wooden pail filled with fishtails, during a waxing moon...') that the truly meaningful patterns began to emerge. Sorcerers always knew that hair made for the best source in Polyjuice, and that you can conjure water much more readily than milk, but arithmancy began to explain why.

My problem with much of the 'real-world' numerology is how arbitrary some of the qualities seem, even moreso when applied to the naming of children; would prospective Jewish parents approach the scholar about best names for encouraging certain traits, or was their attempt to 'game the system' likely to create a monster? So I went back to the numbers themselves- ignore history, ignore pure mathematics. What do these numbers mean?

[extract from A Story of Magic]

So, when we speak of arithmantic meaning, we are speaking of the whole of human spiritual culture, distilled into nigh-on universal meanings. These meanings vary with culture and you can see bias in the spirits of east Asia in comparison to those, say, of the deep Amazon, but their meanings are our meanings, often derived from more... mathematical truths.

*One*. It is the smallest, the sole object. Alone yet complete. It's geometric representation is a dot.

"Not a sphere?"

A dot. Zoom in on the dot and you will discover it is still a dot, because One has no subcomponents.

*Two*. The essence of communication. From here to there. Two is represented by a circle- the center and orbit. It is also the symbol for pain and loss and fear, for only by cleaving one into two did everything start to hurt.

*Three*. It takes the simple binary of two and adds a dimension, multiplying meaning, creating both dissention and dynamism. It is therefore also the number for creativity... and lies

*Four*. the first multiple. Symbol is --

"A square."

No, it's a three-sided pyramid. Four is a family, sustainable procreation. It is also stability and truth, for only by having two opposing sides sharing equal voice is there something to match against. It is also the first possible solid object- more than a shadow.

*Five*. The hand, artifice, the incomplete array, the broken star- it also represents humanity in our lost-our-tails aspect and unrestrained power.

*Six*. Armies. Two triangles arrayed at cross purposes. Also, a strong model for division and unification. Six also represents society and culture.

*Seven* is the soul, and location. It establishes existence. The geometric representation of seven is a double pyramid. One point at the center, one length out, forward and back, to left and to right, up and down. All connected, they form the double pyramid, a reflection of life in death. Perfection, but also isolation.

*Eight*. the cube, structure, architecting - also the compass, to chart a vector; plans and destinations

*Nine*. squares of trios, or the spiral - the unfinished grouping - community - the compass with a center, to represent the ship

*Eleven* and *Twenty-two* were made up, as far as I'm concerned. There's too much culture behind it and not enough prehistorical symbolism. It's like they miscalculated the factors on two and four, then tried to shoehorn in a second meaning to flatter someone or cover their error.

** My head canon says it's basically statistics - the chance of this working, the odds of that blowing up in your face. I base this solely on the one-off line where Hermione compares Arithmancy to Divination.

** My impression of Arithmancy is that it's probability theory mixed with magic (to allow you to have much better predictions). Basically, construct a premise comprised by a set of numbers created by magic to define characters in a confrontation, ingredients for Potion engineering, etc, compute the result and interpret it. So there is math involved, but it never reaches the kind of complexity Muggles dabbles in.

My headcanon isn't well-constructed enough to the point where I could comfortably construct Arithmancy worldbuilding from the point of view of an Arithmancy student (the only Hogwarts course where this is the case), I really only have vague ideas at best.

** Well, I wouldn't call it a substitute. Wizards and witches need a certain level of maths, and -- really -- I never bought into that 'we don't need it for our living; so we have no interest in it'-excuse. I can't imagine really smart wizards like Dumbledore, Flamel, Riddle, Grindelwald, Crouch etc not knowing advanced maths. It just doesn't add up, nor does it feel appropriate.

Rowling's official position is that Arithmancy is the study of the magical attributes of numbers. That might include some divination, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that it has other applications as well.

Many people take Arithmancy to mean spell crafting, but that's going a bit far, in my opinion. On the other hand, I can imagine Arithmancy coming in handy with more obscure types of magic like wards and so on. It's not too difficult to imagine how numbers or their attributes might come into play when analysing, breaking, improving, or setting up wards.

But that's how it is, even in our world?

Obviously a pre-enlightenment society without a proper education system would be even worse off.

But why? Even the best brain surgeon will be unable to give you a simple galois group because it's not his field. There is nothing wrong with that?

Strongly disagree. There is always an academic interest in science, simply because it's an intellectual pursuit. If a wizard needs to know basic maths to calculate potion ingredients, why wouldn't he wonder about certain relations of numbers, patterns, laws of maths? Strictly speaking, most common people don't need any maths in their daily life beyond the Law of Proportion and maybe some rudimentary geometry. So why is it we all know so much beyond that?

Completely different. Natural science, the pursuit of comprehending nature, extends to what many people refer to as 'Muggle' stuff (biology, chemistry, physics etc). These aren't ways of non-magicals to compensate for magic, but human attempts to describe the world. Every human is curious, no matter magical or Muggle. And maths, simply put, is just a tool you need in order to advance beyond a certain point in any given field of natural science. Your comparison is also highly infelicitous because magic is not something that replaces science. Rather, it's a science Muggles have no access to. It doesn't make any sense that nobody in the magical world would be interested in, say, physics or maths. In fact, seeing as magic is dependent on a tradition of written words, the argument could be made that they, naturally, would have to be more (!) advanced in some fields of studies than Muggles.

*** My headcanon use of arithmancy is to find the right numbers to plug into some other magical use, which can be just about anything. Thus, it's divination using, but also about, numbers.

This makes me think it's more analogous to magic physics than anything else.
