** The author had posted something about inflammatory reviews / pms along with maybe moving to another site other than FF.net.

I'm with you, it was in the top 3 of my most anticipated updates, and I'm sad I probably won't get to read the rest of it.

** Really sad about that as well. Was easily in my Top 5 MCU crosses. Unfortunately, the fact that it was a crossover also works against any access to it via fictionhunt, since that only archives pure-HP fics.

Since that's the case, I've gotta ask. Does anyone have a recent ePub copy?

*** If you remember the link, you can try putting it in P0ody-Files. It checks its archives first, so it has found fics taken down but downloaded before for me. Maybe might help.
