So Lily Evans is a pureblood and she gets murdered by someone. She is found and Lucius Malfoy, a young ministry detective is assigned to the case. I don't have all the details worked out, but I thought that this would be a cool idea.


** Why is lily a pureblood? Why is Lucius a detective? seems super random

Literally 3 sentences that don't include plot, conflict or any sort of, you know, story isn't an idea, my dude. That barely counts as a prompt.

** Why can't young detective Lily Evans stumble upon the cooling corpse of Lucius Malfoy. Evans works in a private investigation firm with Petunia as her secretary. Petunia is good at picking up gossip and maintaining appearances, Lily is good for getting down and dirty with her darring do to catch the bad guys and collect bounties.
