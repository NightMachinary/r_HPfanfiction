*** I literally just finished rereading Strangers at Drakeshaugh a couple minutes ago and came here just to see if anyone was talking about it!

Seconded whole-heartedly. It's a great story. Northumbrian's stories are all really well-written and imaginative, and a lot of them feature OCs.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks.

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.
