Arthur finds out that his knowledge of muggles (or rather lackthereof) is not at all expertise, or even the average degree of understanding that wizards have. Most wizards grasp it just fine, but Malfoy influences Arthur's bosses into keeping him on board instead of getting someone qualified because it makes it easier to get shit past him.


** Honestly this could be a crack fic or completely heartbreaking. I hope someone with more literary skill than me writes both!

** Another crack-or-serious idea is that it's the same thing as a lot of Drarry fics - Lucius is besotted with Arthur, and secretly pining away. Thus he keeps him in a job.

He gave Ginny the diary because he thought it would be an intro to making Weasleys Voldemort followers and thus, safe

** Plot twist! Arthur is secretly an expert at muggle technology and culture; he plays the idiot in the Ministry because he knows that the pureblood elements (like Malfoy) would try to get him removed if he were pro-muggle /and/ competent. By ensuing that the next-best candidates if he were to be fired look more difficult to sneak stuff around, Arthur keeps his job.

Why then does he ask Harry questions that he should know the answers to? It's his way of helping Harry's self-esteem after his rotten time with the Dursleys.

You know, if the prompt were played in reverse or something.

** I don't think muggles are really his job and that that's why he gets away with the lack of knowledge. Instead he's the least glamorous cursebreaker in Britain.

*** Yeah, his job is to un-enchant muggle stuff, dealing with the muggles is a bonus. And he is must be good, if Ford Anglia is any indication. I mean, it can fly and turn invisible, and became semi-sentient after some months in the wild. How cool is that?

*** He might not work directly with muggles, but an understanding of muggle culture and technology must surely be a necessity when determining what is and isn't an improper enchantment vs ordinary function.

**** Yes, but hasn't he basically changed the law so that any enchantment on a muggle object is illegal?

***** Only if you were to intend to use it. If you were to, say, enchant a car to fly, but not intend to use it to fly...

Just realize the Ford Anglia follows the same rules as the Philosopher's Stone in the Mirror of Erised. Arthur is secretly Albus.
