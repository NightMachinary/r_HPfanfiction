I want a Voldemort that's such a monster, that he's essentially a monster of legend. A Voldemort that's only ever been held off by a mother's sacrifice and Dumbledore with a mythical super wand. One that can burn cities to ash and outsmart the smartest of foes.

No slash please.


** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) has a pretty scary Voldemort but it doesn't take his power to bring Harry down, a hired thug from Knockturn Alley and a knife is enough.

**** I also liked linkffn(Divided and Entwined), Voldemort is pretty scary using really evil curses, even though he doesn't make too many personal appearances.

****** What's your favorite? I've read almost all of Starfox, and I liked it pretty much the most along with Lady Thief.

******* The Marriage Law Revolution, although the Starfox5's other fics have elements I like or think are unique. Patron has a unique world, reformed and really trying has a hilarious Grindelwald, and lady thief has a great initial premise.

Marriage law Revolution because, I mean seriously, people tend to gloss over marriage laws being state sponsored rape and the world building was amazing.

If Starfox5 wrote a Harry-centric fic, I'd be all over that. I'm not as big a fan of Hermione as I was when I was younger.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) has a Voldemort that's so cartoonishly overpowered that it takes time travel and a decades-in-the-making plan to bring him down, and even then it's a close call.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Yeah, canon Voldemort is a pushover. I really think he's just coasting from his name, really.

So is Canon magic, in general...
