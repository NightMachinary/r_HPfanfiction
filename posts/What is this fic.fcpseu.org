:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic based around the Triwizard tournament where the dragon bites Harry's hand and he brings it into the stadium because he's angry at it. That's all I can remember, thanks for any help ðŸ˜Š


** You mean the little one that they pick from the bag? I think I remember this fic. Doesn't he enlarge the Pocket!Dragon so it can fight the actual one from the challenge?

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
