I'M DONE READING REHASHES! Seriously stop writing stories, Especially Avengers Stories, where the entire idea is "The movies goes on and Harry stands around kinda helping, kinda" or as I like to call them Rick Jones Stories, where Harry takes the place of the Comic Book Little Buddy of the Avengers Rick Jones. You know Rick Jones as the kid Dr. Banner saves from the Gamma Bomb, or Cap's Current Day Bucky. He is mostly known for hanging out and helping the Avengers, like Harry often does in these Stories.

But guess what, that is BORING AS FUCK and makes you seem like a bad writer if you can't think about how to fit Harry's own original story into it. Now some May be saying "Well Harry already killed Voldemort he doesn't need a Marvel Adventure" and thats why your writing sucks! Marvel is ridiculously large, why the hell can't Harry go and do something completely separate from the other Avengers, they are able to separate. "The Movies don't have enough Villains" ... And why can't you harvest some from the comics? Your imagining your own world, why can't Modred the Mystic show up to access some source of magic and Harry stop him (Use Marvel Wikia For Fuck Sake! THE MOVIES AREN'T THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFO!) Why Can't Harry deal with some insane race of Demons trying to take someone back with them? Why Can't Harry fight some coven of Vampires using a city and a open hunting ground!?

*JUST STOP WITH THE GOD DAMN REPOST OF THE AVENGERS MOVIES AND WRITE SOMETHING ORIGINAL! FUUUUUCCCCCCKKKK*


** [[/u/Djagar]], [[/u/ItsSpicee]], this is more of what a rant looks like.

*** Not hardly. A good rant needs a /lot/ more cursing (this has some but nowhere near enough), and shouldn't look like it was written by someone who knows how to spell and compose sentences.

**** HAVE!...Seriously, I am not a native speaker of the English language, but I don't think I've made this mistake (replacing have with of) ever! It pains me reading it every god damned time I see it!

As for the rant/ranting in general: LET IT OUT! Bottling it up serves nobody :)

** A-FUCKING-GREED!!!!!!

Every Grodd damn time! It's probably the worst in GOT crossovers because nothing ever changes when it certainly should, especially if you add a character of Harry's caliber into the story. An example of this is in a story I read where Harry has all his magic, he's friends with Ned stark, he's there at Neds execution and yet Ned still fucking dies. Like what mate? What the fuck?! He's a fucking wizard! He should be king of Westeross yet he's relegated to a fucking bystander.

Even worse is those stories where Harry warns Ned about Baelish and pretty much has everything figured out yet somehow Ned still act's the same way he did in canon.

*** This is the same canon rehash symptom in non crossovers.

Someone is writing a pretty decent 'Sirius raising Harry' story series, only to force the plot back to canon rails in Year 1 and 2. It's so disappointing.

** I agree. I mean If I wanted the story to go the same way as the movie I would just watch it again.

** Wand and Shield has Harry teleport the Basilisk into Odin's dining room and has Peeves as an immortal evil monster. Sounds original enough.

** I both agree and disagree, because I think it comes down to character motivations. For the GoT example, Harry might be morally inclined to save Ned, but at the cost of revealing his magic to all of Westeros (assuming it was being kept quiet in this case). Maybe he has greater plans that Ned would be in the way of. Or maybe he just wants to bang Sansa and Ned didn't like that, so he says 'fuck it' and lets him die. I guess I can sum it up the whole thing with 'could vs. should.'

Plus, canon Harry generally seems to hate being in the limelight so being on the sidelines and playing support rather than going all Big Damn Heroes on the villain du jour also makes sense, as long as the job gets done. There's a lot of different angles to this, and in the end it comes down to how good the writing is, and if it makes sense for the character to do that thing they did, rather than what we the audience want them to do.
