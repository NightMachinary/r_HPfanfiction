Are there any stories that follow Hogwarts under the Carrow regime that diverge significantly from canon, or at least don't end up in approximately the same place? (Bonus points if no one takes swipes at DAYD's advertised canon compliance.)


** I've been looking for a fic like this as well, but no luck so far. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3808697/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Ginny Weasley and the Sword of Gryffindor]] was supposed to be an AU where Ginny managed to escape with the sword and join the trio for the horcrux hunt, but the story was abandoned before anything significant happened.

I've actually been plotting out a couple of fics with this premise that I will probably make lots of notes about but will never go anywhere because of my utter inability to pay attention to writing for more than fifteen minutes. One idea is the same as the above, but with Ginny escaping with the sword and Seamus and joining Dean's camp instead of Harry's. That would avoid yet another rehash of the horcrux hunt while still giving them some action with Ted Tonks dying and the snatchers and all, while also exploring Seamus and Dean's dynamic. There's also a subplot regarding the identity of Dean's father, who is a Snatcher. Will probably be either Seamus/Ginny or Dean/Ginny. Or maybe both.

Another idea I have thought only vaguely about is some sort of Hunger Games-esque tournament at Hogwarts in which certain members of the DA (and may be a reluctant Draco Malfoy) are forced to participate. Not sure I can find any realistic way to sell Ginny and Luna and Neville fighting to kill each other under any circumstance though.

EDIT: Oh, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11100717/1/Draught-of-Living-Dreams][Draught of Living Dreams]], an AU where Ginny was tortured worse than canon. It was meant to be a post war recovery fic, but it was abandoned after two chapters. The first chapter, the one with Ginny at Hogwarts, is self-sufficient though, and a pretty good read.

*** I agree that the Hunger Games idea probably wouldn't work, but I'd love to read that first one.

** Long ago, I read a sequel to Prelude to Destiny, which was the book club book from a couple of months ago, called Backfire. Unfortunately, the story appears to be deleted. In a year-old [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/330w00/lf_fanfic_written_in_the_perspective_of_ginny/cqi3j36][comment]] from here, the poster recommends messaging the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/36388/brainchild][brainchild]]. Don't know if that will work.

Backfire is a 6th and 7th year AU told from the perspective of Ginny Weasley. Due in part to her own natural talent, and in part to shenanigans that involve Dobby, Ginny ends up as quite the talented witch.

Per my recollection, the story was well written and the plot was intriguing. I found a particular seventh-year plot point quite compelling; it was believable and I have never seen it done elsewhere. If you can get your hands on it, I would definitely recommend.

** *Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum*, linkffn(8286141): although mostly focused on Harry, there were significant actions inside Hogwarts too.
