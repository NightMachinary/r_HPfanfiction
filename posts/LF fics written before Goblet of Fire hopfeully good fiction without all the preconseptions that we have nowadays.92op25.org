** Life begins at conseption. HP fanfiction (with rare exceptions) begins after GOF.

It was written around the time of GOF, but a couple that go way back are Cygnus Crux's /Existence after Life/ series (begun in early 2002) as well as the late Full Pensieve's /Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion/ (begun in early 2003).

****** Very popular website host from the 90s and early 2000s, shut down in 2009. Millions of websites lost, a decent portion of which were never archived anywhere.
