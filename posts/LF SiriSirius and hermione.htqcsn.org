Hey guys!

I dunno if my last post actually posted so apologies if I double post but I'm looking for a Sirius Hermione time travel fanfic. If I can't remember correctly Hermione gets sent back and is either adopted or it turns out that she's a lupin (not sure which) anyways she ends up with the last name lupin. I also know that at the start hermione and harry are talking about opening an orphanage for orphans after the war but we're looking for money to start it and Sirius has bought a bunch of burnt down shops and turned them into an orphanage for Hermione TIA
