Dumbledore creates a deal with the residents of the forest, just like all the previous headmasters, in keeping the peace and separations of grounds. When Umbridge is put in power and Dumbledore is removed, this deal is now null and void. Here comes the wrath of the forbidden forest.


** Reminds me of the whole idea of goblin ownership thing, with renting/licensing goblin-made works (do goblins consider their works equivalent to living creatures or something?) instead of just buying them.

But, hmm...who would represent the land covered by the Forbidden Forest? Who speaks for the land that's leased to Hogwarts and its headmasters? Something canon? Something non-canon?

...Heh, the giant squid is the landlord.

*** I will happily read a fic where the giant squid is the Hogwarts landlord. That would make my year.

**** Maybe that's why the first years are supposed to go over the lake instead of on the carriages. So the giant squid can get to see the new tenants.

*** More thinking of an on-going treaty that goes back to when Hogwarts first started and must be renewed by each headmaster or headmistress to occupy the castle. We all know Umbridge view on beings not pureblood and rich

** No wait, what if the rightful heads of the school literally had a treaty with the Forbidden Forest itself. Umbrige usurps power in an unacceptable way so the Forest comes alive like that hilarious yet awesome Pottermore article on a Quidditch World Cup that descended into a war with sentient evil trees.

**** Haha, very much so. I'm just going to quote the entire bit, I still laugh every time I read it because it's hilarious and also shows how ridiculously strong HP magic can be:

  Attack of the Killer Forest

  "The ghastly climax of the 1809 final between Romania and New Spain (what is now known as Mexico) has gone down in wizarding history as the worst exhibition of temper ever given by an individual player. Niko Nenad's teammates had become so concerned by his ferocious outbursts during the quarter and semi-finals that they tried to persuade their manager to substitute him for the final, advice that was sadly ignored by the ambitious old wizard.

  After the game, Nenad's teammate Ivan Popa (winner of an International Wizarding Order of Merit for his life-saving actions during the catastrophe) told an international inquiry: â€˜Over the preceding weeks we'd seen Niko beat himself over the head with his broom and set fire to his own feet in frustration. I'd personally stopped him strangling two referees. However, I had no suspicion about what he was planning to do if the final didn't go our way. I mean, who'd suspect that? You'd have to be as mental as he was.'

  Precisely when and how Nenad managed to jinx an entire forest on the edge of the West Siberian Plain is open to speculation, although he is thought to have had accomplices among unprincipled fans and was later proven to have paid local Dark wizards substantial sums. After two hours of play, Romania were behind on points and looking tired. It was then that Nenad deliberately hit a Bludger out of the stadium into the forest beyond the pitch. The effect was instantaneous and murderous. The trees sprang to life, wrenched their roots out of the ground and marched upon the stadium, flattening everything in their path, causing numerous injuries and several fatalities. What had been a Quidditch match turned swiftly into a human versus tree battle, which the wizards won only after seven hours' hard fighting. Nenad was not prosecuted as he had been killed early on by a particularly violent spruce."

This is the sort of ridiculous but fitting thing I wish we'd heard more about in canon. XD A few random dark wizards were game to being paid to charming a tree army and someone needs to write this story as a fanfic
