I remember that Harry, and Ron, Were girls. And Hermione was a boy.

Harry ended up with George.

It sort of took place across all of the books showing little bits and pieces. I remember George ask harry to the yule ball. Also I believe Fred lived in the end.

It was also on fanfiction.net

Thanks in advance.
