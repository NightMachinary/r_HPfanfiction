I started my adventure with fanfiction with Hermione Granger + someone (Draco, Severus, Harry, James, Sirius, ect.), but then it's started get boring. I began read about Harry but not romantic fanfiction. I started read Harry in another dimension, Harry's parents are alive. I read some Harry/Voldemort but not much.

And now I can't find anything to read!

I feel like I read anything worth reading.

I would like to read something long, with romance, happy ending, without Ginny (I hate her) or evil Ginny but not as a MC.

I don't know... I asking for a lot, I know. But please, I read everything in polish and so many in engliah and now I don't have anything to read.

Can you help, please?

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** I would say to read some Harry/Draco fics. I'm on a massive Harry/Draco binge after being a fan of Hermione/Draco since forever, so I'm just going to take a second to talk about how they are the perfect pairing.

We all love Hermione/Draco because it is so satisfying to watch enemies fall for one another, but Harry/Draco takes that tension and ups it in every conceivable way. The rivalry they had between each other in school, the rejected offer of friendship in first year, the obsession Draco has with getting a reaction from Harry in subsequent years, then Harry's obsession with Draco in 6th year... Not to mention the added tension from accepting that they are gay. Oh man, so good. Such a great rabbit hole. Seriously, they are everything Dramione is, but better.

I'm not an expert, but my favorites so far are:

Tea and No Sympathy (by who_la_hoop) How to Handle an Enemy ( by who_la_hoop ) On Call (by faithwood) and Turn (by saras_girl)

1 and 4 are more plot based, 2 and 3 are more porn based, but I would highly recommend each one if you are sceptical of the pairing, because they do a great job or keeping the voice of each character and exploring the sexual/romantic tension between the two of them.

Seriously. Drarry is Dramione on steroids, they are amazing, you will not get bored.

** Well, I think that all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass]] stories are quite good. They are all Haphane tho so that might not be your cup of tea.
