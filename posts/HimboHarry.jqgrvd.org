In which Harry is an absolute meathead and (!!) is extremely powerful due to not knowing/understanding how magic is /supposed/ to work. Basically just any situation where it helps to have a few less brain cells and a lot more blind faith in himself

For example: - Gamp's law? Well he's definitely heard Hermione mention it once or twice, but really, it's probably some obscure wizengamot thing. Harry proceeds to conjure full meals while at the Dursley's, much to Hermione/McGonagall's horror - Harry gets hit by a Sectumsempra and falls over...laughing. The death eaters are horrified that he can survive it and flee. Meanwhile, Harry is wondering why he was hit by a tickling charm in combat. When he finds out it was a /scectimsempra/ and not a /rictusempra/ he just gets annoyed that all the spells sound so similar.\\
- Harry tries to put Voldy in therapy bc ‚Äúit helps crazy muggles!‚Äù -Plays beater and just straight up punches a bludger

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?

*** I think they could argue about taking the air molecules and changing them into food. But they still should only be able to create the basic ingredients and not full meals, especially meat.

If you want a lasagna, for the meat you would need to create something alive jet dead and that contradicts itself. And to cook something it needs several steps you have to take, I can see them creating the sauce for the lasagna but it would be cold because to warm it would be the next step.

  Harry Potter is a genius. A hero of unparalleled intellect and strength of character.At least, that's what he thinks.In reality, Harry might be the dumbest wizard to ever live. Thankfully, he's cute at least. Watch in awe as he saves the world by accident and slowly convinces Ron to go out with him.

** Or simply because the Dursleys always said this or that Is law even if Harry know is not true he hates "laws" and in his mind magic is magic, in his mind he thinks that ANYTHING could be achieved/done with magic laws are merely suggestions or said by others simply for the purpose of restraining/limiting/controlling him and he because magic has no limits completely ignores them. Even gravity. And the limitations of the human body. And that a person can only have 1 nonmagical animagus form. And 1 cannot make himself a matamorphmagus or gain , create abilities...... Etc.etc
