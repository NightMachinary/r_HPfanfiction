I want a fanfic where Harry gets involved in politics, not as an advocate of light, but as neutral!

​

- Harry has power and influence in the ministry, makes alliances with old and noble families

- Harry doesn't agree with the light side, he doesn't like muggles much, but there are arguments for his muggle hatred.

​

(Please, I don't want a fanfiction in which an 11-year-old Harry already knows absolutely everything, not least because it's impossible.)

​

If you know of a fanfic that has these characteristics or is similar, please tell me, I will be delighted to know!

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
