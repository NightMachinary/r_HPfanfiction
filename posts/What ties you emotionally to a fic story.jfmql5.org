The pandemic made me dive into the fanfic world and I was surprised by how many good works we have in the community, so if you are a writer, you have all my admiration and respect!! After so many versions of Harry and the wizarding world, I began to realize that although there are many well written stories, they are few that I integrated emotionally to the point of being on the side of the protagonist, rather than admire it from a distance. What kind of plot/ main character make you expect anxious for new updates? (or frustrated because it is not complete lol)


** I really enjoy realistic romantic pacing. My favorite stories are the ones where the reader can actually believe that the characters fall in love with each other.

It's often rushed, or taken for granted, or frustratingly brief (the "epiphany"-type).

I think that's what really makes me stick with a fic. I can read/enjoy fics without it, but the ones I go back to, that i follow and actually seek out updates for are the realistic romances. Sappy, I know.

*** This, but with friendships too. I really like fics where you can totally feel why these characters are good friends to the point where it's so vivid it almost feels like you could be a part of the group. Often these are the same stories with the well-written romances, but I like it when there's no romance involved too.

** I love stories that truly understand my favorite character and explores in depth her relationships with other people. This means that my favorite fics are the ones that truly keep them in-character. More than that, they explore facets of the characters that are often ignored or simply skimmed upon.

I also love it when stories explore themes like loneliness and family. There is just something incredibly heartwrenching about my favorite character questioning her place in the world, and then be constantly reassured that she is loved and wanted over the course of the story. I can't help but fall in love with stories that end with the affirmation that she isn't and will never be alone.

** Recently, I like when good things happen in a semi-realistic way for the main character. I like stories where it seems the MC's existence is supported and even welcome by the world at large - even if some people or organizations are against them.

The over-the-top stuff can be fun if done right, but for emotional connection, for me, it needs to be believable as possible.

** What ties me emotionally to a story is the characters. This is why I love Stephen King so much: his characters are so developed in that you grow to actually care for them in whatever plot they exist within. (Stu Redman, Barbie, and Holly Gibney are the characters I connected to the most.) Since I'm on a Charlie/Hermione high at the moment, I look for well-developed depictions of Charlie and Hermione and that usually ties me down to a particular story. Unfortunately, the Charlie/Hermione pairing isn't all that popular so it's slim pickings for me. However, there are a few gems that feature Charlie/Hermione as a romantic couple and it is those stories that I revisit every now and then.

**** I got some to recommend:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703557/1/Whom-the-Gods-Would-Destroy][Whom the Gods Would Destroy]] by ianthewaiting. It's a post-apocalyptic story that is completed and, in my opinion, is both excellent and awful. However, the good heavily outweighs the bad so I'd give this one a chance if I were you. (And both Charlie and Hermione are written so well in this story along with their relationship.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3550231/1/Only-In-The-World-of-Dragons][Only in the World of Dragons]] by atruwriter. This is also completed and though it does get a bit wordy, it's still very, very good. The chapters are long chapters but don't let that deter you. This one's a gem.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13228312/1/Lost-and-Found][Lost and Found]] by minasark. Unfortunately, this one isn't completed but this story is done just so, so well. I had my own reservations about reading it (due to it not being completed) and it stands as one of my personal favorite Charlie/Hermione stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417149/1/A-Pleasurable-Kind-of-Torture][A Pleasurable Kind of Torture]] by Allotropism. This is actually a one-shot but a very funny one-shot at that. This is a slice-of-life type of story and I definitely come back to it whenever I'm feeling down. This is probably my favorite Charlie/Hermione one-shot I've come across and believe me, I've come across many one-shots.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993848/1/Games-are-afoot][Games are afoot]] by grumpy grizzly. Usually considered a classic among Charlie/Hermione stories, I'm a bit hesitant to recommend this story and would only suggest reading it if you're new to the Charlie/Hermione pairing. The reason being is that this is probably the story that is the weakest in terms of writing. And while complete, the ending is extremely rushed to the point where Charlie and Hermione don't even have a single line of dialogue in the last chapter. While the ideas are good, the execution is not. But, maybe you'll like it more than I do.

I also have four stories of the Charlie/Hermione pairing that I'll list below:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11394918/1/And-Gryffindor-Roars][And Gryffindor Roars]]. This was my first story and, in my opinion, is not well-written. However, it is complete and deals with Hermione going to Hogwarts with Charlie instead of Harry and Ron.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915227/1/The-Freedom-Land-of-the-Seventies][The Freedom Land of the Seventies]]. This is a one-shot and does include a good deal of smut. So, if you don't like the latter, then you'd best skip this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13699001/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]]. This is my current work-in-progress about Charlie and Hermione teaching at Hogwarts together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13711145/1/Cocoa-Powder-Footprints][Cocoa Powder Footprints]]. This is a one-shot also but involves no smut. The story is about Charlie and his son baking a birthday cake for Hermione's birthday.

Hopefully you find some of the above-mentioned stories worth your while! And there are a lot more Charlie/Hermione stories (that are neither one-shots nor include smut) yet I find most of them lacking. If you want, I could compile a list for you anyway. Just let me know!

****** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21280616][How to Tame Your Dragon]] is another, no smut, very very mushy as it gets further in. I had to stop reading because that's not a genre that I'm into, but if you like that sort of thing it seems like a good story. It is about Hermione getting pregnant unintentionally, and things move on from there. tagging: [[/u/emong757]]

** I think what really makes a fanfic super appealing to me is when they have a combination of 3 factors: solid writing, terrific characterization, and something about the plot/setting/arc that makes my mind wonder what will happen next.

That first is a no-brainer - fics with typos everywhere, painfully bad or painfully dry writing, good general writing with piss-poor dialogue and vice versa (though honestly piss-poor writing with amazing dialogue is far rarer than the former), endless paragraphs with no sense of where to take a breather - it all makes reading /painful/.

Terrific characterization - it's funny because people definitely have distinct and different views on the canon characters, but IMO the best fanfics are those where the fic characters stick closely with how they're presented in the original books - and then, gradually, with deft skill and subtlety, /change/ to better match the fic author's vision.

This is...not easy to pull off. Honestly, sometimes I'll keep reading a fic even if I'm like "this is an alternate universe Harry entirely, the author has not made a good foundation for how canon!Harry became /this/!Harry."...but the fic will go in the 'never bother reading again' pile.

That third thing - that sense of making me wonder and imagine what's next - is the same /spark/ that the original books caused in people to /write fanfics/ to begin with. A good fanfic almost inspires you to want to do your own spin on it, because it /tantalizes/ the mind with spiraling and branching /possibilities/.

** Honestly, when drama is played well and things are at stake. I find myself very immersed in stories where Harry & Co actually are not this invulnearble team and we see them struggle, bleed and make mistakes. I like when characters display different emotions, good and bad. People betray, lie and deceit, but also forgive, help and stand up for others and themselves. The problem is that many fics are written with a mindset of story first, characters later, when it should be the other way around. The plot should exist just to see how the characters react to different scenarios we haven't seen before. Harry can kill and not necessary be evil, he can make wrong decisions and not be an idiot, he can help people but not be a saint. It's all about exploring the character to the limits and showing what they are capable of.

** For me it's just that, good writing. A competent writer will get me invested.

Someone trying to pass off a list of plot points padded out with snippets from a world building document as a story will get me to go read something else.

** The way it's written. I read a lot of romance stories and if someone can be greatly detailed (in a way that's relevant and not just a bunch of words for the sake of a high word count) and it's realistic and you can almost /feel/ whatever it is that the character(s) are supposed to feel

I hope that makes sense lol

** I think I'd have to say that it's about giving the characters realism and depth. One-dimensional saints and scoundrels may be briefly interesting, but to be properly invested in a story, I want to see heroes who have real character flaws that cause real problems, yet they are still genuinely trying to do the right thing. I want to see villains who had understandable reasons to get where they are, even if what you understand is that those reasons are horrible or that their implementation is too extreme. And I like to see them talk through their problems - not necessarily fixing everything in five minutes, but openly communicating is such a precious thing.

I mentioned the Innocent series in another comment. The divergence in that series is all about Sirius escaping from Azkaban early and raising Harry. And Sirius is far from perfect. He doesn't have secret Black family magic. He doesn't have all the answers about parenting, and he makes a lot of questionable choices, like allowing Harry to participate in retrieving the locket from the cave, at less than ten years old - Kreacher's assistance notwithstanding. He's still genuinely trying to do his best for James and Lily's son. He gives Harry affection and fun and tells him about his parents, and puts his life on the line to keep Harry safe. They're a family, however small and imperfect, and Harry hasn't had that before. That's what I really like about the story.
