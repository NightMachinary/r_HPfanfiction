** I thought linkao3(The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer) was unusually tight and well paced for a 100k+ word fanfic. It was suspenseful and the ending held up ok. There were some typos and other flaws here and there, but not enough to get upset about. It is a Dark Lord Harry story with no shipping to speak of. The basic premises are a bit dubious but the story makes up for it.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** ) The Eyes Â» Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. (Definitely nail biting and mysterious with psychological elements) highly recommend it!
