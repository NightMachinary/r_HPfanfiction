Harry is often referred as rich , I've come to conclusion that either Potters were nobility where Charlus and Dorea Potter nee black are his paternal grandparents and James and harry were wizarding nobility which seems to go well with attitude james said to display in fics, family wealth passed down through generations, Rich history and accomplishments littered through wizarding history and james living off his parents money while in hiding with his new family. Where dorea took her great nephew in on basis of family relations in war time. James made Sirius Harry's godfather because them having some blood as well as familial connection. Family does seem to change things in one's mind.

OR

Fleamont and Euphemia Potter were Harry's paternal grandparents where fleamont and his genius potions was source of potter wealth and they were just rich well known people and james fell in lower rich class or upper middle class tier. Harry had no actual blood relation to Sirius like in other case and potters just generously took him in. James and Sirius having a pretty solid friendship and being godparent being a verbal honor not some deep magic.

What are your views on it ? Like was harry rich or not ? And if yes then source of wealth ?

** The Potters were wealthy and generationally so. From the same article we learn about Fleamont, we're told the first Potter also created potions and left significant gold to each of his seven(7) children. We're also told the Potters after him improved on the fortune. We're then told Fleamont took an impressive fortune and quadrupled it.

The Blacks, no doubt, found Dorea's marriage suitable because Charlus, who was probably a distant cousin, came from an old and wealthy family and probably had his own money.

So, Harry was at least wealthy to start the series and probably back at rich when the series ended. The source of the wealth was mainly potion making and whatever the Blacks had in '96.
