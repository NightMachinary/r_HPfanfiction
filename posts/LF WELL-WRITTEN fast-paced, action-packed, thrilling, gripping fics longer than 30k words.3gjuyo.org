** Try reading some of Brennus' stories, I think they might fit with what you're searching. Here are some of my favourites:

Hail Odysseus [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129864]] After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he returns out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

Homecoming [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129928]] After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a â€˜Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.
