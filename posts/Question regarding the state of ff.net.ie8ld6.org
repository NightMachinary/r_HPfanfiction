So over the last week or so when I've been looking for updated fics on ff.net, the search results will be in a random order. I tend to leave it on the default sort of by update date, but I'll get stuff that was updated a month ago listed before something updated an hour ago. I'm also finding that stuff that has updated isnt showing up, even if I filter to only return stuff updated in the last 24 hours. Is this happening to anyone else and is there anything on my end that might be causing this?


** yes, sometimes it gets fixed by itself and sometimes it would get stuck to stories updated last month when I ordered them by update date. I have no idea why but it keeps happening. I havgen't tried it but deleting cookies might help.

** I've seen lots of weirdness with the sort order as well, particularly with the 2nd-last pages. For whatever reason, the first page tends to mostly sort acceptably.
