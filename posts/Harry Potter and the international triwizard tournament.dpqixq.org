I'm looking for a long fic to read and I came across this one. What do you think? Should I read it? Maybe you could give me a nice long fic, preferably complete.


** It's absolutely amazing. I would recc it every time, 100%.

It's steadily updated. The author engages with his fanbase to a high degree. The last few chapters were fillers mostly and just world building, but it has a good pace for a fanfic of that scope. It's probably one of the best fanfics out there that is live.

** People seem to really enjoy it. I myself have never read it and probably never will. But it keeps getting recommended to me. I've skimmed it and from what I can tell the author's technique gets better. That being said, the moment I saw Daphne as a character; I ran. So I can't comment on the plot or character arcs. But yeah, it's probably a solid 8/10. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** I'd read it. Depending on how things turn out it might actually be a decently written harem fic (haven't read one that isn't creepy before).

*** Hey, who said it's a harem fic! I've been rather clear that nobody knows, though recent chapters certainly lead the reader towards believing it will not be a singular girl paired with Harry. I've not given anyone a definitive answer on it. :P

I do appreciate the comment and rec!

** Definitely worth reading.\\
For me I especially like how close to my own head-canon the magic system is portrayed. Although Some things differ a lot.\\
Something I don't like is how Dumbledore is acting. Too much "My boy" and clumsy manipulation attempts. That might be an act though so i hold on to hope.

*** There's only been two Dumbledore scenes. I enjoy writing it more where things are more subtle than overt. There has been quite a few reviews with different takes on the most recent one. Dumbledore is smart, scarily so. Smart doesn't mean he doesn't have blindspots. Keep that in mind, it's only two scenes and my comment. There will be some added context with the next Harry, Sirius and Remus scene too.

Either way, glad you've enjoyed the fic so far.

**** I remember more than two I think.\\
Before first task, before Yule ball, after second task. You're definitely hinted that there is more to him than meets the eye though.

What I enjoy most in the story might be the mystery and different plotlines and how much is going on at all times. It never gets boring.

Overall one of the best fics of this particular genre of HP fanfics.

*** While I haven't specifically read what DLP has said I'd imagine given the first few chapters were a generally not that good, I'd imagine they didn't keep pace into the newer content. Many say after chapter 7 it picks up but that's rather subjective.

It's there, read it, or don't. It will be there either way.

****** Outrageous massacres of spelling aside, it /is/ an entertaining fic and greatly improved as it gets rolling. I rather enjoyed this take on the Second Task, even if the First was somewhat... Anticlimactic.

******* Heh, it was beta'd.... lol. First task was supposed to be anticlimatic, the focus wasn't on the task itself, more everything around it. I didn't wnat it to be like the Second Task, where the task is a major focus of the plot, showcasing Harry's development.\\
Not everyone is going to love every part of the fic, even if they like the fic. Thanks for reading.
