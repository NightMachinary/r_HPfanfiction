The fanfic was Voldemort winning during the first war. Lily and James survive to raise Harry who can speak animal languages. The story was of a tournament where the winner gets to give birth to Voldemort's heir. Harry was entered by Voldemort and won but said he did not want to wed with Voldemort at the last second so there would a political mess. Dumbledore & Grindleward are together in prison. It's Harry/Tom. There was some virus so Voldemort was nearly killed and when he woke up, Harry finally agreed to be his (wife/husband ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
