Like the way Fanon events have just replaced canon events in my head - does anybody else suffer from this or...? The first book actually felt like it was wrong! Because of what I had convinced myself as being true, I guess, due to years of fanfiction. It's gone rly wild how surprised I've been getting by the books.


** Well... In a way it's like you are discovering them anew ahaha. I can't say i feel the way you do because i routinely reread the books (up to the early chapters of half-blood prince, cause after the first time i really CAN'T get over Sirius death in fifth book and focus on the sixth one) so the canon doesn't feel out of place

** Nah, at this point I'm so steeped into my weird blend of canon-fanon-headcanon that every time I watch the movies or go through the books I get irked and think to myself 'Dude, just look up book X/there is a potion for that dammnit/drop out of Divination, you idiot!' and many, many subtler stuff. Like Charlus and Dorea not being James' parents. I'm so connected to that bit of info and all the stories it was in that it feels so wrong when someone mentions that it's actually Fleamont and Euphemia that are the canon ones. Oh, and Charlus being a badass veteran who fought side by side with Arcturus Black. Or the whole Most Ancient and Noble House thing. I know the idea of a Wizarding (pseudo) nobility gets a bad rep here, but I like it and seen it used so much that it feels weird going through canon without seeing Lord this or that, and all that family and politics back story. And the much, much larger and intricate Wizarding world, as fanon almost always portrays it. I outright refuse to believe the Magical population of the British Isles wouldnt even fill up one of London's neighborhoods, as canon suggests.

​

Dont even get me started on Harry's overall attitude to life. Plunging so deep into proactive Harry stories really makes reading the canon version irritating. Fanon totally warped my view of the original work to an irreversible degree.

Where does canon suggest that? I always figured there were thousands of wizards in Britain alone.

Edit: I don't understand where people get this wild idea that we need millions to stay populated. It's ridiculous. There are plenty of communities that exist today with only a few thousand people.

Scientists believe that everybody alive today comes from less than 10,000 people who existed about 80,000 years ago. So a few hundred thousand wizards worldwide is perfectly believable.

And with a population of 100+ Million worldwide, like what was suggested below, it'd be impossible to keep magic a secret.

***** Rowling has admitted she's bad at numbers, and that we shouldn't take the named characters in Harry's year or the number of fellow Gryffindors to be representative of the size of the school or the size of the wizarding population. She only had a handful of named characters, but that's just because those were the ones she wanted to focus on and have a backstory. It's not realistic for her to have named and described 200 students.

Since the hat sorts based on personality, you can't assume that the houses will be evenly divided. While there's only 10 Gryffindors in Harry's year, there's no reason there couldn't be 20 Hufflepuffs and 30 Ravenclaws.

I believe I remember reading that Rowling imagined there to be 2000 or so students at Hogwarts at a given time, which makes much more sense than the 280 you'd get using the “40 students a year” equation.

****** I think you're forgetting that despite Harry being unobservant as shit, lowballing to seeing only 40 seems like he's all but blind because that means that he only noticed ~2% of the student population. Also, you're saying about 2k students for 7 years. Looking at a boarding school in Maine with a student body of 1.8k for grades 6-12 (same number of years as Hogwarts), it seems reasonable right? Well, that's when you don't factor in that there are other boarding schools and the population of Maine is 1.338mil.

So even with Rowling being bad at math and everyone insisting that 10k is fine for a population, kind of hard to rationalize that when Rowling said that there should be about 2k students in Hogwarts at a time. That means a literal fifth of the population is constantly in school. Now, you're forgetting that that 10k includes underage wizards/witches that don't go to school or are at the very least homeschooled in basic writing and maths.

And even with Hogwarts being the most well-known UK school, that means that the population needs to be much greater than 10k to warrant those other schools even existing.

Hell, even Lucius was 26-27 when he had Draco and that was because the first was was going on and he wasn't sure if he'd live or not with how the aurors were also using Unforgivables. Not everyone was like James and Lily and had kids fresh out of school at age 20. And of course the Weasleys had William "Bill" Weasley when they were a couple years out of school because the rumblings of the first war were being felt and heard across the country. A lot of the "Light" families seemed to be that way with having kids early because they were in the middle of the war.

Let's not forget that the auror department was badly ravaged by both the First Wizarding War and the Second Wizarding War, which were both "won" within 16 years of each other.

To put that in perspective, the population of the United states dropped 60k between 1917 and 1918. The US joined the war in 1917 and it finished about a year later. So it'd make sense for the population to drop about 5% of 1%. Now, that doesn't seem like a lot, but you're looking at 103mil where 60k dropping off doesn't affecting the population significantly. If we apply that same percentage to the 10k of Wizarding Brittain (even though Wizarding UK would make more sense), that's a loss of about 6 people. But, that's inaccurate as we've been told there were entire families that were wiped out. That means both sets of grandparents, the parents, and, assuming average for wizards, 1 child so a total of 7 people. Now, that's not looking at the older families that had far more family members and wizards having a longer lifespan compared to Muggles. At that point, you're looking at an average of 12 per family. Now, let's call it an average of 9.5 people per family. We don't know how many families were wiped out so that number could easily be in the hundreds which is actually very detrimental to a population of only 10k.

Why does each floor need to staff hundreds of people? Two of the floors at the Ministry are literally just the Atrium and the courtrooms. And not each one needs hundreds. The top floor just consists of the Minister and his support staff. That's it. So that's three floors that are hardly anything.

So really, even if there are 1000-2000 people working in the Ministry, you could still have hundreds working in the proper departments that need it.

You are massively understaffing 7 divisions by staffing them with anywhere between 24-48 staff members....not counting the head of the overarching department. Plus, pretty sure each sub-department has a head or manager as well. Tell me how 48 staff members is enough to deal with something like a dragon or a nest of acromantula?

Why? Why does the Department of Magical Games and Sports, for example, need 500+ people like you're implying?

Furthermore, your argument of there being millions wizards imply there's thousands of Aurors, for example. And that doesn't make sense with what we see in canon. We get a glimpse of the Auror office in the fifth book, and it's not even remotely implied to be big enough.

The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures has like 6 sub-departments. Two of them are just liaison offices for Goblins and Centaurs. So yes, I think that's enough.

Also, dragons aren't native to England.

And acromantulas aren't common either. There isn't even one confirmed colony in Scotland, according to Newt.

There is honestly no reason to believe that hundreds of wizards are needed daily to fight magical creatures.

Furthermore, you also have things like the "Official Gobstones Club" as being one of the subdepartments in another department. So you obviously don't need many people for that, meaning some of the numbers can hop into the appropriate divisions.

And just a reminder that 332 is me very much lowballing the number. I'd argue there's at least 2,000 people working in the Ministry, which would double your estimates.

The Ministry put 500 workers toward the Quidditch World Cup. As daily operations are, well, daily, it doesn't make sense that these 500 workers would even be a third of the full force. So their full number is probably a few thousand.

Probably much less tbh. It's an elite force. Why would there be hundreds for a small population?

You know, I've been defending my stance this whole time, constantly putting down rebuttal after rebuttal of yours before you give up on those lines of argument, but let's argue yours now.

You believe there are millions of wizards in the UK. Since half the Ministry's purpose is to keep the Statute of secrecy upheld, that means there would have to be tens of thousands of Ministry officials.

Explain how this makes any sense with what we see in canon. Where are these hundreds of Aurors? Why do we keep seeing only a couple? Where are the 10,000-100,000 or so children going to school? Are only 2000 going to Hogwarts? Seems low.

How in the world do they uphold the Statute of Secrecy with hundreds of millions of wizards worldwide? 100,000,000+ easily all over the globe. There's no way in hell they keep magic a secret.

That's completely irrelevant. The point is that small population countries can have functioning governments. How that government started is irrelevant.

  hundreds of thousands in the world.....scientists believe there was once a period in our history where only a couple thousand humans were alive.....numerous scientists have calculated that only a few hundred people would be enough to kick off a new society without inbreeding.
#+end_quote

Let's break this down one at a time: a population of 10k is not enough to warrant 9 floors of departments in a Ministry. Maybe a town hall, but not a Ministry. Second, I was referring to sustain the population of magical Britain. And I've seen your other arguments in this thread and they don't track as you're assuming each copulation results in a net growth in the magical population, not accounting for squibs or non-magicals born of a magical with a muggle. So, you'd need to have an equal number of deaths and births just to sustain the population every 18 years.....assuming no teenage pregnancies where the kids are born out of wedlock and, again, the kid/kids are born magical and not muggle/non-magical. While it is doable, it still wouldn't warrant having a Ministry and a full Wizengamot, which is used as the court system which seems to be mostly hereditary rather than an elected position.

Now, onto those scientists: yeah, there was a point where only a couple thousand humans were alive. Let's assume big and go 5k (even though a couple thousand is 2k). For the first few decades, they'd need to be breeding like rabbits or inbreeding within the same family multiple times to grow the population pool. By that point, there's a lot of genetic deficiencies.

As for the only needing a few hundred, again, let's go with 500 hundred as that feels reasonable. Assuming all 500 are within a reasonable age group to where the child isn't born sickly, you'd need to wait at least a decade or two each time unless you go with an open society where everyone is having sex and breeding with everyone. In that case, you're further narrowing the gene pool as that prevents safe numbers to avoid inbreeding, which again leads to genetic deficiencies and problems.

So, no, 10k is not enough to maintain the population of a country the size of Magical Britain without resulting in inbreeding even with Muggleborns being brought in every year, and warranting a government the size of the Ministry of Magic where it seems most of the population works.

#+end_quote

You keep making these claims, but you haven't actually given any reason for them. /Why/ can't 10k warrant 9 floors? If the Ministry has, say, 1000 people working in it, then that means there's 100+ people in each floor.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic_floor_directory][Now if we take a look at actual floors,]] we can come to the easy conclusion that there doesn't need to be 100 people in each floor. Hell, two of the floors aren't even actual departments. It's just the Atrium and the other is just courtrooms. And another is just the Minister and his staff. So three whole floors need far less than 100 people in them.

So you're looking at 150+ people available for each department where there are actually people working. And it wouldn't be equally spread out. Some floors might have 50. Some might have 500. But the point is, even a department having 50 people is fine. It's perfectly reasonable. It's not at all unusual.

And this is with me being very generous with the "only 1000 employees" thing.

#+begin_quote

You have yet to actually give a reason for this. There is literally a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu#Government][country]] in the real world that has 11,000 people. And it works. It has a government.

Hold on, we're not talking about expanding the wizarding population to what it is now for us. We're talking about /sustaining/ the wizarding population. All those 10,000 need to do is /stay/ at 10,000. And with the longer lives of wizards added into the mix, this is easy.

As for the rest of your comment, I think I'm going to go with the actual scientists on that stuff.

[[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated/]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_population]]

[[https://www.britannica.com/science/minimum-viable-population#ref1215147]]

The most generous of these to your argument is the one stating that you'd need at least 14,000 to populate a planet. And that's if people aren't particularly careful about inbreeding. And that's about populating /a planet/. What we're talking about is people who can live twice as long as the average muggle keeping a steady population.

So /yes,/ 10k is enough.

So the short version is that their parliament has 15 members plus the 10 members of the Prime Minister's cabinet plus the speaker for a grand total of.....27 people. Now, for a small island nation like Tuvalu where it's spread across 3 islands and 6 atolls, meaning they seem to trust major autonomy to the outlying areas.

#+end_quote

Even when Rowling said that 2k of said 10k population is supposed to be in Hogwarts? Let's also not forget that part of that 10k is underage and proof seems to point to most families only having one child while families like the Weasleys are outliers. Hell, even the Patil twins can be considered out of the norm when compared to the Longbottoms, Malfoys, Zabinis, and even the Potters. Hell, even look at the muggleborns and you see that most also only have one kid with the Creevey brothers being the exception.

#+begin_quote
  very steady population.
#+end_quote

And where's your proof on that since you're demanding so much proof from me? For the record, population tends to go down in times of war and Wizarding UK had 2 wars 15 from the end of one to the start of another. America's population dipped 60k when we joined WWI, that's 0.05% of the population. With a wizarding population of 10k, yeah, that's like 6 people but it doesn't make sense as people have pointed out that entire families were wiped out during the First Wizarding War and we have proof that it happened again with the Bones family nearly being wiped out during the Second Wizarding War.

#+begin_quote
  Squibs are a rounding error at best.
#+end_quote

And where does it say that squibs make up a small population? Hell, we don't even know the appropriate percentage of muggleborns as we only have like 2 solid examples out of Harry's year: Hermione Granger and Dean Thomas. Assuming that 40 was accurate, that's 2% of the student population.

#+begin_quote
  longer lives of wizards added into the mix, this is easy.
#+end_quote

Actually, it's not as if you look just at James Potter (Harry's dad), he wasn't born until his own father (Fleamont) was 52....assuming that Fleamont was born in 1908. All we know about Fleamont is that he was born before 1909 so 1908 seems like a safe enough bet while James was born in 1960. The reason that Harry was born while his father was 19-20 was because they were in the midst of a war. The same argument can be made for most of the students for Harry's year and possibly even a few years prior as parents were having kids sooner in hopes of continuing their family line.

I mean, look at the Blacks who had Sirius in their in their early-30s. And the only possible reason for that is that Rowling was bad at maths or they had a different mindset than the Potters.

Also, in relation to your "Magic Number for Space Pioneers Calculated" article, please read the whole thing as then you'd see this part: "A potential concern is that small populations can suffer a damaging reduction in genetic diversity due to inbreeding, says Dennis O'Rourke from the University of Utah. He considered the same 10-generation, 200-year journey as Moore and looked at both genetic drift and inbreeding.

“The decrease in genetic variation is actually quite small and less than found in some successful small populations on Earth,” he says. “It would not be a significant factor *as long as the space travellers come home or interact with other humans at the end of the 200 year period*.”"

I bolded the important part.

Common sense. If the pop is under 100,000 in 1990s, then if we were to use the muggles as a standard, there would be like... 5 wizards around the time Hogwarts was built or something. And that's dumb. (But not as dumb as the implications of millions of wizards in the UK alone.)

That's a huge freaking difference from 10,000 people merely sustaining their population to about 10,000.

Quidditch is probably a much bigger percentage of the overall wizard economy than professional sports are in the real/Muggle one, where major competitors exist like movies and concerts. There doesn't seem to be the same diversity of entertainment in the much smaller magical world - Quidditch is the only form of entertainment we see that draws big crowds. I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that it's something like 5% of the total magical economy, which would translate into hundreds of people earning their living from it.

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention that you need a certain population base to fill stadiums, youth programs, make merchandise profitable and the like. And that's just one sport.
#+end_quote

Wizards don't have to spend the resources to build a stadium. A few skilled wizards can probably set up a Quidditch pitch and some stands in a day. If they can get a few hundred people to come at a few Galleons each, that's hundreds of Galleons for a few days work. If you can schedule a game every week, that's probably more than enough to support 13 organizations of a few dozen players and support staff.

Youth programs wouldn't be necessary; promising players would just be recruited right out of Hogwarts by the teams' coaches.

Merchandise is probably just subcontracted to the standard craftsmen in Diagon Alley, then sold at a mark up. There's no reason you'd need a lot of people to make that profitable, and it's just supplemental anyway. The entire thing could probably be profitable just with ticket sales.

Not really. Canon was written (or at least published) over a period of 10 years and has been through professional editing. My point is it was more or less a job for the people involved. While fanfiction is often a hobby for authors which they try to fit in with their school or job. So canon is more polished than 99% of fanfiction I've come across.

Plus canon has a certain innocence that fanfiction lacks. It brings many memories with it, while I started reading fanfiction much later and that doesn't bring any memories of waiting or anticipation. I don't mind stuff like gore, sex and profanity, but it needs to be used the right way. Many fics overdo it by having sex or gore every alternating chapter. This can get boring quickly. It loses its novelty. While on the other hand, Molly yelling "Not my daughter, you bitch!" or George losing an ear have a much bigger and shocking impact because it's unexpected.

** I generally differentiate pretty well between canon and fanon so I'm never really shocked when I do a reread and find something different than a fanfic that I read, but I do prefer certain aspects of fanon over canon. (For example, I don't buy into all the borderline medieval magical nobility that some fics have, but I like the idea that there is a kind of high society based on family name, even if it might not mean anything.)

To be honest, although I'm the resident HP encyclopedia among my friend group, I don't really recommend Harry Potter as a book series anymore. For one, it's popular enough that it's not a new recommendation. But mostly, I see a significant part of why I love it so much being that there's a whole community around a) building off of canon, b) "fixing" canon, c) exploring something that canon didn't. I think it's amazing to see how creative we can get.

** When I do get around to re-reading canon, I really appreciate how edited down the books are. So many fanfics I read are very long -- longer than the books -- and obviously have not been edited to be completely concise and focused and not drag on with useless scenes.

When it comes to canon divergences a lot of fics do, I'm usually thinking, why didn't X do Y instead? I also read a lot of time travel fix fics so the lack of heavy time travel in canon can be annoying.
