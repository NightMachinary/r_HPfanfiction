The details of the fic is that Hermione catches Harry masterbating in the common room, she gives him a handjob and they end up having sex. Ron catches, pretty much runs off heartbroken.

Ron ends up having angry sex with Draco, who then uses it to blackmail Ron.

Hermione and Ron forgive each other and end up having sex in the Room of Requirement when Ginny and Harry lock them in there; meanwhile the fic end with Harry and Ginny having sex in the common room.

I think it's the start of a series, so if anyone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.


** Huh, I don't think I've ever read any Ron/Draco before. What an unusual pairing

**** Yeah, my mind stopped at Harry thinking the COMMON ROOM is the best place to masturbate.

***** Never doubt the teenage male and their ability to masturbate anywhere, no matter how dangerous it is. We call it a danger wank.
