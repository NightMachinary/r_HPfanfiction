First-time poster and first-time fanfic author here. I started posting chapters of my first fanfic a few months ago, but it has gotten nowhere near as much attention as other fics of similar length. It's sitting at 65k words and just under 1.5k hits on ao3. Now I've seen a lot of people say that they also struggle with getting readership (and yes, I know that readership shouldn't be what motivates you because you should write for yourself) but I've noticed that other fics at least get some /hits/, even if they don't get reviews. I've wondered why my fic is so invisible, even edited my summary a bunch of times to no avail. I've been thinking either my fic has just got a really crappy premise (which could always be the case of course) or it could be because it doesn't have any ships in the tags. I'm going to have pairings in it eventually, but right now the characters haven't even gotten old enough to be paired with one another (they're in 3rd year). I didn't want to tag the ships until the characters at least /sort of/ got to the flirty stage, because I didn't want to anger anyone that read my fic up till now to find out that their ship doesn't even happen yet. I've been tossing up just adding the main ship, but Harry hasn't even /met/ them yet. Any thoughts? Has anyone else experienced this? When you added the shipping tags, did readership go up? Or are fics that are very genfic-y just have much smaller readerships? Thanks in advance and sorry for any noobishness.

Ao3 is not a place where you will get a lot of attention. I have a fic called "No Longer Alone" on FFN where it sits at 260k hits and 2200 follows. On Archive, it has 4200 hits and 115 kudos. That's simply the nature of Ao3.

  reviews
#+end_quote

I had two PM exchanges on archive which resulted from reviews, and both times it was me reviewing other stuff. Meanwhile, on FFN each update gets me a few PMs. Ao3 is praised for its culture of dialogue, but I have yet to find evidence of it even existing.

Are not a guarantee for success, unless it's a popular queer pairing because that's where the reader-base is to be found. Although I think that this is more to the fact that Ao3 allows you to search for F/F fics as well as specific pairings, which makes it a lot easier to find rarepairs.

To be fair, although I am much more active on AO3, I follow a lot of recs from this sub to FFN, and your fic was one of them. The AO3 Harry Potter fandom is 1/4 the size of the FFN fandom by fic count, and as you noted elsewhere a lot more of it leans queer. But there is a lot of discussion under the fics I read and follow.

I really like this fic, and I'm gonna give it a re-read to catch myself up soon.

Yeah, I have a Hermione/Tonks oneshot and it was not very popular on FFN. It used to be my only fic more successful on Archive until TemporalKnight came along and promoted it in a chapter of "Potters against the world". That were a few fun days with a hundred emails each.

Also, I'm glad you enjoy my other fics.

My experience is extremely similar to yours. I get way more feedback from FFN, and when I reply to reviews about half the time they respond back. On AO3 I get about a tenth of the response and no one has replied yet.

** Try promoting it here? I have searched by ship before so gens wouldn't come up. What I really care about is /avoiding/ ships so if I think a fic just has untagged ships I might skip it for that reason... I once came across a fic that was MARKED HHr where Dramione happened.

I have read quite a few gen fics that were recced here or in the discord though. I particularly like when people rec stuff on the discord and I can just ask questions, or more often, read the answer because someone else has already asked.

*** that's a good idea actually. I haven't been in this sub for long, so I didn't know if it was okay to do (as I said, noob). thanks for responding! I'm gonna have another look at the plot plans for now (I spent a few months away from the fic and only just got back) so I think I'll just draft up a bit more and add the tags once I'm 100% sure of the direction I'm going in.

*** yeah that's a good idea. I'll tag them as slow burn, given that someone else said that some people will skip fics if they're worried a pairing they don't like will show up. thanks!

I've actually cross posted to ffn already, and it's got slightly better results there. I'll just have to keep going with it and see where it ends up. :)

** Well, the thing is fanfiction in ye olden days (+15 years ago) was much more segregated than it is today, with sites like say the die hard Sink Into Your Eyes for H/G fans. This meant pairing was usually how people actually looked for fanfiction (and indeed this often why people get into ff in the first place).

Fast forward to today, now most of these have shutdown and agglomerated into a handful of broader websites like [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and [[https://archiveofourown.com][archiveofourown.com]], with a few broader niches like DLP, spacebattles and sufficientvelocity holding out as commentary/critique sites and forums. Thing is though, most people get into and stay in the fandom mainly for the cliches and pairings, which is why the primary search category ends up being pairing, characters, and genres.

By the time they have 'grown' beyond just looking for pairing, 90% of people have lost interest and/or moved onto other fandoms to do...well basically the same thing. This makes gen fics difficult to get readership in general, because most gen fics are more like actual novels than the bulk of the pairing/character/wish-fulfillment fics I just mentioned. Those are, if anything, more analogous to trashy romance novels you see at airport stalls and trucker stops.

*And no, I don't mean this to offend people who like or read pairing exclusive stories*. Its merely an observation born from the trends in this and other fandoms, not meant as derogatory against peoples' individual tastes.

*** It's also because when a fic doesn't focus on pairings, it has to rely on the skill and originality of the author to carry it. A task that many fanfic writers are not up to. This is by no means me throwing shade at any authors on the sub, just a comment on Sturgeon's Law in general. I myself have a few incomplete fics out there that are just crap.

*** the thing is, I love a fic with a good romance subplot. I swear they used to be everywhere, but now it's either "genfic with no romance at all" or "basically just a romance fic" with no in between. I don't think it helps that I want my fic to go in the m/m direction either, given that that alienates fics even more for a lot of people. this isn't just for hp fics necessarily, just something I've noticed in fandoms in general. oh well. I just want to write it for myself more than anything, and if it makes even a few people happy, that's all I could ask for.

** Ao3 search engine is an amazing feature and maybe that is why you are not getting not that much rec: I, for instance, often search through pairings, so your fic would never get into my radar as a result.

Maybe is that, maybe it is not.

** Hi [[/u/hava_97]]! I've read this fic and I've commented on it before! You're a great writer, and it was pleasant to read (in terms of spelling, grammar and style). From what I remember of this fic, for me the issue was that Lily... Was disappointing. She's the woman who defeated Voldemort and yet she lets Narcissa Malfoy push her around like some kind of Mean Girl. She tells her son to stay out of trouble and not fight against blood purism.

Another thing I rather disliked is that the "racist" characters in the fic, Narcissa and Draco, seem to be shown to having a rich inner life. An inner life that the narrative respects, if not the protagonists. It's just not my cup of tea, I much preferred J K Rowling making these characters look ridiculous (as well they should be given their ideology). This is just my preference, I wouldn't take it as an indicator of the quality of the fic.

For me, having one of Harry's parents survive would change so much. And you have changed so much, its not nearly as bad as that Everybody Lives series. But I just see certain things as being that way for the sake of dramatic tension and it grinds my gears. I guess the feeling of not being listened to or thought delusional (Lily believing that her other son survived) is a rich well for tension and drama but for me it just makes me mad.

I bookmarked it and resolved to read it again when it was finally complete. Because at the stage the fic was in when I first read it, it was just too annoying to me.

*** heya! I remember you! you gave me a bit to think about then when you commented, and even more now! I'll definitely give what you've said a good think through, I think i just didn't develop lily's side of the story very well, because I totally see your points. I focused much more on her sons' stories when i was planning it, plus this is my first time trying to write a big fic, so there were bound to be weaknesses. thanks for giving me some great feedback!

** From what I can remember of fic site statistics, I feel like AO3's readerbase is more skewed towards pairing-centric fiction, and romance fiction will therefore get more readership and traction. (It's just a mad theory of mine, but I think being able to very easily filter characters and pairings seperately makes the pairing-minded more likely to use AO3 over other sites with different navigation structures.) Try not to compare your fanfic to stories in different genres, since those genres will have different levels of popularity. I agree with other posters here that crossposting to fanfiction.net might help, since I personally am a gen fan and find most of my favorite reads there as well.

** I suppose my romance story gets proportionately more views but that's coming from an extremely low base. Romance is somewhat more popular than gen, but I don't think it makes as much difference as people say. I struggled to get much attention on any of my fics and I don't expect it to change now. Sadly, I think it's my writing people don't like.
