:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hermione x Snape

I have been trying to find this fanfic and I need help.

Things I remember: 1) Ron didn't want kids. Hermione has a binder with names picked out.

2) Severus found her crying in the hall.

3) hermione's parents has a home for squib children.

4) Hermione and Severus set Harry and draco up with each other.

5) The last time I read there was only pile 15 chapters but it was being updated regularly.

That's all I remember!
