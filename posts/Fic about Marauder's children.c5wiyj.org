I've never found a fic with Marauders children in it, i think it sounds quite interesting, can't imagine why no one had this idea before. I'm especially interested in a fic where Remus has a daughter and Sirius a son, and the daughter inherits the werewolf gene.


** We have a whole series about one of them lol.

In all seriousness, the linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) fic has Sirius' daughter in it, but I don't think that's quite what you're looking for.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
