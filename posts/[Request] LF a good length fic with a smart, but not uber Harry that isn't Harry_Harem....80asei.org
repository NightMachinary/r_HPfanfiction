... and doesn't have bashing or tons of angst. Something similar to linkffn(To Shape and Change) linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), linkffn(Only a Boy) (Okay, Harry isn't the mc in this one but something like would be amazing.), and linkao3(C'est La Vie). Preferably with a good mentor/student relationship between Harry and Snape that doesn't have either of them out of character.

Although, I am fine with bashing if it is similar to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) where it gets better as the fic goes on.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** linkffn(11591125) Should have what you want, it has a smarter and more motivated Harry than in canon, but without making him OP. All of the major players, namely Voldemort and Dumbledore are less irrational than in canon, and sequel fics through fourth year are complete, increasing drastically in length (fourth year is 250k words) with a fifth year in progress. Enjoy!
