:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been on a bit of a teacher Harry trip lately, and remembered reading this one fic where he officially taught DADA while still being a regular student otherwise, and I really feel like rereading it.

​

Might have been fifth year. It wasn't really the main plot point or anything, more something that just kind of happened, possibly a kind of continuation/evolution of the DA. I remember some awkwardness over having to teach his peers and the upper years. I think it was Harry/Hermione and Hermione helped with lesson plans. Could have been a Time Travel fic, I read a lot of those.

​

Only thing I'm 100% sure of is the teaching thing, take the rest with a grain of salt, I might be mixing up half remembered things from other fics.

​

Help would be super appreciated!

*** That sounds like linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste) Harry and Hermione pretend to be the Carrows so the death eaters don't realize that Hogwarts is no longer run by them. They also take classes at the same time. The fic didn't go into much detail regarding their time teaching though.
