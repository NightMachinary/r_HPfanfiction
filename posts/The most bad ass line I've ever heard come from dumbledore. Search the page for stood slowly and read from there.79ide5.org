** The scene is Dumbledore confronting Malfoy the elder about the Chamber of Secrets.

"There's no way you can prove that it was me, Dumbledore. And if you could there is no one that would believe you over me. If you can't remember Dumbledore, I am the reformed gentleman that gives to charity. You, on the other hand, are the old man that allowed an innocent boy to die in the hands of his muggle relatives." Dumbledore placed his wand on his desk

With a smug look, Lucius shook his head. "You need to realize that you're irrelevant now, like a relic from the past."

And he stood, readying himself to leave the office when he found that he couldn't move his body. Nothing was responding to his command. His hands wouldn't clench, his feet wouldn't walk and his chest wouldn't expand; leaving no room for him to take a breath. He began to panic when he realized that he could suffocate in the middle of the headmaster's office in Hogwarts.

Dumbledore stood slowly. "Lucius, I will not slander your name to the press. I will not bring you up charges or have you investigated. I will come for you myself. You need to realize that I am from a time when power stood for something." With a wave of his hand Lucius was released. "And I still have that power."

Gone was the smug look, replaced with anger as Malfoy stalked out of the room."

***** Hmmm... well, of the top of my head, I thought his speech to Quirrelmort in "Weasley Girl" with the "three problems" he had with giving him the Philosopher's Stone, even if he currently has Fem!Ron as a hostage was pretty badass.

Well... not really the lines in and of themselves, but more the way he says them so completely casually, and remains calm and polite, like it's no big thing, even as he effortlessly trounces Quirrelmort after a distraction from Harry.

#+begin_quote
  "The Stone?" said Dumbledore, still calmly as ever. "Ah yes, I thought you might want to make that particular demand. There are only two --- no, make that *three* problems with that. The first one is that I have no intention of giving you the Stone."

  "Then... she dies!" Voldemort snarled.

  Harry knew the time had come. He pulled the fifty-pence coin out of his pocket and threw it. And, luck over all luck, hit Quirrell right in the forehead. The former Defence teacher took a startled step back, and Harry took the opportunity to grab hold of Ronnie and pull her in under the Invisibility Cloak. As he had hoped, Voldemort had failed to give her any orders on what to do if she was unexpectedly grabbed --- and so she was like a limp rag doll in his grasp, not even bothering to struggle.

  "What --- no!" Quirrell yelped, turning around, hand on his forehead as Ronnie suddenly became invisible to him.

  "The second problem is that you are one hostage short," said Dumbledore, flicking his wand in Quirrell's direction.

  Quirrell once again raised a shining silver shield around himself, but Dumbledore's spell, whatever it was, hit it with such force that it shattered, sending Quirrell to the floor, and his wand almost flying out of his hand before it hit the floor and rolled away. The former Defence teacher was on his stomach, panting and wheezing, his turban starting to come undone.

(The third problem is more of a plot twist, so I won't quote that in case you decide you want to read the fic sometime.)

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** Really similar scene in linkffn(Forging the Sword):

Grey eyes narrowed. "You have no proof of any wrongdoing on my part."

"If I had," the Headmaster said, every word precise, "you would no longer retain possession of your wand. Or your faculties."

Side note: If anyone hasn't read Forging the Sword, you should. It's fantastic.

**** What [[/u/fflai]] mentioned is sadly correct. The story doesn't have any real self-contained arcs. But, it's a realistic representation of a smarter Harry. Harry keeps his core traits, his conviction, courage, and single-minded focus. So many smart!Harry stories cop out and corrupt his character, rather than take the long road and write a realistic smart!Harry

**** I actually completely read it today. No, sadly it doesn't, not in its current state. It actually stops just as the first "real" action-part and worldbuilding would begin, sadly.

It is a great beginning for a fic - but definitely nothing satisfying as it is in my opinion, because no arc is really finished.

Contrast that with - for example - Santi's "Wrong Boy Who Lived" or Rakeesh's "A Long Journey Home" which have finished arcs, but leave room for more, and thus are more worthwile to read.
