*this is the start of a ff, please bear with me. (I wrote this, btw)*

In a shadowy but lit-up room of a run-down Orphanage in London, a baby cried.

He cried softly, not whiny and screaming like other babies, but quietly, like he knew not to disturb anyone. The mother was pale, moments from death as she clutched the arm of the Matron, Mrs. Cole, who looked on slightly worriedly.

"T-Tom, Tom Marvolo Riddle." She sounded exhausted and weak, her grip feeble. Mrs. Cole wrote it down quickly, showing it to the mother for any spelling errors. The mother nodded in relief.

"Yes... named after my father and the man I loved. I hope he will grow up to look just like his father." With that, she closed her eyes and fell into a deep unconsciousness. She would be dead soon, and there was nothing Mrs. Cole or anyone else could do about it.

"Funny name, Marvolo." Mrs. Cole muttered, glancing at the baby, Tom, who was eerily silent, staring up at her with swirling dark brown eyes. When the light shined on him, they almost looked a sheen of dark blue, like the night sky. Mrs. Cole turned away and sighed, shaking her head as she hurriedly left the room to get a volunteer girl to take care of the new baby. The room was silent now, except for the constant crackling of the small fire in the soot-filled fireplace. A shadowy figure crept up from a corner he was hiding in. His fluffy tail swished side to side, his emerald-green eyes never once leaving Tom's small form. The dark-grey cat padded forward until he was right in front of the near-broken cradle which held the baby. A whoosh of air engulfed the cat and suddenly a human figure replaced the feline creature. He looked seventeen, with messy raven-black hair and pale skin, although you could tell he'd been out in the sun a lot. His bright emerald-green eyes seemed sad as he reached out a hand to Tom. The baby's dark brown eyes sharpened as the hand got closer, but he slowly accepted it and gripped it as tightly as he could with his chubby fingers. Mine, he seemed to say possessively. The man laughed quietly, his slender fingers running through Tom's chocolate brown curls, making the baby blink sleepily.

"I'll be here when you need me." The man said softly, tearing his hand away. Tom was already asleep, and the man was gone, replaced by a cat once more. The cat meowed and slunk back to the corner it stood in before, watching silently as Mrs. Cole re-entered the room noisily with a young, blonde-haired girl who's name he gathered was "Lucy" by her name tag. She looked shy, but loving as she picked up Tom and cradled him in her arms.

"He's your charge now Lucy, at least until he's grown a bit." Mrs. Cole commanded, and Lucy nodded.

"I'll take care of him well." She said determinedly, and Mrs. Cole's expression softened a bit.

"I have no doubt." She responded before leaving the room once more. Lucy sat down on the ratty chair and hummed "Greensleeves" as she fed Tom out of a bottle. The cat settled down in the corner, closing his eyes sleepily. Perhaps he didn't know exactly what he was doing. Maybe Tom was irredeemable. Maybe it was written in the stars that he was destined to become the Dark Lord. If that was the case, then Harry would tear down the stars and rewrite destiny. Because he believed that Tom could be a better person. He believed that Dark Lords weren't born, they were made, and they could be unmade, because nothing was evil unless you say it was. And Harry says Tom isn't.

*so... thoughts everyone? would ygs read it if I posted on ao3? the gist is that Harry's MOD and he went back in time to change things concerning Tom Riddle. No slash. More like, friend!Harry or olderbrother!Harry to Tom. This is my first post, so please lmk if I did something wrong!*


** Better written than most fan-fictions with this trope. Some thoughts/Sugesstions/Advice:

Are you planning on giving Harry a backstory? If you do, It is better to tell it through interactions and what he reveals to Tom rather than writing a backstory chapter or through a bunch of flashbacks. Maybe make Tom learn of Harry's "past" like how Harry learned of Dumbledore's relationship with Grindewald.

Are you going to make Harry adopt Tom or manipulate him from the shadows? If He is going to adopt him, don't make Tom go to Slytherin. Make him go to other houses instead.

Is Harry the only one back in Time? I would expect Ron and Hermione or maybe Ginny(provided they survived the war) would want to help him in this endeavour. Come to think of it, I have never read a Golden Trio time travel story.
