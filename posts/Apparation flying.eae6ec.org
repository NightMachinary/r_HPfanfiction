If you could turn your body whilst apparatimg and your momentum carries through the apparation you could have some when falling from very high heights. When you almost reach the ground you apparate your body to flip upside down and shoot back upwards with your momentum. You could also apparate back to the top and keep falling endlessly.


** Doesn't Apparating require strong concentration? I don't imagine many people will be able to concentrate on the three D's while in free fall. (Well, apart from paratroopers, I suppose. Though even they are awesome they are still muggles) And regardless even if someone does manage it the whiplash from changing direction and speed so quickly could still injure them.

*** You don't get whiplash because it would basically work like portals from 'Portal' (Only without portals)

But yeah it would be mindblowingly difficult. Get a broom or something. Or just apparate to your destination instead of playing stupid games

** Something like this happens in The Havok side of the force. linkffn(8501689). Its a comedy crossover with Star Wars and it has scenes of harry doing just what you mention. /Spoiler/ He even kills Dath Maul that way

Edit: Its incomplete with long periods between updates.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
