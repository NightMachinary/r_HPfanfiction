You read the books? For me it's been way too long. I've read more fanfic then the actual books. So I was wondering, when was the last time you read the books, and if you read your favorite fanfics more often. (I do, Poisoned Pen is my fav)


** Lowkey haven't read a book in years, read fanfic all the time.. I feel a little guilty about it

*** I've started forcing myself to read at least one real book in between every complete fanfic I read. Reading fanfics is easy because you're already invested in that world. It's much harder to immerse yourself into a new world.

It's been quite liberating, though. It's also prompted me to read 6 books this year that I probably wouldn't have otherwise. I'm reading American Gods right now and it's managed to hook me into it.

***** It's just one book, and I'm roughly halfway through so far.

It's a little disjointed, but given the premise, I think it's intentional on the part of the author to make you feel the way the main character does - in over his head and lost in a world that doesn't make sense to him anymore.

I'll reserve final judgement until I actually finish the book, but if it keeps the pace and the thrills building into a satisfying conclusion, I think it will be a very high rating indeed.

** Just finishing up the last book now, actually. It's been very refreshing to see all that I've long since forgotten about come back to me. I'd recommend anyone who hasn't read them in a few years do the same. If for no other reason than it will allow you to judge the quality and characterisation of fanfics better.

** I always wait a year until I reread the books. This time I am reading them in English for the first time. I love them but I am struggling to finish the first one because it kind of bores me - I also had that struggle the first time I read it. (Not that it's bad but the darker themes of the later books are more interesting for me)

But I can't get over the year without fanfictions. They are my save heaven and they give me some variety, canon can't compete with.

** I haven't read the full books in a while but I end up reading several scenes across multiple books when I'm about to write a character I don't feel confident with. I try not to read too much fic when writing in case it influences what I'm writing, but I probably ha e read fic more recently than an entire book.

** I read the 1st-4th a while back (7mo ago?) when reading a proper set up ‚Äúcharacters read the books fic.‚Äù Typically those stories tread the plagiarism line, but I found one that if you had the actual HP books open in your lap one could read in them, then jump back to the fanfic story and then back to the HP books, etc. I think the author had to lock the story though, I'm on the email list and get sent a link when she writes a new chapterü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Beyond that, it's been years.

I've probably read chunks of the 7th book the most. For instance, anytime I end up watching Part 1+2 of the 7th movie I often have to re-read (or listen to audio book) book 7. Specifically re-reading ch 36 The Flaw in the Plan (when HP wakes up in the forest from his weird Dumbledore kings cross dream) to the end. Honestly, because the dramatic fight scene in movie 7 part 2 pisses me off---all the loose ends that were tied up in the book were tossed to the wind for a dramatic light show battle in the movie. I know they were competing w/ Twilight's movies at the time---but even the final Twilight movie Break Dawn part 2 was able to squeeze in their dramatic movie-only fight scene and then flashback to what actually happened, which was true to the book.

Anyway, yah you're right, I turn to fanfics when I get an HP craving long before I go to pull out my cannon HP books.

** Haven't actually read the books. My mom read them aloud to me when I was a kid, and she continued doing that even as I grew up and learned to read for myself. It was a fun little tradition...

Nowadays I reference PDF versions of the text when I need details for a fanfic, but I haven't touched a physical copy since middle school --- and I'm a grown man living on his own now.

** I only re-read when I need to confirm something for my fics, but even that's usually a ctrl-F to find what I need. As for a /full/ re-read, I don't think I've done that since before HBP came out. I dislike the later books so I have a hard time making it through the entire series.

** More than a decade ago. Haven't read DH since release, the others before then.

This means that I am more influenced by movie portrayal of characters than what is shown in the books, which is likely to affect my view of some people.

The main one that comes to mind is Severus Snape. I am told that movie-Severus acts in a far more redeemable way (his worst portrayed action after his turning away from the Death Eaters in the movies boils down to being Neville's Boggart, and he apparently did far less inexcusable things than in the books, the only truly bad point being his awful teacher persona). He still has the same biggest personality flaw -- inability to let go of his past (his view of Marauders and Lily are stuck in the past just like in the books) -- but his actions are generally portrayed in a better light.

*** That's a shame. With Worm especially, because there isn't a single piece of fanfiction that comes close to touching the original series. With HP that's more debatable, since the fandom has seen a ton of great authors come and go, but I still find myself reading the books every year and still enjoying them.

** I go back every so often, at least every year, though admittedly I don't always finish, nor do I always choose to read the entire series. I like the tone of the early books more, so I tend to just pick and choose parts of the later books that I like, and only read the other parts as reference material.

** I'm actually almost done with DH right now, but it's been slow progress because I've been reading the series to my kids. So to answer the question, I guess I've been very slowly rereading them for the past year or so. Lol But before that, it had been an embarrassingly long time. I think that I'm going to give them another read myself once I finish up with the read aloud.
