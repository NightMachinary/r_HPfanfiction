Hi there,

Long time lurker in this sub, first time poster. After reading "Harry Potter and The Cursed Child" and FULLY expecting Scorbus to become a canonical reality (only to be let down by the Scorose ending that essentially came OUT OF NOWHERE), I was hoping that those of you well-versed in fan fiction could point me towards some well-written, well-developed SLASH of Scorpius and Albus.

As a writer myself, I find that I am drawn to FF that is on the longer, more detailed side - I also vastly prefer stories that remain respectful to the established canon of the original 7 novels and prior to the events of CC, rather than going off into an AU.

Thank you so much for your help and for any suggestions you have that could point me in the right direction!

-KayDavid

PS: I apologize if a thread discussing this subject already exists - I used the search function several times with several different wording combinations and I still came up empty!

(edited for clarity regarding the canon timeline I'm looking for!)


** Scorbus sounds like some sort of cleaning thing you'd buy off a Billy Mays (RIP)-wannabe informecial at 2 AM on a Tuesday.

*** To me it sounds like a disease. Scorbus, the retarded cousin of scabies.

Not trying to start arguments about what is canonical/not, but will it be okay that it's too soon for fics to incorporate CC? There might be some CC-compliant one-shots but nothing long like you're looking for

*** Sorry! I entirely meant the established canon PRIOR TO the events of CC - I need to go back and edit my original post to be more clear!

Thanks for your response!

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/115114][Irradiance]] is well written and really good but super depressing. Linkao3(115114). This fic is locked so you need to make an Ao3 account to see it if you don't already have one.

I liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4605858/chapters/10496574][Summer Boys]] a lot. It's not too plotty, but it's well written and pretty detailed character development IMO. Linkao3(4605858).
