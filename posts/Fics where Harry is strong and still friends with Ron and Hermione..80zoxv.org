There's this trend in fanfiction where if the fic has Harry become powerful or more intelligent than canon, then he either doesn't become friends with Ron and Hermione, or stops being friends with them. So I'm looking for fics where Harry grows stronger, and still stays friends with Ron and Hermione.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): After his little excursion into the SW universe, Harry got magnitudes powerful. Hermione and Luna literally threw themselves at him, while Ron and Ginny became his loyal 'minions'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Harry is very ambitious, manipulative, and powerful in this fic. Even though he fell out with Ginny, he remained extremely close with all of them, and they all gave him good advice in dealing with Daphne.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Harry grew very powerful and politically savvy in the 2nd half of the story, and their friendship became even stronger.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]], linkffn(5270746): Fairly typical indy!Harry fic with lots of cliches, but Ron, Hermione, and even Molly remain close to him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): They grew dark and powerful together. Best of my recommendations in this thread.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
