Basically what i am looking for is a traditional wrong boy who lives fic. With Harry's brother being famous, James and Lily being alive and Harry neglected. However Dumbledore while helping [Harry's brother] and having close ties to the Potter isn't completly evil. He tries to do what's best, but because of it loses sight of the smaller picture. He saw Harry as a supportive brother to [Harry's brother]. However later he realises the damage done to Harry and seeks redemption. He can still be helping [Harry's brother], because he's the boy who lives and needs training. But is also supportive of Harry. He apologizes to Harry about his part in Harry's neglect.

So this way we get a traditional wrong boy who lives story, but with Dumbledore not being an enemy. Other characters can still take on different roles and the Light/Grey/Dark (political) conflict can still be there with the various leaders. Sirius and Remus can either support Harry or [Harry's brother]. I don't have much of preference on the Malfoys or pairings either. But the main twist that i am looking for is Dumbledore being guinely kind and out to help and make a better world. And trying to earn Harry's Forgiveness.

I hope i made clear what i meant. Please ask any question for clarification and if you found a fic or wanna write one like this please let me know and give a link when possible. It would be much appreciated :)


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is pretty much what you look for. Though I need to note that it's also pretty heavy AU in terms of setting, with most of changes being for the worse. But the plot is intriguing, characterisation is decent and the funny moments are actually funny. Sadly currently its update rate slowed which makes reading it as it comes out annoying due to million sideplots stalling story progress. I recommend reading first two years (skip prologue, it's better that way) and waiting for the weekly update rate to return.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Not 100% youre looking for, i wouldnt say completely OP harry, but pretty there. Raised by Snape while the Potters take care of the wbwl, his brother. Dumbledore is the one who set it up. Not finished, may never bebut what has been written is very enjoyable. Cant really complain since what is there is quite a bit, 72 chapters. Very little actual dumbledore

** Saving Connor is a complete, 6 book series with P much that exact plot. Harry is actually trained to protect Connor's (the brother) innocence. He works in the shadows to kill all the bad guys so Connor can stay innocent and pure of heart. One thing I like about it is that Connor isn't some horrible demon from hell, he's pretty much what a normal Harry that was raised by his parents would be like. He's got prejudice for slytherins, but it's never worse than in Canon, but because you are reading from Harry's pov, you can see how in some cases it's uncalled for.

Disclaimer: I haven't actually read the whole series, but just going by the characterization of Dumbles from what I have read, he's definitely not an evil manipulative bastard, and he's really trying to do the right thing, he just got the wrong BWL.
