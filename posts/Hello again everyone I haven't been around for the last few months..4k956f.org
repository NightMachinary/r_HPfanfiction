Any promising fics started in the past few months?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** welcome back friend! and not really to my knowledge... I Have been delving deeper into the Naruto Fandom so HP has been on a back burner for me. oh P.S. the cookies are on the counter to your left. That changed recently. The dark Side lost their monopoly on the cookies.

** *The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877): interesting three way wars between the British Ministry under Lucius Malfoy, exiled French Order under Dumbledore, and Voldemort. It's also a nice Ron/Hermione romance, who were initially caught on opposing sides.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
