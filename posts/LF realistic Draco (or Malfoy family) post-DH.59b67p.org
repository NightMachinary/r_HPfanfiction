One of my biggest pet-peeves about Deathly Hallows is the lack of redemption or destruction concerning Draco. I'm interested in fics that portray him as grey/complicated dealing with the post-war fallout. He can be redeemed, but the canon emotional ugliness and smallness can't simply be glossed over. Any pairing but slash. If you don't know a Draco specific fic but do know one that has a good generalization of the post-war Malfoys, that's okay too.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]] is a decent Draco examines his life fic (realizing most of his life has been about cowardice). Also a decent "pureblood living among muggles" story (stupid muggles can't even keep their homes warm -- a year later, oh, that's how you control the heat). linkffn(6432055)

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

*** I wish this had a sequel. I got so excited about Draco and Harry at Hogwarts and then it just ends before the real fun can begin :(

Also there wasn't enough Harry/Daphne interaction. It was really fun in the beginning and then it focused almost completely on the Hermione fiasco.

Still, the fic overall was great and is pretty much exactly what the OP is looking for.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** The Starting over universe features a realistic Malfoy IMO, though he doesn't have a very predominate role. I'd call him a side character but his appearances are some of my favorite scenes in the story.
