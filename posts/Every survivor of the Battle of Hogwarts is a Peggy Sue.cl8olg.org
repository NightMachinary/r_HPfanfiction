Rough Outline

After Harry defeats Voldemort,everyone begins to celebrate before the Dark Lord's corpse explodes in a flash of blinding light

When Harry recovers,he discovers he is back in his eleven year old body,waiting in the Entrance Hall to be sorted

When he looks around,he sees almost all of his yeargroup (all of them eleven as well) looking around in confusion and horror .

The doors to the Great Hall then swing open as an extremely flustered Mcgonagall emerges being flanked by Flitwick and Sporut and followed by the younger versions of Cho,George,The Chasers and Oliver

McGonagall clears her throat

"It seems we have an predicament"


** Question: is it only the good guys that get thrown back in time, or do the surviving Death Eaters (read: the Malfoys) and those affiliated with them go back too?

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

**** Yes it is, but this is Magical Britain, an isolated, throwback to almost Victorian Britain. It may seem normal in 2019 UK, but in a rural or aristocratic community form 40/50 years ago would not, and that is what I believe JKR based herself in. I'm confident no character in her books uses /issue/ in that sense. I'm normally reluctant to make corrections, not my business, but too many anachronisms or Americanisms can put me off. This, I think, would be one.

  Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying.

While you are right in that most uses of "issue" seem to have the "come out" or "issue of a magazine" meaning, there are some instances where "issue" is used as "problem" in the original books.
