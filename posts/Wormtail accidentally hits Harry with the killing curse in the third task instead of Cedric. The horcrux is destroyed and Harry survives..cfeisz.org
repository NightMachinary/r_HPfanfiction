** You probably know this, but I'll point it out because someone must: that wouldn't actually have worked in canon. Voldemort's Killing Curse in the Forest killed Scardemort but not Harry himself for very, very specific reasons, even if not everyone agrees what those reasons were (the Elder Wand not harming its true master? the Love Magic having been transferred into Voldemort's blood and thus preventing him from killing Harry? some combination of the two?).

So if this had happened, Harry would just have died. Presumably the Horcrux would still have been destroyed, but fat lot of use /that/ would be when the one boy whom Prophecy said could defeat the Dark Lord is dead. Unless he hangs around as a ghost and defeats him /that/ way, of course. That would work. But we're digressing.

*** On the other hand, if the prophecy is fulfilled then anyone could probably kill Voldemort. Harry is just the only person who can kill Voldemort (and Voldemort the only one who can kill Harry) as long as neither has yet killed the other and fulfilled the prophecy. After that the survivor is no longer affected by unusual fate and anything could happen.

***** Technically, there is no real reason to believe that Harry needed to be /alive/ to be used in the resurrection. It really just comes down to 'Voldemort thinks only he can/should kill Harry, so none of his Death Eaters are allowed too.' Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken doesn't specify the enemy needs to be alive to be forcibly taken.

*** I thought that canon basically says that prophecies are predictions not fact - they don't dictate the future, only give hints at the most likely outcome at the moment that they are made. As such, not all prophecies come true.

**** Not quite. What we're told in canon is that when they are made, Prophecies only give hints as to /possibilities/, but once one of the people directly concerned by the Prophecy learns the Prophecy and acts on this knowledge, this locks events into place. Hence, if no one had ever repeated the Prophecy, and if Dumbledore had kept himself from using its knowledge, it would have remained up in the air, but once Snape repeated it to the Dark Lord and /he/ bought into it completely, fate was sealed.

***** Mmm, no, it was more like V believing in the prophecy put Harry in danger because V would go after him and his family, and would continue to try to kill him. The danger is from V's reaction to the prophecy, not the prophecy itself. D's discussion with Harry implies that the prophecy doesn't matter - Harry and V are set against eachother and Harry would have stood against V regardless of the prophecy. Ergo, the propchecy predicted Harry's and V's behaviour, not controlled them.

****** What you are describing isn't materially different from my reading; within the context of matters of fate and divination, "locks events into place" meant "we now know definitively that the prophecy is predicting correctly", not "the prophecy will actively enforce its version of events".

In other words, Prophecies in HP accurately predict the sequence of events following from one of their subjects learning of the Prophecy. (They're meta like that.) And this is indistinguishable from "once you learn the Prophecy, it /will/ magically come to pass", even though, of course, the Prophecy doesn't actively /do/ anything.

******* Your answer implied that the root cause of this whole discussion (Peter accidentally killing Harry in the graveyard) would be impossible due to the existance of the prophecy. However, it seems that we both agree that is not the case.

******** But I /do/ think the root would be impossible due to the existence of the Prophecy. I reached the conclusion, above, that Prophecies accurately predict the actions of their subjects in the event that the subjects hear the Prophecy.

Wormtail killing Harry would mean that the Prophecy's bit about how "either must die at the hands of the other" did not accurately reflect what happened after Voldemort heard the Prophecy.

Therefore, if Wormtail were to kill Harry, then the Prophecy would not have been made in those terms in the first place.

(It's the same logic where we know that someone armed with a Time-Turner who met his future self from two hours later /couldn't/ die in the intervening two hours, not because the Time-Turner was magically keeping them alive, but because if they were to die they simply wouldn't have encountered their future self.)

********* Ahh, I see where our thoughts diverge. The day that Trelawny made the prophecy it was a very good prediction of the future. However, I don't believe that the future is written in stone - the prophecy is a prediction that happened to come true mostly because both Harry and V had plot armour and were obsessed with eachother (more V than Harry in the begining). Anytime after the prophecy was made, changes could have happened to the world that would have made it less likely or even unlikely. It's like predicting the weather - the farther away the prediction the less weight the prediction has.

Your example of the time turner is different (IMO) because it gives two fixed points for the timeline that must be met, like a plane that takes off must at some point land.

*** Harry survived the Killing curse in the 7th book because Voldemort had used his blood in his resurrection. That is explicitly stated. So yes he would have died.

Though, after the resurrection, he could've survived a killing curse from anyone. For the life of me, I don't understand why he had to go and let Voldemort kill him.

The prophecy means jack shit anyway. There's no reason for anyone to act on it. And for all that Dumbledore says that the prophecy isn't binding on Harry, he still bases his entire "so-called" plan on it.

It's explicitly stated /that this is what the possibly-hallucinatory Dumbledore in Harry's head thinks happened/, but I think there's enough leeway that fans who prefer to think it's because of the Elder Wand can continue to believe that.

(Personally, I think it's both, and Dumbledore had enough foresight to layer failsafes upon failsafes; there are probably two or three more we don't know about.)

*** I admit I didn't really think of what would cause him to survive, although ghost Harry somehow defeating Voldemort does sound interesting.

IIRC, in the Deathly Hallows I'm pretty sure the death eaters couldn't just kidnap Harry from Privet Drive because of the blood protection keeping him safe (although I may have been mistaken, maybe it was just the house itself. I had always assumed that if Harry were to have the killing curse cast on him it wouldn't properly work, but this probably isn't true).

I just thought it was a cool idea I suppose. Maybe if he were to be hit in the Duel after Voldemort, the protection from Harry's blood would now be inside Voldemort and somehow prevent him from dying, like you mentioned.
