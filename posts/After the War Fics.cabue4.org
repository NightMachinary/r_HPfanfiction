** At some point I'll have to read the rest of Northumbrian's stories on the subject...I enjoyed Strangers at Drakeshaugh (despite the punch to the gut upon realising that the Statute of Secrecy eventually broke up the Charltons' friendship with the Potters), but it's set quite a bit later.

  Annabel has a bad day, and she tries to deal with it as best she can.The last thing she needs is to meet someone else who has hurt her, someone who she hasn't seen in many years. Or is it?Do people really change. Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up?

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on.

** [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803]]

Solid length, has a sequel and 100% complete. Harry is an auror trying to round up the remaining Death Eaters. The inner circle death eaters are working on finishing what Voldemort started. Relationship issues, struggles with the past, and family centric. I haven't read it in a while but I thought it was nice.

​

Linkffn(Life's Interlude)

I haven't read this in a long time but I think it was good? Don't quote me on that. It was either reaaaally underrated or reaaaaally bad I can't seem to remember lol.

  What happened in the 19 years that JKR left blank? This story starts immediately after the battle and covers the four main characters, as well as taking side jaunts to look at the lives of other peripheral characters. Will stick to canon where known, but will attempt to fill in blanks for a lot of secondary characters. M for chapter 5 onward.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

** LeQuin's linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin) I find quite amusing every once in a while. The PTSD comes across as pretty genuine and the sheer mustache-twirliness of the AU Potters as villains is simply hysterical, in a Dick Dastardly sort of way. It has its issues but overall I think it's pretty good.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
