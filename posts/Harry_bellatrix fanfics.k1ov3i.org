Harry/Bellatrix can be a very interesting pairing with time travel before she goes insane but most either give up or the story's suck in one way or another. Is there any good fanfic with Harry/Bellatrix like this because it seems like a good idea if done Right but if there is I've never found it.


** Another fun one I've seen once is harry goes insane like her and the havoc they cause

** Story: Stepping Back [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784]]

This incorporates time travel and includes a lot of Marauder bonding stuff which can be fun to read.
