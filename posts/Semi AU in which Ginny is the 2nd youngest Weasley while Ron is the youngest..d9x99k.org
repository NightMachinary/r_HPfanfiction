Hi there.

I was wondering if there were any fics that has Ginny as the 2nd youngest instead?

It would be interesting to read.


** Then either a) Ron wouldn't exist since Molly finally got her girl

or

b) Ron would be even more neglected than in canon.

*** This is fanfiction. Saying that one change means certain things have to happen just doesn't make sense.

Molly could be a dragonborne who dotes on Ron, the only boy, and abuses her 6 daughters.

*** I don't remember any mention in the books about Molly having 7 children because she wanted specifically a daughter.. Do you have any book quotes on that?

**** I don't believe canon ever makes that claim. It was certainly one of Ron's deepest fears, as the locket Horcrux uses it to try to protect itself:

**** Its entirely probable/possible that they had seven children because its a magically powerful number.

**** She had 6 sons, then 1 daughter, most families seem to have at most 2 kids.\\
It's not stated, but clearly implied
