For fellow Fate fans, here is a prompt with a lot of crack potential.

The 11 he has to take care of are, Castoria, OGtoria, Altoria, Latoria, Lalter, Santa Alter, Lilytoria, Rulertoria, MHX, MHXX and MHXA.

Yes this does mean that he has to manage the appetites of these women.

Yes this does mean that the skimpily dressed ones now wear proper clothes.

Seeing as she is now 11 again along with Lily, MHX and MHXA, Castoria decides to apply to Hogwarts to continue her education. The aforementioned Artorias follow out of curiosity. Shenanigans ensue.

MHXX, OGtoria and Santa Alter decide to become the new security force to keep an eye on them.

Altoria decides to become a merc. This comes into conflict when one of her targets is Dumbledore. She tries to back out because who would be stupid enough to fight /him/?

Finally, Rulertoria, Latoria and Lalter decide to open a casino and manage his finances. Why? Because they're responsible that's why.


** Harry woke up in a darkened room, seated on a table. Unbeknownst to him, upon the same table, 11 other people were seated. If Harry had learned about legends and myths, he would find out that this was a Roundtable.

Suddenly radiant light burst forth, and the darkness shrouding the room disappeared. Harry finally found out that he wasn't alone. Alongside him were 11 other occupants - all women. Some young children like him, some mature adults, some with blonde hair and some with grayed hair.

Harry Potter looked at the the strange gathering of women before him. They all were of differing ages and wore differing clothes, yet they shared a strange similarity. It was as if they were siblings.

A few seconds ago, he was back from the trip to Diagon Alley, resigned to spending the few days he had before Hogwarts began with the Dursleys. And then, he had then been brought here to this strange gathering.

"Hohoho, Harry Potter. You must be wondering who we are and why we have brought you along with us. Well, let me answer this question. We are Arthuria Pendragon and we have come to present you a choice." The speaker was a blonde teenager in a swimsuit. MHX Harry blushed at the exposed skin for a moment.

"The choice is - to live as a hero or die as a mundane person!" The speaker was a regal woman in a strange combination of a ballgown and plated armor. OGArturia Her hand held a glowing sword. A moment later, Harry realized that the sword was illuminating the room.

Harry didn't know how to reply to the strange question. "Live or die?" The hint of murderous intent in the tone shook Harry out of his daze. His body seemed to grow cold upon hearing the voice - life or death would be decided by his reply.

"Live! I want to live!" Harry replied immediately.

"Good child. Maybe you can change your fate." The same woman who brought him panic earlier with three words spoke again. Salter The speaker was another woman - this one a gray haired one with a contrasting armor, ballgown and black sword.

"Harry Potter. You have seven years. In these seven years, you'll face countless trials. Surmounting them, you have to become a true hero. Some of will train you for these trials, while some of us will create trials for you. Carefree days have ended for you, the time of battles has began." The mystical voice like a prophet's belonged to a young girl who looked his age. Ponytailed hair and a slender sword on her hip. Castoria Harry might have had a crush if it wasn't for the bizarre circumstances of their meeting.

"A-are you people going to train me to fight Voldemort? Were you sent by Dumbledore?" Harry could only surmise this.

"Hahaha! Do you think some petty mage could command us? No, we were sent here by the unspoken will of the Master of Chaldea!" The speaker was a mature woman with dark armor and a heavy spear in hand. Lalter

"Master was so excited when the 1st FGO crossover event with Harry Potter was announced and saved so much Saint Quartz to summon you! But when he realized you were utter trash as a SSR, even worse than Scheherazade, he was so distraught!" Harry felt shame for some reason.

"Well of course, he was completely worthless as a hero, relied on luck and was puppeteered by the manipulations of Albus Dumbledore all along! His spellwork is pretty mediocre! His greatest heroic feat, the showcase of his will and determination, was suicide - to a instant death curse! How pathetic!"

Harry grit his teeth. Somehow he had realized what these women were talking about - his future. He would definitely become a hero in the future, a hero that would even kill Voldemort... Yet that much of a legend wasn't enough for the 'Master of Chaldea'. To change that, these women had come...

Arthuria Pendragon... The female version of Arthur Pendragon, the legendary king of Britain. The bearer of a great legend. They had come to rewrite the legend of Harry Potter.

"So be it." Facing the Heroic Spirits bound to the legend of the female Arthur Pendragon and the challenge they gave him, Harry accepted it.

He had no other choice. He would surpass the legend of Harry Potter - his own legend.
