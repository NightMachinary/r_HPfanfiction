It's either good death eaters or "everyone just goes dark suddenly" (can't really remember) after Harry joins Tom and has his own "mini death eaters" (or was it junior?) and the only scene I can remember is a dueling tournament where some of the Weasleys are there and Snape and I think it might be at Malfoy Manor (but it usually is, so I might remember wrong..) I can't get enough defining words for a good google search but if someone here remembers something like that, I'd gladly check if it's the one I remember.


** I'm not sure if I remember that particular scene, but from your description it's probably Abandon (or its sequel, Reclaim) by Batsutousai.

*** Finally back from easter. I think that could be it - after seeing that it was also on ffnet (I'm mostly there, so if it was only at ao3 I'd have guessed probably not). Didn't get around to browsing far enough, but it does ring a bell.
