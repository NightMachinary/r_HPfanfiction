So basically something that feels like a prequel to the original books in terms of style and atmosphere, just set in the Marauder era, preferably near the end of their Hogwarts time leading into the war and death of the Potters. I don't mind romance as long as it's not the main focus.

It has romance (James/Lily, Sirius/Remus) but neither are the main focus. For me, this reminds me of the main books because it although there's war and trouble, there's still happiness.

  It's December of 1976. The Ministry is more concerned about cracking down on werewolves than it is about disappearing Muggleborns, Remus is a lousy prefect but a decent friend, and James has declared that all Christmas gifts must be "creative" this year. Includes strongly worded letters to the editors, Muggle protest tactics, Quidditch games, and a very temperamental Sirius. Happy Christmas!One part a day will be posted from December 1st to December 25th.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
