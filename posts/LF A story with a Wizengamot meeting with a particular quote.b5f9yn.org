Looking for a story, where during a Wizengamot meeting, one of the Dark allied wizards puts forth a rather disgusting law, and one of the Light sided good guys (maybe Harry?) goes "STOP! If any of you support this law, I'll duel you right now (or maybe it is a blood feud)!"

It might be a Harry/Hermione story because the majority of what I've read are stories with that relationship, but it might not be.
