It's been driving me spare, but I just can't seem to find it anywhere. It's an older story, as far as I can remember it was longer than 40.000 words at least.

It's first set many years after the Final battle. An adult/old Harry is disillusioned with Dumbledore (who is long dead), the history behind the war and the current political situation (I think he gets a letter/memories from either Snape or Dumbledore that make him want to seriously re-do things). He gets an opportunity to go back in time to before he was born (so.. time/dimension/parallel universe travel) and resolves to change things. This time period was sometime in the 70s, his parents were still at Hogwarts and he does not develop any kind of significant relationship with them. He does not go to Hogwarts (remains an adult though probably changes his looks).

I think he either helps Riddle stitch back his soul or he sends him a letter telling him why he should do so. He becomes very active in politics, I think he legally takes on a new name that he knows will mess with Dumbledore (.. possibly Peverell) and meets James' father and James/others during his political activities.

He remains in contact with Tom Riddle/Voldemort, and though he did not mean to do so at first, later on partners up with him (a political alliance, possibly pre-slash). Dumbledore was the main political antagonist and towards the end of the fic they exposed some of his machinations publicly.

If any of this sounds familiar please let me know. I'd really like to stop looking for it and re-read it :D
