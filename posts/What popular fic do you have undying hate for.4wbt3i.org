Forget the materialistic Dark!wank.

Forget the never-ending stream of cardboard cutout OCs.

Ignore the boring focus on physical combat replacing magical prowess.

I might have been able to look past all of these, but I get really angry that this is supposedly a "Harry/Hermione" story. The two main characters bear absolutely no resemblance to either of the protagonists from the original series.

Interestingly, it's Ron who illustrates the "plot's" big problem in a rather succinct manner:

#+begin_quote
  [Ron] nodded, holding up his hand and counting off each finger as he spoke. â€œFact one: your biggest issue with Harry was his being human and therefore incompatible with you. Fact two: you leave him without so much as a goodbye a month through your vampirism; give or take. Fact three: you had a relationship with Viktor Krum, human. Fact four: you had a relationship with Viktor Krum for six months. Conclusion: That's fucked up. How can you stay that long with Krum after you gave up on Harry so quickly?
#+end_quote

But of course, +Hermione+ Vampy-Sue is forgiven for cuckolding Harry rather quickly once they start having Crazy Vampire Sex again.

**** Sure do.

Reading it five years later and I can barely get through some parts of it. A lot of the references I felt were clever were in actuality very poorly thought out. A lot of what I thought was working while I was writing it clearly doesn't in hindsight.

The beginning of the story is painfully dull, and the chapters in the middle of the story all follow a very specific pattern that is jarring when it becomes obvious. It was both poorly planned, and too planned. I followed too rigid of a structure and it makes it significantly worse, in my mind.

There's only two chapters of the entire story I actually like and, ironically or not, they are two of the poorer received ones. The best thing I can say about it on my end is that it made me realize I liked writing Quidditch.

***** Effective self criticism is [[https://i.imgur.com/mzfexXy.jpg][hard]]. I started reading Letters and liked the premise but just like you found it ground to a halt rather quickly.

I feel almost like you where writing for the wrong medium. The letters themselves were... intrinsically uninteresting to read because they were so naturalistic. When you look at Harry and Fleur's correspondence in a bubble, it really does look like two penpals getting to know each other.

That's a nice bit of technical writing, but it doesn't grab the reader like a good Quidditch match does sadly.

Writing something that feels real or perhaps grounded is a better word for it, is hard. It's hard because the suspension of disbelief becomes so much more fragile and that's a tough limit to work around. It also sets up all sorts of tonal expectations that are rather strict.

Letter would probably work much better as a screen play, where the dialogue is natural, grounding the film in reality, allowing the actor's to focus on carrying the emotional element of the story.

We are so conditioned to experience love in a setting of heightened reality or melodrama that the writing style of Letters seems to run counter to the audiences expectations.

That and the whole... Draca thing.

Edit: There's a forced sex change in In This World and the Next, too. I can understand bashing to some extent, but that's just nauseating overkill. But if the reviews are to be believed, readers love that shit.

** The hidden hero linkffn(3995826). It's a nice idea, that the author completely ruins. It starts off bearable, then continues to be way too close to canon (and a worse version) for the changes being made. Things get more and more implausible. Then 2/3 through, you have a Harry that wants to die but that's stayed alive in the muggle world instead for quite a while. They eventually seek out and kidnap Harry, hold him in st mungo's, rape and alter his mind and bind him as a slave to snape. Nobody has any objections to this. Harry forgives everyone and embraces being a slave to snape. I gave up and stopped reading here. Apparently the ending in 10 chapters time was rushed and bad. No idea why it has so many favourites.
