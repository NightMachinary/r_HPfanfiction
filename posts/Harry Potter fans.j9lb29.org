K I just thought of something what if there was a magical battle between the Harry Potter cast and some of his fans omg how would it go! K I need answers So what do think about the idea ?


** That really depends on the amount of fans and what they would know. For example the cast all has had a full magical schooling while the fans only know a few spells and have never practiced them because of a lack of magic. So while we would know the spells we wouldn't have any skills to go with them.
