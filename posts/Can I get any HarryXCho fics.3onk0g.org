Ideally not too long.


** I have nothing to contribute with, but if someone /does/ have a too-long Harry/Cho fic, you could, you know, reply to this comment with it ;)

Very long and written pre OotP. 5 completed stories. 2 are post Hogwarts. Well written. Haven't read them in awhile.

** Not Harry x Cho, but a short Cho story that follows her postwar and involves her relationship with Harry. Great involvement of characters, realistic: [[http://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=281651][All Over Again]] by Celestie.

** Well, I remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3717885/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Autumn-Swan][Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan]] a while ago. I think I enjoyed it but it is both long and unfinished. That said, you're not getting many recs here so I thought I'd drop it anyway.
