I read a fic that had Stephen Cornfoot ( a Ravenclaw in Harry's year ) as a punk rock fan who was in a secret relationship with one of the Carrow twins. And of course there's Daphne in " What's Her Name In Hufflepuff "

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

***** After a long struggle. But she is also a good friend with Weasley family (including, after long struggle, Ron). Probably the main point of divergence from other Daphnes in fandom is that she is also a poor orphan picked up from the foster home (run by a squib foster mum), which makes her outsider in Slytherin house. It is really well written.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** Regulus Black is a wonderfully complex character in this big story. We see him gradually losing his faith in the cause. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]])

If I may recommend one of my own stories, my readers seem very entertained by my take on Tom Riddle, Merope Gaunt's muggle rape victim. I've made him as ambitious and devious as his son, so once he learns about the existence of magic, he's determined to exploit it for his own purposes, not just be victimized by it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.
