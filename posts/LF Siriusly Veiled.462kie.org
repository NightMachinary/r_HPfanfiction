I'm looking for fics about Sirius post OotP. Stories where he doesn't die. Like Beatlejuice2712's 'Past The Veil'. Can be anything from him being saved or coming back through the veil. No slash, please!

Thnx!


** A black comedy by nonjon is one of my favorites - harry follows Sirius into the veil to another dimension and fun ensues.

  A shell shocked but triumphant Harry Potter decides to leave his world behind for another. Someone should have told him that AUs can be really, really different. HP/ X-Men crossover.

** linkffn(returned by ladyseradereturns) might fit. Somewhere on her profile or in the story itself is a link to her blog where the explicit scenes are more explicit than FFN allows. There's also linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie) that I recommend often, though it's a monster of a fic at like 800k words.

I can edit this post later with more 'returned from the veil' fics since I have a couple in my favs list :)

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  Sirius has RETURNED. Everyone else is older, wiser, and have left things unsaid. As Sirius deals with his new old life, romance accidentally happens, but someone still loves Hermione.
