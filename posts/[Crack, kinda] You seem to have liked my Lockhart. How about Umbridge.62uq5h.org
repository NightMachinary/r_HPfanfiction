‘Mr. Black! Mr. Black, do you understand me?'

She looked like a toad. A toad that someone had dressed rather sharply, even if there was way too much pink. Maybe he had finally cooked? Wouldn't surprise him for a minute, after five years... Wait. Was it five or six? Or maybe seven? No, it couldn't be seven... he'd remember that...

‘What date?' croaked Sirius. It was hard to speak -- the last time he got to try this particular skill was long, long time ago. Even the guards that dragged him here today had never talked to him before.

The woman smiled.

‘It's December 24 of 1989. Oh, forgive me...' she looked at her watch. ‘It's December 25 already. Merry Christmas, Mr. Black.'

‘Thanks.' Whispered back Sirius, leaning back into the chair. Seven years and a half, then.

The woman watched him for a moment.

‘Mr. Black... do you know why you are here?'

‘Because I got them killed. I betrayed the Potters...' his voice came out defeated, but overall it was good to know that he was getting the hang of talking again.

The woman shook her head.

‘Not that... Do you know why you are here in this room, with me? Do you know who I am?'

Sirius lifted his head a little to take a closer look at her through the greasy bangs that covered his face.

‘I'm sorry, Madam. News travel slowly here.'

The woman closed her eyes, sighed and covered her face with her hands. Finally, she looked up. 'Mr. Black, I am Dolores Umbridge. As of yesterday, I have become the Head Warden of Azkaban. A day before that, I was the first Undersecretary of the Ministry, second only to Milicent Bagnold.'

Sirius blinked. ‘My condolences.'

‘Thank you. But I am not finished. Mr. Black, I became an Undersecretary not because of my money or influence -- although I have since amassed quite a lot. I became an Undersecretary, because I have always did what's right and demanded nothing but from everyone else. And yet the moment I refuse to roll over to Cornelius Fudge and his benefactors, I get sent here.'

Suddenly, Umbridge smiled. It suited her, even though her eyes could do with a little less vengeance.

‘I want to get even. I want to see Crouch destroyed. I want to save the work of Minister Bagnold and make the Ministry a seat of power instead of Malfoy's own circus. And I want you to help me with that, in exchange for a fair trial.'

Sirius froze with his mouth half-open. The woman stared at him, unblinkingly. Finally, the wizard cleared his throat.

‘How?' he asked.

‘By striking them where it hurts, Mr. Black. Lucius Malfoy has interests all over the world -- mostly illegal, in some form or another. I want to see them arrested and discredited, and if it is not possible -- destroyed. I hope, you haven't forgotten what you've been doing eight years ago?'

He didn't. That was not a thing he could ever forget.

‘Thought you didn't,' smiled Umbridge. ‘Of course, you won't be alone. Cornelius, in his infinite wisdom, has granted me an endless supply of human resources... And rest assured, your compliance will be ensured up to the moment of your release. So think carefully, Mr. Black.'

Sirius did, for the whole of three seconds. And then he gave his answer.

--------------

/You've been given back your wands.../

Sirius let go of his broom and fell through the darkness, counting at the back of his mind. Six others followed suit, dressed in all black, which made them almost invisible under the new moon. As he casted the Featherfall Charm, Sirius smiled. He often said that wanted to see Africa... but this definitely wasn't what he meant.

/Along with some new toys.../

Hollyway barely dodged yet another spell and, cursing, fell back into cover. Sirius looked at Victor and, trying to ignore the maniacal smile on his face, nodded. Two seconds later, the first clay container landed in-between their attackers and then the madman charged forward, supporting his Inferno Bombs with a liberal usage of Incendio. Sirius and Nick hastily followed through - even if these portugalians were bad people, they didn't deserve unsupervised Victor. No one did.

/Because I have a deal for you./

Brazilian rainforest hid them well. Besides, Lucius saved up on the defenses -- instead of some form of magical barrier, the entry to plantation was blocked by a fence and a couple of lazy guards that Thomas quickly stunned. As the fields began to catch fire, Sirius pulled out a small vial of blood and started drawing a mark of local crime lord on the gates.

/I'm offering a way.../

Concrete was cracked under his feet and overall the heat was unbearable. Luckily, Sirius soon reached his destination -- a street café on the street he'd break his tongue pronouncing. Not only did it serve amazing ice-cream, but it also gave a clear view on the opposite building. Sirius was half-way through the second helping when he saw the curtains rise in one of the windows rise. So he ordered the third one, in celebration -- after all, thanks to one diplomatic attache with a gambling problem, they now had everything they needed on Malfoys' Ukraininan partners.

/For you to win your freedom./

Jen almost didn't make it out of their last scrap. And she was way past her requested quota anyway. So the moment they reached the Azkaban, she grabbed Sirius's hand tighter than ever before and didn't let go until they reached The Door.

‘I hope you'll find him,' she said as she went through.

An hour later Jennifer Lear got her term cut to three months of minimal security. And Junior Oblivilator Smith got another letter of commendation.

/So tell me, inmates.../

Sirius watched the new batch listening to every word of the woman in front of them. In the last sixteen months he learned the speech by heart. In fact, he's been mouthing it along -- and his favorite part was coming up.

/Are you ready to serve your country?/

*** You really should read /Suicide Squad/ comics. I recommend the original series from the 1980s by Ostrander, followed by /Checkmate/, /Secret Six/ and current /Suicide Squad Rebirth/.

Also, even if you won't read anything else, read recent /Suicide Squad/Banana Splits Special/. 30 pages of crazy fun followed by 10 pages of depressing fun.
