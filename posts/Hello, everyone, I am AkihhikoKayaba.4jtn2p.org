Hello, I just wanted to let everyone know that I have switched Reddit accounts. The reason for my switch was because a dick in school somehow found out about it and started PMing me some pretty nasty stuff. The old account was AkihhikoKayaba. I will be reposting everything I posted under that account under this one,

Thank You.

PS: Some of you have seen a post I made (under the old account) that said I would be audio reading HP Fanfiction. I will still be doing that, and I have decided the first fic I will be reading. It will be Arsinoe de Blassenvilles "The Golden Age"


** If true that's harassment and your administrators can deal with it. take screenshots, record, etc.

*** Yeah, I already dealt with it, but then he started pursuing me online and I tried to go to them, they said that they couldn't deal with problems outside of school.

**** Then go to police. Online stalking and harassment is no different than in person harassment. The fact that the school tried to deal with it internally only helps your case.Keep records of which officers you speak to and if it's legal where you live, record your conversations with them. If the police won't deal with it, go to a lawyer. Almost every lawyer will at least hear your case for free, and in this type of case they may take it for free entirely, especially if you kept records. The lawyer or you can even take it to the media. They love any story factual or exaggerated that they can play up as a sob story or inducing fear.

The most important thing is that doing nothing is not the answer.

Also for the record, making a post tying your two accounts defeats the purpose. A quick Google search and you're back to square one.

** If he knows your account, won't he know what subreddits you frequent and see this post? Or is that too much work for someone like him?

** If he's stalking you he will likely find this post with a Google search so I would delete it asap.
