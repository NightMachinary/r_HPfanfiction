** It's a matter of convenience. Ron's canon faults (as I understand them) are that he is insecure, insensitive to others, oversensitive personally, jealous and complacent. Frankly, these faults are common to most of the teenage cast, and it is entirely realistic and typical of me as a teen along with almost all of my friends at the time.

Going off his particular manifestation of these faults, if we want to grossly exaggerate everything, he becomes terribly stupid, arrogant, gluttonous, possessive, holier-than-thou and unnecessarily violent.

From this exaggerated monstrous caricature, abuse and crime up to and including rape is a very easy way to destroy him as a character, and radically shift other characters into whatever the author wants them to be immediately.

Even when he isn't an abuser or anything like that, one of the primary roles of Ron as a character in the canon was treating all the quirks of the wizarding world as normal, providing exposition and comic relief as well as contrast. The character isn't necessarily appropriate for that in many fics, so outside of fics intentionally celebrating him, Ron is going to be sidelined.

We have to also acknowledge that while Rupert Grint did a fine job, movie!Ron pales in comparison hard to book!Ron. movie!Ron is less kind, less informed and all around less helpful than book!Ron. Some of book!Ron's best lines are given to Hermione, and sometimes movie!Ron is just a jerk for film purposes.

As far as fanfiction goes- Ron is irrelevant more than half the time, a monster a part of it, and rarely celebrated. This means that Fanon Ron ends up being a disappointing blob of a character.

*** I find book!Ron to be a bit insensitive yes, but having vastly better people skills than book!Hermione. And I feel that gets ignored by authors, whereas it is a good relationship to explore and allow Hermione (and Harry, who's a bit stunted because of his upbringing) to have their faults.

*** I liked the goofy movie Ron a lot more than the outright prat from the first four books.

The way book!Ron vs movie!Ron react to Snape's "insufferable know-it-all" snipe at Hermione means a lot to me, and I don't think book!Ron is the prat.

***** "We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He's right. We don't want to end up with a pair of trolls.”

Hermione let out a sputter of indignation. “A pair of . . . what, excuse me?”

“Well --- you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I'd rather go alone than with --- with Eloise Midgen, say.”

“Her acne's loads better lately --- and she's really nice!”

“Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.

“Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you're going to take the best-looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible?”

“Er --- yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.

  Straight from Goblet of Fire, page 394. And how he treated Hermione during the Yule Ball isn't much better.

** I think that the Love Potion thing originated from two things. First there is Rowling's atrocious depiction of Ron and Hermione's relationship prior to the battle (and never properly showing that Ron grew up and became a better person than in the early books where he was a dick to Hermione quite often) and since "fighting all the time" does not make a good relationship but rather a quick way to a messy break-up, people dissatisfied with the pairing thought of "plausible" explanations how that relationship would work out, came up empty and then went completely overboard with bullshit explanations. Was Ron a prat to girls? Definitely, just read the GoF chapters surrounding the Yule Ball. I mean, I am not the suavest person around women, but the verbal diarrhoea he spurted there is really cringe-worthy (and not completely atypical for teenagers). That, however, does not make him a rapist.

  But why love potions?
#+end_quote

Mrs Weasley's joke about dosing Arthur with them to give him "a little nudge" (translated from German here). There are some editions where that line is included, and some where it is not.

People argue that since Ron's mothers used them, he wouldn't hesitate either (Not very convincing, I know).

Personally, I think that Ron/Hermione would not work out because there is not just water but a deluge under the bridge. But c'mon there are ways to get Ron out of a story without bashing him. Just pair him with Lavender and he will be properly distracted without becoming a moron. I know it would have done the trick for me.

** Love potions CAN be pretty rapey. I would categorise what Merope Gaunt did to Tom Riddle to be rape. The potion removed his capacity to deny consent, and therefore also removed any capacity to truly /give/ consent.

But, as far as we know, Ron has never used a love potion. On anyone.

I think it's people looking at Ron's slightly more “traditional” views - he IS a bit more conservative than Hermione in some ways - and assuming that they'd make any relationship with him a complete nightmare for her. Which is, frankly, bullshit. They're intelligent enough, and like each other enough as friends as well as lovers, to figure these disagreements out without either of them going full monster.

For all we know, their marriage has Hermione being the ambitious outspoken brilliant woman we all know and love while Ron's a very hands on Dad taking toddler Rosie and Hugo to visit Uncle George at the shop.

*** It's very much a matter of opinion on Love Potions. Perhaps the small ones that only produce lust-based infatuations are rapey, but Amortentia is a whole different sort of messed up --- it doesn't "make" you love the person against your will, it /actually alters your mind into making you love that person/. It rewrites people. That's why it's so terrifying. You aren't forced to be in love --- you are killed, transformed into a slightly different person who does, of their own will, sincerely love the person.

** Ron's values are very traditionalist and conservative. It's easy to misconstrue him when he says, "The house elves like their jobs," as Hermione prattles on about slavery. Or how he fears werewolves and centaurs. People often associate that with other traditionalist views, like the wife staying at home, raising the kids, and not having the right to deny sex.

It's just people turning an insignificant trait hyperbolic as they often do in Ron's and Dumbledore's case.
