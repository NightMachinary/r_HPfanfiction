** I realise I ought to know these things, but.... why would Harry be throwing around Unforgiveables at random and killing people because he doesn't like their faces? Are you sure this isn't Voldemort in medieval times?

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

This story is a great story , and the "Merlin"-arc (Chapters 4-7, "Forging a legend") is perfect for you. You can read that arc alone if you want to, but I can recommend the whole story completely. Yes, it's fem!Harry, but that isn't the focus of the story and doesn't distract from it too much.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

This story includes the founders-time, but it doesn't /only/ play in it. It isn't nearly as good ALJH, but it's... okay.

**** Can only recommend /A Long Journey Home/. Absolutely amazing. Sadly only sporadically updated.

***** Especially after that last chapter. It's been tugging at my heart for the last 7 months, and I'm kind of dreading to find out what happened.

** Look up HP crossovers with Merlin

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-Crossovers/224/3301/?&srt=2&lan=1&r=10&len=40]]

That often involves them time traveling to Merlin's time which is the era you are shooting for.
