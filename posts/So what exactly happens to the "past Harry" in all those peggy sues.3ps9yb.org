I have read a few of those kind of stories (I may or may not be addicted to them... sorry!), but why does Harry never have any qualms with effectively destroying his past self? I mean, a pre-existing consciousness is effectively erased, no? It makes me feel like I should go ahead and write a peggy sue where past-Harry is NOT erased...


** We are all constantly destroying our past selves. Harry's just doing it less continuously.

** Here's a fic where that's been done, with past-Harry retaining control and future-Harry becoming a voice in his head: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10127452/1/Schism]])

Too bad it didn't get very far before likely being abandoned.

  AU. Time Travel. Harry Potter knows he is a wizard. He knows he is going to Hogwarts, where he will make friends for the first time in his life. He knows this because the Voice in his head told him so. The Voice says it is Harry from the future but Harry just wishes it would stop trying to take over his body.

** It'd be an interesting little oneshot: the consciousness of real-Harry get's shunted to the side when insert-Harry shows up. He can comprehend what insert-Harry sees and thinks but can't communicate with insert-Harry. He's just got a backseat view of this person who has taken over. Personally, I think it would be tragi-comedy, with insert-Harry screwing everything up by making decisions based on fanon and trying to be subtly manipulative but failing.

I think you we're just commenting on the consequences of a dimension/time traveling Harry (?) What are your thoughts on when it's a Peggy-Sue/SI situation? *(EDIT: I mistakenly thought Peggy-Sue=Self Insert)* It's a good question from the OP, because an Peggy-Sue is different from the water+water situation you get when it is only Harry involved...

**** Peggy sue is when older Harry's memories go back in time into his younger body. The memories of his younger self are a subset of his older memories, so they're not destroyed. They're simply added to. Thus the water + water idea.

** Hmm ... well, while strictly speaking it's not a recommendation---because the very end result of the mental time travel is not one you seem to want---hence I won't ask the bot to link it, in “Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool” (once known under a different title, with the last word being “bitch” instead) Harry does try not to do that. The problem being that mentally the person into whose body he slides is kind of badly off, and doesn't really survive despite the attempt to save it.

That being said, if you can write it well, sure, go and write it. The world could do with more good fiction.

Oh, no. No. It won't be good, or even moderately well. It'd probably be absolute shit. Not that I would care.

**** Yes, well, I do recommend it too.

That being said, it has mentions of quite heavy abuse of a particular character, which might be a bit off-putting if you happened to come across stories that had that and were poorly written, but in this case it's something that actually has its place and doesn't lead to endless angst and stupidity. Just saying that so that you wouldn't stop reading after one chapter; I did that once, then returned after having seen it recommended many more times and got through that part and I was hitting myself for not returning to it much earlier.

And hey, at least you have the nerve to say it probably won't be good. That puts you above ... I don't know, 80--90 percent of fan fiction authors.

- Obliteration: Real-Harry ceases to exist

- Body Swap: Real-Harry and the Self-Insert swap bodies

- Absorbtion: The SI and Harry become one single consciousness

- Voices: Harry becomes a voice in SI's head

- Back Seat: Harry loses all control and contact, can only observe

- Conflict: Harry and SI share/struggle for control

- Non-issue: the HP universe did not exist until the SI was inserted. Before the SI there was no Harry

** I would reply to some of the comments, but everything that I wanted to say has already been said by others. Whoops.

I'm thinking of a situation where, right now, some random voice in my head would show up and declare himself the future me, and I am to be assimilated into HIS consciousness. How would you react to that? I doubt you'd just go "oh okay, I'm just a subset--everything I have experienced, he has experienced too, so it doesn't matter" or whatever. Even if that was the case, would you go ahead and trust it?

That's my basis of thinking, here...
