I've seen sub 1,000 word chapters and others have over 25,000 words per chapter. What is a good balance?

Also if an author has a finished story with a pretty high word count, say 300,000+, what do you feel is a good delay between chapter updates to maximize visibility and the chance for reviews?

** 5k word chapters. that's about the average for normal novels. also, I've noticed a pretty sharp decrease in reviews after a 1 week period, or perhaps slightly less than 1 week. Truthfully, if you've got a 300k completed story and it's 5k chapters... that's over a year worth of posting and you're likely going to be sacrificing reader interest for a review count.

**** I probably wouldn't wait until it was complete before posting. I like being able to edit stuff based on feedback on the like, and if the entire story is complete, you run the risk of ruin if you accidentally missed a giant plothole. It makes more sense to keep a bit of a buffer.

***** I meant in terms of chapter length. Your original comment made it seem as though chapter lengths of 5k words isn't good for 300k word stories.

****** Unsolicited opinion:

See my other comment in the thread for more detail, but narrative tone dictates how long a chapter should be and by association average reading session. The more you want readers to settle down really pay attention, the longer the chapters should be. If you're writing something lighter, then shorter gets in and out without bogging things down.

****** well, context is important, but if you're doing 4 scene breaks in every chapter, then it probably shouldn't be 12k long

** There's a lot of response here of authors talking about what they do, so here's my opinion from a reader's perspective:

4-8k word chapters, no less than once a week.

The length of the chapter really depends on the story itself. Lighter, faster paced stories tend to benefit from a quicker updates and shorter chapters because the material isn't intended to be read with a high level of scrutiny. These stories trend more toward comedy and fluff, similar to a half-hour television show.

Longer, denser works are the opposite. Usually those stories are intended to have a longer average reading session, likely taking in details and appreciating both imagery and worldbuilding. With a work like this, 4k words may not be enough time to meaningfully advance the plot and give the story a disjointed feel. These are more like hour long television shows.

Longer than once a week for any type of story and readers will start forgetting details and losing track of minor or supporting characters. This is especially a problem if there's not a whole lot to distinguish your Harry from someone else's Harry, or whoever your canon characters of choice might be.

The more AU a story is, and frankly the better a story is, the longer it can go between updates without disjointing readers because the story will be memorable. For a particularly dense, heavily AU, and well-received story I would say the period extends to two weeks as long as the chapters are proportionally beefy and productive.

** I prefer chapters to be around 6-10k words. I've found around 8500 to be a happy medium.

I feel like finishing a story before positing it is...pointless. I'm doing this to get feedback and improve my writing. Why would I want until I'd written to try to get that feedback?

** I struggle to write more than 1000 words for some chapters others can be longer. I usually update once a week on Fridays afternoon. My longest story is 68 chapters and almost 88,000 words. I have one scene break in a chapter. I usually don't start posting until I have a good amount of chapters.

I don't know a good balance though.

** When I was actively writing and posting California Dreamin', I tended to post as chapters were ready. I didn't really think to delay or stage anything WRT maximizing views or reviews. I started posting it when I had eleven chapters complete and I did one a day and then after that, as they were completed. The time between updates varied depending on real life (trip to UK, holidays) and how well the writing was going. I completed the 39 chapters in a bit less than a year, so that's a pretty good frequency.

Some of the chapters were 9 and 10k words and I think the shortest was between 4 and 5k words. I don't go for a specific word length per chapter, but rather shoot for an ending that seems natural to the action of the chapter.

** I've never actually posted a fiction, due to an inconsistent schedule. I didn't want to leave people waiting and was happy just to write for myself. In order to avoid the same issue now, I'm aiming to complete at least a first draft of the entire thing before I start posting and was thinking of posting a chapter per week.

My chapters are usually between about 3500 and 5000. Depends on tone and density of text. But I also try to be efficient with my words. Sometimes a chapter will be a touch shorter, because it's the right place to put a chapter break but I've said what I need to say. I don't really like to pad.

** Though some people make it work, under 3000 words is a bit low. Under 1000 is (almost) always a bad idea. Over 10 000 might be too much, but anything between 3 000 or 10 000 works for me, and between 1000 and 3000 is /suspect/, but it /can/ be fine.

** If I'm actually reading something that's in progress, I want 5-10k words, if not more, per chapter, because I'm awful and greedy lol.

If it's complete, I really don't care because I read on my phone, as long as it isn't something silly like 200 words.

As for posting something that's complete- the delay would depend on how long the chapters are, honestly. If they're only a few thousand each, 2 chapters per week is something I've seen plenty of going by author notes on FFN (people posting on a schedule).

** To add a different perspective, I read relatively unusual pairings where good long fics are pretty rare, so if I find one I like I'll stick with it even though the chapters are too short for my taste. I'll read the first chapter of everything for the pairing and maybe bookmark a fifth of them so can't really be picky. I'll also readily leave comments asking for more because good stories are hard to find and comments motivate the author. So I think it's something to take into consideration too ! Not as a reason to slack and update a few hundreds words every month, but just to put things in perspective.
