There's plenty of stories out there that have him finding out about the */Ancient and Noble House of Potter/*. He accepts and internalizes this Pureblood Culture, and then proceeds to remake himself into Lord Potter, Head of House.

​

What about going the other way:

Whether you completely down-play the "wizard world as a separate culture" aspect... ... or maybe Harry never learns about the */A&N HoP/*... ... or maybe he does find out but doesn't care?

​

#+begin_example
  What if Harry and other Muggleborns treat Hogwarts
  as simply a boarding school and nothing more?
#+end_example

​

Instead of Pureblood Etiquette lessons with Nevile or Daphne, he's working with Hermione and Justin to keep up with their Muggle school topics (Math, Language, Science) so they can take A-Levels.

Instead of Quidditch, he's arguing with Dean and Michael Corner about that weeks Football (Soccer) scores, or trying to organize a pickup game out on the grounds.

Or he's geeking out with Lisa Turpin and Katie about whatever new computer technology just came out.

​

Basically, Harry becomes closer friends with the other Muggleborns, because humans (especially young children) tend to gravitate towards people who know and understand and like the same things as they.


** Sounds interesting, I'd also like to see muggleborns work together maybe even some kind of secret organisation.

I don't think it'd be weird for muggle raised kids to reject wizard culture if half of the purebloods want them dead and the other half think they're some kind of interesting pets..

** It'd be nice to see Harry embrace his Muggle roots a bit more, or at least have Hermione not go totally native, but don't forget that Harry saw magic as an escape from the hell Dumbledore placed him in. He jumped into the magical side of things with both feet because it was something new and different and seemingly-wonderful. Maybe after a year or two, he might start to come to the conclusion that magic was more trouble than it was worth, but before that I think he'd embrace it wholeheartedly. Maybe a close friendship with Hermione or a Muggle-born Ravenclaw (or a pre-existing love of science class, or a desired career path in the Muggle world) might persuade him to keep up with his Muggle courses.

- The local police and school are both headed by old Smeltings buddies of Vernon's.
- Local adults are gullible enough to believe the Dursleys' lies about Harry, and said lies subsequently color their perceptions of him and their interpretations of what they see.
- Harry is deemed "the wrong sort" by the very elitist and exclusionary residents of Little Whinging, so they look the other way regarding any mistreatment.
- Dumbledore is actively suppressing any attempts to investigate or complain, altering memories and documents as needed.
- The wards on #4 are deliberately designed to make people ignore and/or join in the abuse of Harry.
- #4's wards protect Harry in part by diverting attention from him, which accidentally prevents anybody from noticing the patterns around Harry and recognizing the abuse, or makes him slip out of their minds so they forget to report what they've seen.

There certainly is something sketchy about only purchasing clothing for one of two children, especially when the hand-me-downs do not fit the other child and are not suitable. And if an abuse case ever /had/ been brought against the Dursleys, I'm sure that this would've been brought up as one more piece of evidence against them, even if it isn't specifically illegal to do this.

But honestly, people just don't call child services for things like this. And if they do, it doesn't always help.

Stuff like him living in a cupboard while his cousin had two bedrooms, and him never having any new clothes even though his cousin's clothes manifestly did not fit him and his guardians could have afforded to buy clothes for both of them.

I don't think that's true either. I know that Harry's internal narration states that he was "never starved, exactly" but that's less the narrator and more his own thoughts - and the only people who need to nitpick like that are people who really /have/ been starved. We also have the direct evidence of Harry being locked in his cupboard and denied food by his uncle (and having to sneak out at night to feed himself), and him hoarding food in his room when he was locked in there.

As I said upthread, I doubt he looked malnourished, but that doesn't mean I think he wasn't being "kept hungry" or inappropriately denied meals. I think the evidence suggests that he cadgd enough food that he simply was skinny and small rather than going around looking like a starved child.

**** The Dursleys are a normal appearing family. In the US, that can go a long way to causing people to overlook child abuse, especially if they're not leaving visible marks (and despite all the skillet beatings, I suspect that they /didn't/ leave any visible bruises on Harry, if only because magic stepped in). I bet it's exactly the same in the UK - if you appear normal, and well-educated, and you work a steady and respectable job, and your home looks clean and well-kept, people will assume you can't be abusing your child.

If either Harry or Dudley had outright /told/ somebody about some of the stuff that went on at home it might have been different, but children often don't, for whatever reason. (Though to be fair, even when they do tell, often nothing comes of it.)

I don't recall that episode, but I'll take your word for it. However, physical violence /is/ commonplace in Harry's world; it just comes from his fellow magicals, not his adoptive parents. Incidentally, said violence includes heavy metal objects flying at his head---and he enjoys every minute of Quiddich despite that.

OK, I've found the list. Thank you for informing me of its existence. It confirms my view that the Dursley adults didn't beat Harry, but I hadn't realised until now how big a deal food and hunger were in the books.

With respect to Vernon striking Dudley, no, it certainly doesn't imply that it was commonplace. From the point of view of Vernon, it was a desperate situation in which his son was jeopardising everyone's life and safety by delaying. This is a less extreme version of the [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550618755873][crying baby dilemma]].

#+begin_quote
  And Harry having magic was a valid reason to try to hit him with that pan?
#+end_quote

If he were attacking someone else with said magic, yes. That said, I've looked up the bit of canon:

#+begin_quote
  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
#+end_quote

So, it looks like she did that /after/ the supposed curse, so not self-defence or defence of another, strictly speaking. (Harry is an unreliable narrator about Petunia's knowledge, however: Petunia does not have a way of distinguishing an actual magical curse that didn't work or works with a delay from a made-up one.)

And, since we are using absence of reaction on Harry's part as evidence of things, notice that after learning that Harry was not allowed to use magic, Petunia never did anything of this sort ever again---which to me, at least, indicates that she was responding to an explicit threat, even if belatedly.

Honestly, I tend to think that the fact that she attempted it once - no matter what the provocation! - suggests that physical abuse of about that magnitude happened more than once.

******* Yes, it makes it much better ethically. It makes it a mother defending her child from a monstrous threat. Early-canon Harry is pretty happy-go-lucky; he doesn't spend much time reflecting on anything, so him failing to reflect on something isn't evidence of anything in particular.

Here's what we do see in canon on the subject. From PS (Hagrid in the Dursleys' cabin):

#+begin_quote
  ‘Now, you listen here, boy,' [Vernon] snarled. ‘I accept there's something strange about you, *probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured* -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --'
#+end_quote

(Emphasis mine.) Observe that Vernon is speaking of "a good beating" as something hypothetical, that never happened.

We also have the following scene in PoA:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Don't you smirk at me!' boomed Aunt Marge. ‘I can see you haven't improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.' She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her moustache and said, ‘Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?'

  ‘St Brutus's,' said Uncle Vernon promptly. ‘It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.'

  ‘I see,' said Aunt Marge. ‘Do they use the cane at St Brutus's, boy?' she barked across the table.

  ‘Er --'

  Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.

  ‘Yes,' said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, ‘All the time.'

  ‘Excellent,' said Aunt Marge. ‘I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?'

  ‘Oh, yeah,' said Harry, ‘loads of times.'

  Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.

  ‘I still don't like your tone, boy,' she said. ‘If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy's case.'

- Dudley looking so overweight - Harry being so skinny and malnurished looking.
- Dudley being so rowdy - Harry being so meek.
- Dudley is advertised by them to be perfect - Harry is advertised by them to be a troublemaker.
