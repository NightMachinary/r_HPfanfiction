I read a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mhx1jb/snape_is_confronted_with_his_own_mortality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf][post]] that gave an idea for a Snape is WW Breaking Bad AU. That gave me this idea. Here are the character matchups I came up for this particular AU. Lmk what you think

Walter White: James

Jesse Pinkman: Draco

Mike Erhmantraut: Snape

Gustavo Fring: Tom Riddle (Not Voldemort)

Saul Goodman: Peter

Skylar White: Lily

Walter White Jr: Harry

Hank Shrader: Sirius

Steve Gomez: Remus

Marie Shrader: Petunia

Badger: Crabbe or OC

Skinny Pete: Goyal or OC

Jr's friend Louis: Ron

Jane: Patsy maybe

Hector Salamanca: Grindelwald

Andrea: Hermione maybe

Characters that I would just make OCs for: Krazy-8, Emilio, Tuco, Gretchen and Elliot


** I think it's a rather interesting concept and could actually work but James is no Walter White. Remus would fit much better and his relationship with a Jesse in Draco (which I love) would probably go some excellent places. The only problem is I don't really see Remus losing himself the way that Walter does unless you go for a werewolf type of thing with his personality like Jekyll and Hyde. James would work better as his former friend who stayed with the company and is raking in the dough. Sirius as Hank would also work and with Tonk Remus' wife that's the family connection.

Tom Riddle is perfect as Gus there is no other character who could be as bad and as charming.

I think Lucius being Walter is another possibility a little more difficult to pull off with Harry as his Jesse. I think Narcissa could be a great Skylar. Also Ted and Andromeda Tonks as Hank and Marie would be perfect.

** Walter: Snape

Jesse: Harry

Saul Goodman: Mundungus

Jesse's Parents: The Dursleys

Scrap trying to make everyone else a perfect fit. Snape has no wife, because no one can love Snape. Keep Magic. Change meth for luck potion. Make it 2 dueling sides with loose similitudes to BB characters.

The Gus Fring Guys (Death Eaters)

Gus : Tom

Lucius, Bella, Draco, Barty Crouch Jr

The Salamancas (The Order)

Hector: Dumbledore

Lalo: Bill

The twins: The twins

Ron -- give him a badger like role

Ginny and rest of the Weasleys are here too. Molly should cook something.

Hank and Steve and co... (The Ministry, the aurora)

*** This is not really the story I had in mind but it's certainly interesting. Sounds more like a drug cartel AU than a Breaking Bad AU tbh but it's pretty cool

**** I mean Snape-Tom relationship can work better as a Walter-Gus than James-Tom... Also Snape-Harry instead of James-Draco.

A loose adaptation can do wonders here, and avoids BB rehash.

Dumbledore, old codger Salamanca, leading the crazy clan of the trafficking Weasleys against the more pompous DE... Kingsley and Scrimgeour tying to catch either of the clans...Fudge taking bribes from Lucius. Hinny complicating things for Snape-Tom relationship. You can have Hermione getting caught in all of it... Sort of like skyler. Instead of the trapped wife... Hermione can be a proper citizen who was at the wrong place and the wrong time and now needs to side with the Weasleys (Ron) to avoid getting herself in trouble with the Ministry.
