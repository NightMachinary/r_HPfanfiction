From what little we know, the wizarding world seems quite pluralistic for a seemingly tiny population.

Everytime people talk about wizarding culture, it's all, moste ancient this and lord that and other stuff and nonsense. What about the vast majority of wizarding people who probably don't come with vast manors and many, many vaults in Gringotts attached to their birth?

They'd have their own tales and their own ways of working magic and their own impact on society. They might not make someone a social pariah for not greeting them in the exact correct fashion, but they'd have other social traditions and taboos, etc. And what about down-market neighborhoods such as Knockturn alley? Some enclaves would have to have more Muggle influence in them while others would be more isolated. I can imagine insular wizarding villages peppering the British countryside. And the Welsh and the Irish and the Scottish would have vastly different mythologies, the same as they do IRL, especially considering how anti-nobility Scotland is. This is a whole society of possibly hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world that separated from the Muggle world centuries ago, which is a vast amount of time in terms of social evolution.

So what kind of culture do the Weasleys and the Lupins and the McGonagalls of the world have?

Edit: Just FYI I read slash as well, so don't hold back on those if they meet the requirements.


** If you haven't read Percy Take the Wheel I think you will really enjoy it. It delves into Molly Weasley's home-making magic (hedge witchery), general culture of the world through Percy's eyes, and also is a great family story. It takes two underrated things (Percy, Homemaking) and combines them into something really interesting.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** There were two quite interesting ones I read (no links because they're in Russian) regarding the life of Knockturn Alley and its dwellers. It's fascinating to see how those people might earn a living in a not glamorous way, deal with life and other people.

I feel there are quite a lot of underexplored dimension pockets of the wizarding world with their own beliefs and even language. Oh, the possibilities...

*** I remember a fic I've read in Russian years ago where they had soup swimming races in Knockturn Alley. Like, they had a giant tank of soup, and competitors swam in it, pieces of vegetables and all. It wasn't even a complete crack fic, iirc, although I don't remember anything else from it and not sure how to search it even.

** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) might fit what you're looking for. It has the ancient lord, high house, Elizabethan culture for Purebloods, but spends a lot of time contrasting that culture with the culture of the Lower Alleys, which are filled with thieves, squibs, and the general cast-offs of Wizarding society.

** The Lord and Lady flashy high society stuff with amazing magical powers that only the Purest of the Purebloods posess is just more flashy, I guess.

I remember a few stories where Hedge Witches, and other less formal forms of magical use was the topic. Often it was Molly Weasley who used the magic even though she had gone to Hogwarts.

That and there's a few stories that brings up Suibb culture.

I'll make an attempt at finding them when I get home.

** Yes, I really like these “life of normal wizards” stories (or I was thinking about the term “magicians' realism”, nothing to do with magic realism, which I despise). That's half of the quality of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] stories.

That “story of a normal artisan in Hogsmeade (with some twists)” is exactly what I like on linkffn(Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31) (its sequels are loosing exactly this and they are just silly fluff without any substance whatsoever). Also, while reading the story it came to me how much I prefer this story (no spoilers, so I cannot explain fully) than the fairy-tale nonsense which is in DH. There is a huge difference for me between the Harry Potter magical world, which is (with addition of magical powers) more or less rational, middle-class, down to the earth, more or less realistic, and the fairy tale, supernatural, magical (in the Muggle sense of the word) crap which happens in DH and which is the dirty mark of so many fanfic stories. There are neither supermen, gods, supernatural intangible beings, nor kings and nobility in the original HP world, it is all about tradesmen, craftsmen, small ministry officials, and it makes much more pleasant experience than Scion Longbottom with Lady Potter (nee Greengrass) can ever be.

Also, [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC]] which has exactly this spirit, but it is even better because it is a historical novel.

** Taure's victoria potter fic seems like it'd fit a bit? There's some classism in it though so I'm not quite sure.

Cauchy's fic, "Blood Crest" also has some unique wizard culture, 'wizard-reading' though there's classism between purebloods and racism towards squibs in it. It's a very good fic overall.

Also this one which has lots of worldbuilding but is quite short [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9570961/1/The-Serpent-and-The-Crown]]
