** the problem with these fics is that while theyre rather common, they get taken down a lot for copyright. this is the only one i can think of that hasnt been taken down:

You could simply paraphrase and write the reactions instead of using direct quotes.

**** It's frustrating because I kind of like the idea of "Reading the books", done well it's an interesting idea, but copying straight from the books is the worst possible way to do it. A Dramatic Reading sensibly avoids it.

  When Dumbledore drops a book on the floor, the proper thing to do is return it. But what if the person on the book looks vaguely familiar? James, Sirius, Remus and Lily read the first of the Harry Potters books in a hilarious twist of fate.(Originally posted on fanfiction.net)

** There's A Dramatic Reading, it's incomplete but Philsopher's Stone is done- it sensibly avoids copying the text wholesale.

There's a few on Fictionhunt still around-googling/searching something to the effect of 'fictionhunt' 'reading' '[insert book] seems to come up with results-such as [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/5908149/1][this]] but I have no idea on quality.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** I really like a few from Wattpad, though I can't remember the names. If you search it up you can come up with a few good ones though. Some are amazing but are discontinued, like you said :(

** It's the reformed Order, not the original Order, but /Under a Watchful Eye/ isn't bad.
