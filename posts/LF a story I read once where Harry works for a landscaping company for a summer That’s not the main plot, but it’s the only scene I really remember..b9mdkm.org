LF a story I read once that I think was fairly long. Harry is somewhat independent, and I think he dates Katie Bell? I remember this scene where he is working for a landscaping company, and the owner of the company is his muggleborn girlfriend's father. He also has a female pet snake, I think. I'm sorry that's so vague, if anyone has any ideas, that would be great. :)

Edit: Story found and mystery solved by WordHammer. Many, many thanks to them. :)

Edit 2: wait, maybe it's The Psychic Serpent? I'll read both stories, and update when I figure it out, sorry!


** Sounds like the first ten chapters of linkffn(The Refiners Fire by Abraxan), though the girl is completely muggle.

**** I love long fics! I haven't read nearly as many one shots as I have stories of 100,000+ words. I'm starting to dabble in the one shots though, and I totally get the appeal.
