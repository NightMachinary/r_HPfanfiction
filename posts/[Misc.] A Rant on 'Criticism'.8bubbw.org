Lately, people have been /highly/ critical of their fellow writers. That's not the purpose of this forum; we have the general audience for that. We're supposed to be /objective/, provide feedback and support. The basis of any story isn't going to be original. Even /Harry Potter/ wasn't the first of its kind. It's all how you take that basis, and make it your own. So please, reserve judgement before you say, “Oh, another Daphne story, I've never seen /that/ before,” or, “Yet another one where Harry is abandoned by his parents, oh joy,” or countless others, whether it's a marriage contract, soulmate bonding, Sirius raising Harry, etc.

You don't have all of the facts. You can't make that judgement. And of course I'm not going to give you all the details; what writer does that with anyone but their Beta, and sometimes not even that? All I'm asking for is advice, not how I should write my own story.

If you got offended by the adverse replies, just say you got offended. No need to drag the rest of us off the fence.

While I agree, quite strongly, that people should be less aggressive in their opinions as they can sometimes get, they do have a right to disagree. I am sorry that you did not find people who liked your idea, and I hope you have better luck in the future.

Also, the only objective things in literature are technical things like SPaG. Everything else is a matter of taste.

Tell that to certain authors.

The other day I read a Hermione/Narcissa fic set 6 years after DH (so 1998+6 -> in 2004). It began with Hermione going to Serbia to investigate something and nearly getting raped by pro-Serbian militias who worked for Slobodan Milosevic, who at that point had been out of power for 4 years and under arrest in the Netherlands for 2-3. I left a review to point out that inconsistency but continued reading.

In the tenth Chapter, Lucius abducts Draco, Narcissa comes to save him and gets raped by Lucius to the point where she's a bloody mess. Harry shows up with a team of Aurors and catches Malfoy in the act of raping his ex-wife after torturing his son with the cruciatus. Then Narcissa does not want charges pressed because she wants to forget about it. Harry, Malfoy and Ginny eventually agree to this scheme.

I left a review saying that this was the stupidest chapter I have ever read because it is clear that this will lead to some unnecessary drama down the road and there is absolutely no reason why Harry, in his role as Auror on the scene, or Malfoy, as a victim of the torture curse and after watching his mother getting raped would agree to that. She does not want to tell her girlfriend Hermione either and Harry agrees to not say anything despite saying that it would end his friendship with Hermione. It just makes no sense and is a glaring plothole. I was not even exaggerating when I said that this was the stupidest chapter I have ever read.

A few minutes later the author PMs me to say that " You don't have constructive criticism, you can't question the fundamentals of the story line without leaving insulting remarks. You are a troll" and "This is the whole point of fanfiction, so wake up little girl. Im glad you stopped reading, the world would be a better place without your underhanded, insulting and arrogant remarks."

**** While I also agree that the chapter was stupid, your problem is this:

You said it was stupid. It doesn't matter if you think it is stupid. I doesn't matter if it is, in fact, stupid. You /said/ it was stupid, and that isn't criticism, that is an insult. Absolutely no one responds well to an insult, especially people who have just written something stupid. There are many ways to go about saying a chapter is stupid without actually saying a chapter is stupid.

***** I've read many bad stories, but this one really stood out. It wasn't just the idiot ball to make a plotline work (like no one believing Death Eater Draco). It has characters completely OOC, ignores the laws of the setting (unforgivable - > Azkaban ), ignores common sense... It ignores basically everything to set up some unnecessary drama. Using the story logic alone there would be at least 5 ways to resolve that scene with a logical conclusion (Lucius, caught in the act of raping his wife after torturing his son, goes to jail).

In that scene, Harry says that he can't keep this under the wraps for several reasons, most notably that it's his job and that it would destroy his best friendship. Narcissa has neither a convincing argument nor blackmail on Harry or on her son, who just had been tortured. The victim of an unforgivable is right there, saw his mother raped, Harry finally has something to lock up Voldemort's right hand, the victim is still bleeding... And then nothing.

Really, there is no way you can express that kindly. The story had some odd fascination with rape (it is randomly thrown in every few chapters) and then that scene. Calling it stupid is putting things very friendly.

******* Because I'm more inclined to put some effort into a post for a reddit community which I generally enjoy than for a story where "utter shit" was one of my kinder thoughts. And since the author immediately went to PM insults, I don't even feel bad about it.

And I only got snippy after the author started calling me a little girl.

*** You can remain objective while pointing out something illogical, which was what I was actually seeking help on. Again, I /don't/ expect people to agree with me, but I have read stories based on a premise I don't like and still been able to return feedback like, "This is a plot hole, have you considered this to fix it?" without bashing their idea.

**** At the risk of dragging this convo cross-topic, from your other post:

  (Oh and if anyone has a good reason for two kids to transfer from Durmstrang right into a war zone, please provide it as well.
#+end_quote

According to them, this /is/ a plothole, because there /isn't/ good reason for two kids to move into an active war zone. They are doing exactly what you are asking for.

As for doing it without bashing, I agree! I would absolutely love it if people were nicer in their criticism. Tact is a godsend! But people are very, /very/ opinionated about HP fanfiction and sometimes you run into that. I do commend you for speaking out against it, but the tone of your post is one of righteous indignation, and I can't feel very sympathetic to that.

EDIT: Actually, I'm reading that wrong. You're mostly just picking a fight with a couple people, pardon, you're both picking a fight with each other and the rest are helping you with no problems. I wouldn't really consider those two the entirety of this forum.

***** Note that I'm aware it's a plot hole. That's why I was asking for advice on how to make it reasonable. The first response answered that, and I appreciated it. Then they started attacking the idea, which was when I admittedly reacted badly. If the same person attacked you in two different posts, when you initially responded cordially, would you not feel victimized?

... But that's not the point of this particular post.

Yes, there are only two people this was targeted at (in my case). I apologize if it came across as sanctimonious, but I was trying to bring awareness to something that's happened several times before.

****** I shouldn't have been as hostile when criticising the usual "Harry and Daphne" tropes, but that started when you asked in a post "where did I say that the trio wouldn't remain friends?", and I answered quoting your lines that gave that impression. And then answered your next question "Still sound like the standard "pureblood" trope to you?" with an explanation of why it does, in my opinion.

I also tried to point out that your solution for a plothole - "why send two orphans into a war zone? Because the adult orphan can't take care of his sister" opens a potential new plothole, mainly: "Why would him taking custody of her (especially if she'd be at school for most of the time anyway) be worse than sending her into a country in the middle of a civil war? Is he incompetent? If so, what do you need him for in the story?" I proposed to make both minors, to avoid that, but you shot that down, without explaining why you need that character to be an adult. The first reason for the Danish boy to be an adult, aka older than Harry, that comes to mind is that you need him in a mentor/tutor role - and that role would be impacted if the guy was so incompetent that sending his sister into a war zone would be preferable to him taking custody of her. Whether or not you have considered that I can't say, since you never answered the question of what exactly you need an adult Danish student for that a minor Danish student wouldn't work as well.

******** Well, there's an easy explanation why the kids are going to Hogwarts (even if the Greengrasses are the guardians they could go to Durmstrang, after all): They (feel that they) aren't safe at Durmstrang. They don't trust Karkarof to protect them, either because he's incapable or because he's unwilling, and so Hogwarts is the best choice, because of Dumbledore.

** It's hard to not feel attacked when you post something that you created or are thinking of creating. I think part of the issue was that you posted so many ideas that you were going to do and then really only asked for feedback on two things towards the end and it was pretty open-ended. I had to re-read your post to understand what you were asking for feedback on. In my own experience, I've found that if I want to get truly meaningful feedback from people, I have to ask specific targeted questions.

My husband reads everything first and I get general story impressions from him first and if he doesn't bring up anything on his own, I ask specific questions about specific things. "What did you think about this line?" "How about this scene?" "Do you think this is a valid way for Harry to react given the context?" I've also learned that I can't just accept, "I didn't like it." I need to ask questions to find out exactly what it was he didn't like and how it could be changed to be made better.

It's all about setting expectations. If you are asking for feedback on something specific, then focus on that. Don't hand someone a bunch of irrelevant information and expect them to not only know that it's irrelevant, but to ignore it and not react to it. If all you're looking for are Durmstrang headcanons, then ask for that directly. We don't need to know about Lupin and Tonks, or Daphne or the status of the Golden Trio friendship because it's not relevant to your real question. Tell us that you're thinking of a couple of Danish characters--has anyone been to Denmark?

Don't be afraid to ask for what you want, but you /have/ to ask your questions in a way that you receive feedback that is meaningful and useful to you. Otherwise the sharks are going to smell blood in the water and before you know it, you're a disembodied head washing up on shore.

I'm a pretty good judge of shit, having grown up on a farm and shoveling more of it than any sane person should. I'll call a spade a pointy shovel (not good for shoveling shit, incidentally) and disregard your sanctimony like I would any other bit of ill-advised, self-absorbed twaddle.

** Yeah, some criticism can suck and be unfair and utterly unhelpful, but the people who give lousy or even unwarranted comments? They're never going to disappear.

/Ever./

My only advice is to grow a thicker skin to ward off as much of the slings and arrows as you can. That's what I had to do when I started out in fic, way back when. /shakes cane/

--------------

But, on a slightly different note, it's important to always pay attention to critics. I do, at least as a pro writer (any fic I write is waaaay more relaxed than my published stuff, and I don't often have time to write it, never mind read comments for it).

It might hurt hearing the things people say, but I try to take criticism in stride, and step back from what I'm writing to see if the naysayers are /right/, because +more often than I like+ they have been in the past.

** Who died and made you king of reddit?

From an outside perspective, it looks like you made a thread ostensibly looking for feedback on an idea, then got annoyed when you got actual feedback instead of mindless praise. And now you've made another thread to complain because you didn't have a large enough audience.

I'm not a mind-reader, I don't know what your actual motivations are, but please keep in mind that this makes you appear childish and isn't going to endear you to many people.

** It must be frustrating to have an idea and find that people have critical responses to it. I generally have seen mostly supportive and helpful comments, but I can also see how it can be frustrating to have someone be less enthused about your work than you are. Don't give up, every idea you write down is a road to a more skilled tomorrow.
