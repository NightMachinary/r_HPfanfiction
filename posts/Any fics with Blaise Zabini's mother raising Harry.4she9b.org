**** I didn't like the ending.

[[/spoiler][Specifically how Harry destroys the inferi, kills Pettigrew, but Voldemort escapes. End Chapter. The final chapter is set in the future and tells us that the war ended after destroying much of Europe. That's okay, I guess. I would have preferred to "see" the ending rather than just "see" someone talking about it.]]
