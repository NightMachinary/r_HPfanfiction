Hello!

Do you need a Britpicker for your story? I would love to help you. Can also offer some light Beta-ing at the same time.

I'm a Brit and have lived in London for over ten years.

Ideally short stories would be best, but I might do longer if your story sounds really fun.

Also, if you have any specific questions about something British that you're not sure of for your story feel free to message me and ask.


** Due to being a non-native speaker, I know I'm definitely just sort of messing it all up in a pot anyway --- I'm the sortof weirdo who says /mashed potatoes/ but has an American spellcheck. But I /would/ prefer to root out any Americanisms that may have accidentally found their way into my /dialogue/, so if you could give it a looksie that would be nice. linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

(It's a bit long, but also considered by most who have read it to very much be "fun". Anyway, First-Year is extremely short, so maybe you could just start with that, and only go on if you want to; I'd be perfectly okay with that.)

** I have a couple of questions for you which, in one way or another, are relevant for my own in progress stories:

1. What used to be the process for getting a driver's license in the early 90s? Wikipedia isn't clear on whether you need to take special classes or can just learn it from any adult.

2. How late did the "last show" in a movie theater begin? (again, in the 90s)

3. What do you do on a night out after the last order? Do people really just go home after 11 pm? Even on weekends?

4. Do women go to pubs as well? In media, those are usually filled by grumpy, middle aged men. Are there any differences in age (like younger women preferring different establishments altogether)?

5. How popular is green tea in the UK?

6. What terms are used to describe smaller roads between cities? Are some of the "official" titles not commonly used? (For example, In Germany, you have "Kreisstraßen" , but everyone calls them "Landstraßen", which are a higher /tier/ of streets with a different administrative background)

7. What are some slang terms for loose weed nor yet rolled into a joint?

*** 1) All you need to do is pass the test. Most people are taught but instructors with dual control vehicles which keeps insurance down. That being said, as far as I am aware, anyone who has held their license for more that two years is allowed to teach. In order to learn you need to have a provisional driving licence. This one is green rather than the pink of a full licence. [[https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence][This link takes you to more about that.]]

2) I think 9pm ish. Not entirely sure.

3) If you're in a pub till last orders 90% of the time you bugger off home. If you're looking to go out for a night on the town then you probably don't go to a pub you'd go to a bar or you'd have a few drinks with friends at someone's home before you went out.

4) In the 90s smoking wasn't banned indoors. A lot of local pubs got hazy. They'd has its regulars too, things can get a bit cliquey. A small local pub probably wouldn't have any women in it unless they're the barmaid or landlady. A pub in a town or a city might have a few in it especially shortly after work hours are over. You'd probably find more women in bars than pubs.

5) Green tea is a newer thing, if you're aiming at the 90s like with your other questions then its rare. Vernon Dursely might even say its not 'proper' tea.

6) B-roads are minor roads. In the UK we have motorways, A-roads and B-roads. Country lanes and stuff exist and the majority of roads have a name. Some roads have multiple names. For example the A6 I used to drive when I was going up to Leicester becomes London Road when its goes through Leicester. The minor roads almost always have another name. Very, very rarely will someone recommend you take the B103 to somewhere before you take a right onto the A12 or something along those lines. They're more likely to say something like take Station road till you get to the third roundabout before you take take the third exit onto the A12.

**** Thanks a lot.

Regarding 6: What do you use when you are talking in generals and not specifics? For example, you go from Aberystwyth in Wales to Bournemouth. That would be the A44, 470, 479, 40, 449, M4, A46, 36, 350, 354 and A 338, which is far too specific to be part of a normal conversation. Would you simply say

#+begin_quote
  "I spent 5 bloody hours driving over A-roads"
#+end_quote

or is there a more colloquial term to use here?

And what about describing things abroad? Let's say you travel to Portugal, Finland or the Czech Republic, rent a car there and then drive around using the local "A-road equivalent". Is there a way to describe the fact that you were not just taking the motorway but explicitly state that you used the smaller roads or is my thinking too German here?

And, in case you are wondering, I have an upcoming chapter where the protagonists drive around Northern Finland in a rental car to find an old ritual place. Unlike brooms, a car comes with heating, which is rather useful if it's thirty degrees below freezing (and you need to know a place before you can apparate there).

***** You'd probably just say '5 bloody hours on the road.'

If you're talking about small rural roads you might call them 'back' roads or country lanes but I'd generally only use country lanes when talking about bits of England. Back roads is used to refer to roads off the main roads often used only by locals. They wind through the countryside connecting small villages so I'd probably use that.

*** /cracks knuckles/ Oh let's do it

1. In the 90s you could apply for a provisional driving licence at 17 years old. This meant you could drive a car with an adult (who'd had a full licence for at least 2 years and was 21 years or older). This could be any car as long as it was fully insured for both you and the adult to drive it. BEFORE 1996 you just did a practical test with a test instructor to get a full licence. AFTER 1996 you also had to complete a written theory test.

2. I have no idea - sorry.

3. Yeah, you'd probably go home. Or you might go on to a nightclub or something, it depends which city you live in really. And what kind of night out you're having. Sometimes pubs do "Lock-ins" where they let you stay in them with the doors locked.

4. Yes women go to pubs. It depends on the pub. You get some that seem to be frequented only by disgruntled middle aged men. A pub filled with only men is common. One filled only with women is rare. Pubs are cheap and easily accessible (they're everywhere) so filled with the young as well as old. If you were having a "fancy" nighht you might go to a cocktail/wine bar instead.

5. Generally, not massively popular. A lot of people drink it but if you were to go round an aunt's house or something and they asked you if you wanted tea they'd be meaning black tea with milk. That's the default.

6. We're not very imaginative in this - you'd just say "the road", or maybe "the A-road" if you wanted to make a point that you weren't using the motorway.

7. Slang terms are extremely specific to place. Each town will have it's own. So, I have no idea really. Where I'm from you'd probably say "hash"

  How late did the "last show" in a movie theater begin? (again, in the 90s)
#+end_quote

Depends on the cinema (we almost never call them movie theatres). A big town multiplex would have a last showing starting at 10 or 11 at night, a small-town single-screen place (which had almost died out entirely by that time) would start its last showing at 9ish. There were exceptions: the cinema in Brixton that was my local at the time had 1am showings.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Absolutely they do, although there were pubs whose clientele did consist entirely of grumpy old blokes. There were usually one or two of those in any given town, but they're dying out because, as a business model, catering to misanthropic parsimonious old gits who think women shouldn't be allowed in pubs at all isn't a very good one. There was a time when the majority of pubs were like that, with perhaps a smaller ladies bar on the same premises, but they had almost entirely died out by the early 70s and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 killed the practise entirely as an actual house rule: actual old-bloke pubs, by the 90s, were that way because they were establishments so awful that they drove off all but the die-hard regulars. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke-rbD9ke68]] is an episode of Coronation Street from 1991: the Rovers Return is as good a depiction as you'll get of a typical local pub.

#+end_quote

At the time, the next stop on a night out after last orders would be a nightclub. Local practises could and did vary - getting a license involved local government, local magistrates and the police with firm limits on the permitted hours they could grant - but typically clubs opened at 10pm, an hour before closing time at the pubs, and stayed open until 2am. Drinks were more expensive, the music was played at insane volume, and they were the only venues required to have bouncers at the time. I'm not going to go into the kind of shenanigans that went on in such places: I managed to get my youthful indiscretions out of the way /before/ social media and I shall not squander that grace /here/...

Moving on to Chapter 2, a pool table wouldn't have the balls racked up and ready. Pub tables are coin-operated, you've to put money in to get anything but the cue ball out and ready to rack up. And it's not called foosball here, it's table football, and the players don't come with kits painted on. Tables like that /used/ to be made, but they're expensive antiques that you'd not see in a rugby boozer. Even if you did, they'd not be english teams in a welsh pub, look you. (I'm pretty sure you'd get objections to Arsenal and Chelsea across quite wide areas of the UK, never mind Wales...)

***** We don't have the fancy ones with sculpted players, no. The chunky plastic robotic-looking players, yes, although the only place I've seen one recently is in the common room at my son's university hall of residence, they were going out of fashion when I was an undergraduate. Take your point about the kettle, especially since the kettles on sale here tend to be a tad more powerful, I'm told, than the ones sold in other countries.

The Guardian isn't actually snobby - just up to broadsheet newspaper standards of having actual news values and requiring a reading age of more than 12. And in 2002 (?) when your story is set, not actually that lefty either. Between the Thatcher years and five years of Tony Blair, the Overton Window in the UK is not where it was when I was a kid, and the Guardian was, as I recall, pretty solidly Blairite at the time. Which is to say, about as left wing as the parliamentary* tory party ca. 1975.

As to what /should/ be there in that pub, if it's a proper local pub it has been there at least several decades ** and will have acquired all sorts of clutter. Chain pubs buy generically "old" stuff up, apparently by the hundredweight and scatter it about, but the genuine article will have photos of regulars from years gone by, souvenirs brought back from foreign wars, stuff relevant to whatever the local industry is - in Butetown, the docks, which will add to the exotic souvenir count and bits of local history all over the walls.

Also likely: the pub's various sports team trophy hauls. Darts, five-a-side football, rugby, pool, maybe ten-pin bowling. Some of these will be seriously old, and occasionally for sports long out of fashion. Framed news clippings of long-dead regulars winning medals or breaking records or otherwise distinguishing themselves. Service souvenirs of previous owners who'd been in the forces - pub landlord used to be a popular second career for retired NCOs, and the reason so many pubs are named after famous generals.

There will also be at least one of:

- an offensively noisy one-armed bandit (when it's playing, they just quietly flash their lights if nobody's losing money on the thing)
- a jukebox if they get a younger or rowdier crowd in, or
- a quiz machine

and a ratty-looking cigarette vending machine, they hadn't quite disappeared yet.

There's almost certainly a dartboard there too, but Harry might not have noticed that the first time he went in, or it might be in the back bar.

Oh, and a poster up somewhere informing patrons what night the quiz night is. Nearly every pub has one. Less common are open-mic nights, local bands (although generally one or two pubs in an are will specialise in this and the others won't bother) and karaoke. Which is always good for a laugh.

Duly noted. Thank you.

And yes, Tess's father was EXACTLY that type of retired NCO who buggers off to run a pub - he's dead now, so it's her pub, but he was exactly that kind of guy. That's what I had in mind for her family. Guess I got that right?

Her son's gone military too, incidentally. Hints of magic in Afghanistan and Iraq are fun to explore, and I have an interesting idea about there being a magical equivalent to IEDs with really vicious curses on them. MoD may or may not have requested some magical help on that score...

Sundry adjustments will be made.

Well, if your old teacher was welsh-but-toning-it-down-for-the-sais then you nailed it, because that's the sense I got from Tess.

And if Tess's dad was late of the South Wales Borderers (which it still would have been when he was in, it's part of the Royal Regiment of Wales now), there's probably at least some Rorke's Drift memorabilia about the place :)
