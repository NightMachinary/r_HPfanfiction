:END:
Hello, I wanted to reread an old fanfiction, and I've managed to remember scenes that occurred but not it's name. Can anyone help?

So basically Harry creates a Raven/ or crow that likes to talk in riddles, they play riddle guessing games with each other. There is also a point in the fanfic where the raven pecks out Harry's eyeball for absolutely no reason. It is also a completed fanfic.

Many thanks
