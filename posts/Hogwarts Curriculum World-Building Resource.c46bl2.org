I really like writing in the Harry Potter universe, but I always end up spending more time on the worldbuilding than actually thinking of a story to tell. Recently I decided I wanted to write a story that took place a decade or so after canon, and started designing a Hogwarts that has been improved in that time. Eventually, this ended up with a fairly large document explaining the Hogwarts curriculum. I figure, since I'll probably never actually use it to write a story, I'd post it here for anyone who wants to use it or take inspiration from it.

Basic summary of contents:

- Full list of subjects taught at each level of education (OWLS, NEWTS etc)
- Basic breakdown of topic(s) and theory/practical split for each year for each subject
- More detailed breakdown of each topic for each year
- Explanation of what subjects are taught at each level, how many, and what the requirements are
- A full Charms curriculum with over 100+ spells and their descriptions
- A list of example Potions and the year level at which they're brewed (25 Potions)
- A full explanation of how magical creatures are classified, as used in Care of Magical Creatures at OWL
- An explanation of the Components of Warding and the Components of Ward Breaking, as taught in the Warding NEWT
- An example History of Magic essay at 5th Year OWL level

** Nice work! I've also done some worldbuilding on the side, but that is simply magnificent amount of work. A few technical suggestions from me:

- Care of magical creatures should include some 5X creatures, or at least one of the less dangerous and more obtainable ones, like a dragon (those can be handled pretty easily by a group of wizards) in NEWT level
- Water conjuration isn't a survival charm, as conjured objects disappear after a while - so while it might work to spray someone or cool yourself, you're much better with a cooling charm, because drinking something that will disappear after some time isn't wise
- Topics should bleed between years, i think. This is partly based on canon and partly on making things more diverse - you can intermingle conjuration and human transfiguration in 6th and 7th year, or start basic animate to inanimate in 1st year (canon 1st year exam was to transfigure mouse into a snuffbox).
- Muggle/magic studies should be interchangable in timetables, muggle ones for those with wizarding background and magic studies for those with muggle background, mandatory up to OWL level without the obligation to take the OWL.
- History of Magic should be a core subject, but Binns must be exorcised beforehand
- Minor mistakes in 1-5X classification scale. All dragons are to be classified as 5X due to untameability. Wampus cat and werewolf also fall into that category. On the other hand, Phoenix should only be 4X, because it can be tamed. Also, Vampires aren't beasts and thus don't fall into the X scale.

*** - The 7th Year NEWT Curriculum for CoMC DOES have its Practical portion dedicated to 5X creatures. There's 5 Years of OWL/NEWT, and 5 Creature Classes for a reason.
- I hadn't thought about the implications of Auguamenti being temporary, but for my own headcanon I'm happy to leave it given that we know in canon characters at least contemplated using it for drinking water.
- I can imagine that they would, in practice. Depending on the specifics of the class, the teacher and things. The Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff class might start on next year's work a bit early, or perhaps spend longer on a topic than originally scheduled for example. But I like the idea of distinct topics just to make it easier to keep straight in my head and as a guideline.
- I thought about doing this, but decided against it. I decided that the aim of Muggle Studies is to ensure that magically raised kids don't learn prejudices, or endanger the Statute of Secrecy, while the aim of Magical Society is to teach kids that will one day live in the Magical World as full citizens how the world works. Essentially, Magical Society is the equivalent of a Citizenship course in the Real World, while Muggle Studies is more like a foreign culture course. But of course, as the two subjects so heavily contrast and overlap, it's entirely likely that a good amount of lessons would be blended together, and that school trips etc might be shared between the classes. Since you only HAVE to study them for 2 years, that means that you get enough information about the Muggle world not to break the Statute or believe utter nonsense, but not so much that it's unnecessary, and you get enough info about the Magical world to not put your foot in your mouth or look like a total idiot. I also like the idea of having Muggleborns in Muggle Studies and Magical-Born students in Magical Society, so they can interact and help teach the class.
- I see HoM as a more specialist version of the sort of thing you get in Magical Society. In MS you get a basic overview of how the Government works, what the general scope of the law is, how magical dress and attitudes differ from Muggle ones, and then in HoM you dig down into specific periods and events, looking at how these things contributed to the present day. I can see an argument for making it core, and if you are going to merge Muggle Studies and Magical Society, I'd support it, but personally I prefer it my way. Also, Binns being exorcised is top priority.
- Dragons are not untameable. They are difficult to tame, and perhaps "trainable" is a better term, but they aren't as untameable as, say, a Blast-Ended Skrewt. With the proper techniques, like the clankers in Gringotts, you can get a Dragon to work as your security guard and not hurt you. A Blast-Ended Skrewt will indiscriminately burn everything nearby no matter what you try. However, some Dragons are more ornery and harder to train or tame than others - Hungarian Horntails are near impossible to train, and can really only be conditioned into fear by something like the clankers, while Welsh Greens can actually, if raised from an egg, be taught to distinguish between authorised and unauthorised people and work as a more effective guard. Wampus may be untameable, but I don't see it as scoring too high on Worst Case Harm or Aggression, and I think there's a good amount of Existent Defensive Options. Unlike the Phoenix which, while tameable and non-aggressive, tops the scale for Magical Potency and can cause unhealable burns, is unstoppable, and can teleport through wards, making it score very high on Worst Case Harm and have basically no Existent Defensive Options. Werewolves are 4X instead of 5X for a similar reason - their weakness to silver, the Wolfsbane potion and anti-Werewolf wards all mean that while they're Aggressive and score high on Worst Case Harm, their other attributes keep them from being at the very top. I debated on Vampires, I think you can go either way depending on how discriminatory you want your Ministry to be.\\

Overall, I'm grateful for the feedback. I think that most of what you raised is very much a personal choice, and I'm glad there aren't too many glaring flaws in my logic or planning!

**** - The summary on top of the doc says they deal with 4X creatures.
- About muggle/magic studies, i thought it should be more about not making life-long wizards sit through magical society lessons, or muggleborns through explainations of the basics of the muggle world. They can get homework that forces them to interact with each other, they don't need to be toghether in class.
- I admit i might be a little biased towards history being a required subject, but it is important to properly understand and attach yourself to the society. Maybe a two-year required course for everyone, just to go over the things that noone would normally care about but that are quite important, like goblin rebellions and whatnot?
- Wampus cat worst case scenario is death. It runs faster than an arrow and can hypnotise people, so i'd say it should score 5x. I don't know where do you get the info about taming some dragon species so i won't say anything about it, but i think they should all be classified as 5X due to magic resistance - few if any singular wizards could hope to stop a dragon.\\
  Phoenixes, due to being non-agressive, shouldn't score 5X even if they have the theoritical potential to cause immense harm - if the reasons you've written are such a factor then you'd have to classify house elves as 5X creatures.\\
  Werewolves being susceptible to silver is a myth - it's only used in treating werewolf bites. The only way to deal with one is to be in an enclosed space where he can't get in, an animagus transformation (a rare and difficult skill) or to off it, which would be tantamount to murder and thus not a feasible option.

** What might be interesting is to explore the possibility of taking OWL level subjects after one's fifth year - for example, if you decide in your seventh year that you want to have some background in Cryptozoology, but your subjects are more geared towards a Healer specialization, then you can either obtain the material through the school, self-study and write the exam with the rest of the OWL level students, or you can join the Care for Magical Creatures class during the year and write the exam at the end of the year with the rest of your class.

â€‹

If that got confusing, basically post-OWL students should be able to add to their number of OWLs after their fifth year of schooling. This would be helpful for kids who find themselves suddenly changing their minds about their chosen career path - as someone who just finished going through this phase in my life, 14 to 17 years old rarely produces concrete plans for the future. (Even now, I find myself contemplating switching my Psychology degree for one in Digital Art... someone stop me!)

I've always loved world-building and character development - 2k words on the characters background but only 1500 words of actual story. Goodbye, fics that I was actually working on after months of abandonment. I've been sucked back into worldbuilding!

*** That's definitely something I took into account! Since you can take as many OWL exams as you like, with the limit of 8 subjects being for classes, you could if you wanted do exactly what you described. I see no reason why you wouldn't be allowed into the OWL exams in your 6th or 7th year too, provided the Professor agrees.

And yeah that sounds like my system too, forget the story I want to fiddle with the background details!

** This is a fantastic resource, thanks for putting it together! A small correction, if this is based on canon; Astronomy and History of Magic are core classes in the books. You also left off Astronomy from the basic subject description list. I like the idea of Astronomy as an OWL class, but I can't believe studying planets/moons happens in 5th year AFTER comets/meteors. Seems like planets/moons would be better directly after stars/constellations. Based on all of what you wrote, I think DADA should be required, but not beginning until 3rd year, while History of Magic should begin in 1st year.

*** It's definitely not based off canon - see the existence of a "magical society" class, or the fact that second year students are learning NEWT-level Charms (Aguamenti - not just NEWT-level, but a particularly difficult spell, if we go by the fact that the sixth years were studying it for several months).

**** Yeah, I basically took canon as my starting point, but tried to make it a bit more logical (or what I see as logical). Charms was by far the hardest, since we really don't get much idea in canon of what Charms Theory actually entails, or why you'd need to spend multiple weeks worth of lessons on a spell instead of just being taught the wand movement and incantation and told to practice (unless it's a dangerous spell). Put simply, I don't think there's any actual reason given in-universe for why Aguamenti is taught at NEWT level and is so difficult, whilst Accio is 4th Year and kinda difficult, with Alohomora being ??? difficult but taught in 1st Year. That's why I decided to kind of ignore the difficulty of the Charms and focus more on the type of Charms. The idea is that you learn roughly half (increasing as you get through the years) of the spells you learn about, with the expectation that you'll practice the others when you're ready in your own time. So you don't learn Aguamenti in practice, and you aren't expected to be able to cast it, but you do learn its incantation and wand movement, and the theory behind it, and then you're expected to practice it at your own pace. That means that it could still be a NEWT level charm in practice, but taught theoretically much earlier.

*** It's based on canon, but since it's designed to be the curriculum a decade or so after canon ends, I put a lot of thought into designing a more logical curriculum. So Astronomy and HoM aren't core because Astronomy is supplemental to Divination, Potions, Herbology etc rather than a directly important magic itself, and because a lot of the basics of HoM are covered in Magical Society, with History being more specialist. As to DADA, the idea is that because after 3rd year, you can theoretically drop any 2 core classes and pick up a good number of options, if it wasn't required in 1st and 2nd year, many students would never study it. As the beginner DADA course is designed to give a wizard/witch just enough info to survive being attacked by a muggle or another student, as well as some of the more common creatures they may face the threat of, it's sufficient for the average person even if they drop it at 3rd year. History of Magic, by contrast, doesn't teach anything that it would be a significant loss for some students not to study, given that Magical Society will teach them the bits that are most relevant to today, as will living in the Wizarding World.

I figured that for Astronomy, also, Planets and Moons would be a more detailed and in depth topic, with a lot more heavy theory involved which is why I had it set for 5th year.

**** It seems like a really well thought out project and I applaud your work! Thanks for the explanation! I know a lot of this isn't canon, with the classes like warding and magical arts, but the foundation is great. Reading it over again, I appreciate the inclusion of enchanting and healing, and that the first years of magical society and muggle studies are focused on mythbusting. Why did you choose the term cryptozoology instead of magizoology for the class? The term cryptids seems so out of place for the wizarding world, where magical creatures really exist and are known.

***** Thanks!

Yeah it's supposed to be an extrapolation of canon. I tried to ask the question "if I was updating Hogwarts for a post-canon time period, with a larger population, peace, less bigotry and fewer obstacles like Dumbledore's plotting, what classes would I teach?" and it kind of got out of hand. I really tried to make sure that a student would get a well rounded education, regardless of their choices at OWL and NEWT, that would set them in a good state for getting a career and living in the world. That's why, for example, DADA in 1st and 2nd Year is mostly just a basic introduction to casting spells to defend yourself, and understanding the most common dangerous creatures. That way, even if you drop it in 3rd Year, you're not going to get burned at the stake by an overzealous Muggle or poke a Doxy nest.

As to Crypto/Magizoology, honestly I swapped them back and forth the entire time I wrote this document, and in the end just liked the sound of Cryptozoology a bit more.
