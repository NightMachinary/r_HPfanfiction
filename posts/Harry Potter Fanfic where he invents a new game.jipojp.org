Hey guys. Thanks to Covid I spend quite a few days home and I´m reading some older fics that I liked. One of them was a story where Harry (or SI Nevile, I´m not sure) invented a new game that used enchanted cards to function like spells and shields where two teams try to capture the other teams base. The game got really popular in and out of Hogwarts. Does anyone know the name of that fanfic?

It wasn't Harry or Neville, it was an SI.
