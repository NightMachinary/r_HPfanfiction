For example when I read Harry Potter initially I really liked Sirius (and still do). He seemed charismatic and badass and wise ( what he tells the trio about a measure of a person isn't how they treat the equal but their inferiors) and kind to the trio despite everything he went through. I wouldn't say he appealled to me as a archetype ( but I did find charming hot-headed but smart and witty characters later on and thats probably cuz of him).

However when I read fanfics I found myself also liking fics with young Tom Riddle Jr, or Regulus, or even Draco sometimes. Not because I really liked their characterization in canon, but because I like the snarky sardonic characters with a flair for the dramatic who may occasionally be manipulative or Chessmaster types, in general. And thats how I saw them being characterized in fics and regardless of the canon accuracy I liked archetypes like that. So my initial interest in seeing fic about them was solely because I liked a certain archetype ( even if some like Draco and Regulus I like reading fic about for different reasons now).

Do you guys have characters like that for hp fic?


** Arrogant jerks, especially the unapologetic ones who can back it up. The half-formed ideas I toss around always involve this type. There's a long list of them, either actual characterization or the idea of them, but my top 5 are Fleur, Dumbledore, James, and the Crouches. The only one here who routinely shows up in fics is Dumbledore and even the well-written versions often miss that element.

*** That's a little stupid, but I never considered Dumbledore as arrogant, /because/ he can back it up. A lot of his lines should come as bragging, but because /he/ said them, it's just stating a fact. Considering the whole legend around the character, he almost sound humble.

As for Fleur, it may be because I'm a French myself, but she doesn't seem to be "that" arrogant. She often had a point when complaining (Scotland is cold, Scottish/ British food . . . exist, and a 14 years old should not be part of a Tournament prepared to put adult wizards at risk). Her worst (or best) moment was her Alpha bitch tirade at the end of HBP but . . . meh, standard hot french girl (or just standard hot girl?). Goes to Paris (or any big city) and you should find tens of girl like that (and they boy equivalent).

**** Yeah, Dumbledore's bragging is subtle. "It was a guess, but my guesses have usually been good." Absolutely a fact, but the last part was not necessary. Another one off the top of my head is in HBP when he tells Harry to have his wand at the ready, but not to worry about being attacked 'cause Harry was with him.

I'm from New York City, so I know what you mean, but when I call Fleur an arrogant jerk I was more thinking about her sniffing at the Christmas decorations in GoF and taking shots at Molly during Christmas in HBP. She's not as arrogant as Dumbledore and James, but it's there.

** I like the bubbly fun type of characters. So Tonks (at least in OotP) and Lavender or Parvati for example, while also disliking characters who are only about humour (eg the Twins).

** I've grown to love Sirius more now that I'm an adult. If you ask me, his personal story is one of the most tragic in the series, and I'm a sucker for any fic that makes things better for him. (And -- key point here -- lets him live to enjoy it.)

** I liked Bellatrix, even before the movies, despite her limited appearances. Of course, with the movie release, and HBC's excellent portrayal of her, I only loved her more.

Why? As a bit of an...older person...you have to understand that when I was growing up, there weren't many (any?) examples of strong, independent women in fiction to look up to. Even heroines were subject to needing to be saved and/or romanced by men.

However, for little girls looking for kick-ass role models, while there weren't many heroines, there were plenty of female villains. They wielded power, didn't take crap from anyone, lived their best life, and didn't need a man to save them. While other girls wanted to be a princess, I wanted to be Maleficent.

So Bellatrix fit wonderfully within that mold. I could do without the sucking up to Dark Lord, but the way she absolutely inspired fear and panic (second only to LV, and perhaps arguably even surpassing him in some instances) made her one of my favs.

*** She... also tortured a couple to insanity, amongst other unspeakeable things. I'm mean really, if there's one person you shouldn't look up to, it's /her./

**** I didn't think I'd have to disclaimer my post by saying, “I do not approve of torture and murder,” but I suppose this is the Internet so...

Kids: There is a difference between fiction and reality, and it is always important to remember that.

We may admire Bellatrix for being an empowered woman: super awesome at what she does, inspiring fear in those who stand in her way, and fully committing herself to living her dreams.

Unlike Bellatrix, however, if those dreams include torture, murder, or any other acts that would be considered felonies or misdemeanors under the California penal code, please check with a parent, guardian, school counselor, or other trusted adult first, before implementing your plans.

What I meant to say, since you seemed to have missed my point completely, is that while admiring a characters actions and what they represent are not the same. If you're looking for a “strong, independent woman“ who'll fulfill your feminist fantasies then you may just as well lay your eyes on McGonagall, who despite not needing a man to save her whilst also inspiring fear in her enemies, has avoided succumbing to insanity and debasing herself.

I know that it may be a far-fetched realization for someone such as yourself but you can find plenty of “empowered women“ which have avoided becoming blood purists, seeing as that's a rather bad example for a role model, which you stated yourself was what you were looking for in Bellatrix.

I mean, if you want to continue that train of thought, we have Umbridge, second only to Fudge in her incompetence, wielding power and living her best life whilst simultaneously not needing a man to save her. A great role model no?

** I initially liked Hermione because I enjoy an intelligent character, but she got a bit oversmart for me. Now, I like Harry because he's imperfect, brave, and determined.

** Believe or not, it was Hermione. Smart, socially awkward, bushy hair, know-it-all attitude -- it was nice to identitfy with her character.

Then I grew up.
