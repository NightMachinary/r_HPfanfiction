There's probably a fic that fixes that!

When I tell people that I'm into fanfiction, particularly Harry Potter fanfiction, there's a look that you get, right? That kind of 'that person is off the deep end, but if we smile and nod they probably won't charge. . ." Look.

But when I follow it up with "what's your least favorite thing about Harry Potter? Because there's probably a work exploring that" I get MUCH better reactions and have encouraged several people to take the plunge and read their first fic.

The thing that got me into reading was "Saving Sirius Black". I was absolutely torn up by Sirius' death ( I still have a hard time reading OotP because of the shadow his death casts over the novel). He was Harry's family and suffered a great miscarriage of justice! How can you not want to fix that!?

And then I recommend things like linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) or linkffn(one-hundred and sixty nine).

What was the thing that you needed to fix about cannon that got you into fics?


** I'm probably from the second largest pool of "what got you into fanfiction" group. The first group is the shippers. I put them in one giant category because they're all about "Hermione and Harry should've ended up together", "Neville and Ginny should've ended up together" "Harry and Draco should've ended up together".

But the second largest group of us are the ones who wanted to know what happened right after. We love our canon HP, we are cool with the epilogue. But what happened the day after? How hard was it for our hero? How fast was Hogwarts rebuilt? We weren't even given the dignity of honoring our beloved characters we lost in the Battle with a memorial, when did that take place? What about the surviving Death Eaters? How long until Harry/Ginny got back together? When did Ron/Hermione bone? How the heck did Australia go down?

We all needed those questions and a thousand more answered.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I suppose I must be in a third category, because I don't have any particular problem with canon. There are things I may once have wanted to change, if I'd been introduced to fanfiction a decade or two sooner; Fred's death, for instance, was completely heartbreaking for me when I first read it, but now that I'm older and a better writer I'm completely fine with it. Honestly I wouldn't change a thing. At the same time, I'll gladly write and eagerly read stories with /everything/ changed. :-3

I was introduced to fanfiction by HPMoR, and that probably was the only way I could have been that would stick. I couldn't care less about who Harry ends up marrying, the majority of ship fics just annoy me.

I love the what-ifs, love the AUs, love the inspired-by-but-differents. I love the character explorations, who these people could have been when we weren't looking, or who they may have become in different circumstances. I love seeing what the magical world looks like from a different perspective, or what it /might/ look like if a few things were changed.

/Edit:/ That said, what bothers me most is the magic system's floofishness. It's hard to pin down, shifts from book to book, and is on the whole not quite firm enough for my tastes. So, I suppose looking at it from that angle, that sort of /is/ why I turned to fanfiction; for more thought-out and stronger explorations of the magic system.

*** I'm right with you. I can't remember how I came across HPMoR, but it was definitely the one that got me interested - I hadn't read fan fiction for anything before that.

I think I really love the world of Harry Potter, but I just want it to make more sense than it does in canon. The magic is inconsistent and the characters do (or forget about) a lot of things that just don't make sense.

Like in PoA, they have a death eater who can turn into a rat who is absolutely critical to exonerating a family friend who was wrongly imprisoned and tortured for more than a decade. But somehow, everyone thinks wrapping a few ropes around him as a human is good enough to keep him from escaping. Why not - oh I don't know - maybe use the spell that Hermione used in /first year/ that would completely paralyze him? Why not use stupefy and levitate him back? Why doesn't Lupin send his patronus to Dumbledore?

It's moments like that that make me want a different version of the story in the same universe. Similar, but written for more critical adults instead of 10-17 year olds.

I got into fanfic during the three year wait between GoF and OotP. I was a young teen and I just wanted more of the wizarding world and the characters in it, and fanfic provided me that.

** For me, it was books 6 and 7 in their entirety. They had always bugged me, though I had never thought about why until last year. There was a sense of "Something about this character is off".

Once I got into fanfiction (accidentally, funnily enough) my second series to check out FFs for was HP. And then it was like a veil lifted. Like, "Yea, why are Ron and Hermione so OOC in HBP?" Or "Why would Hermione let Ron off her shit list after he up and left?" Or, "Why didn't Harry have to actually learn from his saving people thing? All JKR did was kill off his one decent relative".

There are stuff earlier in the series, but fixing those requires a bigger change to the series, I don't always need that big a change to get into a story.

As with after fourth year, it seems like at the times Harry would need his friends the most there's a forced distance put between them.

I mean, Ron was (as many boys that age) vain and rude not infrequently. Hermione could be vindictive when crossed. But HBP almost felt like an attempt to overdo those traits... after the public exposure of Voldemort's return.

...what? That was for a few hours (the length of the Hogwarts Express trip back to King's Cross). And Rita's stories were rife with lies that were putting people's well-being and reputations on the line. Hermione got hit with magic anthrax because of those libelous stories.

Doubt it was permanent (counter-jinxes exist, it was just an obscure jinx) and calling it disfiguring sounds like intentional embellishment. Further, the reason was plainly said: they were trying to learn how to defend their lives which the Ministry was preventing. Hint: they ended up needing that training. And there's no evidence her mother's job was on the line. Arthur didn't lose his job despite 4 of his kids being on the list.

The HBP scene was bad, but as with many things in that book it was OOC. Hermione can be vindictive, but not violently so in the way she was with the birds.

All they had was Harry's word on that at that point. They were just a bunch of kids in a school who were going to do this cool rebellion against the new teacher/principal, led by some boy who claimed he fought some evil dark lord. Half of them probably joined up for the thrill of the school rebellion and learning some cool new spells instead of actually believing Harry the nutjob. From their perspective, Hermione was crazy to do that.

Also, Marietta still had those scars months later, in sixth year. Harry even smirked about it when he saw her like an asshole.

So yes, Hermione has psychotic, abusive tendencies. It's not OOC if she has a pattern of it. Like setting Snape on fire being her FIRST thought about how to stop him from jinxing a broom.

It's sad that these minors in America don't realize nor understand they're mere pawns in a dangerous political game, propagated by the one-sided, biased American media.

** The sheer number of coincidences and deus ex machina. Comedic post.

The List:

1.  Fawkes and the sorting hat in CoS (everything about them).
2.  The arrival of the Weasley's car during the acromantula adventure.
3.  A horcrux can only be destroyed by something really dangerous. Good thing there is a basilisk fang lying around.
4.  Oh no, he is dying from venom. Good thing the only cure is phoenix tears.
5.  A flying beast is available right when they need to get a man with no wand out of Hogwarts quickly.
6.  The brother wand effect. Rowling needed a way for a fourteen year old to escape when outgunned, outnumbered, outmaneuvered, tired and injured. So she introduced priori incantatem earlier in GoF to escape.
7.  If you spent a year impersonating an auror and teacher, drinking polyjuice, and helping a B- student get through the magical equivalent of the Hunger Games, why the hell would you make a TWO-WAY PORTKEY? Thank goodness for small miracles, or idiots depending on your perspective.
8.  How can they make a death eater fanatic spill his guts? Good thing Snape introduced Veritaserum. Why not use legilimency? See #11.
9.  We have Barty Crouch Jr. hostage and can use him to warn people about Voldemort. Wait, the Minister did what? He called a dementor from Azkaban overnight, brought it into the school, and immediately had it kiss Crouch? And Snape/McGonagall forgot that a patronus was a thing? Well, now no one will believe Voldemort is back. Wait they have Veritaserum! And Harry! And Snape! And a penseive, which I forgot to even mention, but is awfully convenient too. But apparently thats not happening.
10. We need a way to get to the ministry quickly overnight? Oh yeah, we introduced these invisible horses with wings earlier in the book. The carriages were originally horseless, but you couldn't see the thestrals because you did not "understand death." What about Lily, and Quirrel, and did no one really know there were no horses, given someone would have said something and Hagrid apparently shows them off in his classes.
11. Voldemort and Harry have a unique mental connection. What's this? Now he has the ability to read minds and project images? Why he could use that to trick Harry! After all, there needs to be some way to get Harry out of Hogwarts, so mind-reading abilities are now a thing.
12. Six kids manage to survive a skirmish while outnumbered 2-to-1 by much older and more experienced wizards and witches (or witch because Rowling made almost all the villains male and the good guys much more male-female balanced...is she sexist?). To be fair to Harry and Co., like half of the masked idiots spent the last fourteen years partying it up in Hotel Azkaban.
13. Harry sucks at Occlumency? Good thing Voldemort can't stand the power of love (bangs head against desk).
14. Sirius left Harry his house and all his stuff, including the house elf who knows about the horcrux? And they handled the horcrux before, but Harry did not remember until well AFTER he saw the penseive memory with the locket in it, thus trying and failing to preserve the secret of who R.A.B. was. What are the odds?
15. Harry finds a potion book with instructions on how to make better potions, and it just so happens its the one he needs for his 6th year NEWT class (how many books could Snape have written in?)?
16. Harry needs extra help to get the memory? Good thing he won a luck potion earlier in the year, and good thing Aragog died (that's probably good in any case).
17. Harry keeps pinning for Ginny? Good thing she just broke up with Dean.
18. Ron and Hermione would be hard to work with on the Horcrux hunt if they are fighting one another all the time. They settled all their differences? A near death experience? Well that's so fortunate.
19. Goblin steel can absorb that which strengthens it. Wait, you're telling me it now has the power of basilisk venom, even though it never actually stabbed the fangs? Thank goodness Ginny got the Diary. Hey wait!
20. Snape heard where they were and left the sword, right when Ron was nearby to save Harry from his own idiocy.
21. The snatchers take them to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix happens to be there, and what do you know she blabs about the Horcrux in her vault.
22. Voldemort isn't there at Malfoy Manor, or even in Britain. Apparently, he needed to get advice from Grindelwald on "how to be a better Dark Lord," especially since he is having problems getting his wand to work (heh heh heh).
23. The mirror and Dobby. Seriously, what gives? The mirror is completely forgotten in the 6th book, and was reintroduced literally for this one scene. And of course Aberforth knows Dobby, who doesn't know Dobby? Wait house elves can do what now?
24. The people who escape Malfoy Manor happens to include Garrick Olivander, possibly the only one who could answer questions about the Elder Wand empirically, and a former Gringotts goblin, who used to work at the place they need to break into. Also, Bellatrix's hair is on Hermione so they can use Polyjuice, and they have her wand.
25. Its not safe for them to be somewhere with people. Wait, its that easy to put up the Fidelius Charm? Why the HELL didn't you put it on the Burrow?
26. What would have happened if the diadem had been in the vault and the cup had been in the Room of Requirement? Harry would have no idea what to do, and the Grey Lady would never have any idea how to help him find Hufflepuff's Cup, so he would have been over a barrel. Thank goodness Voldemort cared more about elemental themes than his own immortality.
27. We need to sneak into Hogwarts. Turns out there is a member of the Order in Hogsmeade, who they met before. Also, he can answer Harry's questions about Dumbledore, and he is literally the only living person who can. Wait, he had the other mirror from Mudungus? And he has a backdoor into Hogwarts? And he it leads to the hideout of the DA? Well, that's good.
28. The diadem is in Hogwarts? The only person who knows where it was in the past is here too? Its in the Room of Requirement, a place Harry knows about and has used numerous times? And he saw it before, only because he accidentally walked in on Malfoy, cursed him, and the person who saved him knew the spell AND asked to see his potions book, and he decided to hide it in the Room of Requirement (instead of, I don't know, ANYWHERE ELSE)? I lost count there.
29. Voldemort kills Snape, but doesn't use the killing curse. That's odd. Now he has a moment in time to deliver a message. Wait, the recipient is already here? That's great!
30. Harry never figures out the message until the exact correct moment. He had a year. Also, he didn't call Dumbledore back to answer his questions first? That's good, otherwise it would not be so sad when he commits suicide by sociopath.
31. Harry's Magic Blood Part II: the Jesus Maneuver
32. Dumbledore is there to explain all his unanswered questions, when it could have been literally ANYONE WHOEVER DIED there to greet him. But somehow its Dumbledore, and not say...his parents or Sirius.
33. Voldemort doesn't dismember Harry's body, or anything permanent or that might blow the whole "faking being dead thing." Oh no! Someone is being sent over to check if he is alive? Its Narcissa, thank goodness. The only person who might conceivably cover for Harry checks if he is still alive. Hagrid would have bawled like a baby.
34. Voldemort summons the hat to kill Neville? A gryffindor? Wait...you don't think...he's the Heir of Gryffindor? Wait, no that's stupid. He just summoned the only weapon that can kill the snake horcrux, right when he was close enough to use it, and Harry told him to kill the snake. Shocking.
35. Harry is the master of the Elder Wand? Good thing he disarmed Draco: if he hadn't said Voldemort's name for the first time in like 7 months, that never would have happened and Harry might have been screwed. Oh wait the magic blood makes Voldemort a horcrux for Harry, so it doesn't really matter anyway. Plus everyone is protected from them in Hogwarts due to Harry's whole flirtation with the grim reaper, so Voldemort literally can't kill anyone in that whole battle.
36. The killing curse, instead of just you know...not happening when it targets its master, bounces back, something never before stated as possible in Harry Potter (not the movies, frankly that happens to much in that case).
37. And finally, Harry is the master of the Elder Wand. And no one ever defeats him so that he can break the cycle and power of the wand. I never would have guessed... Wait, who's Delphini?

And I didn't even bother with book 1 either.

Edit 1: Lucius Malfoy shows up to Dumbledore's office in person? And right while Harry is there to hear it? And he brought Dobby with him, for apparently no reason? Good thing for Dobby, but what the hell?

Edit 2: Harry makes better friends with Neville and Luna in OOTP. What now, they can see the thestrals too? Strike one Mrs. Rowling. And they decided to help Harry right when he is trying to check on Sirius? Strike two Mrs. Rowling. Ron, Ginny, Luna and Neville escaped, while disarmed and outnumbered, knocked out the Slytherins, grabbed all their wands, knew exactly where Hermione was leading them (Ron never even visited Grawp...), and found them in the Forbidden Forest, when Harry and Hermione were walking for like an hour? Strike three Mrs. Rowling. NO! Your out, I don't want to hear about how Harry and Hermione are covered in blood which also attracts the thestrals!

Edit 3:

Harry: So how are we getting to the World Cup? And why are we standing around that mangy old boot?

Ron: It's a portkey Harry. When you grab ahol...

Harry: Wait a minute Ron. Is this going to be another one of those things I learn about the magical world at the beginning of a school year that ends up being really important later on?

Ron: Ummm...maybe?

Harry: Okay. I think I'll take the Knight Bus.

**** To be serious for a moment, I have read the books so many times, and a ton of fanfiction, that I reached a point where overarching trends begin to be noticeable. I love the HP books (well...not Cursed Child, but to misquote Brad Pitt 'you do not talk about Cursed Child'). There are some great themes there: the triumph of innocence, the sacrifice of nobility, the power of family and friendship, all of which are certainly displayed.

But what I do not like is that Rowling shot herself in the foot with the idea of "destiny." One of the best parts of HP is when Dumbledore trying to walk Harry through why the prophecy doesn't matter, because he would not rest anyway until Voldemort was finished. But the way he ends up resolving things, the fatalistic portrayal of Voldemort's defeat, undermines that message. A lot of movies and books have ruined themselves by talking about fate and destiny.

Several of the points I mentioned hint at this. When you have Harry triumph because of his strength of character, his wits, and his dedication to those he loves, its great. But Rowling tainted that somewhat with so many coincidences, plus the implication that the resolution to most of the plot of the last book was all planned or predicted by Dumbledore.

You want an example? Harry ends up owning the Black house and Kreacher, which also happens to be where the locket was hidden. And he would never have owned it if Sirius had not DIED. Rowling created shortcuts like this instead of having Harry struggle and work things out. Remember when he figured things out after Dobby died, and took command? That is what he could have been like, but Harry needed to remain ignorant because we, the reader, are seeing things from his eyes.

I think that is what I would want to change. Harry succeeds because of who he is, not because it was pre-ordained in some way. But please do not interpret this as disliking the books. I wouldn't be here if I did.

It sounds terrible when you say it like that. In fact, I love the books, but I also understand that some of these are Rowling planning things out, and some of them are lazy ways of resolving situations. Chamber of Secrets is really the worst in this regards, but the last book definitely tries to top this

As for forshadowing, there is a difference in literary tradition between forshadowing something and introducing a concept just so that you can resolve a plot point. At the end of the day, the only one that really gets to me is the stuff at the end of the second book. Fawkes and the Sorting Hat are like the poster children for Deus ex Machina. Their is literally no prelude to being able to pull a sword of the Sorting Hat.

- The Ministry thinks he did magic when it was a house elf (the trace changes from book-to-book)
- Ron, Fred and George don't ask ANY questions regarding the bars on Harry's window, the lack of food, his stuff being locked up, his OWL being locked up, or his obvious near starvation
- Harry and Ron don't are of course the LAST people to go through the barrier, otherwise that would not work to stop them. Apparently Dobby knows his shit.
- They fly a car across Britain, smash into a tree, get seen by muggles, but they only lose some house points and get a couple of detentions (thats like a slap on the wrist for Harry).
- ALL of the basilisk victims survive to be petrified, in increasingly ridiculous circumstances.
- Five or six petrifications occur before the Ministry does anything.
- Somehow a thirteen year old girl is the only one smart enough to figure out a mystery that has been unsolved for fifty years, in a school that includes the "greatest sorcerer in the world" and ghosts who KNEW SALAZAR SLYTHERIN (see the Grey Lady and the Bloody Baron).
- The Weasley car inexplicably becomes sentient, and decides to take up being a superhero.
- The acromantulas don't just eat them, Aragog answers all their questions first.
- Lockhart was a fraud all along. And literally everyone seems to have been aware of it. Geez, I would hate to see who the runners-up were...
- What would have happened if Lockhart was really talented with Avada Kedavara? Well I can dream.
- They dive into the Chamber of Secrets (imagine Salazar Slytherin riding down his own person slip-and-slide), knowing their is a basilisk down there, and don't, say, conjure a rooster or at least grab some sunglasses?
- Harry drops his wand at all, thats not even getting into the fact that he knows there is a basilisk chilling out nearby.
- For some reason Diarymort is intangible to being touched or tackled (good effort Harry) but he can still pick up Harry's wand? What the hell is going on?
- The King and Queen of the Deus Ex Machina arrive: please welcome Fawkes and the Sorting Hat!!
- Fawkes: his tears can cure cancer, he can lift many times his own weight, he once pecked out the eyes of a basilisk. He is the most interesting bird in the world.
- Rowena Ravenclaw: Godric, I think you need to reconsider letting the sorting hat summon your sword. Godric Gryffindor: Why would I do that, we need brave warriors in times of trouble. Rowena Ravenclaw: But what happens if one of the kids summons the sword while they are being sorted as a first year? Godric Gryffindor:................
- You know Fawkes, I got to say, its pretty stupid of you to do all that other stuff and not just apparate them to Dumbledores office. Unless of course you get like people yanking on your tail feathers. I mean its cool, whatever your into.
- Literally no reprecussions for anyone. Dumbledore, Hagrid, McGonagall (two years in a row where the same students were wandering around in life or death situations?).
- Lucius Malfoy came to Dumbledore's office. Why? Why not? Oh thats right, we needed to make it obvious for the children in the audience who the culprit was. Oh, and you brought Dobby for...no reason. Great.
- Ginny never receives any form of counseling for what amounts to mind rape and immense psychological trauma. Geez, I sort of get Weasley basing now.
- Hagrid got blamed for the Chamber twice, and was punished both times, and yet he still decided to stay and work at Hogwarts.
- And once again, Harry is sent back to the Dursley's, despite the Weasleys being well aware of the less than hospitable conditions.

******** To put on my teacher's glasses and get out my notes:

Fawkes was created by Rowling SPECIFICALLY to get Harry out of his situation in CoS. She had a plot that she wanted to tell, and she came up with a creature with a bunch of magical powers that resolve most of the obvious issues. Like I said, Fawkes is the king of Deus ex Machina (see my post).

But why didn't he heal Harry's curse scar? Because that would run into the problem of explaining what his scar actually is, which Rowling poorly tried to hide (I was a pre-teen when HBP came out, and I guessed it was the scar as soon as I read the Chapter titled Horcrux).

Why didn't he heal Dumbledore's arm? The same reason Luke Skywalker acts the way he does in Episode VIII: his presence would immediately shift the story to focus on him, and the main character (Harry or Rey) would become a sideshow and is not in serious danger from the bad guy because he is stronger. Thus, both Dumbledore and Skywalker die, ironically both of them pulling off a ruse to give the hero's a fighting chance in the last book/movie (can you say Return of the Wizards?).

And then Fawkes disappears? Why? I thought he came to anybody who showed Dumbledore loyalty. Oh that's right! Fawkes can apparate anywhere (seemingly), can heal any wound, and clearly displays a level of near human sentience (he understands when people talk to him). If Harry or the trio had access to him, can you imagine how the books would go? Fawkes could instantly apparate them to Umbridge, they take the locket and free all the muggleborns, in like 2 minutes. None of this Polyjuice or invisibility stuff. When someone splinches, he heals them immediately. Nagini shows up? Pfft, Fawkes pecked out a basilisks eyes before, thats barely even worth his time. They need to escape the basement? Your friendly neighborhood phoenix is here. Hell, even Gringotts and Hogwarts would be like an hours work at most.

So Fawkes HAS to disappear. Rowling made him to powerful and gave him too many abilities early into the game, and now she had to write the phoenix out of the story.

Like I said:

"He is the most amazing bird in the world."

(From Fawkes) "I don't always bond as a familiar, but when I do, I prefer if they're flaming."

****** Try imagining Harry from Seventh Horcrux reading the actual HP books, and this is him summarizing his findings. That was sort of the "voice" I was going for.

Fawkes inexplicably appears in the Chamber, somehow he knew Harry was showing Dumbledore loyalty (I am imagining when Dumbledore is not in his office, Fawkes is standing on his desk checking a loyalty meter in case anyone needs him). Fawkes is immune to the basilisk's sharingan...I mean magic eyes. Everytime Harry needs something, Fawkes shows up. He tosses him the hat. He tosses him the Diary. When Harry is dying, it cries on his arm. When he is feeling afraid, its song inspires his courage.

And the hat? See my post about Neville and the hat, because frankly I doubt I could beat those jokes. The hat instantly magics him the Sword of Gryffindor, which not only kills the basilisk but also creates a future thing the trio will have to wander around aimlessly looking for. Not only that, it resolves all his fears of similarities to Voldemort, without actually addressing the core issues.

I enjoy making fun of this stuff (obviously), but its not because I hate it or am mad. It's because I like Harry Potter and its world that I mock it: humor wins over more people than arguing. But at the end of the day, I really just wanted to have fun writing all that. I am particularly proud of the last two jokes.

Now it's the bad logistics and numbers. Why did McGonagall and Lupin have the year groups split into four sections while Snape and Hagrid combined two houses? And didn't Snape want to be a Defence teacher /before/ Harry's first year? And does Hogwarts really have 1000 students when they can barely keep one Defence teacher employed throughout the year?

Tho my pet peeve that I haven't been able to find a good fanfic for is the the whole “Ginny comes out unscathed after being possessed by Voldemort”. She was in her first year at Hogwarts and was possessed by a dark lord into petrifying students and she nearly died so that tom riddle could live. I mean, shouldn't she have at least some issues?

I guess my other pet peeves are: 1. Harry's blind support of Dumbledore ( this covers many things such as “love is his greatest gift”, accepting that his “training” is not learning how to fight and defend himself, being a sheep, being treated like garbage and yet is oh so forgiving, etc.)

1. Lily apparently having a forgiving nature which Harry is blessed with. But she never forgave Snape.

2. Harry's lack of issues following Cedric and Sirius' deaths. Other than bad dreams, what else is there?

3. The rampant bullying in Hogwarts that is never addressed. Also constantly having the school turn against him but the teachers never say anything about it.

4. The Dursley were never really brought to task over Harry's treatment.

5. The absolute faith in Remus when the man didn't deserve it. He never contacted Harry before 3rd year, only told him he was his father's friend when he had to, and then didn't stay in contact with Harry all through his 4 th year.

I could go on but I think I've said enough for now.

** 1. Ron and Hermione are an unlikely couple. I can't see what they have in common except being friends with Harry. Opposites attract, but not on that level. We're talking suspension of disbelief here. The pairings feel contrived, like the author had 4 people and forced them into pairs while at the same time steering clear of incest.

2. You don't name your child after your mother's stalker, especially after being abused by him for years. Why not call him Vernon while you're at it? There's forgiveness, and there's Stockholm Syndrome.

3. Who is Ginny? She was in the first book, more or less disappeared, and then suddenly she was Harry's girlfriend. We know less about her than we know about Draco Malfoy. And let's hope she grew out of her fangirl phase. Don't marry a fangirl, Harry.

4. Plot holes. Plot holes everywhere. You know what I'm talking about. If you don't, you haven't read any of the books or watched any of the movies.

** I think what put me off was the fact that Ginny and Harry got together. I don't know about anyone else but I personally find it strange reading about someone hooking up with their best friend's sister.

It was also weird for me to think about Harry also hooking up with someone who had a crush on Harry ever since she started Hogwarts. It made me think that Ginny hooking up with Michael Corner and Dean Thomas was her way of “practicing” before she entered a relationship with Harry.

This actually helped in a way, I don't remember much from it but it was the very first Harry Potter fanfic I read and I enjoyed a clean slate of a character which also provided more interest as she was in Slytherin House.

Everything beyond that isn't. Prompts are short, one or two sentences, and a general idea left open for the authors to play with.

** The thing that grinds my gears the absolute most is the lack of logic, especially when it comes to claims of the truth. Going completely with canon, when pensieve memories are altered it is extremely obvious. Slughorn's edited memory blacks out entirely and his voice is yelling and booming. The effective editing that some fics claim exists is never shown, so why would memories not be used all the damn time? But beyond that, there's literally a truth potion. Like, half of the issues from GoF onwards could be solved with 3 drops. I'd love to see Harry waltz into the Ministry in the middle of OotP, cast Sonorus, and publicly challenge their beliefs with his offer of truth under Veritaserum. Hell, he's supposed to be a Gryffindor yet spends 3 separate books allowing nearly all of Hogwarts to bully him. Even factoring in his Slytherin tendencies that are never really shown, he should have done a press release right away, instead of hemming and hawing over it and putting it in the Quibbler. Or get a goddamn lawyer! Maybe there aren't libel/slander laws in Magical Britain, but so many other problems could be solved with some good legal counsel.

One point that I haven't seen tackled logically is the claim of Salazar Slytherin being evil. He created a school alongside Helga Hufflepuff. In my mind she's the one of the four who can unequivocally be classified as not being bad in any way, Gryff could be overly violent or Rowena could be snooty/elitist. Anyway, Salazar willingly created a school alongside at least one completely good witch. Why would she agree to work with him if he was evil? This has been addressed by stories that deal with the founders in some way, but no one in other fics I've read has asked why the ‘good' three would work with him.

Edit: Phrasing was weird, I meant the Slytherin thing to do would be a press release rather than yelling people into submission.

  “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, /very crudely done/, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
#+end_quote

I don't really see how Slytherin tendencies would factor into avoiding doing a press release, if anything that would be a cunning Slytherin move. Harry's stubborn (a Gryffindor trait), he wants people to believe him without needing to prove it (because he's right and everyone else isn't in his mind), he's even hesitant about doing the Quibbler article. More than that at this point in time they would still deny him no matter how truthful his testimony may appear-Fudge would do anything to avoid Harry telling the truth.

Harry never allows anyone to bully him, he consistently fights back and often has to be /stopped/ from doing so.

I think the thing with Harry is that by GoF and OoTP he's mostly decided it's not worth the effort-particularly in OoTP where he knows doing anything will cause more issues than it will likely solve.

** A lot of my annoyances have been shared so here's something I don't think is commonly discussed: magical travel.

It started with the Floo network, something I could live with. It's like the Ways in A Wheel of Time, something set up ahead of time, allowing magic to shorten the distances between destinations. Then Portkeys became a thing and a plot item. Fine, they may take special preparation or magical skill, so suspension of disbelief. Then Apparation came along, which anyone nearly of age can pull off, taking passengers when they're as young as Harry in 6th year. Of course we never saw Portkeys before they were needed, nor Apparation, aside from an apocryphal description in book 1 of landing on the school roof (which could just have been magical levitation).

Suddenly, a wizarding world that felt like a lot of little pockets of magical culture nestled among the mundane became a wholly insular world where anyone could just zap themselves here and there at will and ignore what lay between. It made the world seem small and petty.

** I have to be honest while I loved the book as a kid to the point of rereading each one at least once a year, I am sure that had I read them now for the first time I would have hated Harry Potter. There are several logical inconsistencies throughout the books for example the one that annoys me the most is the Fidelius Charm: we see in Deathly Hallows that people hidden by the Charm can be the Secret Keeper (Bill is Shell Cottage's secret keeper while living in the house) and yet the Potter instead of choosing James or Lily had to pick a person who wouldn't be in hiding with them. While it was clearly necessary to the plot, Rowling could simply have Bill and Arthur choose other people in order to maintain internal logic. I also hate everything about the epilogue, from Harry naming his son after a person who constantly mistreated him to him becoming an Auror after his problems with the Ministry. But the thing I dislike the most about the books is the fact that Rowling did everything in her power to make Harry as average as possible which is an horrible idea for a children/YA book's character considering that in these kind of books the children are the one supposed to solve problems. This lead to several problems with the plot for example all the wand lore shenanigans in DH could have been easily avoided if Harry was as powerful as Voldemort or Dumbledore and didn't need to be the Master of the Elder Wand in order to defeat him, also I always thought that in making Harry average she destroyed Dumbledore as a character. In fact Dumbledore, who is supposedly hyper-competent, still entrusts the defeat of the most powerful Dark Lord ever to an average teenager, thus looking an idiot in the process.

The only things that irked me in canon were the following.

- Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione.

I did not buy that. At all. I truly hoped for Harry and Hermione to find together, and I suspected a Harry / Luna ending after OotP. When it became Ginny, I felt really disappointed. To this day I shy away from fics that focus on a Harry - Ginny pairing.

- The Epilogue

Just... fucking christ. The whole chapter was just awful in my mind. From the names of the children (one obviously being the less loved son) to the implications of what they said to each other, it was just awful.

- HBP - pretty much as a whole.

The sixth novel set up the last one and it didn't do a great job. Especially jarring, for me, was the way in which Hermione and Ron just waved away Harry's concerns.
