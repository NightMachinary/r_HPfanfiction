I'm looking for any (preferably complete) fics where James and Lily don't die and Harry has a normal childhood with them.

Bonus points if: Harry is smarter and more talented than canon. Harry is not a twin. Good!Dumbledore At least ~100k words


** I would love to read something like this, but i think its really rare.

** linkffn(5353809) fits most of your criteria and is considered one of the classics. It has a twin but not as clich√©d as you might think.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6004275/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Greater-Good]] is also a great read! I haven't read it in a while, but I remember it being interesting and not too over the top.

** Linkffn(Hallowed) checks your boxes. Harry is still an only child, is entered into the TWT in his sixth year on his own merits, and Dumbledore seems secretive, but well meaning

Edit: Not longer than 100k unfortunately, but decent length from what I remember

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

** linkffn(6439871)

A Different Halloween By: robst

one of robst better works. Although it has Dumbledore bashing, it has more than 100K words and Harry is raised in a loving family so he seems smarter and more talented than in canon. I wish I can find more fics with similar starting plots as this one.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Twists of Fate ) Don't know how no one suggested this, though I found it extremely boring, considering its basically canon with a few OCs and modifications (Draco has a brother, Neville a sister, Harry's sister, and so on... ) and a new prophecy . But its exactly what you asked.

  Harry's parents didn't die that Halloween night, they even had a daughter just after going into hiding, and the Weasleys took care of Harry and his sister after the attack by Voldemort. Now what?
