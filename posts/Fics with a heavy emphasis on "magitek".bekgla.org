I'm not just talking about the awesome, bombastic pieces of magical technology, e.g. FTL interplanetary travel. I would also like library, where you can speak/choose a word, and it will filter the books you would like to read; better yet, it's all online accessible via Magical Google.


** Good luck finding some. Magitek stories aren't really the bread and butter of this sub. I'd recommend searching up old threads.

** linkffn(Core Threads) has elements of this, albeit only as innovation in pure magic rather than magitech. For example, one of the Cerberus's head's dies, Harry manages to save it's ghost, and he binds it to a spell he invented to search the library. Cerby will literally fetch books for you with all the searching skill of Google.

** Here's a few in the order that I remember them, not in order of quality:

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione is good at crafting spells and knows enough science to create some interesting effects. Laser spells, new (published) research in potion creation, custom transfigured molecules, grey goo, and a heart-stopping curse that looks dark but it's okay because it is really a slightly overpowered medical spell used as defibrillator.

Linkao3(Say a prayer by mad_fairy)

Harry is adopted by Loki (who is a weird mix of MCU and real Norse Mythology) and creates a Space Travel Club at Hogwarts. Diary Tom realizes that what Voldemort did didn't really work out that well and decides that the best way to save wizards from the muggles is to move to a different planet. SHIELD has no idea what is going on.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Smart-ass Harry with more scientific knowledge than most adults and a talent for finding canon plotholes. Time-turning shenanigans, custom molecule transfiguration at NEWT level in first year, rocket assisted broomsticks and a defense teacher who likes to use the Killing Curse on any threat because if it works, so why learn anything else?

Linkffn(Significant Digits)

A sequel to HPMoR. Where Harry fights for Medicare for all while running a research lab, Hermione uses Suborbital Kinetic Bombardement against prisons that use Dementors, Voldemort is sitting in a box and Ron is an astronaut.

Linkffn(So, how can we Weaponize this?)

A Nerd goes to Hogwarts. Laser Beam Of Death spells, a flying camper van, some insanity and a boat stolen from the US coast guards later, Voldemort has no chance. Doesn't really take itself very seriously.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage)

Harry Potter/Marvel Comics Universe. He is the adopted son of Tony Stark, has his own magically enhanced power suit, and learnt magic from Doctor Strange. Hogwarts is not ready. Not complete.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Harry creates runic devices for everything. Communication, fireworks, Voldemort-beating.

Linkffn(The Lightsaber)

Harry creates a Lightsaber, learns to use The Force (even though it's highly illegal dark magic), cures Werewolves and creates a company that makes Starfighters. Oh, and the centaurs absolutely love plasma weapons.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

The Ministry is full of Voldemort supporters and openly discriminates against mudbloods. But while the ancient wards of pureblood manors can easily defend against the most powerful of spells, they were never designed to handle a few dozen kilograms of plastic explosives and homemade Napalm. A fic where Seamus is a muggleborn with relatives in the IRA and gets to use his talent of blowing things up. Less high-tech and more explosive action.

** Only two come to mind:

HPMOR, but not to a very large extent (it's mostly some magical applications of certain science-knowledge), it's not really the main point of the fic, and people either love or really hate the fic.

The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig has a decent amount, and the concept is amazing, but the entire fic is basically a dirge where brief triumphs are rendered moot by ever-greater tragedy. I can only recommend it if you feel like dying inside a little.

Also, it was abandoned at a point that can make sense as an ending, but only a VERY downer one.

** My long time favorite is linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by Nonjon). Firefly crossover, but there's plenty of tech and magic, with some zany hijinks.

Also, if you're a fan of Darth Mars, he has a new Battlestar Galactica crossover in progress with plenty of techno-magery. He's about 70k and 17 chapters in, started about 4 months ago. Releasing weekly so far. linkffn(Invincible by Darth Mars)
