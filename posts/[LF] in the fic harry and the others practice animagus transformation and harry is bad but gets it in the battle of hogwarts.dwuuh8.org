:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
SPOILERS TO THE FIC IF YOU KNOW IT

Okay so he is a powerful dragon animagus, more specifically; the night's fury AKA toothless from how to train your dragon I dont know if the fic has stopped but it stopped annoyingly right after the transformation and i don't know if it's been continued

Please if you know it tell me

Thanks


** I don't know what the fic is but am I the only one who gets annoyed because I've read the HTTYD books and Toothless is supposed to be a small green dragon?

Sorry that I don't know the story, just wanted to ask that.

*** It is interesting how the film toothless is the rarest dragon there is whilst the book toothless is a common green (though I remember it being a running thing that toothless was a super rare permutation).

**** From what I read of the synopsis, book Toothless is actually a baby Seadragonus Giganticus Maximus.

*** Toothless is the main black dragon which is kind of op or idk something like that. I haven't read the books (I didnt even know there were books) so I wouldnt know what they say about toothless in the books

**** I've seen the first film as well, so I know what he is in them, it just annoyed me slightly. Toothless is a hunting dragon, and Hiccup has a separate dragon that he rides, who I think he just calls Windwalker (which is also the species name).

** the fic is dead. was last updated in 2014. right where you stated. the last words literally being "Night Fury". pissed me off too. but yeah, Dragon Raptor vanished around that time, and no one seems to have heard from him/her/they since.

*** Shame, it was such a cliffhanger ending that I can't comprehend it. Like come on you're not going to explain the reason why it's not been seen in such a long time? What are the magical properties? Just end it on Trelawney telling you something interesting for once and NOT EXPLAIN IT

It was too frustrating to read it another time over
