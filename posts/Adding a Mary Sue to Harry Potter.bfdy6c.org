My writing group and I had a discussion about what makes a bad fan fiction. We had a whole brainstorming session about how we could create a Harry Potter fic that would destroy Harry's character arc. We decided to to focus on the Goblet of Fire, because this is the turning point from innocent, sweet Harry, to teen and angsty Harry. We also added the humorous stipulations that when we wrote this, we could not edit anything we wrote and we passed of the story after every page. The next writer could only read what had come the page before.

The result was a surprising masterpiece, but also a train wreck. Camille's Harem presents for your reading pleasure, the Fith Chamopiaon!

  "You remind me of my mum," he said queitly.

  "Never say that to another girl, or me for that matter, ever again. " I told him. I then kissed him, ramming my tongue down his throat.

Doling out useful life lessons I see.

** Is there any chance you can post one with less spelling errors? It hurts to read. It's completely hilarious though

*** We could probably spend a weekend and upload an edited version so it doesn't destroy people to read it. Haha! We kept the fic in rawest form to give a nod to some of the worst garbage we have read and recorded from other fanfic writers.

Glad to hear that you're still enjoying the story regardless of Nate's horrendous spelling!

***** The original spelling for her name was von Huffleclaw Slitherdor, but I messed up when first writing her name and it stuck throughout the whole fanfic. Hahaha! There was a lot more that was supposed to go in, like a random flashback to when the four founders raised her and then sent her to live in an orphanage in New York City, which was meant to clash with her memory of her parents. Buuuuut.... We forgot about that tidbit too while writing.
