Harry and Nymphadora are a couple, they time travel to the 70s, get in a fight in Diagon Alley with a group of death Eaters(possibly Riddle himself as well). They also meet Andromeda and Ted in one of the shops.

I can't remember the name of this fic. I'd really like to read it again. Thanks.

*** Thank you for that. Shame it stops before Harry gets to teach a class. Wish it would update.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
