Hello Everyone! I wanted to know your guys favorite not as well known fics. It doesn't have to have 1 view, but just something not SUPER loved. I do have some specifications.

1. No slash.
2. No harem.
3. No Fem!Harry unless it's REALLY good.
4. Not well known, obviously.

P.S. This subreddit has been great about responding to my requests. If you've answered one of my past posts, and I haven't already thanked you, thanks.

Edit - Formating mistake.


** linkffn(11259389) is one I am shocked that few know about, probably because it's a Draco/OC fic, but I still find it a good read.
