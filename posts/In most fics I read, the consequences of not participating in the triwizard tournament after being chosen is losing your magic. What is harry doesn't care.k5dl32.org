Harry is tired of old wizards telling him what to do and magic has only made his life more difficult over the years, so when dumbledore told him he would lose his magic if he didn't participate, harry said "you can take my magic and shove it up snapes arse".


** There's a fic where he decides not to compete and snaps his wand and leaves Hogwarts and everyone is shook. Of course, the plot twist was that because he is fated to defeat, or at least fight, Voldemort, the prophecy's magic was stronger than the magic of the tournament's contract so when he breeched the contract by not competing, he was able to keep his magic. But no one knew because at that point the prophecy was still largely a secret.

** You then have three ways to go, either Harry goes muggle, the person that put his name in the goblet is on the hook, or they come up with some way to force him to participate (throw him in with the dragon, chuck him in the lake, etc.)

*** Realistically though only the latter two options would make it vaguely interesting. The first one is kind of the antithesis of having Magic as a thing in the universe, what's the point of establishing a story about magic, where there is no point to it. Just write a whole muggle AU or its just going to turn into Muggle wank. Its one of the things i like to see conserved in a fanfic, is that however shit the Magical World is, it's still preferable to the Muggle one.

**** The first option could still be interesting and magical if it just stops being about Harry. The rest of the story could be about Neville being forced to take up the mantle of the "Chosen One" and defeat Voldemort or something.

***** Bruh the Neville worship thing in fanfic is a huge turn off for me. For example when they say Neville is extremely powerful and on the same level of Harry because of the prophecy but it doesn't show due to his self esteem and confidence issues and cause of his dads wand

****** Its not just that, but the series is called Harry Potter. Doesn't make much sense if the titular character buggers off half way through, never to be seen again.

*** why wouldnt it get taken aswell though, i would imagine that all magic in Harry would get taken, including the negative Soul shard, aswell as Lilys protection aswell as the Dumbledore extended protection.
