Unfortunately, Dumbledore is assassinated that summer, so Harry won't have anyone looking out for him anymore.

** Well that's nice. A version of Dumbledore that actually looks out for Harry by actually checking to make sure he's well cared for and most importantly informed. The canon version of him just keeping Harry in the dark with everything, which didn't give him much of a fight chance, and basically raising him like a farm animal for slaughter disgusted me.

Have you not read the books?

Dumbledore didn't raise Harry to be "slaughtered" by Voldemort. That's just what he needed Harry to believe. Dumbledore loved Harry like family. He loved Harry so much, he took possibly the least utilitarian path to victory possible /specifically/ so Harry would live.

When Harry tells him in GoF that Voldemort used his blood to resurrect himself, Dumbledore gets an uncharacteristically "triumphant" look on his face because he knew, then, that Harry would be able to survive the Avada Kedavra because Voldemort sharing his blood would tie him to life, while the horcrux was destroyed.

If Dumbledore just needed Harry to die to get rid of the Horcrux, why does Voldemort /himself/ have to do it? It was all part of his plan to make sure that Harry would /live/.

**** The Prophecy exists, and we don't have a proper understanding of how magic works in Harry Potter.

For all we know, this was the best way to railroad Voldemort's death.

**** Plus! He did so much plotting in order to get all three Hallows to Harry.

..actually, I'm not sure when the thing with Draco's Wand happens, but it's probably after Dumbledore died, isn't it?

***** I thought Albus intended to take the Elder Wand to his grave so the world would be free of it but then Draco came and used /expelliarmus/. Albus probably thought "Well, shit" and a bit later died.

I don't think he could plan the whole confusing thing with Draco's wand.

*** He did care and look out for him.

He wanted to keep Harry a child; circumstance just kept that from happening. The only things he kept him from knowing were the prophecy and his status as a horcrux, both because he thought it would be too much to bear.

That Dumbledore looked at Harry as a means to an end is completely fanon.
