things that i would like (but im open to all suggestions! :3 )

- does not avoid lime/smut (in my opinion this is just part of any relationship, just dont overdo it on that topic)
- long
- happy ending
- m/f relationship

so not all points are to be kept of course! Most outstanding fic in that direction ive red thus far was "Angry Harry and the Seven", id like to broaden my horizon in this specific fic trope,- as i rarely find the hidden gems myself.


** linkffn(11697407) is the only good one in the marriage contract genre. I fear the other fics in it are mostly (read: pretty much all) terrible. Of course I would be happy to be proven wrong.
