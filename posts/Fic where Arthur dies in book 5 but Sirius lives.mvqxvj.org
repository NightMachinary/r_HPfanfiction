** Arthur dies in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). I don't remember what happens to Sirius but he isn't very close to Harry like canon. Harry is in Slytherin and he's definitely grey but he isn't an edge lord like many Slytherin Harry fics.

**** I found her to be a motherly figure when it was convenient. She overly mothered some of her children and over indulged others. She acted as if she always knew best even when she didn't.

It's no surprise the oldest five turned out the way they did:

Bill and Charlie chose jobs that took them far away, and bill then married a French woman.

Percy wanted to be the opposite of his family due to the isolation and socio-emotional neglect that he experienced similarly to Ron. Percy emulated Bills success to stand out as only his achievements seemed to be recognized, not Percy himself appeared to be valued.

The twins were pranksters that often bordered on bullies. The loss of her brothers likely impacting her letting them run wild to a degree.

Ron and Ginny were overly coddled in my opinion.

As a child I was always wary of her, particularly how she treated Sirius in his own house. She was always so quick to put Sirius down, not realizing how much trauma he suffered in Azkaban as well as how being back in his childhood home also come cause him to regress.

She always seemed so quick to say he saw Harry as James but I always felt like Molly tried to replace Lily in Harry's life without being asked and Harry had too much childhood abuse/trauma to correct her. Whether this was intentional or not it's odd to me she noticed he was too skinny but none of the signs of neglect.

***** I don't disagree that Molly was often overbearing, but uhh...

Percy was embarrassed by his father's lack of ambition. He, however, recieved new robes and an owl for his achievements.

Ron wasn't coddled at all. In fact, JKR went out of her way to write his parents' treatment of him almost opposite of Ginny, Bill, Percy, and Harry.

And there's really nothing wrong with the way her children turned out.

Bill was a top student, head boy, prefect, and was, apparently, successful in his career.

Charlie was apparently successful as well.

Percy had top marks, was HB/prefect, and fell assbackwards into a good career positions.

The twins were successful business men and talented wizards.

Ginny and Ron both had successful careers.

And what's wrong with marrying a French woman?

****** I'm not saying she was a bad mother but I ALWAYS SAW it as she created a lot of pressure on each of her children to be successful which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I expressed why I saw Molly as insufferable and we can agree to disagree.

However her intolerance of things not fitting into her mold was off putting TO ME as a child and as an adult as someone who was never good enough for failing to meet stereotypes and generalizations.

If you like her that's great for you, but she never came off as particularly likable to me and thus my comment about finding her quite insufferable. Her treatment of Sirius is why I would have rather had Sirius survive. While I didn't mind Arthur I never quite took to the Weasleys. I saw them as a family who seemed too invested in Harry's actions considering how little time they spent together relatively speaking.

To me, Percy was embarrassed by Arthur yes but he also seemed embarrassed by the whole lifestyle of his family that was much larger than it likely should have been. Yes the family loved themselves but I felt it irresponsible to keep having kids if they were struggling. I know it's not canon but it almost felt like she only wanted a daughter. She had favorites, Bill and Ginny. Bill's nature and exploits made Molly very fond of her eldest, and Ginny was the girl so awaited by the Weasleys for more than a century.

Percy is not looked at in a particularly flattering light by his family. All of Percy's siblings were either mocking (the younger) or condescending (the older) towards him. Molly didn't know or possibly didn't care to support to two isolated sons in Percy and Ron.

Percy acted accordingly, trying to Emulate the success that made Bill a clear favorite to Molly. Molly rewarded Percy for all he achieved not in Percy himself but his scholastic achievements themselves.

Ron seems coddled TO ME in the sense that he never seemed to have a concern about the real world. He grew up thinking he would be the best friend like Ginny would be the wife. His concerns were essentially the cannons and his next meal. He couldn't really be bothered to do his schoolwork or chores. Granted that is how a lot of teens are, but I honestly feel like his inferiority complex was in part due to Molly.

The French comment is based on the England- France rivalry. Bill did what he could to rebel his mother's expectations whether intentional or not: long hair, earring, and marrying a French woman instead of a “respectable British witch”

I lost a lot of respect for her after her initial treatment of Fleur as well as learning she potentially love potioned Arthur. I don't see how telling others she once brewed love potion could be a good thing when Ginny at that point seemed to have a crush on the boy who lived persona instead of her brothers friend.

Her children were successful in different ways because of how she tried to micromanage many of them. Being successful academically for example was a one way ticket for the oldest two at least in my opinion.

******* When I read the books I got a feeling that Molly never particularly gave Ron much attention. There was always someone doing better, creating a bigger mess or seeming more vulnerable that unless he did something dramatic (steal a car) he was basically left alone.

The fact that Molly went through the barrier before Ron I think says a lot. And that We see she shows Harry so much more love and attention than we ever see her show Ron.

I agree with you on basically all the other points, an incredibly overbearing mother would drive away kids as we.see happen.

******** Maybe coddle was the wrong phrasing... but it felt that way in comparison to Percy. I can't think of the parenting style but I know it's not authoritarian or authoritative... it just came across confusing where basic needs are met but the emotional ones arent

Her black and white thinking annoyed me especially with why the twins and Ron had to rescue Harry as well. She was far from the worst parent in the potter universe but I never understood the hype except for her battle With Bellatrix.

The whole barrier thing was always fishy to me. I never even thought about her going in before Ron. For someone who had five students before Ron it was odd to me how Harry learned to get to the platform from Molly. In CoS I found it odd how Ron and Harry had to go last.

********* Yeah, after Percy pushed away from the family and without charlie and bill she focused her attention on the only children she could. That happened to be Ron and ginny

But her battle with Bellatrix felt so wrong. She is portrayed as this dumpy housewife and she absolutely destroys one of Voldy's top duelists.

Not that any character in the books actually seems like they have ever practiced dueling in their life. Children should not beat death eaters, it should have been a slaughter.

********** Speaking as a dumpy housewife, I freaking love that she beats Bellatrix. ;-)

Molly is seen through Harry's eyes, who knows what she did and what skills she has besides those centred on her home and family? My own children were very surprised when they first saw me on stage- they had no idea I was an actor before they were born, yet acting took up a great deal of my pre-kid life.

Molly beating Bellatrix demonstrates some of the major themes of the novels- that heroes come from all walks of life, even ones that are often devalued,(See: Dobby) that people are complex and can surprise you for good or bad (Sirius, Pettigrew) and that the 2 dimensional stereotypes we come up with as kids are rarely a perfect fit. (Neville is underestimated, Snape is not just the "bully teacher", Dudley is capable of growth, Dumbledore is not just a light-hearted, twinkly eyed eccentric, and Molly has skills other than those of a housewife)

********* A lot of that Weasley stuff is because Rowling bends the characters to develop the plot. Molly was talking about the platform because Rowling wanted the entrance to be weird, to introduce this family to Harry. If Molly's behaviour went against worldbuilding or character then it doesn't matter cause plot comes first.

Second year, she is mad about the flying car so that they get in trouble when they take it and can be told to go to an adult first (Lockhart). She goes through before the boys because the plot says so, not because she is neglectful.

Rita's articles needed to have a visible impact rather than just telling us students distrust Harry again. Molly dislikes Fleur so we can get a double love confession in the hospital wing. She jokes about love portioning Arthur cause Rowling wasn't concerned about consent for men.

I choose to think the best of all characters so I prefer to read from Au's that get rid of these counteractive flaws.

Rowling put a lot of depth into her characters, Molly, Remus and Sirius have flaws that work for a kids story, but as I'm older I want to see them learn and grow. (Like, wow Remus had a good character moment in the hospital wing as he learns to accept the love from Tonks, but two months later he's running away again.)

******* his inferiority complex isn't because of his mother, but because of how many siblings he has. And, I'm sure many of his brothers felt the same. Ron felt like the least loved Weasley boy, but that wasn't true at all. None of them were coddled. And, if you had 6 sons, wouldn't you want a daughter as well? I don't think they kept on trying for a girl, I think most of them were genuinely mistakes. Also, while she didn't treat Fleur well, she treated her bad because she didn't think Fleur actually loved Bill. After Bill's face got marred and Fleur still wanted to marry him, she treated her better. That was her being overprotective mama bear. Why would she treat Harry like a Lily replacement when she wasn't even close to Lily? And, Grimmauld Place was a MESS, it needed to be cleaned up. Molly was like a mother to Harry, but Sirius had only just met him. Sirius did treat him like a James clone. She was invested in Harry's actions because he didn't have parents who could be. Maybe she wasn't the world's greatest mom, but she cared and loved them all and she always did the best she could. She had good intentions for sure.

******* Her love potioning Arthur is not canon. He also had no clue Harry liked Ginny until 6th when Harry kissed her, and even then his reaction was essentially ‘well, if you must'. I don't see how he was somehow plotting to have Harry married to Ginny the entire time he knew him. And really? His only concerns are the Cannons and food?
