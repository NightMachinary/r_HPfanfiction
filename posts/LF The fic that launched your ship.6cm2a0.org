Hey guys and gals, long term lurker, first time poster. I'm going on a long flight later and would love some recs. I love me some shipping and I have no issue with slash or het, crack or cannon, angst or fluff. Please recommend me a fic or a classic fic that shows off your OT(P/3) so I can join in the love and realise all along, that Dobby and the squid were meant for each other and fight anyone who says any different. I have an open mind and it would be hypocritical for me to judge so please dazzle me with your favs.

** linkffn(4062928).

Harry Potter and Ice Cream Delights.

I am a stupidly huge fan of Harry/Luna, though i admit its more of her fannon personality. Luna has this whole "other" feel to her character in cannon and when i see the fans interpret that by pulling out the Fey mythologies i fall in love.

Harry/Luna is one of my favorite takes on Wild falling for Calm. Add in all the nods to somewhat older and more innocent courting practices and i love this story.

**** Linkffn(The Flurry of Life by R3aper; Triwizard Champions by chris400ad; Rude to Stare by Elis1412; Letters by TheEndless7)

Flurry of Life a Series of one shots all Harry/Fleur (or Flu-rry) , nice and fluffy and what it is, one shot series

Triwizard Champions is a contemporary of my first post, about as good as the one I posted. Mid sized story

Rude to Stare, Fleur is the one to be interested, very interested in a believe 14 year old Harry with zero experience. Again a One shot single

Letter is probably the best written of the ones posted, Harry and Fleur are pen pals, has hands down the BEST triwizard tournament in all of Fanfiction. Longer story. Highest recommendation

The biggest problem with the Harry/Fleur end of the Fandom is that Fleur isn't extraordinary popular like Daphne (for whatever reason) or any Slash relationship, so Fleur isn't the solo pairing in many stories, she does land in lots of Harems and Multis so you may need to seek those out to get more Fleur/Harry

** Harry/Draco!! So the first fic that turned me to them was Irresistible Poison by Rhysenn. You can find the completed story on Fiction Alley. It's a veeeery old fic though and only compliant up to like book 3 iirc, so I don't know how well it fares against the passage of time.

But for a really, really fantastic epilogue-compliant Harry/Draco fic I recommend Turn! I reread this one every so often because it's so good and the characterizations are so on point.

** Drarry (or Drarry + Hermione) forever! I say this after reading many different ships. While the quality of the HP fandom writing is astounding, I found some Drarry writers who just take it to another level completely as far as what I /personally/ look for in a story (i.e., literary/lyrical prose). My absolute favorite fan work of all time is Danse Russe by Frayach, but I'd also recommend checking out saras_girl, lettered, Aja's older fiction, and new-on-the-scene bixgirl1 (all on AO3).

** My fav ship is H/Hr so canon (except for HBP) I guess. It's really difficult to get their dynamic right though. Beginning a romantic relationship is often either too easy or too hard for the wrong reasons. It makes sense for both of them to be cautious for example, it shouldn't be to the detriment of their friendship though (defeating the purpose, if the reason for their caution is not wanting to ruin their friendship). Also many authors seem so influenced by canon that they can't manage to avoid the same pitfalls of H/G or Ronmione.

The worst part about shipping fanfics is how they often 'fuse' the romantic partners and they don't even seem to exist as unique people anymore. It happens to H/Hr a lot, it seems worst for canon centric fics though, in particular with Ronmione (when Harry is the protagonist and they only seem to appear as some weirdly fucked-up unit). Sorry for the tangent.

In a lot of ways the "perfect" fic for my ship has still to be written, but some are relatively close. In this thread Potato19 (I really like "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149290/1/Imagination][Imagination]]") has already been mentioned, most of her fics are really close, though a lot of it is quite AU. Also lorien829 writes great Harmony, I can really recommend "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]]", not just for the pairing (one of the very few finished 7th year replacement fics with a cohesive plotline and not just a single gimmick).

Other noteworthy fics:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis]])

Vox Corporis gets a lot of things right and there's good reason it is mentioned so regularly.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]])

This is another fic that came to my mind. I really enjoyed how the relationship developed. Although it's been a while since I've read it so no guarantees.

*** so you say, that in most H/Hr fics, they become a couple that is built on their romance and their friendship has no such value anymore? And what do you mean with Pitfalls of H/G and Romione? Do you mean with that, that there is to much interaction between H/G and R/Hr to separate them anymore or that in the attempt to put H/Hr together, they accidently end up with the canon pair? Do you want H/Hr in Canon or AU? Im a H/Hr shipper myself and eager to read any fic thats as close to canon as possible (a lot of fics deliver an H/Hr outcome for DH, but im also interested in some HBP stuff, but since the plot of the Canon is so dumb, i guess its difficult to create this couple for the sake of the actual Plot).

Sort of. Symptoms are usually that Hermione becomes much less competent and is more of a trophy wife. At best she gets to read a book from time to time or makes a bossy remark... it's ... weird.

No, the main pitfall I'm thinking of that they are decreed by word of god (or author) to be together and that there's no real work being done to convince the reader why they should be together. I'm already 'sold' on HHr, so I'm okay with most fics that just throw them together, but those are not fics that I could recommend to someone else. Canon has the exact same problem: Why are these people even together? Sometimes I'm surprised that many people complain about soulbond fics so much, yet canon (except it doesn't use the word soulbond) shows all the symptoms of one: Fate/God/Author has decided these two people complete one another and will end up together, no matter how incompatible they seem (because JKR wanted to stick to her original epilogue no matter what happened in the books).

I get a lot of enjoyment out of fics that try to explain the OOC behaviour in HBP with them being potioned up to the gills or imperiused or something. There's nothing that is ever going to make me believe that Hermione would believe in Draco over Harry. That just isn't right.

***** Haha, im ignoring any Fic, that has the Word "Soulbond" considering H/Hr in its summary, because Rowling has written on Pottermore (which i dont take serious, by the way) in the Ginny article, that she is Harrys Soulbond (or was it mate? i dont know anymore). But the Word itself is suggest me, that H/Hr are to easily becoming a couple and they became God (or powerful)-like beings. At first i wanted to read a decent written Fic with them together, but then i experienced, that the "i love you" line is pretty out of place, in my eyes. Probably because The Books dont consider loveships and romance in the mainview, but its more some sort of "sideeffect", however, there are some Fics when this line is used (Deathly Hallows Revisited by redstarpuppy), but just in the end. i got used to this and think its fine, but if i take the Original as a base, where these Words arent used, i feel they are out of place and want H/Hr say them after Years, if they are happily married, or atleast a couple for a couple of Years. Slow built Romancefics could also be tempting, the mentioned Fic by me multiple situations in which either Harry or Hermione asked the other one a Question, but are always interrupted by differenct circumstances. As i read the Fic for the first time, i was annoyed by this (and i probably would be by similar situations in different Fics), but now i think about it as a good/great way to built their Relationship. But i feel like i can only read those slow-built fics with Harry and Hermione unbounded (means, not together or in a relationship with their Canon partners), maybe at the beginning, but they break up. Because for me it feels like they stealing their Partners (either Harry and Hermione having an affair with her pregnant with his baby and they pretend its Rons or by they having something, their Spouses getting suspicious and divorce...probably to the pain of ther Children. And i cant stand any lovescenes of R/Hr and H/G, if i actually wanted a H/Hr fic)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing.
