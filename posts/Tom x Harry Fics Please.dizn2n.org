I've read a ton of Tom x Harry fics and would like to see if their are any I haven't read yet.


** There's also Linkao3(Stand Against the Moon by batsutousai) and its sequel, Nose to the Wind.

Linkao3(Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW) is incomplete if you don't mind reading a WIP.

#+begin_quote
  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

** Here are a few that I've enjoyed recently:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13377375/][The All Seeing Eye Glass]] - A comedic (but often serious) HP/TMR time travel fic. linkao3(13377375)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581/][Of Your Making]] - During the Battle of Hogwarts Harry and Voldemort are trapped together in a unique magical prison. (Voldemort's soul is knitted back together in the process of transporting them there, thus he returns to what he was like in his younger years.) linkao3(14368581)

You mentioned reading "More Precious than Rubies", so here are a few AU fics with premises that are a little more off the wall.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17541269/][before they convinced you life is war]] - A mysterious magical disaster transposes everyone's minds into an alternate universe with X-Men like powers instead of magic. (Written by Eclipse Wing who also wrote "Inevitabilities") linkao3(17541269)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042234/][The Killing Instinct]] - A Claymore crossover. Everyone is mostly OOC in this fic, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. linkao3(12042234)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888734/1/Jonquils-and-Lightning][Jonquils and Lightning]] - A dimension traveling MOD!Harry encounters a dimension traveling Tom Riddle. linkffn(12888734)

  No one really remembers the history behind the arrival of the Inferi; most know only that they did come, that their hunger for flesh was as endless as the void, and that their presence amongst them brought nothing but death and fear. The only ones strong enough to defeat them were the ‘Silver Eyed Demons' known as Claymore, half-human and half-inferi warriors created by the Order of the Phoenix to be used as living weapons to push back the threat. But their presence on the Island of Draiocht only led to more unrest, many believing the unnatural hybrids to be far more dangerous than the monsters themselves.Harry Potter was orphaned at a young age and left othered from the inhabitants of Godric's Hollow by his status as a Wizard, but when his little town is forced to call on the Order's aid his life is irrevocably changed and a cold hearted monster is given a reason to live beyond an empty duty.

*** !linkao3(Runic War Warding)

fem!Harry/Voldemort. This is honestly one of the best fanfictions I have ever read. Featuring a sensible but still evil Voldemort, a very well-written fem!Harry, and one of the best Snapes I have read in any fic.

!linkao3(I give you all of me all of you)

fem!Harry/Scarcrux. The scar horcrux starts speaking with Harry when she's six, giving her guidance and generally being an arse.

!linkffn(Devil Take the Hindmost)

fem!Harry/Voldemort. The horcrux in Harry forged a powerful connection between Harry and Voldemort's minds, making him aware of her status from almost the moment Voldemort was discorporated. Harry naturally ends up being darker with Voldemort speaking to her nonstop.

!linkffn(Power is Control)

Harry/fem!Voldemort. Voldemort is drawn to Harry by the horcrux in his scar, and sets out to claim him as hers after she is returned to a physical form at the end of the TWT. First in an ongoing series.

!linkffn(Descent by aelursadgod)

fem!Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Abandoned, but still worth a read.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. This is blatant self-promotion on my part. Tamelyn Riddle notices the horcrux in Harry's scar in the chamber of Secrets, and decides that merging with it would be preferable to killing Ginny for a body of her own. She winds up stuck in Harry's head, and the two come to an uneasy truce to get her a body in exchange for getting Voldemort off of Harry's back.

!linkffn(Moratorium)

fem!Harry/diary!Riddle. The relationship only happens at the end of the story, but Tom is a constant companion for Harry throughout the story.

!linkffn(When Harry Met Tom)

fem!Harry/Tom. Harry winds up in the past after an accident in the DOM battle at the end of her fifth year. She just wants to get back to the present without changing things too much, but Tom Riddle's interest in her is rendering that all but impossible.

!linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17)

fem!Harry/Tom. Being Master of Death has sent Harry on a constant stream of being reborn into the bodies of the recently deceased. after being reborn countless times, Harry ends up in the body of a young witch who meets Tom in his London orphanage, who promptly claimed her as his.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm Harry,” she finally offers when the silence in the cupboard feels like it's going to overwhelm her. “Harry Potter.” There's a warm sense of satisfaction resting in her stomach, not her own, and Harry doesn't know why Tom seems so smug. It's wonderful to meet you, Harry he practically purrs, sounding like he's whispering directly into her ear. Harry twitches, a small smile starting to grow on her face. “Are you going to help me, Tom?” If you'll let me. I'll take very good care of you, Harry. Tom Riddle starts talking to Harry when she's six.

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  Harry has almost accepted that he won't be going back to his own time, and he's working in a small apothecary in Diagon Alley to make ends meet. Then someone tries to blow up his employer's shop, and that brings him face-to-face with Tom Riddle, who he successfully avoided during his time at Hogwarts.

*** Just a heads up because I think it's important people are aware, diagnosis by maidenmothercrone is literally just Grey's anatomy with the names changed. Huge sections of plot and scenes are word for word from the show. It's pretty ridiculous how much credit the author took for plot/ideas/words that are not their own.

Though judging by their other fics and quotes they lifts from TV shows without credit/acknowledgement, it's something that they do pretty often.

*** When I saw "TheObsidianQuill" I thought you meant "ObsidianPen", who also writes TomxHarry.

I quite like No Glory, but it's very dark. Dunno if it's the kind of story you're looking for.
