Basically a father son relationship like that of Doctor and Scott Evil in Austin Powers.

  Instead of trying to have Barty impersonate an auror for an entire school year, intact an insanely elaborate plan entering Potter into the tournament where he could die multiple times, only to kidnap him in the end, why don't you just have Barty kidnap Potter on the Hogwarts express at the start of term?

  Scott...ya just don't get it, do ya? You don't.

** Awww. Perfect chance to slip in Delphi, and you don't go for it. Damn. I really like her as a concept. You'd rather wholesale make up a son instead of use the canon daughter? :D Wow.

*** I just watched the Austin Powers movie where Doctor Evil and his son Scott constantly disagree on how to properly do stuff, and imagined Voldemort in the same situation. Delphi would work too, but I was thinking someone who would be a little older than Harry and a young adult by the time Voldemort returns so that we can have scenes where father and son are trying to manage the Death Eater movement but disagree on stuff.

**** Voldemort would never admit it out loud but he enjoys the fact his son often disagrees with him, and not a feeble disagreement but a ruthless calculated disagreement filled with logic and reasoning's, Voldemort had actually enjoyed debating in Hogwarts as a youth, and while he did enjoy the sheer terror he admitted in his followers he greatly enjoyed having someone who shared his brilliance and someone he could bounce ideas off and someone who would not just grovel. I mean nobody had suggested to him before to just wait till Dumbledore died of old age before starting his next attempt at power.

If there's anything longer, I'd like to see it too!

  Alternate Universe. Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange were killed in the 1970's, and a girl with silver-blue hair ended up being born a generation earlier... A few rough sketches set in the summer and early autumn of 1991. One-shot. Rated 'T'.

  AU. One-shot. Delphini is able to travel through time, and means to keep doing so, until she can ensure her father's victory. It's a shame for her that Nyarlathotep is watching... Rated: 'M'. Warning: HORROR. TRAGEDY. Major character death.
