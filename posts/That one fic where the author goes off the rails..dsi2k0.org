:END:
They had a time travel bit, and the story was about 150k words, with about 100k of those words being " And turns " because Harry was going back 13 years with a time turner.


** That sounds like a parody of How Harry Potter should have ended

** I could see this being an interesting fic concept, if done right. A story told backwards, crafted through seeing the important moments that happened in in one place alone, a few minutes or half an hour at a time, with the words 'And turns' just acting as a scene divide.

I suspect that you don't mean it was done like that, though...

*** It was more of a "and turns and turns and turns and turns and turns and turns and turns and turns and turns" instead of that, but that sounds interesting anyways, think of Harry going backwards in time towards the Marauder's era by turning a timeturner in the great Hall, the scenery flashing by, the sun beginning to look not as a ball, but as a line across the twilight sky. The children becoming young men and women, blending into each other as Harry continues to turn the timeturner, the scene staying nearly static, pumpkins and Christmas decorations staying for seemingly all year, the inevitable passage of time reversed, and the old, becoming younger as Harry stays static.

That is a scene, certainly one I'd like to read.
