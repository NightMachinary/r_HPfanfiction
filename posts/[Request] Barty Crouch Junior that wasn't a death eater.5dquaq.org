** Barty Jr is often bad even in time travels or Voldemort free world.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), after Harry exposed him as a Death Eater, his father sent him to Azkaban immediately, although he didn't commit any specific crime.

In *Riddled Universe*, linkffn(8678567), he was part of a conspiracy trying to destroy Tom Riddle.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** I've read a few stories where Barty just sat and watched the Lestranges torture the Longbottoms, and one where Alecto Carrow polyjuiced herself as Barty. I can't remember the names to any of the fics, though.

** Considering that Sirius didn't get a trial either (technically Crouch Jr had a 'trial', but he wasn't allowed any defense from what I recall), you'd think that fanfic authors would be all over this.

I guess that being behind the whole Triwizard Tournament thing sours any sympathy fanfic authors might have for him, mind.

Here's a thought that someone could run with: Barty was really innocent the whole time; when Peter and Voldemort came to his house, they put him under an imperius of their own and set him to impersonate Moody ala canon (Why? Because the real Moody's got enough willpower to resist the Imperius). And...someone else shot up the Dark Mark during the Quidditch World Cup, I guess.
