What are, in your opinion, the best AU fan fiction ever? And why?


** POTDK and the Firebird Trilogy. I can't choose one, but both are incredibly creative.

POTDK is a Voldemort Won AU which manages to stay true both the character of Voldemort as well as Harry which is no easy feat. Sadly incomplete but what is there manages to paint a rather believeable picture and is very creative.

The Firebird Trilogy takes place in a matriarchal society. I've never read anything like it, the dystopia he builds is highly creative. Darth Marrs manages to create an amazing world, but the plot does go a bit off the rails towards the end. The subversion of usual harems as well as the political landscape are well thought out. Well worth a read.

**** A matrilineal society formed centuries before canon due to a number of important physical and magical disparities between wizards and witches. Now females control everything in society, for good or ill, and generally force males to marry in order to maintain their population. There is also some elemental information (not like avatar though) and Harry is an aether (sort of a magic sensor). Its sort of depressing, yet at the same time understandable within the context of the story. Its also, arguably, one of the only /good/ examples of a harem story, because it spends 80% of the story trying to tell the reader why they are bad in the first place.

** Linkffn(the havoc side of the force)

Star wars harry potter crossover with Harry in the prequels universe. Harry doesn't just wave his wand and fix every problem and the Jedi are weary of him for the most part. The story does not under power the Jedi or sith. Harry keeps winning because people underestimate him, which I will be fair, feels a bit like a cop out.

Also a great hk-47 who never fails to make me laugh.

More like because wizardry is just straight out more powerful than the force, no way around it.

Jedi and sith are remarkable compared to normals because they're essentially highly trained magical warriors. Harry on the other hand is a highly experienced magical warrior wielding a much more versatile power that actually disrupts the force when used. Harry losing basically requires HIM underestimating the enemy or being caught off guard.
