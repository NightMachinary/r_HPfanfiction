  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.

** I'm imagining a grumpy Death who's exhausted all the time because of his job continually reaping all life on earth. Humans, goblins, cows, right down to blades of grass and microorganisms (though he's thankfully got an automated system for most plants and bacteria and other very-simple-minded things).

The guy got his hopes up when Fiendfyre was discovered, and again with basilisks, and again with the atomic bomb, because he just wishes that all life on earth would go extinct already so he can finally have a vacation.

*** Some people might think that being death, being eternal, being absolutely powerful, is great. Well, most people in this generation probably would. But it isn't.

I, am death. And i confess, that at the start of my career i probably had the worst time of my life (or death? whatever, moving on) because, most people tend to ignore the many billions things i have to kill each second. Each small, minuscule little organism, plant, bacteria, virus, animal and so many others - is actually quite tiring. But, i am death for a reason, i'm not some kind of dumb, and hardworking person. No, i'm many things, but certainly not dumb, and not hardworking, or workaholic.

I thought out, a, very cunning and clever plan, if i dare say so myself, to automate most deaths. And, it worked! For the most part.. I have found out that it is physically impossible to kill everything automatically. Because of that, i have thought up another genius plan. Well, i thought it was, but turns out it actually isn't, because i began trying, to kill of as many living things on earth as possible, so to all life to go extinct. But that failed miserably. I tried it multiple times, and each time i tried i ended up failing. Magical exhaustion (How could /Death/ not have enough magic?), tiredness, depression, anger, laziness.

Therefor, my hopes got up dramatically when i discovered these humans, found out how to be effective at killing themselves. I was ecstatic, dreaming of my perfect vacation at the moon, with some souls to suck on, but that hope came crashing down. Apparently, they didn't want to kill themselves because they like reproducing (Filthy humans).

I, death, will resign from my job as death immediately, if you the very unlucky stranger found this basket with candy and the three hallows.

Your beloved friend, and master

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.
