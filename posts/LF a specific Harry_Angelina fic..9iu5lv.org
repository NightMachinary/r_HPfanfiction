It was on FF.net where I read it about three years ago. It's set in Order of the Phoenix and a conservative estimate would put it at least at 30,000 words. I think they kiss after Angelina finds out about Harry's detention with Umbridge. Also I remember Draco creepily flirting with her and he may have tried to force himself in her. Harry finds out uses wandless magic to force choke him or something. These are pretty much the only things I remember about it.

I'll be honest. I'm only reading this for the pairing. It's the only Harry/Angelina fic I've seen that is over isn't really short or doesn't include Katie and Alicia in a sexy time foursome.


** It's also on [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/2816523/1][fictionhunt]] if you prefer. I remember quitting this story after the whole Malfoy thing happened. Felt weird.

*** Ok thanks. I think I was the same honestly. The reason my estimate was so low was because I stopped reading it at some point. I can't remember why, but I'm sure I'll find out.

*** Thanks for answering! That's the fic I was looking for. Also thanks for inadvertently informing me of this site's existence. I didn't even know it existed until now.
