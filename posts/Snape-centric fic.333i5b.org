Example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]] *Summary*: AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley.

Looking for similar works! Time travel and pairings are my favorites to read though I'm not picky. Thank you in advance!~


** The best Snape story is doubtlessly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] which is the life story of Severus Snape (according to books only, it was written post-HBP up to 2008 originally - with surprisingly little edits as the author more or less figured out The Prince's Tale verbatim, and since has been moved from place to place until 2012). Warning: it is extremely well written, Snape comes out quite sympathetic, and spends very little time focusing on students, as it focuses on what he finds important.

Until you've read this, you cannot call yourself a fan of the character. I think that Snape would have been more self-aware, aggressive, less victimized, and more of a git... but you cannot take away the fact that this is one of the best stories to come out of fan fiction, if not the absolute best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]] is the most popular HGSS story, though I don't think it's anywhere near the best, but since my taste isn't universal it is a good place to start. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] is the most popular of the pairing including time travel (I think). [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377&warning=1][Practical Solutions]] by Aurette is my personal favorite of this pairing because it combines a short length, clever humor, possibly the sharpest dialogue in the fandom, and sex jokes everywhere.

That should satisfy you for a while.
