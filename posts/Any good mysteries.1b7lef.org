I'm open to pretty much anything: private investigator, magical CSI taskforce, protagonist sticking his/her nose where it doesn't belong, theft, murder, organized crime, whatever. I'd rather stay away from suspense stories, but if they're very good I might give them a shot. I'm good with any length, any rating, any era, and any level of canon (non)compliance.

My only requests:

- No Harry/Hermione;
- No Snape romance (minor background couplings are OK, as long as it's with someone his own age);
- No Weasley-bashing (well... I can give a pass on Percy-bashing);
- No non-magical/"Muggle Life" AU.

But please share what you've got, even if it doesn't meet my own personal requirements -- hopefully others will appreciate it!


** Oh, oh, I do! It's a short one, but very well-written and sad. There was a girl sorted in /Philosopher's Stone/, and never mentioned again; where did she go?

Not quite what you're looking for, but it's a pretty good story.

*** Skimmed the first chapter and I'm already hooked. I've been let down by abandoned WIPs too many times to trust this one, but I am definitely going to be checking back frequently in hopes of finding a completed story! Thank you!

** Dark Gods in the Blood "A wandering student comes home, a broken man pays his penance, and a gruesome murder is both more and less than it seems. Some paths to self-discovery have more twists and turns than others." Rated R, there are scenes of graphic violence. This is well written mystery, though if memory serves it does contain an element of Hermione (in her thirties)/Snape [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/DGITB.html]]
