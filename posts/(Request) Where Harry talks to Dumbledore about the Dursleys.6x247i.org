Looking for a fic where Harry sometime during first year tells Dumbledore about his life with the Dursleys. He says at some point during the talk that it was never 'home'.


** Okay, but the bloodwards won't crumble just because someone says something. That trope is really annoying to me because anyone who has ever raised or even watched kids know they throw around hurtful words left and right. "This isn't my home" is hardly a rare statement from an angsting kid. Obviously after all Harry went through in cannon he still had a home there, even if it was a shit one, so arbitrary statements like "Hogwarts is my home" or whatever don't magically cancel out protection based on his mother's blood sacrifice tied to her only living relatives.

*** Surely it depends on what Harry really believes.

Sure, most kids have tantrums and say silly things but they still love their parents and home, just can't effectively communicate frustration to their parents.

Harry on the other hand has suffered abuse and probably does actually hate the Dursleys, it makes perfect sense to me that he doesn't consider Privet Drive his home.

*** Sorry, but I have to put in my own opinion about this. The story was never very clear in how the bloodward works, but if we are to believe it is to protect harry, and his family by blood it should never have allowed vernon to harm harry when in the first book he physically dragged harry to his "room", and threw him into his cupboard. Vernon is in no way related to harry by blood, so it stands to reason(at least to me) that the blood wards were weakened so much that it only affected Voldemort, but never protected "home". It was just plain dumb luck that he was never attacked or killed. Show me one instance when the bloodwards protected "home", and kept him safe there.
