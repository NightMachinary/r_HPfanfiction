  It's easy to cheat on tests when you have a very knowledgeable Dark Lord only a mind's connection away. Oneshot. Winner of the 2011 DLP April Humor Competition!

** Are you looking for epic battles between the two or just... clever banter? Or are your looking for a plot that brings the two characters together in a (non-romantic I'm guessing?) united front?

It also depends how focused you want the story to be on that desired interaction.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
