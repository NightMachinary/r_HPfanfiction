I thought of this yesterday...So, Medusa's story is ridiculously depressing. Just awful, as hapoened to most mortals who interacted with the gods in greek mythology. Harry is a good kid, kinda stupid sometimes, but good. I just had the thought, of what if they meet? I could see it going a few different ways...

1. For whatever reason, Medusa (wearing a hooded cloak/jacket or smth) is there when Harry is dropped off at Privet Drive. Not with Dumbledore and the others, but walking around for some reason. Not like she can really go out easily in the day, so wandering at night makes some sense. She hears him crying, maybe, or sees him, and is like "really I thought mortals stopped leaving leaving babies outside to die of exposure like, 6 centuries ago at the latest". She goes to the baby, and a snake pops out of the hood. Harry sees it and babbles in parsletongue. He's only one, it wouldnt be full sentences but just hearing him cry for mommy and daddy in the language of snakes might give a (mistaken) idea why he's been left out. So she takes, and raises, baby Harry. Cute snake shenanigans follow. Maybe parslemouths can't be turned to stone from her gaze (are they all descended from her, perhaps?) so she finally has someone that can look at her. Or maybe they can, so he has to wear special snake vision repelling glasses, and she does as well.

2. Harry is a bit older when they meet, sometime before fifth year (I'm thinking between 6 years and 13 years old). However old he is, its enough to know he's unwanted and unloved by his family, and to be hurt by that rejection. Maybe she sees him talking to a snake in the garden, maybe when he runs after blowing up Marge he runs into her, not the Knightbus. Perhaps she decides to take and raise him instantly, or gradually. But he's old enough to know what its like to be punished for something you didn't do, even if its not on the same scale as Medusa. And that's not a thing she can properly explain to a child (what happened to her, what Poseidon did, what Athena did), but explained vaguely enough and he can relate pretty well from getting punished for Dudley's doings (the roof incident is semi-parallel--he was being hurt and chased by Dudley's gang, ended up on the roof, and was punished; he was hurt, and punished for it). So they bond, and he's her kid, and screw every idiotic mortal that thinks they can hurt him. Voldemort's gonna have a (rock) hard time dealing with Medusa to get to Harry.

3.a. Post Canon, Pre Epilogue (EWE?): Harry has graduated Hogwarts (...ish...well, who's gonna tell Voldemort's vanquisher that they need 5 NEWTS?). The battle was won. So why does he feel empty? After being a soldier all his life, its so hard having nothing to fight, no battle to win, no foe to defeat, and nothing to protect. Being an auror was his dream, or an interest at least (more to see the look on the toad's face at that advisory meeting, tbh), but even if he feels empty without a war on, he can't stomach the violence anymore. And quidditch feels too vapid (half his team is dead) and he discarded thoughts about being a professor (wouldn't it be cool to teach like Remus, if he didn't have to walk the ruined halls of his childhood home and pick out missing faces in the Great Hall, child ghosts just learning to fly). So he wanders. He could be anywhere, though maybe around Greece is most fitting, when he meets the odd lady who's only out at night, or wears a hood and shades in the day. Does he meet her in the magical district, or the mugfle world? And why is he interested in her? Probably from hearing a hundred tiny snakes chattering (I won't believe he lost parsletongue and you can't make me). Maybe he can't understand it well anymore, but we know it can be taught, and there should still be words he recognizes. But he hears the snakes and tries to catch her alone so he can be like "yo lady why do you have a hat made of snakes???". Except Medusa won't take being cornered by a man very well. Still they somehow get to know each other, and after a lot of time they trust each other. They have a lot in common; they're both rather too used to not being given a choice. Basically, they become bros, and its a healing experience, and the snakebros™ take scenic motorcycle rides around Greece and make snake puns (often in parsletongue. He introduces her to the family, and they are like "are y'all....ya know...together?" But nah, they're just heterosexual life partners.

3.b. Semi continuation of 3.a. I guess---And they were roommates: So they said they were totally platonic and kinda they are but also maybe they would really like to kiss and cuddle and do things friends don't do. But they're bros, and both have like Trauma™ and Severe Emotional Issues™ so its not like they'll tell each other that. And basically the conflict here will be them getting over their bad selves to admit to their feelings. Awesome and cool things follow. I'm partial to the idea of a wedding filled with little snakes as members of the wedding party.

In the end of all of these, if the gods are still around, they'll have to be confronted (maybe they've faded, but maybe the lot of rapey-murder-hobos are still running around the vaulted chamber of the sky) and you just know Harry is gonna be in their faces (literally Harry from any of the prompts, Medusa is either his mom, his best friend, or his bestfriendwife and he'll be damned if he lets the a-holes who did this get away with it). I want a happy ending dang it, so somehow someway he's gonna cow all of them if he has to. I mean, he is the master of death in a world of greek mythology, maybe that means something more here. Anyways, thats my prompt...cause I can't find anything like it.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in. Cross-posted from FF.Net.

**** It's similar to #2. It doesn't concentrate much on the relationship between Medusa and Harry (it mostly is about Harry establishing a safe haven for demigods away from both monsters and Olympian squabbles), but Medusa adopts Harry after the Chamber of Secrets, not after Aunt Marge.

** My vote is 3b, implying 3 happened. I think with how much Medusa's tale is just the result of bad luck in romance, that having just a nice friendship would be cool for them. Romance is cool and all, but come on, who wants romance all the time. Sometimes having two people who are just best friends is amazing. Going on snakey adventures! I need a break from the shipping wars, someone please write this. Please. I'll make a shrine for you.

** Seems fairly contrived? I'm not necessarily against the idea, but a lot would have to happen to get anywhere near close to this. Like Medusa being alive at all would have to be explained since Perseus killed her, and I can't think of a reason at all for her to be in England of all places, let alone Little Whinging.

I mean a Fate Stay Night cross works better, conceptually, since Medusa is in the modern day and can appear in England in one of the routes. But mythological Medusa seems difficult.

**** Having a summoner bring her to England could work though.

1980, Summa Summonerson has just had her family massacred by Voldemort, who, for shits and giggles, did it all with Parselmagic. Summa decides she needs a snakey hero to kill Voldemort. Unfortunately, she looks right at Medusa right when she summons her and becomes a statue, stranding Medusa in 1980 London without any idea why she's there or what to do now. She survives by stealing Summa's identity and avoids statuing anybody through strategic use of hats.
