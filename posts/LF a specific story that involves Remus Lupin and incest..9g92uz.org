Yeah, weird fucking title right? I'm looking for a specific story, and I've been racking my brain for days trying to figure out what it was. All I can remember about it was that I think it might've been a one shot, and it involved Remus Lupin either being a PI or owning a bar, and running into Harry and his OC sister, who he figured out were in a relationship with each other. I need help finding this, cause it's itching that part of my brain that won't give up till I read it.

Edit: NVM, found it, it was Remus Lupin and the Restaurant that Attracts Annoying Customers.
