She raises harry with james. Harry is cunning and devious and lily s strong and dumbledore is afraid oh her. Harry wants a cerberus as a pet


** No Cerberus, but otherwise it fits: Cunning Harry, raised by Lily mostly, with James working, and Dumbledore is, at least later, afraid of her.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16
