And if one of the people making it were to die, would it still be valid? For instance, if I were made to make the vow to not reveal a particular secret with my sister but years later when she drops dead, would it still be valid? Can the secret be now shared?


** I don't think this is spelled out. I could see it working two ways: Magic is set at the time of casting and is permanent. OR It is constantly maintained through a small amount of magic drain from each party (and the binder?) and is weakened or annulled on each persons death.

Your world your rules.

** I agree it's not spelled out, but I think the answer lies in the wording. Are you swearing to take it to your grave? No, you cannot now tell it. Do you swear to keep it so long as you both live? I would say yes as only one of you is still living.

** If I were writing about unbreakable vows I think I'd make it so that the characters themselves are also quite sketchy on the details. Realistically even if you personally know someone who has made an unbreakable vow, and they later died, you can't know for certain what actually caused them to die and whether it was even related to the vow or not. That's what makes them risky, because it's not super understood how or why they work, only that they supposedly do.

*** I like your way of thinking. I read a story once where they needed to get a potion ingredients from a freshly slain basilisk and something that was brought up was that after the eyes of it were removed, carefully as they couldn't do so while looking at them they placed them in a bag. Someone asked if the eyes would kill while the basilisk was dead and they weren't connected to it anymore and the response was no one knows, do you want to find out?
