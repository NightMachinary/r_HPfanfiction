What if the cauldron of Voldemort's resurrection ritual wasn't thick enough for the potion?

And what was Percy going to do with this news?

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

*** That was amazing. Got some mr. black vibes from the parts about the goblins, and that's one of my favorite stories.

** I'm not much of a writer, but a kind of cracky idea popped into my head. Voldemort's resurrection in the graveyard isn't completed correctly because Peter cheaps out on the cauldron used and it cracks during the ceremony. Could be just a silly one shot where Harry tells Peter he would have known the importance of cauldron thickness if he had still been Percy's pet.

Peter is in hysterics not only because of the failed resurrection, but also the stump where his hand used to be is rapidly bleeding out. Voldemort's temporary body was destroyed and he flees in spirit form. Harry grabs Cedric, a now fainted Wormtail, and portkeys away using the cup. Sirius can be cleared and Dumbledore has a bit more time to get ready for Voldemort.

Voldemort uses one of his Horcruxes to bring himself back, preferably the ring so that Dumbledore doesn't fall for it's trap and put it on. Not sure where you would go from there though. Any ideas?

** Have not seen that done.

Does remind me of a scene in which Mundungus reflects on his failures as a guard and notes that:

  Well, I thought it was a sweet deal, anyway. It turns out the cauldrons are flawed, all of them have dangerously thin castings around the lower seals (they got past customs due to a loophole in the law about the quality of imported cauldrons). A muggle wouldn't even use one of them for a cooking pot! I'll probably have to sell them for scrap at a major loss.

  Somebody at the Ministry really should pay attention to details like the thickness of cauldron bottoms. I mean, those things could be dangerous!

(The fic as a whole is very dark and angsty, don't let these paragraphs mislead you on that, but it is very well executed.)
