Are there any stories out there where due to how he was raised, either by the Dursley's or by someone else finding him, Harry just doesn't take anything from anyone?

A coldblooded, opinionated, possibly trained, Harry that stands up for himself and doesn't let anyone push him around or talk down to him. A Harry that when attacked, goes for the kill instead of trying to avoid the situation?

For example he leaves the Dursley home, running away or CPS takes him away, and is found by someone who lives in a very black and white kill or be killed type of world and instills that viewpoint into Harry so that Harry doesnt take aggression from anyone without making them back off in fear


** The Denarian series probably embodies this best; Harry is a self-described psychopath (although Dumbledore keeps pointing out he's not) who genuinely doesn't care about anyone but himself, and is eventually hired by the Order for the missions that the rest of them simply don't have the balls to do, i.e. assassinations. Harry is rude, cruel and tends to answer violence with fiendfyre.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is the first fic in the series. No knowledge of Dresden Files needed to understand what's going on.
