  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Anyone have anything good that hasn't been recommended to death? I just spent yesterday scouring AO3 and there's so much crap out there. I just finished reading linkao3(All According to Plan), which will probably be inwardtransience's only completed HP work. Tsume Yuki is ever popular with her fem!Harry stuff, only wish it wasn't all so similar. I like her works, just can't stomach reading them after slogging through so much bad romance.

Also, there's a special place in hell for whoever decided to merge the "female Harry Potter - character" tag with "Harry Potter" instead of "female Harry Potter", making searching for fics tagged that way unsearchable. Like Mary Potter for instance. Also a special place in hell for those who can't tag properly; just because James and Lily are married doesn't mean that it's relevant enough to be in a story, likewise even if McGonagall is a professor doesn't mean she has to be tagged.

But to make this slightly more relevant, linkao3(On Dead Wings by Tsume Yuki; Gryffindor's Girl by BexSilverthorne; Time Travel? Really! by animeotaku20; Hart's Legacy by yayanaptime; Holly Potter and the Witching World by D_M_Nealey; The Fire that Swallowed the World by RowlettLesbian; Parselbrat by Ziel). I haven't finished reading all of these, but at least they aren't atrocious so far, and some are quite good.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

**** Ah, I just forgot the Yuleball Panic series by Philosophise or something along those lines. I haven't finished it, but it was pretty good. Only reason I'm hesitating to continue reading it is because right now I hardly want to see hide nor hair of Hermione, since AO3 is full of thinly veiled self-insert as Hermione trash that makes her the next Merlin, and I can't stand her for now. There's a reason why "BAMF Hermione" is a tag I'm excluding.

*** I've always loved this one... the funny thing is, I seem to like it for different reasons to everyone else.

People always talk about the stuff set in the past with Merlin. But I've always felt that the Merlin arc was a bit "generic fantasy"... I think it would have been done better if the author had tried to take a more grounded approach to the myth, fleshing out post-Roman Britain in a historically accurate (but fantastical) way. As it is, it feels a bit like a low budget BBC production. I also felt like the magic was a bit generic compared to the richness of canonical magic.

What I love about this fic is the stuff set in the modern day, or close to the modern day. I just love exploring Jasmine the character - in one scene, showing so much poise and elegance, in the next playfulness. A truly feminine fem!Harry, but showing all the /strength/ of femininity rather the direction of weakness that many angsty fics take. The best chapter in the story is, I think, the one where Dumbledore goes looking for her.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
