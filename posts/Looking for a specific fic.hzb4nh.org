:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a great fic on ffn years ago that I'd love to find again. Harry gets sent to an alternate dimension where his parents live and he has a younger sister. His sister (and maybe his parents and the marauders, but I'm not sure) find out he's from another dimension and not the Harry she knows. They end up going to beauxbatons to perform the ritual to send him back to his world. Harry sees Fleur at the school as well. His sister ends up coming back with him to his original dimension. Anyway, that's all I remember, if anyone knows which fic this is I'd be ridiculously grateful.
