Apparently the law against enchanting muggle objects specifies that you cannot enchant them to do things other than what muggles originally intended the object for (eg. enchanting a car to fly) if you're intending to actually use that alternate function (which is how Arthur got around that law, according to the wiki, intending only to tinker and not to actually use his flying car).

So, aside from that meaning St Mungos, The Ministry Building and its entrances, the floo network, and possibly even the Knight Bus are all in violation (the muggle department store building not being intended to house several-more-floors-than-it-really-has of magical hospital, toilets and phonebooths not being intended for door-access, fireplaces for transport, etc), it also prevents a lot of possibilities of magical enchantments on muggle vehicles for more esoteric and interesting uses. Because even if you make it, you're technically not supposed to use it.

In that line of thought, how would someone make a purely magical tank or other vehicle? ie. No Muggle Manufacture involved whatsoever, it can only be made using magical enchantments and magical production and manufacturing. BTW, I'm using tank as an example because it's a relatively complex thing that needs to do a lot of different things in a lot of different places, but any other vehicle you want would be fine and interesting too. :)

If you have any fics with interesting magical vehicles, then please feel free to link!

All relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** Bear in mind that the law imposed by the Ministry is, like in most muggle governments, meant to restrict the non-governmental, unapproved people from enchanting muggle objects (or anything else for that matter).

Its not about stopping everything all together, its about regulating and controlling risks to the Ministry's overall objective: enforcement of the Statute of Secrecy in the UK. Just as laws that control how prescription drugs are administered are not meant to discourage drug use but to prevent abuse or overindulgences that present a possibility of de-stabilizing civil society.

As for your specific question, let us ask another question: why would you need one? Tanks are by design a method to protect people in open terrain from anti-infantry weapons such as firearms and low-impact explosives. They were implemented by the UK in WW I to safely cross the No Man's Land without suffering enormous casualties. People, muggle or wizard, create or invent things to fill a need, not just because they can. And a tank serves no purpose more effectively than what is already feasible for wizards and their society.

Or to put it more simply, inventions serve a need in society. Wizards adapt muggle ideas because they serve specific needs (wireless for entertainment, magic train for comfortable travel experience/vacations/less able wizards, etc.).

*** Why would Arthur need a flying car he doesn't intend to use? Sometimes people also invent things for entertainment.

It's a thought experiment, essentially. It might be pointless practically-speaking (and I completely agree it would be, except perhaps if it were designed to protect from large-scale spellfire), but it's interesting to consider how various things fit together to possibly create something interesting. I'm curious about the how, not the why.

eg. Would they invent a hamster-wheel-esque contraption so that animated constructs could drive a motor and thus move wheels without effort on the part of the wizard? Especially for heavy stuff that might be difficult to levitate or shrink or whatever?

It's the kind of thing I find interesting to consider. :)

** To answer your question (even if just a thought experiment):

Imagine first taking a general cart of some kind, even like one of the thestral drawn carriages.

Next, you would imbue all of the outsides with Runes/enchantments that would prevent spell damage/impact damage. Which specifically would be up to you/what is available within the world you build (I am assuming this is for a fic you might be writing).

After you have a carriage that is basically the body of the tank, you would craft what would amount to a gigantic wand, perhaps only capable of channeling a single spell, likely Bombarda or Reducto. From there you mount it atop the carriage with a simple rotating swivel platform that could be gotten from anywhere (like turning a wheel on its side).

Next is propulsion. Given that they have brooms with charms to handle propulsion and steering built in by use of touch controls through a single wooden shaft, you could install something similar.

And voila ... you would have what amounts to effectively a purely magic tank.

*** Nope, not for a fic. It's literally just something I was curious about and wanted to see what input people had. I barely have time to write the fics I have already, nevermind new ones for a fandom this... exacting.

I don't know if runes or enchantments to prevent spell damage are a thing (genuine question - are they?), but I suppose lining it with basilisk skin could achieve the same end. Those are canonically resistant to spells, right?

I like the idea of the giant wand. That's pretty cool. I could see that sort of thing being developed as a kind of artillery-of-magic (to answer Xesh's point about inventions being invented to meet a need :D).

** I would put little magical wheels under the castle and magical canons on the sides then run over Britain with it.

*** I know you're probably kidding, but I've said before that I really like the idea of a Magical Mortal Engines fic. :D
