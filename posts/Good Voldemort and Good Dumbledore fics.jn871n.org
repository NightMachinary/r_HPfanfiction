Are there fanfics where both Voldermort and Dumbledore are shown as good guys? Just not in the path they show, and all. Harry can be on the full Light-Gray-Dark spectrum.

Also, what's the difference between Request and Recommendation flair?


** No suggestions for you, but Requests are when you want suggestions from other people and Recommendations are for when you want to suggest a fic to others
