I know a lot of people hate Draco Malfoy, with the movies glorifying him yadda yadda yadda.

The question is, how would you go about redeeming him in a way that it's still Draco and not an OC wearing Draco's skin that it stripped from Draco's slur-spewing corpse.


** I think HBP from Draco's POV would be extremely sympathetic. In my opinion, Draco's HBP character arc is more interesting than Harry's.

Draco gets everything he ever wanted- power, a place at the Dark Lord's side, entrance into a secret club, an opportunity to redeem the family name and save his mother and father.

At the price of everything he cares about and loves.

Kill the Headmaster or I'll torture and murder your entire family instantly makes you pretty sympathetic.

And if Draco's tormented by internal doubt and compromised morals (accompanied by an intellectual problem that stretches him to his physical/mental limits)- that seems like the definition of the human heart in conflict.

I would read /the shit/ out of that.

His rock bottom would be failing to kill Dumbledore, and losing /everything/ the beginning of his redemption would be not positively identifying Harry at threat to his entire family.

*** By far, the best part of HBP is how successful it was in reframing Malfoy from a one-note bully, a Hogwarts equivalent of Dursley, into a tragic character. I liked how Draco's choice is so difficult /because/ his parents are alive and committed to one side, especially when juxtaposed against Harry, someone who finds himself unambiguously on good side because of how his parents died.

Still, doesn't make up for introduction of horcruxes.

EDIT: I should probably mention that the reason I find the incidents with Ron and Katie to be not as relevant as they probably should be is because I find them to be very weak points in the book. Draco's character would be so much better if they didn't happen at all, and considering complete lack of consequences for the story, the book would have been better without them as well.

**** Yes! Exactly! Harry is extremely morally unambiguous, and when you're not a kid anymore- that gets boring.

Draco has a lot of moral ambiguity that makes him /fascinating/ on reread.

***** It's very telling how invested I was in occupying Harry's mind during my first read of the HBP, because I remember thinking of Draco as whiny during their confrontation. It was only after I came back to it that I noticed this being one of the few moments in the entire series where we are actually encouraged to consider what's going on from a perspective different than Harry's.

i think allot of people forget/ignore we see everything through harrys POV, harry decided he hated draco pretty much immediately so his view is very biased and untrustworthy, they also barely interacted so there was never really a chance to get a good look at draco

**** Very true. There's no doubt Draco has a multitude of faults, but that makes him quite interesting IMO. I would prefer we got more character building out of him, and a deeper look at more characters in general. But building a solid narrative around his sixth year, in a realistic, but also sympathetic way seem quite possible.

He's a kid put in a life or death situation, the weight of the world on his shoulders, of course he's tearing himself apart at the seams and taking anger out on others- it's what nearly /everyone/ would do! The fact that he nearly succeeded, is incredible, and shows a great strength of character we don't really see in him otherwise.

** I think the best start would be at the World cup. During the attack, he gets separated from his parents and ends up witnessing the death eaters torturing the muggle family. He sees their child screaming her lungs out, bleeding, terror and pain clear in her eyes while the parents can do nothing but helplessly watch till the child stops screaming.

Draco makes some noise and gets attacked right away, just managing to escape with a bloody back and leg. He finally finds his parents only to look at those same eyes the parents from before had and begins to think as he sits on his bed back in the manor.

"Why? Why did they do that? How could they? She- she was just a girl. Just a child no more than 7, so how-. How could they just /kill, torture/ an innocent child? But, they didn't care. They didn't care for her screams, didn't care for her fear, for her pain or that of her parents. They didn't care they took a life. Didn't care if it was a muggle, half blood or pure blood. They didn't care. All they wanted to do was destroy and kill and cause pain and terror.

Was... Was his father involved in this? Did he do such unspeakable things in the last war? Did he care that he was hurting other people? Damaging them beyond repair?"

Draco spends weeks, month on these thoughts till school begins again, till he has to face all those people HE hurt before with his behaviour and he is barely able to meet anyone's eyes.

One day(before Halloween) he has another nightmare. He leaves the dungeons and sprints for the lake to gets some fresh air, to dump his head into the water, to just try SOMETHING to silence those horrible screams in his head that just won't leave him alone.

And then there is Ron behind him, pulling him out since he didn't register he had been too long without air, too deep in his thoughts. They stare at each other. Neither saying something as Ron watched tears streaming down Draco's cheeks.

Ron sits down beside him and waits patiently. Neither taunting nor judging him. And the dam breaks and Draco tells him everything that happened and went through his head.

Rest is up to you.

*** I completely forgot about the World Cup when I was thinking about this - that's a great place to start I think!

I am curious though - what made you choose Ron as the person to come across/save him?

*** Oooh! I really love the idea of Draco first experiencing doubts at the World Cup, it's perfect foreshadowing.

He would see how utterly /pathetic/ and /useless/ hurting a muggle child is. What exactly are they proving? /That they're better, stronger, more powerful than muggle children?/ What a /revelation/.

It accomplishes nothing (from Draco's perspective) other than proving what they already know.

It would be like stepping on a baby mouse, you can, but what's the point? It doesn't make you a big badass human.

** Possibly great loss. Draco has never struck me as a good character, or selfless, which is why I personally prefer he is irrelevant or dead in the stories I read, or at the very least acting canonically like a douche and idiot bully.

​

However, I think it is potentially plausible that after the death of Snape, or maybe even Crabbe, Draco decides he doesn't want to be on the side of the man who essentially had them killed. If you want to write him like this during their time in Hogwarts, it could be down to his father's imprisonment, and the fact that Voldemort doesn't care. He could play a Snape-esque role, except using info he gets from other classmates in Slytherin.

​

That's the only reason I see Draco ever leaving the side of the Death Eaters. He doesn't have enough morals to care about the Muggleborn Holocaust, and will only care if it affects him and those he treasures.

** the most important thing in my mind, and some might disagree, is that Malfoy first needs to be punished for his actions. And I am not talking about just 'oh he suffered consequences for his choices'. No, he broke the law and should be punished by the law.

Redemption can not be sought before one has paid for their crimes. If they just walk away freely, it is not redemption, it is society forgiving them for everything and those two are VERY different things.

Only after Malfoy has been punished rightfully for his crimes and evil actions, can redemption be sought and earned.\\
And that is another thing. Redemption MUST be earned. No one can just be redeemed without effort. An easy redemption is meaningless and can easily be undone again, as the 'redeemed' has learned nothing.\\
Malfoy must stand and face the world that hates him for his many crimes and evil actions. He must struggle and work hard, through strife and pain, to earn his redemption.

** I talked for way longer than I intended, so tl;dr at bottom.

I think one of the biggest parts of redemption is that it's a process. Even if the character has a come-to-god moment where they realize a lot of what they believe is bs, they still need to examine their beliefs and /start/ to work on correcting their behavior/way of thinking. There's no believable way Draco wakes up one day and all of a sudden treats everyone equally regardless of blood status. This can /seem/ to happen from an outside perspective, but that would have to involve a period of time where your characters don't see each other. For example, Hermione runs into Draco again X years later and finds that he no longer treats her with disdain and has changed his beliefs about blood purity. To her, the change is sudden because the last impression she had of him is vastly different and she didn't see any of the gradual changes.

However, I would generally recommend against taking this approach, as it can be difficult to make the redemption seem as genuine. There is absolutely potential to pull it off, but it won't be easy. I think it's easier to write a believable redemption arc when you are traveling along the arc with the character, not hearing about their journey after it happened.

I personally think Draco is well set up to have a redemption arc - others may disagree. It has been a while since I've actually read through the books, so I don't have a very clear recall of how we see his behavior change throughout the years, but I think HBP and DH set him up as a victim in this. THIS IS NOT TO SAY HIS BEHAVIOR IS EXCUSABLE. He behaved like a prick and that's something that I think needs to be addressed for a redemption arc. However, we also know for a fact there are external forces at play that influence his behavior.

Most obviously, Draco was raised to believe he was better than others because of his blood. We don't know how aggressively or forcefully this was drilled into him, but we do know that he was raised with those beliefs. In addition to this, Voldemort being resurrected at the end of GoF certainly has an effect on the Malfoys. We see right away in the graveyard that Voldemort is displeased with how his followers behaved after his “defeat” at the hands of baby Harry. Lucius (I'm pretty sure) claimed he was under the Imperius curse (point against him for disloyalty) and gave away the notebook in CoS, which ended up getting it destroyed (another point against him), so our old pal Voldy is none too pleased with him. This then results in Draco's assigned task in HBP, with the threat of harming his family(or just his mum?) against him if he fails. So, even if Draco is still /fully/ on board with the ideology, attempting to kill Dumbledore is a task forced on him, and one that Dumbledore, at least, thinks he did not want (and I agree). Even taking the mark was almost certainly driven in part by Voldemort's threatening presence in his life. I'm not saying it was entirely against his will, but I am saying that he didn't really have a choice to refuse.

So, there we have the framework Draco was working with. Again, this does not excuse his actions. He still was arrogant, entitled, and a bully, and he still did go along with Voldy's plans (I really don't see how someone with his upbringing /wouldn't/ given the circumstances, but that's neither here nor there). He is a very flawed character who has done bad things, and those cannot all be waved away as him being a product of his upbringing, but I do think it is important to remember and to not consider his actions in a vacuum.

Now, as to how we go about redeeming him. I believe he /has/ to be questioning his beliefs and the side he's on by the final battle for him to be redeemable. If he's true to blood purity and/or Voldemort to the end, I don't see how you can move on from there. When and why he starts rethinking things could be for a number of reasons - it's important to have a why, but I don't think it's important for it to be one certain thing in order for him to be redeemable (as in I don't think it has to be because of X reason and any other reason isn't good enough). I think it's best if he's unsure by the time he takes the mark at the latest, but you might be able to work with it being later.

He's probably not going to have much freedom to explore his doubts until the war is over, especially if Voldemort is already back by the time he decides to examine his beliefs. Once he does though, I think he's going to have to realize he needs to atone for his wrongdoings as a part of that. You don't need to make him entirely self loathing, but he needs to be willing to accept punishment for what he's done. Maybe he still tries to get himself a lighter sentence, but that probably needs to come more from a place of self-preservation rather than an idea that he deserves forgiveness where others don't. If he does get a lighter sentence (whether right away or it gets adjusted after the fact), I think you need to have someone “good” having fought for it. Make sure he doesn't get off too light though, or it may make your criteria for redemption appear too soft. You will likely wind up with the feeling that he escaped true justice and didn't properly atone, or that his supposed reform isn't entirely sincere.

I think you could go a multitude of places with what his life looks like post-Hogwarts. You could include some kind of a “community service” kind of aspect of him reestablishing himself, Malfoy funds being largely given for reparations, or about anything else you might think works. The important parts through this are that he is truly repentant, he has to work at convincing others he is changed, and that he's not perfect at it. If nothing else, he has a severe taught bias against those with “impure” blood that he's not going to be able to magically switch off. He'll have to work at identifying his flawed thinking and replacing it, and if he's stressed or upset, he will probably slide back towards his prejudiced and entitled tendencies. He will probably need help from others to identify what he needs to fix as well. Some things are more obvious (muggleborns aren't inferior to pure bloods), but others won't stick out to him as something that needs changing.

I've rambled on for way too long by now, so I guess *tl;dr: Redemption is a journey, you can't flip a switch on behaviors and prejudices, and Draco's background doesn't excuse his actions, but is important to keep in mind*

** Personally, I have no talent for writing, so fairly certain no one would want to suffer through my struggle to tell a compelling story.

What I can do it think of ideas the seem fun.

We look at Draco as is and see a bigoted, racist brat who feels entitled to everything. How does this change? Something... or someone would need to get him started.

If you've never heard of Daryl Davis, I recommend looking him up. He is an African American man that has convinced 200 kkk members to give up their robes.

Often times hate comes from ignorance and fear of the unknown. My understanding is that the slytherin house was made up of mostly pure bloods. Since slytherin was encouraged through tradition to keep to their house, Draco did not really have close access to a lot of muggle borns. I know that there were a good number of them at the school, but they were not in his social circles. What slytherin would be caught socializing with a hufflepuff?

This prejudice was taught and his access was limited.

I think to get a good redemption that doesn't hand-wave away the canon character, we need the wizarding world's Daryl Davis who goes out of their way to befriend people raised to hate him. Who shows through actions that Draco's prejudices are wrong and he's not so different from muggleborn wizards.

** 1. I think there is a huge difference between pre-HBP Draco and post-HBP one. After two attempted murders (Katie Bell and Ron), it is hard to get him really positive spin. So, when somebody asked about cross-star lovers, I could imagine working Dramione only before that.

2. Honest redemption post-HBP should probably mean going to a jail. True redemption and conversion towards The Right could mean that you plead guilty and server your sentence.

** you have to work with character growth, which can sometimes look like a character being ooc. however you have to remember we only see malfoy from Harry's pov. the only time we see otherwise is in CoS with the polyjuice, and that is him as a 12 year old. most people are far more mature at 16 than 12, especially someone goibg through the traumatic experience of living with voldemort
