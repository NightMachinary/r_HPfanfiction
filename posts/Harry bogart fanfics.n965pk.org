Does anyone know any good fics where Harry's boggart is not a dementor but maybe his relatives or Ron and Hermione leave him/are dead? I feel like that could be a good plot to read!


** I know you meant Boggart, but the misspelling in the title now kinda makes me wanna see a Casablanca redo with Harry Potter. :D

** There're two fics that I know of that don't have a Dementor boggart, but they also don't have your examples either.

/The Boggart/ by hypotemoose :: linkffn(3894532); Harry's boggart is him not being himself.

/Riddle in the Dark/ by LeeASherlook :: linkffn(13372427); Harry's boggart is Tom Riddle.

  ONE SHOT. Fifth year. Harry arrives late to potions class and Snape confronts him with a boggart. Why is Harry so reluctant to face it if his greatest fear is Dementors?

  Revisiting the concept of boggarts in Snape's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Harry was wholly prepared to face the faux dementor. But what stepped out of that darkened space was something else entirely. A handsome boy with a gleaming prefect's badge and a cruel smile.
