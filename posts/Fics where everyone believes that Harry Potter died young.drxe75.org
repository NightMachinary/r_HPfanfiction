Looking for fics where Harry is believed to have died as a baby/young child. But then they find him years later.

- Don't want Harry to be ignorant about magic so he knows that it exists and has known all his life or before the age of 11

- Would like it James and Lily are alive alive

Will also accept dimension travel

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** There was a good one! Where they found out Harry died at 4yo.

Snape went back in time to save/raise him, and there was a very nice time loop.

Hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
