So yea, looking for stories where the MC is an OC (can be SI or not, i don't care). I'd like it to be where the OC is strong and has a noticeable effect on the plot. He/She doesn't have to be friends with The Trio, but they should have some impact. Preferably Gen fics (especially if it's an SI, yuck) but romance can be in it I guess.

I'd like if the OC wasn't bigoted, i.e. Doesn't believe all slytherins are evil. I like logical OCs, and I'd like if they were willing to get their hands dirty (i.e kill) in order to stop a war or something.

Thanks!


** Well The Anguis series is pretty much this. The OC characters aren't bigoted and it interweaves with the original series, but the characters still have a hand in taking down the Death Eaters.

The first one is oneshots, but the next three books in the series are all novels.

*** Not really looking for a full OC cast, just for the MC

**** It follows a group of four, with two of them having much more importance than the others.

** There's linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) which has a very solid set of OCs and is set in durmstrang but sadly abandoned

There's also linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix) which is a bit romancey but it's not over the top with one of the MCs being a well written OC.

Also linkffn(Word Vomit, overly Angsty, poorly written piece of garbage)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
