Is it just me, who really enjoys stories which go deep into character development - especially in angsty/almost angsty plots. But at the same time, hurts my heart whilst reading it and sometimes feel as if I can read no more?

My main thing is, I love the immersion. I get really immersed into stories I read, often binge reading entire stories in a few days (when possible). When this immersion meets a well written plot and deep character development, whilst also exploring certain topics, I get really into my feelings whilst reading. It's not a bad thing, but it makes reading further hard... sometimes parallels get drawn and it's difficult.

I love both the exploration and the feelings accompanying it, but simultaneously I hate the way it makes me feel. A true love/hate relationship I seem to be almost addicted to.

I would really like to thank the authors who take their times building these stories, I have enjoyed many over the years across multiple fandoms. However, with the way the Harry Potter is set - there is a lot of opportunity for exploration within this fandom that have produced some phenomenal stories.

This realisation comes from my recent reading of linkffn(Hope and Healing), which I am currently reading. The story has evoked some feelings whilst reading it that I have not felt for some time.

I was wondering if anyone would like to share particular stories which have made them feel like this.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly. On hiatus. Note in ch. 34

** I know what you when. It's the reason why I put off reading this Fanfiction called half-blood romantic. I knew it was a good story but it was going to be kinda upsetting to read. I have now and I can say it was both.

It's not a love-hate story tho. It's more of a story about unreciprocated love, but I'll still link it in case you want to read it.

** Yes! My absolute favorites are the character studies that really focus on the internal life of the characters. I love seeing them grow over time, and the character arcs are my absolute favorite parts of stories.

A story that like that for me is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23465653][the miseducation of hermione granger]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MaidenMotherCrone/pseuds/MaidenMotherCrone][MaidenMotherCrone]] ( linkao3(23465653) ). The character development was just wondrous to watch.

  Hermione Granger knows who she is. She is a Gryffindor. She is a Muggleborn. She is Afro-Arab. She is English. She is a Muslimah. She is a good friend. She is smart. She is an activist. She is things that she will never say out loud.Hermione Granger knows who she is. The problem: No one else does.1. Not her friends.2. Not her parents.3. Not even her. Not yet.  (this is the unlearning. the miseducation. minute by minute)
