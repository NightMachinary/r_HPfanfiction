  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** I'm not a particularly big H/Hr shipper myself, but I'm curious why you'd exclude it? Obviously you're looking for a significantly altered Harry, so the fact that they didn't have much chemistry in canon shouldn't matter.

*** H/Hr is fine in a vacuum, however it attracts some craaaazy people (remember that guy with the 10 thousand word profile extolling the virtues of H/Hr and bashing all other characters). It's not so visible now, but since the 6th book harmonians were some of the saltiest fans in all the fandoms. This resulted in a ton of stories with Weasley bashing, love potions, manipulative DD trying to keep H+Hr apart and Harry being a puppet led around by Her Intellect.

I mostly like H/Hr where they are in different houses, or are not friends from the start and date later (On The Way to Greatness was going H/Hr, I think).
