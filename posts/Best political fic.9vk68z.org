From still in school to pre-epilogue to AU, what's the best( most accurate, most thrilling, most believable, most whatever your measure is) political themed fic


** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) this is THE most complex political story you will find in Harry Potter Fanfiction. Harry is ruthless, ambitious, cunning and much more.

linkffn(Midnight Gold, The Rise Of The Forgotten Lord by InheritanceConfessor2011) I quite liked this one, it's in early Hogwarts years (second I think), Harry is striving to restore House of Potter to it's former glory.

*** My only issue with Emperor (which I loved for the better part of like 40 frickin chapters) is that it gets so drawn out with the battles. I got so bored by the time the north and south were at war. I stopped reading it because I just felt it was never going anywhere and I read some reviews which talked about how they abandoned it because some of the plot points don't make sense.

**** I love battle scenes in stories - and I tend to search mainly for those. Although you're right, some of the battles are incredibly drawn out and becomes redundant at several points. I think the author even admitted that he doesn't really have any knowledge about combat.

***** I mean don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed a lot of the battles (especially in Spain). But I was tired of them by the time we were on our like 34th battle scene that stretched for two chapters.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/democracy-harry-potter-post-hogwarts-au-complete.683269/reader][Democracy]] by Starfox5

It's a short story about Neville and Hermione becoming political rivals during the post-war period. Hermione wants to abolish the wizarding aristocracy (which she blames for the War) and make magical Britain a Republic. Neville is a conservative who is skeptical of democracy and radical change; he's no blood-purist, but he prefers to preserve traditions and thinks it's better for the aristocracy to carefully implement reforms instead of the government bow to the whims of the masses. It's told from Neville's perspective and does a good job of showing his anti-democractic stance in a sympathetic light while still making it clear that he's on the wrong side of history.

(Yes, the CGI title card is really ugly. Ignore it, the story is far better I promise.)

** I'm surprised that no one mentioned Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man. It's got really complex world building and very enjoyable politics as well as subversion of the WBWL trope. Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series is also pretty good. It follows a Slytherin!Trio (Harry, Hermione, and Ron). The first in the series is The Chessmaster: Black Pawn.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** Okay so, my favourite political fic is a Tom/Hermione time travel fic. It's a two part fic and the first doesn't really deal with politics, however it's essential for foundation.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11722608/1/Choosing-Grey][Choosing Grey by Beta Gyre]]

The second is not linear - it could be described as a series of one shots set in the same universe that are insights into Tom's political career. It's one of the most in depth and fascinating reads about Wizarding politics I've ever read, and includes interludes into international waters, their family life, and the forging of an entirely separate political party from the existing Light and Dark sides.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11911789/1/A-Marked-Deck][A Marked Deck by Beta Gyre]]

Also good to note, the author has it marked as â€˜complete' but occasionally comes back and adds one-shots to A Marked Deck.

** I really enjoy the politics in linkffn(Again and Again by Athey), though HP/LV is not everyone's cup of tea (this is probably the fic where that pairing is most believable tho, since Harry is basically immortal and keeps getting reborn in his infant body when he dies, with all the memories and magic of his previous lives).

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]]. (700k+ words, 86 chapters, no pairings)

The basic premise is that Voldemort returns sane after 4th year and claims the title of Lord Slytherin. Looking back on his actions in the previous war, he realizes that he had strayed far from his original goal of strengthening wizarding society. Thus, he abandons the idea of war and takes up his hereditary seat in the Wizengamot.
