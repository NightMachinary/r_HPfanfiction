Who knows if we'll get another [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13082443/30/The-Life-He-Leads][chapter]] after this, but it's very nice to get something. What do you guys think of it?


** Lots of grammatical errors, which is interesting to see. I guess other people's first drafts are as bad as my own in that respect, which is encouraging.

** Damn, I remember reading this story for the first time and thinking it was really well-written, but I've been re-reading it for the past few hours and the dialogue between characters is just terrible

** An excercise in mediocrity, like the rest of the story. The overarching themes are interesting and somewhat original, but the dialogue is wooden, the characters not exactly well developed and there is far too much (and far too wordy) exposition.

*** Also using italics in every other sentence to emphasize certain words gets old real quick. I get that the dude's trying to invoke emotion, but doing that so often makes it so those words completely lose their emphasis.

** Am I the only one terrified to post a review for it afraid I might fuck up this story and author with my dumb over active brain?

*** If the author lets a negative review destroy their motivation (especially 30 chapters in) then I think the story probably wasn't going to get finished anyway.

Just be constructive and it'll be fine.
