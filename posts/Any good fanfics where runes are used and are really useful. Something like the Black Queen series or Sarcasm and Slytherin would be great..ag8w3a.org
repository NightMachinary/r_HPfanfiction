** Linkffn(5087671) - Runic Animagi is cracky and doesn't have the best writing, but it's one of the very few stoner Harry fics and the only one that does it somewhat well. In which Harry fucks off during the Summer after his Godfather's demise, finding his Mothers old rune notes. He ends up finding a talent in it, going as far as creating unheard of runic scripts to do a variety of things including the titular idea of using them to become various animals.

Linkffn(5077573) - RuneMaster does a better job both in writing and story, in which Harry finds out he's a runic prodigy and does amazing things revolutionizing things like potions with them- then decides to deal with Voldemort and the deatheaters himself. It's crack but it's rather funny and an interesting story. One of my favorite HP stories and definitely contains my all time favorite Harry Potter epilogue.

Edit: Spelling/grammar.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** That story has outstandingly good and rather bad/bland aspects. The whole mentor/mother relationship with Babbling is the best I have read so far, with nothing even coming close to it. And the twists regarding Lily are nice as well. But the whole "pureblood culture" arc with Tracy and Daphne was just bad and a badly disguised attempt at justifying a harem when "we were horny, had a four-way and ended up caring for each other" would have done the trick. And Harry's interactions with Tonks and Fleur can be very "white knight-y", which is not a good thing.

**** I totally agree. Shiva's character was brilliant and their relationship was different (in a good, interesting way) from what you normally see in adoption fics.

The romantic side felt weak and heavy-handed at times, like you said, forcing a harem simply for a harem's sake. I think the biggest miss for me was 'how many' it ended up. That Harry's personality didn't jive with "harem master". If you really want to keep the "keeping the family lines separate" trope, then I think that holding it to only 2 wives would have felt more in character for that Harry.

Or have it Harry/Hermione and they fool around with Fleur/Tonks occasionally. Maybe something along the lines of couples with benefits or they share Potter Manor and, if they feel like it, the bedroom. That would have been a way better dynamic than centering everything around Harry and some pureblood bullshit.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
