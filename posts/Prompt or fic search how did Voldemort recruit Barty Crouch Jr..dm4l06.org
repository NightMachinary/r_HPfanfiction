This is a guy whose father was head of the DMLE when Riddle was on the rise. Jr. was supposed to be nearly as gifted as his father. What could Voldemort have used to seduce him into his inner circle?\\
Looking for reference fics or just inspired notions.


** Born into wealth. Born into stature. Spoilt rotten yet simultaneously left wanting. A doting mother who Barty loved very much, and a father who didn't even care that he'd been born. Suppose you could say, "Tale as old as time?" Well, almost. The fall of Bartemis Crouch Jr was mostly along those lines.

It was supposed to be a little rebellion, mess up the establishment and screw with the old man's perfect image.

Openly delving into the Dark Arts, relishing in the puce colour the mans face would turn.

Playing coy at the scene of a Muggle home, giggling behind his hands as the old crone desperately figured out ways to cover it all up.

Never letting his smile drop or his laughter falter with each strike, hex or curse he received in retaliation.

He wanted him to KNOW. Barty wanted Bartemus to KNOW he was a lost cause, and that he would forever tarnish all he stood for and all he hoped to build.

But then HE came. On a dirty street, surrounded by men and women in cloaks and masks, the cackling madman playing his games with the Muggles of choice came into contact with HIM. HE was a game changer, HE was when it stopped being a game...

The Dark Lord... he was something else. Something so SO different. The things he could do, the power he wielded and the faith... that was the real thing... the faith he had in him. He looked upon him and Barty knew (in that instant) that he held his Lord's favour. The moment those scarlet eyes raked him up and down he saw his value right then, right there.

He wasn't the son of Batemus Crouch, he was the Dark Lords. He was the Dark Lord's lieutenant in that very moment, one of the deadliest men walking. He was respected, he was revered and he was desired. Everything the Dark Lord required was everything he had cultivated in jest.

It was all supposed to be a game, a ploy to harm the man who harmed him. But maybe it could-

NO.

Then and there, there was no maybe. He had a duty, a destiny. He was REQUIRED to put his skills to use, for the betterment and advancement of his kind. To slay and spell in HIS name, and to feel proud for doing so.

There was no slow seduction to the Dark Side for the Ministry man's son, he'd acclimated himself to it years ago. But there was a moment of providence at the bloody scene he found himself at that night, a call to action that tugged at his mind far stronger than anything had prior. A voice in his head, so far removed from his own, that informed him of what it was his magic could do and who that magic should be used for.

The Dark Lord saw that in an instant, he smiled that proud and wicked smile...

...and he didn't even have to ask Barty Crouch to kneel.

*** Honestly I thought Barty Crouch Jr was rebellious enough which led him to Voldy but I did wonder how he was convinced and this is pretty much perfect. You should like post a one shot on Ao3

** A father figure who is impressed with him and proud of him. Also a path to success and greatness where people won't assume he got in just because of who his daddy is.

*** I can see someone like Lucius Malfoy (or perhaps his dad Abraxas) acting as patron and father-figure to the kid, but the criminal monster he's heard about at home for the last ten years?

Also, if I recall the pensieve scene, Barty Jr. was nervous and twitchy and altogether not as scary as the Lestranges he was running with.

**** Also maybe his dad drove him to the Dark side because Barty wanted to rebel. But he was in way way over his head, must have assumed daddy won't lock him up too. Really, he's fascinating, he's so talented and brilliant and EVIL and so childish.

**** Don't think Lucius is old enough, but then maybe Lucius got Barty to attend a meeting and Voldy did the rest of the manipulation?
