I'm looking for stories that diverged in one of three points: when Credence dies (so that he either escapes or goes into custody of MCUSA, Grindelwald, or Newt/Tina), when the Muggles are obliviated (so the secret of magic is exposed), or when Grindlewald was caught, meaning he escapes unhindered.

If you could find a story with any one of these plot points, and direct them to me, I would greatly appreciate it. If you could find a combination, even better.

If you could find one of these where Jacob also goes un-obliviated, that would be absolute perfection.

Apparently you missed the bit at the end where Newt looks up and sees a bit of surviving Obscurus slithering out of the subway.

**** I mean, as a person, you know? He's just a floating ball of evil energy now, right?

***** Well... he always kinda became a ball of evil energy when transforming into the Obscurus form. So why shouldn't he be able to transform back into a person?

****** Huh, I didn't think about that. That one shot where he's in his cloud and he's getting holes blown through him made me figure that he must be dead, and then the obscuros floats away and I said to myself "oh, so that's just an evil ball of energy now, and credence died"

And now that I'm typing that out I just remembered when Newt said "Obscuros can't survive outside their hosts". Credence is alive, then. I wonder how this is going to pan out.
