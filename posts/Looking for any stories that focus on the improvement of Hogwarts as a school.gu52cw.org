#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape is confronted by the Lone Traveler on the Eve of his ascention to Slytherin Head of House. The visiting Harry teaches him to change the course of Slytherin and all of the Magical world. All he has to do is get them to open their eyes. The major portion is almost exclusively in the viewpoint of Severus Snape. Now with Lucius Malfoy thrown in.

** This might not be your cup of tea because of the strange combination of tropes, including mpreg, triads, multiple titles, blood adoptions, goblin contracts, different sortings, and bashing of Dumbledore, Molly, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Lily, and Tonks(!). Hadrian alert.

But, it does have many efforts to improve the school: getting rid of bad teachers, bringing back cancelled classes, upgrading the wards, etc.
