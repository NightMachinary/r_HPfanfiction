Usually, non-magic AUs are not my thing (apart from the occasional fluffy romance), but recently I've been really into crossovers where Harry has no magic.

My requests: - well-written (or at least written well enough to enjoy) - Harry-centric (can be told through another POV though) - at least 10k words (longer is preferred)

Thanks!

Oscillate Wildly isn't truly a non-magic AU, but it's a fascinating read. HP/DM, adult themes.

Sorry I'm late to the party!

*** Yes, this is a great fic. I love how the reader can never be certain which world is 'reality'.

** If you don't mind slash (DM/HP), then I have to highly recommend [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3727][Draco's Boy]] by empathic siren.

*** I love this one, but seem to remember it being extremely sad? Idk, it's been a while. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1608067/1/Life-As-Experienced-Through-Your-Fingers][Life, As Experienced Through Your Fingers]] is pretty good. Though it will be up to you if it's well-written. It's another DM/HP with a few good side pairings if I remember correctly.

**** It wasn't sad per se, but heartbreaking in a lot of places. I got a bit weepy reading it.

*Life, As Experienced Through Your Fingers* is another excellent suggestion. In fact, I just recommended that fic in another thread (Artist!Harry fic recs).

** Can't believe no one has suggested Almost a Squib. Hands down one of /the/ best Squib!Harry fics out there - and an amazing fic, regardless, even if squib!Harry isn't your thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][*Almost a Squib*]] - /What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a/ *nonpowerful, but cunning,* /Harry./

*** This is not quite what I was asking for, but, yeah, this is a pretty good fic.
