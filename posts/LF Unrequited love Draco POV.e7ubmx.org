:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I'm looking for a Drarry fanfic for a friend, I'd be grateful if you could help me. I really want to help this person find this fic.

The story is told from Draco's perspective, he's melancholic and hurting in the fic for Harry.

Things I'm sure of:

It was published during the DH release. It has the Sectumsempra scene in it, and Draco felt happy about dying there (there's a whole chapter named “Sectumsempra” in the fic).

Harry saving Draco from Fiendfyre in RoR, and Draco watching Harry dating Ginny. Harry misunderstands a lot of Draco's actions in this fic, eg: after RoR Draco feels bad not for losing his friend in the fire, but for the interaction with Harry. Harry gets mad and leaves. Draco is interrupted and shoved aside in the fic, basically his relationship does not diverge much from Canon with Harry.

Harry and Draco get closer in the later chapters or he becomes aware of Draco's attraction but by that point, he's with Ginny. There's a lot of Deathly Hollows parts in it.

Things I'm not sure of and could be a different fic:

- Draco ending up with Harry & Co in the tent in DH, seeing Harry worry about Ginny or something similar.

- Draco might've been a Veela..? But that's an unlikely possibility.

Thank you very much in advance.
