Most of the time when I read fanfics where Harry gets hold of extremely old books or gets tutored by ancients ghosts/portraits, I think of how little sense it makes that magic would get less advanced over the years.

Realistically doing this, would be like preparing for science class by studying the works of Aristotle and Newton instead of modern books.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] has this, though the main character is Tom Riddle. One of my favorite lines is "Slytherin was skilled but if he was a thousand years ahead of his time we should all have cause for embarrassment." Tom also almost blows up his own arm when using ancient magic. I personally abhor the idea that "ancient magickzals" are more powerful as well. Seriously, if they were so good, who the hell would forget them?

*** Personally, I always figured that there might have been something forgotten to time that they indeed did better back then, or at least different, but on the whole, things from that time is appropriately vastly out of date. For example, there might have been an arcane form of movement (say, mirrors for example) that completely ignores more modern wards (a la Vanishing Cabinet) that people could abuse to travel past protections, but stopped being used for a reason. Maybe it was more risky, such as people getting stuck inside, people not coming out of the other side whole due to the mirror being broken -- which could also explain the "origins" of the "7 years of bad luck" saying -- or similar.

Another example would be something like a cure to Lycanthropy. Maybe back when the original curse was brand new, it was more rampant and a cure was eventually found, but it was forgotten to time with most werewolves in actual society disappearing (leaving only the "feral" ones that travel in packs). This doesn't imply that the people back then did it better, but that they might have had things we no longer have.

I like the approach of older magic being more wild, less controlled - capable of being more powerful in some situations, but also just more dangerous to the user. Like your example of Tom almost blowing up his own arm - if that came from a potent spell that could outdo modern ones in its intended use when it works, but 1/4 times it'd backfire horrifically, wouldn't it make sense for society to move away from it - even to a 'weaker' spell?

**** Just gonna mention here that humanity as a whole was more avanced in 300BC than in 1000AD. Science and technology doesn't follow this trend either, knowledge isn't a static thing, it can be lost and forgotten.

I mean, the Dark Age was called that for a reason. As was The Enlightenment. Humanity as a whole hasn't been doing the whole "science" thing very consistently at all.

For Wizards, this is an even bigger problem. Spells you invent, especially in the bloody past, you'd like to keep secret, because you are very much safer if nobody can counter them or use them against you or the ones you love. Magical research is dangerous, and requires strict isolation and secrecy, because any new discovery could be something more horrible than you could imagine. So the lone tower in the mountains or the underground bunker filled with labs would be commonplace in a society that doesn't want to accidentally spread memetic viruses, or evil creatures, or anything of that sort. All that of course leads to more secrecy. Technology you can sell, knowledge not so much. And if you can't make money off it, there's no incentive to release it to the public for most people.

And this does tie in with the idea of Harry finding ancient magic texts from a more advanced age, because basically you (and the Enlightenment scholars) are buying into the old Hermetic idea that history has been a process of corruption and loss from an earlier state of greater advancement and purer knowledge, and that the older a text the more advanced and accurate it should be. This is a /religious/ belief, not a scientific or historically informed one.

** Fantasy really likes the trope of ancient and forgotten super-powerful knowledge.

This actually makes sense:

Consider a very powerful hi-tech person (like, even Emperor Palpatine). Much of their power stems from their control and use of technology. Technology requires a very large, well-educated workforce to build and maintain. Thus, the knowledge is hard to lose without a catastrophic collapse of civilization, and even a rather chaotic evil Dark Lord has an incentive to keep such a workforce and knowledge-base going, for their own benefit.

On the other hand, by its nature, standardish fantasy magic, like that of Harry Potter, allows a single moderately skilled practitioner to live entirely by themselves, with little need for others. Canonically, the only things a wizard with sufficient knowledge can't just Transfigure or Charm into existence are various magical substances (like the materials for a wand), certain substances (like gold) and some items (like food).

Even then, a wizard with rudimentary farming knowledge could enchant equipment to maintain some fields. and grow and prepare food that way.

As such, wizards have little to gain from others having knowledge - the most a wizard might want another to know would be skills that they don't want to be bother to use (like hunting down unicorns to take some tail hair).

In fact, the incentive is quite the opposite - the more knowledge other wizards have, the greater potential threats they are, and unlike in a technological society, where the tradeoffs are worthwhile, for the wizards, they really aren't.

Thus, knowledge is hoarded, and only given to those one truly trusts and cares for - one's family and perhaps most trusted friends.

Thus, new discoveries are hoarded and even if the results are publicly sold, the secrets of using them are jealously guarded.

Furthermore, it is entirely possible that sufficiently paranoid wizarding lines might pass on the family secrets only from parent to child, when the child is old enough to not share them... and then all it takes is a tragic early death for something to be lost forever.

Even if some hidden caches of documents are created, if their location is lost, or the location destroyed or rendered inaccessible...

Thus, magical societies hemorrhage knowledge at a rate proportional to their paranoia and incidence of sufficiently early deaths. The apparent low birth rate worsens this (as it takes fewer unexpected deaths to kill everyone who knows).

This applies even if the magic is very sciencey, even more so if there is so little rhyme and reason as to make discovering anything, much less anything useful, in large part sheer luck.

** I think it's caused by the fantasy trope of the ancient empire filled with magic and riches beyond imagining. Seems like every fantasy series has this old wiped out empire or society that was filled with such awesome magic that everyone lives in it's shadow centuries later.

It's as if most fantasy takes places in that world's dark ages. Mix in the hero worship of Merlin and the Hogwarts founders and bam! Old magic MUST be better! Even though that makes no sense in a society that hasn't had some form of complete collapse.

**** What is so special about the Room of Requirement and the Sorting Hat?

The Room seems to be a combination of expansion charms and vanishing/conjuring spells, all of it is still taught at Hogwarts.

And the Sorting Hat seems to be just an animated Hat with a few enchantments.

Stuff like Dumbledores Deluminator seems way more impressive.

However, I do think you are oversimplifying their complexity. The only thing which we see are able to do what the Hat does it Tom's Diary Horcrux. The room is even more impressive. The room first needs to read your mind without an obvious detectable form of legilimency. Then it needs to be able to contain Fiendfyre. It also needs to create stuff. (I might be wrong, but I don't recall there being a conjuring charm. It's part of transfiguration, no? And it's a complicated branch of transfiguration too. It certainly needs someone to do the conjuring) It needs to be able to create paths through the castle. It needs to be able to transport stuff into a storage version of itself without stacking everything on top of each other. I'm sure there's much more. Honestly, Hogwarts itself is pretty amazing by its own right, compared with something like the Ministry of Magic.

There has never been any indication that the room can give a user anything that they want, that being a fanon creation as far as I know. Undetectable expansion charms are fairly easy to make, so that explains the storage aspect of the room, and house elves put misplaced items into the room of hidden things, which explains why Dumbledore received a room full of chamber pots rather then toilets. People don't tend to lose those all that often. The room can create paths through the castle yes, but stair cases shift in Hogwarts, and the Chamber of Secrets, which has been around for a thousand years sprouted a new entrance underneath the girls bathroom on the second floor. As far as I know there has been no indication from Rowling that magical buildings aside from Hogwarts have to behave in the same manner as normal buildings, and at the end of the day a lot of Hogwarts' quirks could easily have been added to the castle by teachers or headmasters/mistresses after the school's creation. As suits of plate armour are inventions off the 15th Century, we already know this to be the case.

Think of the Prince's potion textbook as an example. As printed, it's designed to allow the masses to brew a workable potion. With the notes of a master imparting his secrets, Harry can brew perfect potions with ease.

Not to say there's no innovation in magicial theory. But at the same time, there's a certain quality to going back to basics. I often think of magical combat as a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Maybe that old magic started to break reality due to the sheer power of it (and/or attracted the attention of 'the many-angled ones at the bottom of the mandelbrot set'), or maybe wands and motions were more efficient for day to day (needing less effort and preparation and power to use) and the really powerful stuff that bugger all people needed (because why build a nuclear reactor to run your dishwasher) was disposed of despite being more powerful, or maybe magic is just declining and less people are capable of the stuff and enough teachers died without passing on their knowledge (perils of an apprenticeship system in an overly-traditional and stagnant society - if you don't teach innovation or complexity, it stops very, very quickly). Or just that the spells had some nasty side-effects or some bad dude used them to do bad things and people subsequently banned them and then moved and left their books in that ancient dusty library, etc. But hell, organised teaching only started in 1000AD-ish, so maybe spellcrafters before then were all just ornery hermits and Dark Lords who never shared anything and died with it all sealed in their hidden lair libraries and such.

In linkffn(Mahou mo Ken by Enterprise1701), the author introduces "Japanese battle magic," which is more powerful than Western spells, but takes much longer to invoke, and in linkffn(Plantagenet by Hibob), it's stated that wands are a crutch that permits people who aren't strong enough for "real" magic to perform spells.

** In my stories, ancient magic generally is weaker, less refined, and generally not used for good reasons. Like rituals fell out of use once wands were invented and potions advanced because between the two, rituals were mostly rendered obsolete. Wands, for example, allow much faster and more precise casting, and much more versatility, than staves. Wandless casting is generally so much weaker, even a spell cast by a master of wandless magic would be outdone by an average student with a wand. However, the Dark Arts contain a number of rituals that are still effective compared to modern magic - mostly because they require blood sacrifices.

** For a different take on this: linkfp(Mother of Learning) has a world that used to have divine intervention producing one-off artifacts that mortals can't replicate. The gods have now gone silent, and only a few examples of that kind of magic remain.

But, regular magic is much more advanced than it used to be, and outside of divine artifacts, "lost" magic was usually lost because it was obsoleted by better training (eg mages are now skilled enough to have a single colour-changing spell that can make whichever change they want, instead of needing a different spell for each specific change) or changing conditions (eg volcanic spells for which no suitable volcano exists any more).

If, say the catholic church printed a science book, you should be sceptical of it's accuracy. Same if the Nazi Germany were to print a history book.

Really, the only concern with older books is if newly discovered information is left out.

They definitely knew their stuff, but that doesn't mean a lot of what they said wasn't wrong when looking back, they were simply limited by the available knowledge of their time. And both their teachings are still taught in modern science classes, but you are explicitly taught to only make use of the information which has been proven over the years.

Similarly Wizards like Merlin and the Founders were quite likely some of the best minds of their generations, but they each made point in passing their knowledge on and allowing others to work with it, so modern magics had over a thousand years to improve upon it and discard those which were made redundant or proven wrong.

  In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year, he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

  He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, *he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist, Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian, and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming and The Practical Potioneer.* Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister for Magic.

We know that after school Dumbledore continued to work as partner with Nicholas Flamel and that the Alchemy they worked on ended up being of the things he ended up famous for. This is from his Chocolate Frog Card.

I suppose the really issue is the example that was used in the original prompt. They should have used an example similar to you. An 18th century western doctor would get a lot wrong.

And you're right, it is a lot more complicated than that. Especially in the scenario given in the prompt. Getting some old magic textbooks would not be a good thing if it were similar in n accuracy as a medical textbook written by an 18th century doctor.

As for the magic researcher part, that was just me spitballing. As you have described it seems it was similar to the culture of gentlemen scientists.

And like I taught the other guy, and for some reason was extremely down-voted for, the magic that is used in the room of requirement isn't anything not taught at Hogwarts, it certainly seems to mostly be a room enchanted with space expansion, vanishing and conjuration spells, all of which are still by modern wizard.

Likewise most of the magic of Hogwarts doesn't seem to be anything overly complicated, like certainly it would take a lot of effort and time, but none of it is really seems like a form of unique or forgotten magic.

Those spells are considered advanced by most people, and here they are automated. It can also call on objects within a pocket dimension (The Room of Hidden Things) and move stuff there. It can selectively allow people to enter it, and hide itself away when it doesn't want to be found. Based on some comments by the Weasley twins, and Dumbledore, it can manifest itself anywhere in the castle, it's just more consistent and easier to access in the seventh floor corridor. Its space expansion is greater than anything else we see in the series (with the possible exception of Newt Scammander's briefcase). It can create exits and entrances /outside/ of Hogwarts. The Hogshead inn is not directly connected to the castle, and the tunnel that was used does not go beneath the ground. That means the Room of Requirement can create passages through space-time. Essentially creating short range wormholes.

We have never seen anything do that before or since. And all of this is done by the Room itself, no practice required for the one using it.

****** Sure, we see enchanted items do some of these things, but none as comprehensive or useful as the Room of Requirement.

We see expanded trunks and handbags, and even an item pouch that can summon the desired object to the user's hand, but that was dependent on the properties of a specific magical creature, and it still couldn't really compete with the Room.

Conjuring creates things from scratch, it doesn't summon them from a nearby pocket dimension. Vanishing... I'm a bit uncertain on, but I think that one has been a bit inconsistently portrayed. I'm pretty sure it was explained, and is usually used as a way to completely unmake something. That isn't what the Room of Requirement does. It pulls things from the Room of Hidden Things. It /can/ conjure things, and thus can presumably vanish stuff too, but if you need something specific, it's better that it's a real object.

I'm pretty sure Dumbledore and the Weasly twins didn't come upon the Room on the seventh floor. The Weaslys /may/ have been, as they were looking for a way to hide, but Dumbledore had no reason to go there when what he was looking for was a lavatory.

Space expansion may get larger than the Room of Requirement, but as I said, the largest we've seen is there. (probably)

And while I can't say exclusively that the tunnel to the Hogshead inn /isn't/ through the ground, I am pretty sure it isn't. I can't remember anything about the tunnel going downwards, which it'd have to do to go beneath the ground. And wasn't the entrance/exit in the second storey of the house?

It may be possible for modern magic users to build something similar to the Room of Requirement, but I don't think there is a single instance of that in the books. The only competition it has is probably the Department of Mysteries, but as we haven't seen much of it, it is hard to say something like that conclusively.

And yes, you can lock a door with magic and only allow certain people to enter. Wards is basically that as an entire discipline, but if you break down the wall before Diagon Alley, or mash down the wards of whatever place you're trying to enter, you're going to get in. The Room simply won't be there. There is no wall to knock down, no ward to break. It's just not there.

Platform 9^{3/4} may be the same, but as there's an exit/entrance where the train tracks goes I wouldn't count on it. Still, this feature is probably the one most likely to be available to modern wizards (besides the basic ones)

****** Practical life skills are needed at every level of learning and especially for art students (or magic students) so that they can support themselves when they leave school.

Hogwarts starts at age 11 - that's middle school in the US and that is when a lot of schools teach practical life skills such as home economics, wood shop, computer skills, biology, physical education, language skills, etc. I teach middle school - practical life skills are necessary.

Hermione summoning the horcrux books was the first time she tried that in six years of hunting down facts in the library.

#+begin_quote

Harry, thankfully, knows how to cook... it is actually one of the skills that the Dursleys inadvertently taught him. Ron and Hermione are pretty much useless at making food for themselves. It's not just a skill you need when you are on the run. It's a skill you need when you're supporting yourself and not being fed by a magical table fueled by house-elves.

#+begin_quote
  The majority of students do not need this and never will, if some wizard wants to create his own spells he can just use a dictionary, its not like he need to know the entire language.
#+end_quote

I don't remember where they are limited by the ministry... Hermione was able to do it, though. She could have put that charm on all their denim pockets instead of just on her beaded bag. That would have been handy.

A patronus can act as a buffer against the dementors... so it does kind of exist... but nothing was done to protect students against the dementors on the train or at Hogwarts their third year. And a potion might be more effective... hmmm. Might have to brew one of those for my fic...

Anyway, I have a feeling we are going to continue to disagree. I totally love the potterverse, but there isn't very much that actually makes sense in it. Maybe that's why it is so much fun to get lost in it.

Again Fanon. Canon Harry doesn't know how to cook, we saw him fry bacon and eggs once because Petunia was busy, but none of the trio being able to cook was a plot point in Deathly Hallows.

Oh, ouch. I can't tell you how many times I've read the books. I've been reading them over and over again since I first started reading them in 1999. I don't have a photographic memory and my opinion about how a school should be run has a lot to do with my job as a teacher.

It's not that you or I are misrepresenting canon, it is that we disagree about what it means. It happens. People interpret things differently.

** > Realistically doing this, would be like preparing for science class by studying the works of Aristotle and Newton instead of modern books.

Not necessarily. Let me make an analogy. For example, some of ancient methods for building (like the Roman concrete, or the way Egyptians built their pyramids) are incredibly durable and if you had enough money/manpower/materials you could make a house that'd last thousands of years. However, it's not economically viable and there are much cheaper options.

In my opinion, it's the same way with ancient magic. This kind of magic takes much more power, energy and effort to do, while being stronger, but it leaves the caster drained. The new magic may be weaker, but it also takes less power and effort to be cast. In other words, it's more /efficient./

Modern scientists are always looking for new, more efficient ways to streamline older technology. Yes, there are new, more powerful devices/techniques being developed, but it just feels like it's all connected. Newton's laws of motion are still studied in primary and high schools all over the world, and Aristotle is studied in every philosophy/logics course in high schools/universities not because they are the best version or more advanced over the new scientific knowledge or philosophic views, but because they provide a basis to future education.

I'm not completely sure why I wrote such a huge wall of text, but I guess I just wanted to say I don't look at ancient magic as more advanced. More powerful, yes, but it requires much more effort, preparation and sacrifice to work than modern swish-and-flick magic.

*** What? How on earth is a fucking pyramid comparable to a house? I think something a little more apt is a mud shack in Ancient Egypt and one of the cheap-ass "efficient" houses we have today (spoiler alert: most houseowners find modern housing better than a mud shack!). No, something comparable would be the hoover dam which will last indefinitely with upkeep and 10,000 years if humans were to disappear (not to mention it kind of does more than a pyramid). Egypt spends millions on the upkeep of said pyramids forever. Also, better? The building methods work cause they're in an arid environment. Also, good luck getting AC and modern comforts through early forms of cement with a bunch of unnecessary walls when columns would have sufficed. Hell, why is the longevity of a fucking pyramid relevant to a house? Who needs a house to last for thousands of years? Not to mention canon and the distinct lack of more powerful ancient magic.

** I would enjoy reading a subversion of this trope, but I don't think it's so cut and dry as “new magic would be more advanced than old magic” simply because magic is not a science.

Certainly, some spells and effects could be studied, dissected, disassembled, reassembled, examined, turned inside out, be made to do a little dance, until they are completely understood to the point that you can teach a bunch of 11 year olds how to make things float. Most wand magic and potions that we see in canon are examples of this - things that can be easily taught in a classroom as part of a standard education have to have consistent, predictable results after all.

The flip side of this are all of the things that aren't really explained in full, the bits of mysterious magic that aren't as structured and factor in things like intent, sacrifice, and the giving of ones word. Two huge examples of this are wand allegiance and the blood protections. Don't really need to go into wand lore, but Lily's sacrifice is very important.

The reason Lily refusing to stand aside resulted in Harry being protected from Voldemort is, in my opinion, two fold. One, ol' Tommy promised Snape to spare her, and broke his word. Two, he gave Lily multiple chances to move aside, and she refused every time. This created a unique effect in Harry that enabled him, years later, to survive the Killing Curse a second time. But this is something that couldn't have been planned ahead of time, there were no incantations or wand waving on Lily's part (despite what some very creative people have come up with in fics). It was simply Old Magic, fueled by sacrifice and love, and triggered by a broken oath.

THAT is the sort of magic that would (in my opinion) be the sort of thing that continues to be incredibly powerful magic. It wouldn't be easily taught, since the circumstances surrounding using this type of magic have to be just right, so it would eventually be forgotten in old tomes collecting dust. 99.99% of magicals would never encounter this sort of magic, because it's not something you really ever need to know on a daily basis - and most that do explore it would find it to be just an interesting bit of trivia of Old Magic.

I believe I've stumbled a bit off topic. Anyway my point is just because something isn't taught in standard education, doesn't mean it's useless, doubly so when we're talking about a fictional force that reshapes reality to the whims of its user. Why try to teach ~50 kids a year how to cast a dangerous ritual that may go horribly wrong on the off chance that some of them benefit from it?

Take bakery, for instance, bread made with ancient methods, equally in terms flour making than bread making, tend to be much better not only for the taste but for the body as well.

Since magic is clearly to antithesis to science, both as fields of study and as a fundamental and practical way to tackle everyday life, it makes much more sense if the ancient is stronger.

Actually, one might even consider magic as a sort of artisanship, /techné/ if you'd like. Aren't there lots of instances where characters speak about magic as a very hard thing to grasp and always surprising, which, to me, sounds a lot like something an artisan would say about is own field.

** Except there ARE things that the ancients used to do that we can't. For example, the Romans built concrete piers in the ocean 2,000 years ago, and they are as good today as they were then. On the other hand, concrete piers built in the last hundred years are falling apart from corrosion. What did the Romans do different? No one knows.

The Romans had subfloor heating in the villas (the rich did, at least), and only since the 1900's have we rediscovered how to do that.

The Romans had a complex system of sewers covered by stones, much like modern sewers. Waste flushed from the latrines flowed through a central channel into the main sewage system and thence into a nearby river or stream. ... It is estimated that the first sewers of ancient Rome were built between 800 and 735 BC. Up until the 1800's people were still dumping chamber pots into the streets in Europe!

The Egyptians use an embalming fluid made from natural materials that works better than the embalming fluid used today. How id they do that? No one knows.

In Peru, the ancient farmers used to grew bigger crops than they can today. Why? It's not climate change through the ages as it is raining as much in the high mountains today as it used to way back then. A scientist finally figured it out. For some reason, no one knew why, the Peruvian farms had extra wide furrows, that is there was a mound two or three feet wide, then a depression two feet or so wide. The depressions between the mounds were not deep enough to be for irrigation purposes. No one knew why they were that way, just that that was the way it had always been. A scientist in either late 1990's or early 2000's had a wild idea and got a grant to pay the farmer for his lost crop. He dug out the depressions so that they flooded with water from the river. Amazingly enough, the water between the mounds acted as a warming bank and prevented the plants from freezing at night at the beginning and end of the growing season when frosts were prominent. It allowed the plants to grow longer! Or, in some cases, to have two crops per summer instead of one.

Apparently in the 1300,s there was a major drought that lowered the river enough to fail to irrigate the plants. When it finally stopped a hundred years later, no one knew to dig up the dust filled channels and let them act as warming banks again.

So, who says that ancient magical civilizations might not have discovered things not rediscovered yet?
