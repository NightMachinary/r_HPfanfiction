The purges in The Ministry, the trails (and perhaps executions) of Umbridge, Minister Thicknesse and other collaborators or death eaters. The rehabilitation of Snape's image (true he'll never be considered a nice man but the society acknowledge his role as spy and that he wasn't a traitor) , the abrogation of the anti-muggleborn laws, things like that. Reforms in Hogwarts Curriculum

The denazification process but in Harry Potter's world.

The only example that I Can think of is the classic fic " Hermione Granger and the marriage law revolution"

Are there any others?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

**** Thicknesse's fall was identified by everyone in the Order - largely the same people who will be in power after the war.

I imagine the Imperius defence would be proven the same way coercion and duress generally is.

***** I've always wondered why they don't make people who claim to have been under the Imperius to take Veritaserum. I understand there might be some laws about it but you would think they would make an exception in cases like this.

****** I think Veritaserum was not invented by JKR until GoF. But why it was not more used could still be explained by a corrupt Ministry that wanted to cover up crimes committed by its 'esteemed members'.

In the Books, the corrupt and incompetent British Ministry of Magic based their rejection of Veritaserum mainly on 3 reasons:

#+begin_quote
  Wizards can also close their throat with magic
#+end_quote

That was their most ridiculous excuse. One finite incantatum will remove that, and someone in custody wouldn't have the luxury to perform that wandless feat anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Occlumency
#+end_quote

Very few wizards were occlumens and they still could be softened up before being dosed with Veritaserum. Three days sleep deprivation should do wonder to their occlumency shield.

#+begin_quote
  Memory charms
#+end_quote

They were a serious problem, but human witnesses and confessions could ALL be results of memory charms and thus just as unreliable. However, in Sirius situation, he was caught immediately by Aurors and didn't have the opportunity to perform a memory charm on himself. Although not as rare as Occlumens, performing good memory charms was still very difficult. As HBP showed, even an accomplished wizard such as Horace Slughorn had trouble doing that, and he wasn't under any time pressure.

******* The whole problem with veritaserum is that even if there are defences against it, it would still ferret out a number of guilty suspects.
