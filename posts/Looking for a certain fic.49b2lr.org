I'm really looking for a fic that just has Harry Ron and hermione going through a regular day at hog warts. I really like to read about them going to classes, quidditch matches, visiting hagrid etc. anyone know of any?


** In response to your question OP, I did ask the same question a few months ago. Some of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3o2y5w/school_stuff/?ref=search_posts][these]] may be what you're looking for.

** It's been a while since I've read it, but iirc linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a fair bit about lessons in general, and linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) also has some, although these are both AU in different ways - the second one, in particular, only involves Hermione. Sadly, these are the closest stories I can think of.

Some advice if you end up trawling through ff.net's search function - stories with Hermione are much more likely to involve going to classes at least somewhat.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Sure. There's a series of seven stories, and I'd recommend starting with the one called "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone".

*** So you can ask for a fic where there is 'a submissive/Harry' but you can't ask for a fic focusing on school stuff? I don't get it. Don't judge someone just for liking something.

And you mention the canon series? Yeah well I would say a lot of the series moves away from school stuff to do boring plot things. There's a whole goddamn book where they're not even at school for crying out loud.

I dunno... it just kinda irked me that you seemed to dismiss their request as if it was stupid..
