** I feel like Harry in linkffn(Blindness by angelastarcat) is the closest I've seen to this, especially later on as his reputation grows.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** In most fics it seems to be a mix of the colour, and that they "Glow ominously" with power. A lot of people also seem to describe him as having "old eyes", that don't fit well with such a seemingly young person. So they're trying to show that Harry has been through so much before the age of 17, that he seems like a much older person. So I believe it usually a mix.

It's all Fanon anyways, JK never described eyes glowing with power, just the twinkling Dumbledore had.

Edit: Just realized you were looking for those stories. My b. Theres so many.

*** A headcanon I have for my fic is that wizards of exceptional power have glowing eyes, which can be hidden/have the glow cut down by glasses, which is why wizards wear glasses even though they may not need corrective eyeware. (hence Dumbledore's spectacles, and Harry's glasses. Voldemort doesn't wear glasses, so his ominously glowing eyes are always visible, adding to his intimidation factor.) And a lot of wizards wear glasses to play up this perception.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** You might like my story, linkffn(13165448), the people in Privet Drive are scard of fem!Harry because her eyes have an unnatural, predatorty glow.

Also, in the ever-controversial linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer), Harry's eyes literally glow thanks to an enhancement ritual he performs, and it disturbs pretty much everyone he meets.

  Shy and abused, Iris Potter slowly uncovers the truth about the magical world, despite the warnings of her brother and father. What are the Old Rites, why is numerology a dark art, and why does she keep blushing whenever Blaise and her bond-mate look at her? Prepare for magical theory, politics, paganism, creatures, a twin, romance, and above all, self-discovery.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
