So I love fanfics with more complex magic systems and a common aspect of these is including rituals of various kinds. The obvious issues with this being that if they're that powerful, which they almost always are, then either:

- Everyone would use them which could be interesting but would be a massive shift in the universe. OR
- They're prohibitively expensive meaning only rich people can use them leading to massive class divide. OR
- The more powerful examples require terrible sacrifices that only the truly mad or desperate would pay. This also has the advantage of giving the whole art a dark reputation explaining why not everyone uses simple examples.

This is obviously just the way I see it and I was just wondering what other people think about the subject. I'm trying to outline an expanded magic system for a story I'm planning but even the simpliest aspect or spell seems to change the way the society would form. Or maybe that's just me over thinking it lol.


** Something to bear in mind is how easy magic makes most things, incredible is just a wave of the wand away. Normal witches and wizards work for the Ministry doing paperwork or selling stuff on Diagon Alley. Not all need to be super aurors, secret agent unspeakables and the like. Where I'm going with this is you can have powerful rituals but they're probably pointless for 99% of people. The moment you give them drawbacks of any kind most people simply won't touch them, even then the vast majority have no need for them.

*** Yes, but canon transfiguration is already ridiculously broken. The upper size limit is a dragon according to GoF and a dragon is roughly the size of a double-decker bus IIRC. This means that you can transfigure ~100 m^{3} in one go, which translates to nearly 800 tons of steel. For reference, the gun of an Iowa class battleship weighs "only" 121.5 tons. You can transfigure over 13 kilometres of high-quality railroad rail into existence with the wave of a wand (although not in one piece). Or enough steel for over 400 cars.

Also, any small rodent is way more complex than a space shuttle, and that is one of the pre-OWL topics (countless cell types, a neural system and so on). And if you want to argue with the knowledge required, let me again point out that even a mouse's brain is significantly more complex than a steam engine.

***** The average Joe is kinda irrelevant since they are not even appearing in the background. The Patronus Charm is supposedly incredibly difficult and yet Harry has taught it to the DA in a few weeks in secret meetings. And not all DA students are on his or Hermione's level of competence. Therefore I'd take any claim about average skill level with a pinch of salt since even Crabbe managed to summon hellfire. Hell, the Tonks residence, despite no visible kind of fortification, is able to completely repel Voldemort and his forces without anyone even firing a curse at them. And neither Ted nor Andromeda are known for their magical powers.

****** As far as I remember, only a few members of DA managed a corporeal Patronus. The rest only got a mist. Crabbe summoned Fiendfyre and immediately lost control of it and died. Harry's residence at Privet Drive has no "visible" fortification either and I don't remember Voldemort personally attacking Tonks family.

And the Tonks home repelled Voldemort during the chase at the start of DH. Voldemort's entire force was stopped cold.

Not true at all. What makes Dragons difficult to transfigure is their magic resistance. Hermione did mention size, but since the only time it was mentioned was in relation to a magicallt resistant creature and never later, I'll assume she was simply wrong. Even then, it's not an upper limit. You can likely do larger. Hermione was simply making a guess.

"There's a way, Harry. Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon -"

-GoF 217

" "Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate. . .' But Sirius said a simple one would do it.. ."

-GoF 219

" I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . . unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they're not simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . ."

***** Hermione explicitly states that even McGonagall would be challenged to transfigure something THE SIZE OF a dragon. You even quoted that. Granted, it is an estimated, but if it's too low that transfiguration is even more powerful.

** Harry: I could have brewed a cauldron's worth of Pepper-up Potion in half the time this ritual took.

Dumbledore: And there you have the reason rituals are rarely used any more-for the vast majority of them, there are far more convenient and effective alternatives. However for some, unfortunately often nefarious, purposes rituals are still the most effective, or even only, option.

** Whenever someone suggests that rituals are fanon, I remember the painting Ron encountered in St. Mungoes that wanted to treat his 'spattergroit'.

#+begin_quote
  They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies.\\
  Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.\\
  ‘And what's that supposed to be?' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.\\
  ‘ 'Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now --'\\
  ‘Watch who you're calling gruesome!' said Ron, his ears turning red.\\
  ‘-- the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes --'\\
  ‘I have not got spattergroit!'\\
  ‘But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master --'\\
  ‘They're freckles!' said Ron furiously. ‘Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!'\\
  He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.

Rituals are already canon. What makes them boring in fanon is that all the steps seem obvious and have almost programmatic results.

** Who would use some high-effort ritual that requires terrible sacrifices if you have all the magic you need for even the most nefarious purposes at the tip of your wand instantly, as much as you need, absolutely free? And if you cannot achieve something with a wand, there are always potions. You can turn anything into anything, bend someone's mind or even the whole universe to your will, manipulate memories, unleash a fire so powerfull it would burn anything to the ground, turn into anyone if you just have some of their hair... I truly don't see why anyone would need ritual outside of very specific circumstances, like if you need to create a new body because you lost your old one but somehow didn't die.

** I like to think of rituals as the old way of doing things. Here are some ups and downs of rituals and spells

Rituals\\
Ups :

They are lasting

They are much much more powerful

They are capable of more

Downs:

Require complex knowledge of runes

Takes quite a long time to do (Drawing the ritual circle etc)

Uses a staff (Which are hard to get), which unlike a wand you can not point it at someone and say a spell. You have to use it to help control ritual circles

Spells:

Ups:\\
Are quick and easy

Require only knowledge of incantation and wand movements

Use wands which are easy to get

Downs:

Are not as powerful

Are not as lasting

Some parts of magic (Such as soul magic) Are very hard and power draining to do with a wand.

** They often have the first problem - the world does not look like one where such rituals exist.

​

That said, it is possible for knowledge to have been lost or hoarded, but then you need a really good way to make that make sense...

​

That said, my headcanon is that:

- Wandless magic is exactly innate human magic (like dragon's fire and flight). It is thus rather limited in scope.
- Potions and Rituals harness magics not innate to humans, in order to produce effects that innate human magic cannot accomplish.
- Wands allow for a very wide variety of magics to be produced, turning "innate human magic" into "spell effect X", via whatever the underlying mechanism of the magic system is.

  - In particular, most rituals have wanded spells that are close enough in effect to be preferred.
  - Because reasons, many Potion effects are not (yet at least) (easily) replicable by wand-magic, which is why Potions is a required 7-year course while rituals are not at all (unless Arithmancy/Runes can be applied to, or are, that).
  - Some rituals have not yet been replaced by wand-spells, (inclusive) or for some applications, it is easier to invent or adapt a ritual than a wand-spell

    - For example, the GY resurrection, which was a combination Potion and Ritual.

** they should be powerful but costly in some way: money, blood, sanity, integrity of the soul, risk of exploding, debt upon your soul, materials that you have to overcome a trial to obtain (say, the willingly given horn of an unicorn), self mutilation, etc.

** I always considered rituals as "Old Magic ". Really in use hundreds of year ago, but its drawbacks (really hard tu put in place, and a law of équivalent exchange where there is always a price to pay ) made that people gradually chose to use other branchs of magic like wands. I still think rituals could be used in some special circunstances. Like a ritual could heal a wound caused by Dark magic, but the user need to bring flesh to replace the hurt part, and the process is so painfull most would loose their mind first.
