This is a pet peeve of mine. So, SO many Snape-centric fics start off good, get trucking along, pick up steam, and then someone hands Snape a bottle of shampoo and suddenly he has luscious, beautiful, shiny hair and is incidentally and suddenly gorgeous and probably a better person besides, which:

1. No
2. It does not work like that
3. Stop it

I have very fine hair that gets greasy 12 hours after I wash it; without dry shampoo I'd be a greaseball too. That's just the way it is. Dry shampoo changed my life.

Moreover, bad hair is the least of our dude's troubles. He's not Kylo Ren with the mask off. He probably smells like turpentine on a /good/ day. Don't change it, deal with it!

Reddit, can you rec me some Snape-centric fics where no one whatsoever at all ever is going to hand the guy a bottle of shampoo? Or, when they try, he curses them into next week?


** The opposite is equally as bad, when someone starts liking/falling in love with an unlikable Snape whom other characters in the story dislike and the story never even mentions his greasiness and no one ever has a single thought about it. Or it is mentioned at first and then never again.

OP, I agree that some people may just have hair types that are just more oily than others, but I do think that Snape is presented as lacking in the area of self-care. Possibly due to depression, self-loathing, or even as a reaction to being abused as a child. If I recall correctly he is also described as having yellow teeth in one book.

So... I hear Kylo Ren getting described as Snape 2.0 all the time on [[/r/StarWars]], but this is the first time I've seen it over here on the HP side of things. What's funny to me is that Adam Driver is actually the perfect age for book!Snape, that is, in his thirties, far more so than Alan Rickman was.

I don't know. I feel like if someone is willing to date him and put up with him being an all around horrible person, his looks wouldn't register on their radar. His greasiness is probably the least offensive part of him. People are more likely to think "Why is he/she going out with such an asshole?" than "Why is he/she going out with someone so greasy?"

**** I think good-looking guys are assholes and get away with it all the time in real life and, in fact, were Snape extremely good-looking he'd have students swarming all over him, even if he behaved exactly as he does in canon.

I'm fine with not mentioning it in AU's and fluff pieces where it's clear the author doesn't really intend Snape to have that particular problem. But if it's noticed at the beginning, if other people have used it as an insult, it needs to be dealt with as the fic progresses to have the character(s) getting along better with him. Either they accept it, they get close enough to realize it's not so bad or something other than they thought (like due to brewing all day or that weird hair type or what-have-you) or it gets fixed. Yeah, most of the time "it gets fixed" is pretty awful, but 99% of fanfiction is awful anyway, so it stands to reason that this is no exception. With good writing it would be fine.

Edit: It doesn't need to be a whole scene or plotline, even just a throwaway sentence or two would fix it.

*** Oh absolutely. Giving up on self-care is totally in-character for him, in my opinion. He's certainly not doing anything to help along his appearance. Frankly, he probably finds it useful to look horrible in his adult life; Gross Potions Guy is a useful friend to have and no one's coming to him because they just love his /company./

UNPOPULAR OPINIONS TIME: Do you wanna yell about Alan Rickman being too old? Because I still do, basically forever. Every time someone describes Snape's voice as "deep and beautiful" I roll my eyes and know they're talking about Rickman. Obviously correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there's anything anywhere in canon about his voice being beautiful. Even Tim Roth (who is only 5 or so years younger than Rickman) would have been a better choice, and was in the running!, because you can prop him up next to Oldman and say, yeah, those people are probably about the same age. Rickman just looked SUPER old by the end and the de-aging CG was really distracting for me, though I hate it less and less in subsequent rewatching. (The holding Lily's body thing will bother me til the day I die, though. Yuck.)

**** YES, I love Alan Rickman as an actor and for his voice, but he's never been MY Snape. Much too old and even too nice. And ditto on the Lily-holding. Part of the great tragedy of the books was how young Harry's parents' generation all was when their lives were ruined. And all the mistakes they all made are so much more understandable at book ages too.

I'll take the voice though. Because although I think you're correct that the voice itself is never singled out, book Snape has a /presence/. That speech in the first book was always mesmerizing. It think it's mentioned that he speaks extremely softly but keeps the attention of the class. He's always striding, whirling, and his cape flares out. So, to me, Alan Rickman's voice in the movies approximates that theatricality that book!Snape has.

***** YES, all of this. Also IIRC, his voice has been described as silky in the books. It's kind of my headcanon too that he has a great voice because of his speeches, like the first one about "stoppering death" and when he's the DADA teacher with "The dark arts are ever-changing and eternal", which everyone can't help but listen to.

I completely agree about Rickman. I do love that he totally nailed the "billowing" aspect of Snape. More than his age though, I think he was far too stoic and dignified. The interesting thing about book Snape for me is that he's kind of a hypocrite. He's all "control your emotions" and expressionless but then screams and shouts in capslock afterwards. Rickman didn't really capture that contradiction. His reaction after killing Dumbledore, "DON'T CALL ME COWARD!" was one of my favourite parts in all the books and I wish they'd included it.

**** It's totally in character for Snape to drop self-hygiene. The man's dealing with crippling regret for getting his childhood friend killed by an incredibly powerful man he's incidentally spying on, he has to protect the son of said friend and the man who bullied him his entire teenage years. Early in the books he's dealing with guilt, later on he's dealing with that as well as his life being in danger every time he reports to Voldemort, combined with the fact that he may or may not view that chance as a form of penance.

The man has bigger things to worry about than personal hygiene.

** Well I personally wouldn't call Adam Driver an especially handsome man in a traditional sense of the word. He has a very interesting face, certainly, but he is no supermodel. Therefore with a bit of tinkering on his hair he would be kind of perfect for the role of a younger Snape. IMHO. (Yes, he is old enough to play older Snape as mentioned by cavelioness, but I personally always imagine Snape looking way older than his real age.)

But I do agree with you, our fandom often idolises Snape in both his looks and his personality. Unfortunately, I can't remember any fic where it's done differently.

IMO Adam Driver's face could very well fit the bill, although of course his eyes are a warm brown and Snape's are "black as tunnels" or some such.

***** Actually, in the comic fan art [[/u/Deathcrow][u/Deathcrow]] linked below, there's a quote from Goblet of Fire to that effect:

" ...leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly."

Of course, this is Harry's POV and he has reason to see Snape as the personification of human ugliness. But the text keeps reinforcing Snape's negative physical features, so I suspect JKR intends him to be straightforwardly unappealing.

Also, re: eyes "as black as tunnels," I always assumed that was a reference to Occlumency as well as the state of Snape's soul. Harry just didn't know at the time that Legilimency and Occlumency existed, IIRC.

This has no real bearing on anything, since of course Snape is a kid-lit exaggeration of a menacing stereotype, but since there was such a to-do made over John Nettleship as the inspiration for Snape, I do have to point out that Nettleship was, in fact, an attractive enough man and not a gargoyle. [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/artwork/John/John_Dec_1978.jpg][John Nettleship]] But from young JKR's POV, he was a horrible teacher with long hair and a sharp tongue.

*** Adam Driver is way too tall to play Snape, unfortunately. Snape is never mentioned as short or tall, but Sirius is a head taller than him when they fight in Grimmauld Place in book five. As Sirius is explicitly described as tall, I figure this makes Snape more average-sized than Adam Driver, who is huge.

**** I don't think it's actually said that Sirius is a whole head taller than Snape, though - Snape has to be a small enough amount shorter that it's never been obvious enough that Harry's remarked on it before, even though he's seen them arguing in the past. The book itself only says that Sirius is 'rather taller' than Snape, who is considerably taller than Narcissa (as per HBP) who, according to GOF, is a tall woman.

Basically he's shorter than Sirius, who is a tall man (while still shorter than Dumbledore, who is estimated at 6'7 or 6'8) and considerably taller than a tall woman.

Adam Driver's 6'2" is not actually that impossible, if you take all these facts into account.

There were tens of thousands of people all arguing and expounding increasingly wackier theories, something like [[/r/asoiaf]] is these days- only even better. So I have a pretty good grounding in canon, although I pretty much quit after the last book was published in 2007 until I discovered fanfiction a year or two ago.

Like about Snape's height, I remember the protests that sprang up over Mary Grandpre's godawful portrayal of him in that chapter- short, bald on top, and with a goatee, of all things. I may have /mis/remembered the "head shorter" from someone yelling about him being an entire head shorter than Sirius and he wasn't supposed to be.

Not just at home, but on the streets. It completely fits him, IMO. It's probably sometimes /really/ hard for him to hold his tongue around his students.

And I can easily see Snape as a smoker, in fact I'm writing a fic where he's gone back to the Muggle world and he smokes. He's tense and high-strung, his teeth are yellow (tobacco and tea+coffee, anyone?), and he came out of a Muggle background in which smoking was a normal and accepted part of social gatherings, and smoking bans were about 40 years off.

I think he's someone who struggles to balance his origins (working-class, "gutter rat") with the place he wants to go (cultured, pureblood) and the way he speaks and even smoking is an indication of that. I think he swears /a lot/ in his head. It also has some canon basis, because his reaction to James and Sirius attacking him in SWM is to turn the air blue.

I also think he could have picked up smoking in his youth in Cokeworth, and it's something he would do obsessively (because Snape does everything obsessively). I love those little tidbits of a muggle background he can't shake off.

I had an extremely difficult time picturing a bald Snape, which I'm sad to say put me off a little. But the writing itself was perfectly fine up to the point I let it fall to the side, which is certainly more than I can say for the last few fics I've attempted.

I don't know why tofsla's fics aren't more popular either. Maybe people really do not prefer the crafty asshole that Snape actually is. I've recently joined some FB groups, one a Snape group in particular. Lots of fic promotions there, which is totally fine. All the banners include Alan Rickman, who I certainly find attractive as well, but just shows how people actually do romanticize him. Just the other day, there was also a post there that was railing against people daring to suggest the way Snape should (or should not) be written since we don't know his motivations. (a) Yeah we kinda do and (b) if he can be just any old somebody, then why not make an OC?

My thought is that if there are going to be major character shifts, there better be justification for it somewhere along the story so I can believe it. I'm not going to go along with the idea that he's a true romantic at heart just because it seems like a pleasant notion to read about.

  When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.

*** Well, Sleekeazy's exists and all that, but I think the real point is that Snape can't be transformed by a simple shampoo. He would most likely go ballistic at anyone who tried to make him wash his hair in order to be acceptable; he's certainly been teased and insulted about it since childhood, and maybe even pranked or had his head held down while someone force-soaped him (possibly his parents at Spinner's End). So it's not like it's news to Snape that he's greasy, and he's probably well aware he'd look ridiculous with soft, silky, pretty hair.

So for me it's not a question of whether magical shampoo exists or whether it can instantly give Snape lovely locks. It's a question of whether Snape would fly into a rage and retaliate by giving the purveyor hedgehog quills for hair in return. In flashbacks, he strikes me as a typically neurotic self-absorbed brainy grotty adolescent, feistier and angrier than most. When we meet him in canon, he's clearly settled into the role of the ugliest, most repellent, most hateful teacher in the school. Magical shampoo isn't going to change that, isn't going to mean he stops hating himself or feeling guilty or griefstricken or vicious toward children. It's not going to make him feel better about having ruined his own life.

It /can/, however, be a source of comedy.
