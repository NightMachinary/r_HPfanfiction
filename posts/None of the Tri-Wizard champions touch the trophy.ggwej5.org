Harry and Cedric are fighting against the giant acromantula, and suddenly, it rushes forward towards Harry. Harry gets out of the way at the last minute, and the beast knocks into the Tri-Wizard cup. Suddenly, both the acromantula and the cup disappear, and Harry and Cedric send up sparks to get out of the maze. Meanwhile, the angry acromantula is in a totally different place.

"B-blood of the enemy... forcibly taken... you will... resurrect your foe."

The acromantula watched with interest as the rat man dropped some of its blood into the boiling liquid. It was defeated for now, but would soon escape, and achieve revenge - with interest. Another of its eight legs wriggled free from the rope attaching it to a large, square rock.

It had never before seen a group of such similar rocks, but it supposed that like trees, some rocks came in similar shapes. It would escape this rock forest soon.

Its mandibles clicked as the potion turned white, then sparks flew madly. The acromantula did not like fire.

But then, through the mist in spreading from the cauldron, a shape moved.

Many long limbs, unfolded, creeping over the edges and onto the ground. The acromantula freed its last leg and paused, ready to leap.

Out of the mist came a creature, a monster from human nightmares. The rat man gave a squeak and fell over, scrambling backwards.

Eight serrated legs, a long pale torso, mandibles dripping with poison, and eight red eyes.

The acromantula didn't know what it was, or where it had come from. But this thing had stolen its blood, and brought it here to the stone forest.

It attacked.

But then, through the mist in spreading from the cauldron, a shape moved.

The dark outline of a man, thin and lanky. Juicy and young.

"Robe me," said the high voice from behind the mist, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the red suit from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master's head.

The man stepped out of the mist, gazing at the acromantula. It stared back into two white lenses on a tight body suit in red and black.

Spiderman had risen again.

*** OH SNAP.

Wait, Aragog is old and sickly in COS, and dies of old age in HBP. So Hagrid probably didn't recruit him to run around a maze. So...

  We've all had a gut feeling that something was very wrong, but Harry Potter has been through so much more that he has a higher threshold for weird feelings. Meaning when he gets one, he tends to listen to it. So, what happens when he gets this feeling before grabbing the Triwizard Cup and instead accidentally knocks it into one of the many dangerous beasts in the maze with him?
