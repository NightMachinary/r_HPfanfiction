is it called Bellmione? I think so? I'm looking for ones where hermione isn't evil. I can't imagine her siding with voldemort.

I've read two already. one where she makes a vow to Bellatrix after the war and they are bond and another where she is sent back in time.

but outside of that, the rest seem to be dark. I don't mind dark, but I don't like hermione being evil.


** Check put "Fruits of Love" on fanfiction.net- really excellent Bellamione, and it just got completed!
