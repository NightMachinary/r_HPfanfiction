I've heard a lot about this fic and started reading it today, but the fic sounds very cringey. All that laughing like a lunatic, moaning about Dumbledore and about having to be Harry Potter and all that "oh, look how great I am!". Is it going to get any better? This character, Salazar Slytherin, I suppose, is really tiresome, even though I have just read the prologue and chapter 1.


** Ehh, I liked the story for the history and lore. It's a good story, if you're willing to brush over the modern parts to get to the rest.

** One of the best fics I have read during my 18 years in this genre. World building done right. Haven't read the initial chapters in a few years though.

** I think it is one of the best world building fics around as it goes through pretty much every element of Magical history in the HPU and explains it in incredible detail.

** So I will admit it's a unique story, “Time-Travel”, “Heir to many Lords/Titles”, “Founders”, and a few other Tropes this community makes fun of quite a bit. But it does it in such a way that it's not cliche or Trope-y. You get to see Harry “Sal” earn the titles and his achievements on his own merits. It's nothing that's handed to him but stuff done by him. He isn't Overpowered or anything like that because you see his struggle with staying away from the limelight and just wanting to help people.

I think it's one of the best World building fanfics out there because of the history, languages and showing how society has gone from different forms of government over time.

The story he creates about magic is compelling in a way on how it's evolved into the Magic we know today with magic “used today” having roots in the past. Even His use of the goblins isn't the “Friend of the Nation” trope but something that's worth learning about and seeing how they become the gringotts we know today.

His differences with Dumbledore won't be revealed until later chapters but it's not just as simple as other fanfics like “he ignored my parents will” or “he's a dark lord in disguise”. But I thought his reasoning was very well done and not far off true Canon Dumbledore with his need for secrets and acting too late. (Like we see in canon of Dumbledore coming in late to the fight at the Department of Mysteries, and his inaction to fight fire with fire against Voldemort)

I think the only thing I can really say is give it a shot and realize Sal at the beginning of the story at Privet Drive, is much older and conflicted on the plan he's enacting to stop the Voldemort. He's an old man whose lost a lot and is just tired.

It's my favourite Fanfics out here so far and maybe I'm a little biased but I think it's amazing well written and thought out. Everything is done in a way to make it realistic in a way and not an OP Harry Potter story.

*** But does the writing change at all from the absolute shit thats displayed in chapter 1? I honestly couldn't stand reading that one chapter so it doesn't matter how fucking good the world building is if all the writing is as cringeworthy as chapter 1.

**** I'd say it does. It's definitely not perfect, but it's much better and consistent than other fics I've read. The details and consistency in Ebenbilds writing makes his style of writing worth reading it. It might seem a little confusing at some points but everything has ties in eventually during the fic.

Some people have said they skipped over the scenes in the Present but there just as important to follow as the scenes in the Past.

**** Honestly? Try to read through until chapter 6, it doesn't really get much better or worse, so if you feel like reading it past that point, then it's fine, if you can't then don't.

It's as I_Love_DPs and MidgardWyrm say elsewhere around here, a good idea, shit execution sort of fanfic.

** I hated the first few chapters, because I didn't get who that main character was supposed to be and what was up with him. But it got recommended to me and they mentioned, that it got better and the first chapters were very raw. After the first chapter in a different time I liked it. Maybe try until then.

** It's past history-lore is good but the modern Dumbledore bashing part is terrible. I like it's world building but disliked the modern part. Modern part is basically Harry Potter glory hunter and tropey like how Harry is a bad wizarding name, Lily heir of Lefay, Flamel, etc, Snape/Malfoy good, Dumbledore bad, etc, etc.

If you ask whether it's get better or not. On chapter 61, a 2000+ year old guy holds grudges over a 100+ old guy because what the 100+ year old guy did when the 2000+ year old dude was 11. The story assumes that Dumbledore knew all along that Grindelwald was going to be a dark lord or Tom Riddle going to be Voldemort. The story implies Harry's personal life was sad, questions why Dumbledore didn't go after Grindelwald early. If Harry is sad about what happened to his life, what about Dumbledore's sister dying affecting him? The story insists that Dumbledore was chess master and a believer in prophecy while it's quite opposite.

The whole purpose of modern era is discrediting Dumbledore and glorifying Harryjames.

** Oh I remember this, I stopped reading it because I thought it was some edgy-SI killing Harry and taking his place. Guess that's not quite it from the comments, though it still seems pretty edgy.

** If you're not enjoying the beginning, skip to chapter 5, which is the first chapter about Harry now living in the distant past. If you enjoy that, just keep reading and skip any of the chapters taking place in the present. You won't really miss anything, and you can pick up the chapters in the present when they get interesting without any issues. If you don't care for the pasts chapters either, feel free to drop it entirely.

** No, it's different, and that's about it. I stopped reading when Harry got rekt by some swordsman.

Because being mentored by Merlin and having insta-death basilisk eyes is clearly not enough to defeat a single swordsman.

** Honestly, the rest of the fic is like that all along. Many liked it, I did, but if at the end of the first chapters you're not in, I don't think the rest will change your mind.

** After seeing this thread, I went back to the story, which I'd tried but abandoned after the first chapter. I just finished it, and I admit I liked it quite a lot. The writing starts out very cringy - the author clearly is not a native English speaker, and it shows a lot in incorrect sentence constructions and word choices. This usually is something of a deal killer for me, but I pushed on through it. I don't know if it actually got better as the story progressed (it might have; the story was written over something like 7 years, so it makes sense that the author would improve), or if I just got used to it somehow, but for whatever reason, it stopped bothering me so intensely as I continued reading.

The whole thing did start to drag on a bit. And unlike some readers here, I liked the modern parts, and sometimes wanted the chapters in the past to end so we could get back to the present - I think that as far as this type of time travel far-past stories go, I prefer the past-worldbuilding (and writing) in the Of a Linear Circle series. I got a little lost with some of the creature-born basilisk-eyes phoenix dementor stuff, and I agree that if you look too closely, you can certainly criticize some of the character motivations, which I think is often going to be an issue when you are trying to create a life story for an almost-immortal person and deal with the vast age differences that must be the result of any relationships with that person. (I actually think the author did a pretty good job dealing with this.)

Nonetheless, I still thought this story was overall unusually well thought out for such a massive undertaking, fairly original, and engrossing, with fleshed our characters, a good story arc, and very interesting magic (and thankfully without any objectionable or overly distracting romantic relationships). I was very glad I decided to go back it and will definitely read it again.

** I gave it a try because I saw a lot of people posting about it these last days.

I gave up after like 10 chapters ? give or take. I liked the main idea to be honest ( I love time travel fanfictions ) But I prefer fast paced fanfictions. That and the going back and forth in time between the chapters didn't really appeal to me, because I kept skipping past chapters to figure out what happens in the future timeline. I also didn't like the fact the future Harry (after going back in time) just isn't the same which is completely normal. But I prefer fics where we have Harry interacting with characters normally ? I don't mind him not liking someone and bashing in fanfictions doesn't really annoy me, as long as Harry has people he can count on.

Anyway, I feel like compared to the length of the fic, 10 chapters isn't much so I shouldn't judge maybe it gets better. The idea is cool, and at the end of the day it depends on personal taste.
