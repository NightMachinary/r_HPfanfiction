he uses puppets to fight sort of like sasori and kankuro from naruto


** I would read a fic where he is developing and making human puppets. I don't know if there are any like that though

*** It's quite a stretch, but Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor has something similar.

[[/spoiler][Harry possesses dead bodies that are permanently transfigured into the desired shape by Tonks.]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358785/1/Explosive-Dragon][Explosive Dragon]] has Harry with Sasori's memories I think? And Draco with Dedara's voice in his head. There's also a bunch more stuff like Phoenix!Danzo trying to rebuild ROOT with the school owls and Hidan!Ron with a chainsaw in the ship or something. It's not the best fic out there.
