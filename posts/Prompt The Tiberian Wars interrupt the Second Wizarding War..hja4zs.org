I think the C&C series is perfect for a fic. The First Tiberium War was in the 1990s, and Tiberium's spread across the globe is something the Wizards would be forced to confront. Not only that, but Nod is powerfuland malignant, and could curbstomp most Wizards before they even knew what was happening.


** This!
