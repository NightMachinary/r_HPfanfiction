You know the ones, where for some reason Dumbledore decides that Harry needs to stay with Snape for the holiday/summer. Normally they both hate it, at first, then eventually find common ground. Well...Most of these have Snape on Dumbledore's side.

Anyone know any where Snape is on Voldemort/his own/Harry side. One's where he might start hinting that Dumbledore isn't all he pretends, or tell Harry he is better off on his own, Idk maybe teaches him dark magic and politics, or uses his friendship with Lily, to sway Harry away from the light. I'm just looking for a different take on that plot line.

I'd prefer slash pairing from Harry. Like Draco, Blaise, Theo, Neville. Snape with Remus always amuses me but he doesn't have to be in a relationship, just taking care/mentoring Harry.


** linkffn(A New Place to Stay by Debstheslytherinsnapefan) my fav Severitus story! Severus starts on Dumbledores side but sees the way he acts towards Harry (makes him report while still injured) and moves to Harry's side.

*** I started reading it today but then I couldn't remember if I have read it before.

Spoilers: Does Snape collect horse figurines? Does Nagini eat a house elf?

Am I right with my spoilers or am I thinking of another fic?

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to do― he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

** I really wanted to like “Terms of Matrimony” by Galad Estel (removed from FFnet, so follow the instructions on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my review]] to get it), but for its unfortunate and rushed ending. It looked like a start of exactly this kind of story, but it ended too soon.

** This one fits your description decently and is a classic with one finished sequel and one WIP sequel: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys and has to go home, mid semester. Guess who is assigned to accompany him? This is not slash. This one fits the more classic Snape is on Dumbledore's side.

This one is a bit of a stretch but it has Snape caring for Harry, Snape/Remus, and Drarry! It's also my favorite fic of all time. I will read it for my wedding vows and have it engraved on my tombstone. The first in the series is linkao3(the secret language of mistletoe by Endrina). The instigating factor is not a summer holiday. Instead, Remus snatches Harry from the Dursleys and enlists Snape to help. In this one, Snape is definitely on Harry's side.

Finally, a popular fic I've seen recommended here is Sacrifices linkffn(saving connor by lightning on the wave). This one probably fits your description the best (Snape is on Harry's side, definitely not Dumbledore's or Voldemort's, eventual Drarry), but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it as I don't really care for it. Ive read most of the first four. I think they are bloated and overuse tropes, but they are beloved by many. Your mileage may vary

*** a year like none other... I have tried to read this several times. It has so many things I like in the story but I always get bored around the same spot. I think I need to force myself to read passed that and give it another chance because so many people have recommended it.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
