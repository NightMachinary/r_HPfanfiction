Hello. I've decided to learn Russian. I know basics and I speak Czech, so I can passively understand some more. I'd like to practice my reading skills. So, are there good (preferably long) non slash Russian HP fanfiction stories you would recommend?

(Nothing much on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and I don't have enough language skill and knowledge of Russian internet to find them myself yet)


** I am Lord Voldemort was Russian, but it's been translated to English. They link the original Russian fic on the first chapter

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

** I haven't lurked in that part of Internet for a decade, but the fandom is big, or at least it used to be. I remember really loving [[http://snapetales.com/all.php?fic_id=569][Burglars' trip]]. It's about Snape and Lucius Malfoy friendship and shenanigans, written after OotP and very AU, especially when it comes to Snape's backstory. Starts with them being 11 and goes all the way to canon events. Gen, action/adventure, a lot of humour and decent writing with good grammar.

** hm, i think i remember Tempus Colligendi ([[http://fanfics.me/fic45779]]) being decent-ish (some peggy sue story? dont rly remember)

[[http://fanfics.me/fic37780]] wasnt bad, but it wasnt all that good (tells about some slytherin ooc going in the same year as potter, dont remember much)

[[http://fanfics.me/fic792]] was pretty good (i cant describe what the fuck goes on in here in a sentence, shits fucking crazy lmao)

[[https://ficbook.net/readfic/6463881]] was kinda decent (crossover with dresden, snape picks up a blackened denarius iirc)

havent read any rus fanfics in a while now, but these i can remember off the top of my mind
