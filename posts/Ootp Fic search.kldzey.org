** There are fics where Harry takes the whole concept of House Elf enslavement much more seriously, though I don't recall one where it's specifically the knitting.

**** Well, there's a more nuanced approach in linkffn(Parseltongue is Really Very Ordinary), though it's part of a series. Chapter 5 in particular is on point.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's been learning about pure-blood culture, with Pansy's help, and trying to blend in as an ordinary wizard. But will all his attempts at seeming normal be ruined when they find out he can speak to snakes? His Slytherin friends take the news differently than the Gryffindors. Smart!Harry, Sane!Voldemort. Complete. Part 3 of "Perfectly Normal".
