** Definitely enjoyed it. As a trans person myself, it's really affirming to see stories about us. :)

However, one thing that I noticed was Hermione immediately started using female pronouns for Harry. I would like to mention to readers that if you know someone who goes through this process of self-discovery, it would be more tactful to ask which pronouns they would prefer, or offer to try out different ones to see what makes them comfortable. Jumping to conclusions can make anyone uncomfortable, especially with a topic like gender. As the author notes, the story is set in the 90s, so keep that in mind.

All that aside, I look forward to reading more! I think your story has a lot of potential.

*** Honestly I started writing this one because I could barely find any good trans fics! You're 100% right there. I felt it was more in character for Hermione to go straight to female pronouns in this context. She has a very binary mindset in a lot of things.

**** Yea, I definitely thought it was right for the story - it's in line with both the setting/lack of knowledge as well as her character.

**** Be careful when addressing Harry as "he" or "she" in the narrative. I noticed you "randomly" switched between the two when they go down to see McGonagall.

I'm definitely following this!

***** Hi thank you!

I was trying to convey that moment as Harry realising she was trans and coming out to herself more than anything

****** Using "I'm a girl" for the change was perfect. I meant a paragraph later you wrote "Harry found /his/ gaze drifting" ;)

*** Jesus fucking Christ what? Admittedly it starts off awkwardly, but trans people transitioning is pretty fuckin' tame as far as subjects go for a story.
