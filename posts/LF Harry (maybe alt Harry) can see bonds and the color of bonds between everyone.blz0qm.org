I honestly don't remember if this is from one fic or if several different fic used this trope

Doesn't matter to me! Give it!


** In linkffn(Core Threads), Harry consciously forms bonds between people, and he's capable of seeing them. I'm not certain that's what you meant, though.

** All I can think of is Linkffn(Blindness) but I don't know if he can see bonds in that one. I read one recently where Luna could see bonds but I don't remember it and don't think it was good anyway.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** There's this fic where Harry sees the colour of the soul from each person, and each colour represents an emotion or impulse. There were 7 Colours, but I don't remember them all, only White which only Luna and some other dude had, which was Enlightenment. linkffn(Worthy of Magic) I think green is love or affection, yellow may've been Crowd Control, or Charima, something like that.
