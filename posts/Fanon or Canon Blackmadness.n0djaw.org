We all know that canonically neither Sirius nor Bellatrix are really sane. While Azkaban didn't make it better you can argue they were a little bit insane before that. We know that Sirius' father was paranoid to the point of insanity and nobody who had met Walburgas portrait would argue for her sanity. So the Blacks obviously aren't the most mentally stable family. In fanfiction it is regularly called Blackmadness. But is that actually a thing in canon or is that fanon?


** It's fanon.

Not sure where you got the part about Orion's 'insanity', but Sirius and Bellatrix's instability could just as easily have come from years locked in Azkaban as from anything hereditary.

I do agree that Walburga was certainly not well at the point of her death (although imo her portrait is clearly a caricature of the witch she once was), I prefer to explain this by the grief and loss and loneliness she endured by the end of her life. I think it's more interesting to explain their 'madness' through their personalities/motives/actions rather than some sort of arbitrary 'Black curse', but it is a popular fanon interpretation.

*** Also if you look at Sirius actions.

Its not really insane, Apart from his depressive streak when he spent a year locked in his old family home.

he tended to act towards his goals

*** "/My father put every security measure known to/ /wizardkind/ /on it when he lived here./"- Sirius Black about his father. It's not outright stated - but it made the house so secure it was used as a HQ for the order and to housing Harry while Voldemort hunted him. That's security masures taken to the extreme. Being paranoid was my interpretation I give you that.

PS: I asked because I don't want to use it to "excuse" for their madness, but if it was canon, I would have felt obligated to include it because I try in my fanfic not to change canon without reason. So thank you for explanation.

**** Remember that Orion lived through the war with Grindelwald, World War 2, and most of the first war with Voldemort. That makes his supposed paranoia seem more like taking reasonable precautions.

***** Orion was 9 when WWII started and 16 when it ended. While I give you that it was traumatising - it doesn't made him any less paranoid that he did those measures because we can be pretty sure he took them after the war ended.

And he was on the same side as Voldemort but not activly fighting, so that's not really an excuse either.

****** It also means that he would have grown up learning how to protect himself during wars, and it would have been reasonable for him to prepare for the possibility of another war breaking out.

And even if he was on Voldemort's side, there was still a war happening. Sure, the Death Eaters might not show up to attack him, but an Order member or renegade auror might decide they make an easy enough target if not properly protected. And civilian casualties do happen in wars. And the son who still lived with them was actively fighting. So yes, it is an excuse.

**** Fair enough - I wouldn't call that paranoid to the point of insanity though (just as I wouldn't about Moody), but probably quite common for a bigoted pureblood whose house is surrounded by muggles. And, of course, very convenient for JKR's purposes in using it as Order HQ ;)

** Fanon probably. Andromeda, Narcissa and Regulus are valid counterexamples. Not much is said about Dorea Potter , Lucretia Prewett or Alphard Black but no obvious sign of their insanity is present. Sirius himself was quite sane, if a bit hyperactive before Azkaban. Bellatrix is the only certifiably insane Black in the series.

There are several fanfics which turn Black Madness into an actual magical condition as a price of excess power. Best examples are linkao3(All According To Plan) or linkao3(The Lady Of (New) Avalon).

  Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder --- a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy --- the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy --- and above all, lucky --- the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

*** Really, According to Plan was funny. But reading nearly a full chapter of Ron Weasley bashing, with Hermione being a total ass-hole to him and being applauded by Neville and Harry for it kind of takes the fun out of it. I hate it when stories, that have much promise, do that. So I stopped at chapter 7.

**** Totally understandable. For what's it worth you won't be seeing much of Ron in this fic, he drops out of Hogwarts at some point. I stayed for the worldbuilding really. The other rec is significantly more relevant to your request. Sirius after the werewolf incident in a fit of Black Madness somehow concludes that the best way to regain James' good grace is to turn himself into a girl. The gradual loss of SAN points is quite visible in the narration. Symptoms include Insomnia, general hyperactivity and a general lack of common sense.
