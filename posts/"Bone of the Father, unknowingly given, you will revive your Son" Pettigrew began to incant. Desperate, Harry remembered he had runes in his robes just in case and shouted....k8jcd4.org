"BONES TO BANANAS" just as the Bone of the Father began to fall into the Cauldron, it turned into a Banana.

It's lucky for Harry that he spent his Summer in Gielinor. He didn't have time to learn Lunar Magic like he really wanted to, he spent way too long getting 99 Cooking, but at 15 Magic, he learned a spell he thought he'd never use. Bones to Bananas. Who would have thought he'd be in a ritual involving a Bone that would have revived his enemy.

The world witnessed the birth of Bananamort. he was the funniest Dark Lord ever seen, he tried to be intimidating and scary, but a lot of his spells failed, and the only reason anyone ever died, was that they literally died laughing.


** that would be quite a-peel-ing, Harry would just need to wait for bananamort to turn splotchy and brown then strike at his weakest

** "Bone of the Father, unknowingly given, you will revive your Son" ... "Wait! Why didn't this work? We followed the steps exactly."

"Probably because because someone transcribed the ritual wrong. You see, it should really be 'Boner of the Father'. It's a sex metaphor, if you know what I mean."
