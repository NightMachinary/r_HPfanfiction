** Alright, I love this trope so I have quite a few. Most of them, unfortunately, are not complete.

linkffn(whiskey time travel) features a very competent Harry who's had a lot of experience and is confident in his skills, if also a bit depressed. This story was different because he goes back as an adult to when his parents are 15 (or somewhere around there) so it's more about him not wanting to f up the time line than enjoying having a family.

Linkffn(it isn't easy being a Hufflepuff) has Harry in a rather humorous position of never being taken seriously in this new dimension.

Linkffn(0800-rent-a-hero) I've seen recced here a couple of times recently. It's a good story and with recent updates. Harry's anger about being in a new world is a nice change from all the stories where his world was basically destroyed before changing dimensions.

Linkffn(c'est La vie) I'm trying to remember the plot of this story and I'm struggling. I think it starts off slow, but I remember liking it. It hasn't been updated in two years and I remember thinking that's a shame.

Linkffn(to say my name) has some interesting Ron aspects

Linkffn(Harry Prewitt and the case of illegal time travel) takes Harry back to when the marauders are in school still. Iirc, it features a different take on time traveling Harry by using ministry protocol in place for just such mishaps instead of landing Harry in a younger Dumbledore's office. I got tired of those pretty quickly, yet Harry always seem to end up relying on Dumbles for a new identity. Also features slash.

Linkffn(too far from home) is one of my favorite in this genre. The parallel universe with familiar faces have all lived very different lives and Harry isn't immediately welcomed with open arms. Plus he has his own world that he still wants to get back to.

Linkffn(the mirror of possibilities) I bookmarked this, but I actually have no memory of the specific plot...

Linkffn(Gillyflower, Heliotrope and Hemlock) has a very interesting twist where instead of Harry travelling dimensions, the marauders come to him. Features slash.

Linkffn(Harry potter and the marauders of the mind) handles dialogue very well, which is good because that is nearly all we can have from the marauders. Harry is living a somewhat happy life when he suddenly has four familiar voices in his head all clamoring for attention. (I don't know if it's finished, but I remember waiting for an update after a cliffhanger and felt relieved to finally get the answers I didn't have, so I think it's close if not quite)

And that's all I feel like finding right now. Let me know what you think of any of the ones you may choose to read or have already read! I love to share opinions.

*** I've seen this story so many times, but I haven't read it because of the Dark Harry warning. Harry being evil is just not my cup of tea, though dimension travel definitely is and I actually do like dark fics. Just not dark-for-some-reason Harry. Tell it to me straight, how dark is he in this series?

**** The story starts off with him being Voldemort's enforcer if I remember correctly. So he is dark. However, he still has some values instilled in him. So he is not evil. I think you should read it. You will be pleasantly surprised.

**** I agree with [[/u/Vardso]]. The non-rewrite (only one I've read) starts out with Dark Harry yes, but that is moved away from almost intantly once the exposition is finished. After that the stories focus is mostly on Harry brpther, familie and new self proclaimed friends around him. So if it's the Dark Harry that makes you shy away, then you are missing some.

It's the third and last in a series, though I don't remember if you need to read the first two to make sense of this one.
