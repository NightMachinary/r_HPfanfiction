I can't remember if all of these snippets are of the same story, but here's what I can remember: Harry is called by the Centaurs something like Vael or Vale - some sort of prophesied savior of magical creatures. He breaks magical "webs" that are bonds on the magical creatures. He makes some sort of deal with dementors that send them were the supposedly came from which is the dream world in the form of nightmares. This next ones I'm unsure if it's the same story but either way I'm also looking for it: he has the ability to eat magic, and when Umbridge tries to trick him by stealing his magic with a magical interment he renders her a squib.\\
He gathers a following of many dark purebloods, one being the Parkinsons who's mothers name is a plant and has some sort of thorn/flower magic that runs through her family. It very well might be one of the "Lord-Potter-Black-Slytherin" stories but I can't remember, definitely had tons of "Pure-blood etiquette"\\
I've tried to search for it on my own but I can't seem to come up with anything, I thought for a while it was With Strength of Steel Wings, but the magic eating is way different and there isn't any mention of web breaking or Pansy's family really at all.


** It's been a while since I read it so I don't remember all the details, but pretty sure that's Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc, which starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]. Definitely has web breaking, pureblood etiquette, and Harry the saviour; I don't think Pansy's mother turns up until one of the later stories.

I don't remember Umbridge specifically, but Harry can eat magic in linkffn(Core threads) - the rest is definitly not the same story. He sees magical webs in that story though.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

    [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721625/11/Freedom-And-Not-Peace][The black snake moved higher,]] and its fangs drove home one more time, under Umbridge's ribs on her left side. Umbridge gave another wail, and then simply toppled over. Her left side was frozen, all life gone, though it still looked like flesh. She might limp about with her right leg, gesture with her right hand, speak from the right side of her mouth, animate her right cheek and right eye. It didn't matter. Half of her would always be dead, a frozen grotesque, caught in the last motion it had made.

*** Part of what I remember is definitely the Sacrifices Arc, Hawthorn being Pansy's mother name - with blood magic. It must be another story that comes with the weird name from the centaurs, and freeing the dementors back into nightmares, goblins were also bound to gold and he was working on freeing them from that too.

  We came from nightmares, long ago, from the dark shadows that lurk at the edge of human souls. [...] You could consider yourself setting right the balance of nature and magic in sending us back.

His special name from the centaurs is "vates", first mentioned in second story.

**** This does all happen in the Sacrifices Arc.

/Vates/ has already been mentioned above as his title. As have the dementors.

The goblins are bound to Gringotts and gold in a web.

The thing I remember most about this series (and was a bit of awesomeness in each case) was the need for a willing (self-)sacrifice in order to destroy each horcrux.
