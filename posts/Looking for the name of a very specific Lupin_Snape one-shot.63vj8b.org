So some weeks ago I read this Lupin/Snape one shot and I've been trying to find it for three days but I can't. The information I have: it was a one shot. It was NSFW. It contained bottom Snape and a very dominating Lupin. I think it probably took place during PoA. Lupin is at Hogwarts (probably teaching) and goes to Snape study/bed room. It says it only took him five minutes to get through the wards. He finds Snape sleeping, and is surprised that Snape sleeps naked or partly naked. Snape has a half-empty wine glass on his nightstand and is sprawled out holding his wand, in his sleep. I think when Snape wakes up the Lupin POV observes that he already had a jinx/hex on his lips. The conversation I can't remember but I think Lupin says something along the lines that Snape obviously wanted him to come by and that the wards were so week that Snape could have easily put rose petals on the floor leading up to his bed.

Honestly, I don't care for the smut that I briefly remember followed, I just found the author's take on a sleeping Snape so extremely endearing so I've been dying to read it again. I've been looking through my computer history, searched through ff.net and aao3 but I can't seem to find it at all. Please if anyone has any idea which fic I mean, please help? My guess is that it is around 3k words or so, if not shorter.

If it's not okay to post fan fic search feel free to remove this, I'm just desperate to find this fic that keeps haunting my mind.


** I've been searching over an hour for this... at first for curiosity, but then it was just about the pride of the thing. I think I've found every snupin fic BUT yours, and have read more about "a certain potions master"/"everyone's favorite potions professor" and "the scent of arousal" than I thought I would this evening. Godspeed in your fic hunt, friend. I was unsuccessful.

** I love Snupin fics but this one I've not read. You could try asking over at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]]. But most people on that sub are over here too so I don't wanna get your hopes up.

*** I'll give it a go, but I'm slowly starting to fear I might never find it again, haha. Thank you!
