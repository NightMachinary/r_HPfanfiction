Mine is Loose Canon, I love the mix between social life and Quidditch and feel it's rather well written. It also didn't go down the epilogue route which had Harry be an auror and have a family with Ginny which allows it to explore the world a lot more.


** I've said some reasonably nice things about Loose Cannon but it needs to start getting to the fucking point soon. You can't keep churning out chapter after chapter and hope that everybody just goes with it: sooner or later a story has an ending.

My personal favourite postwar story has been linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7). In fact it's my favourite full stop. It amuses me that it has always been described as "slow-burn" and yet to stories like Loose Cannon, it's a flash-in-the-pan.

At its most basic, it's a story of two people helping each other to heal, although it takes one of them longer to realise that's what he needs. But the story is far more than that. It's a tale of friendship, growing-up, challenge, intrigue, relationships and... ballet. It's probably true that this story ruined the fandom for me because it's so damn good that very, very few stories now stand close to it in quality.

*** I personally enjoy the fact it's just sort of ambling along, no end in sight. It's a story which deals with his life and life doesn't just end all of a sudden and in my opinion, there's still a lot of places it can go. There's a bunch of loose ends which means the plot will never get dry I find. To me it's a great fic and I'll be disappointed when it ends... although it will mean I don't have to wait for updates any longer

That said, TheEndless7 has to be in my top 5 authors, I love his Quidditch fics and other!

Iron and Gold was kind of my Magnum Opus of Quidditch. I'm not sure I can top it and I'm not sure I even want to try.

Something more like Twelve Days where it's in the background is a possibility. But I don't think I'll write a whole lot more on pitch Quidditch.

I've toyed with the idea of remastering Vitam Paramus but I doubt I'll do that either.

**** I subscribe to the story too, and [[/u/manatee-vs-walrus]] deserves a lot of credit for keeping it going, for keeping it interesting and for the general quality of the writing.

But. (You knew that was coming) I think it works right now purely because it's episodic. We know that once a week we'll get a good-sized update that's pretty enjoyable to read. And that's great. I tend to listen to it in the morning while showering and getting dressed, and it cheers me up and sets me going far better than listening to the radio with yet more reasons how Brexit is fucking my country.

It's just coming up to 1M words now. Once it's finally done, will I want to read it again? That's the mark of a great story.

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the updates and hope to continue doing so. But I don't think you can keep a story going indefinitely. You need a goal.

Spoilers: It always fucks me up when I get to the end and I realise that there aren't actually any 'good' guys and that both groups are as bad as each other. Because of the way the propaganda efforts are written it seems like there's a very black and white picture of good and bad throughout most of the story.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13724079/1/What-We-Lost][What We Lost by JacobApples]]

Although I can't recommend this link. JacobApples seems to have went through a mid life crisis. Purged all of his Potter fics. Then hastily scraped them back together in gigantic unedited one page disasters. In the name of becoming a published author.

If you can live with that then you may enjoy this one.

It's Harry/Andromeda where Harry happens upon her in a catatonic state due to trauma of losing her family, only coherent enough to take care of infant Teddy's needs. Harry steps up being a Caretaker to both of them. Hilarious misfortune finds Lucius Malfoy multiple times through the story.

** I think timeless is my favorite, a Hermione and Draco setting where Draco travels through time. And how can Hermione turn down a mystery to solve when she gets asked if she wants to help. It's drama, fluff, no real action and a tearjerker near the end. [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13722174/49/](timeless)]] I put in the story in the link

** Love Loose Cannon, it's just a nice chill fic about people living their life. It was one I was definitely on the fence about when starting to read but it has creeped up amongst my favourites for sure.

Someone else has said Strangers at Drakeshaugh already so I'm gonna have to say either linkffn (4152700) or linkao3 (6334630)

Both fics which are recced a lot on this sub but I've read them quite a few times and still enjoy rereading.

** The Purpose of Wings by Charlennette is about Harry/Fleur with a really compelling mystery. The romance is really refreshing and the romance sublime. I'm a massive fan of the story and will rec it to anyone who likes romance but especially post-war fics. This is a bit different in that Harry and Fleur are settled and older (parents) to two daughters. I think they are late twenties in the story?

I'll second the Grow Young with Me and Strangers at Drakeshaugh recs, those are also lovely!
