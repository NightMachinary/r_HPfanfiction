A bit of a shower thought, but right now I'm trying to get my own fic off the ground. And It just feels like a lot of fics are basically reusing the same materials. So...basically title.


** The Arithmancer series has a very interesting view on wizarding Academia, showing how new discoveries are published.

** For all of the drama and angst in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] did a very good job on their worldbuilding.

- A real distinction between Dark and Light magic and what it means to be Dark/Light wizard. Even 'Grey' if you look at it long enough.
- What it means to be a Dark and Light Lord.
- An exploration of pureblood culture that's not limited to /Muggles are shit and mudbloods are stealing our jobs/. The Walpurgis 'festival', the courtship between Harry/Draco, 'dueling' between two people, and even the connection between purebloods and their manor.
- What is House elf and other magical creature really is.
- Magic 'awakening' on someone's 17th birthday.

There could be more, but that's all I remember.

** The concept of blood adoption which basically allows a witch or wizard to adopt a child magically and have their appearance change as though the child was actually theirs biologically.

Magical creature inheritances that aren't veela inheritances.

** During Harry's time at school Magical America was in its own version of the Summer of Love

Because of her daughter's shenanigans Rowena Ravenclaw enchanted the Ravenclaw boys dorms to eject any girl who attempts to enter instead of vice versa like in the other dorms . The Ravenclaw dorm bed are enchanted to materialise a book at the foot of the bed based on what the occupant dreamt of the night before.

The Wizarding school in Nepal also accepts half human half Yeti hybrids

*** Honestly the stairs always bothered me in canon, as does +Hermione's slightly smug remarks+.

Edit: I checked the actual quote, she actually dismisses it. It was some 4th years that were unbearable. I have to give credit where it due.

Why? If the students want to get up to "no good", they have an entire castle to do so. And with transfiguration, you can turn every room into a love suit within a few minutes. The stairs are a token effort at best.

***** Being able to work around the rules does not take away from the rules being there.

I can use a VPN and tor to get around censorship and monitoring, but the fact they hypothetically are irks me.

In canon it's used as an almost as a throwaway joke. The rule is just awful an awful throwaway.

*********** It's one way. It does not prevent the boys' dorm from being the location of said activities. Honestly, I could see both genders being unable to interact with each other in their dorm rooms if you're going by 1000 year old standards.

More trustworthy is what gets me. Sexual relations are a 2-way activity.

It's not even an important plot point, but it's just a throwaway piece of humor.

if there was a change, I imagine it would be to extend the slipery dip stairs to both genders
