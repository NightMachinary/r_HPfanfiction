*WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HPMOR BECAUSE EVERY TIME IT'S MENTIONED IT TURNS INTO A GIANT CIRCLEJERK OVER HOW AWFUL IT IS AND I'D ACTUALLY LIKE SOME DISCUSSION.*


** Can't remember the title at all, but it was a H/Hr fic. Anyway, so Harry is all moody because reasons, Hermione goes to comfort him, some magic happens because the plot says so and they pass out. When they wake up, they're soul bonded and are now /Lord and Lady Gryffindor/, own the school and have all the money (also they're married), they go to the common room, Ron says something g snarky to Hermione and Harry decks him because /defendin' muh woman/. At this point, all the Gryffindor girls slide off their seats because possessive wife-beater tendencies are just /so hot/ and all the guys now defer to harry for being the obvious alpha. This was all in the first chapter or so, at which point I nope'd out of there.

**** Yeah, I pretty much only read Drarry that's either very AU or set post-Hogwarts. I like to think that when they're a bit older and they've gone through the war and all, they'd have grown up a bit and gotten over their schoolyard rivalries, or are at least capable of doing so over the course of the story. Trying to pair them up in school requires too much of a complete about face in their attitudes toward each other. Pretty much the same applies to Dramione, though I have read some set towards the end of the war where Draco defects and is forced into hiding with Hermione.

I mean, exploring gender and all that is great, and some good points were made, but there are better characters to do that with, and definitely not all of a sudden after like 20 chapters with zero lead-in or relevance to the main plot.

** *Spoilers* for /Written in the Body/. I stopped reading it when I got to the part where Hermione manages to discover and prevent a brewing war, all in the space of one chapter. It felt to me like it was just filler, and not really connected to the plot at all. The story itself, while based on an interesting premise, is incredibly long and there are many paragraphs and, in some cases, whole chapters, that could be completely cut out. And that's not even taking into account the extremely heavy Ron bashing. I can take some bashing if it advances the story or is in some way useful (and IMO it's rare when an author can make that work!) but I do not need to be told every few paragraphs how horrible Ron is as a romantic partner and as a friend.

With that said, it has been extremely hard for me to find even halfway decent femslash, so I'll probably finish it at some point (it's still sitting in my "Currently Reading" folder).

Now comes the morning after Halloween, about the third chapter or so and Harry gets up early to wait in the common room for Hermione because she "stuck" with him. It suddenly turned to Crap as they tell each other how they fell in love with each other on first sight at *age 11*, how they didn't say anything then because they knew Ron would be jealous and hateful *after knowing him a full five minutes*, and how they suddenly don't care what anyone else says.

To stay on topic, I'll try to make a contribution.

I try really really hard to like Luna Lovegood. Unfortunately >90% of her dialogue is just her spouting patently absurd conspiracies that none of the other characters really react to in any meaningful way. None of her motivations, choices, or the consequences of those choices receive *any* exposition. It's like a law about her character or something that I haven't fully figured out. Imagine if the 7/7 or 9/11 "truthers" were never challenged about the ridiculousness of their claims. So the first time a fic has Luna using Blibbering Humdingers or Wrackspurts as an "explanation" for someone's behavior I just hit my browser's back button.

Whenever she brings up these creatures in canon, there's actually a reason for it (to her) and it's very consistent. Nargles steal things. Wrackspurts are invisible creatures that make your brain go fuzzy. So unless she's talking about them in that context, it doesn't make sense.

In a story in which the mainstream opinion is proven to be unreliable and bigoted, having a protagonist on the fringe like Luna is really great. If even Voldemort's origins are explained, turning Luna into a one-trick pony is a disservice to the whole story. I could only permit it in a parody, especially a parody of other fanfiction.

**** You bring up a good point about the differences between canon Luna and how she's generally portrayed in fanfics. I hope my comment comes more across as a critique of how she's generally used in fanon.

In my more cynical moments, I am tempted to view canon Luna strictly in terms of how she's used in two specific moments: on the journeys to and from Hogwarts. In the first emo!Harry is generally dismissive and worried about what others will think of his interactions with Luna. After the Ministry Battle, introspective!Harry sits with her on the train and has an epiphany about how great his friends are. So in that sense, Luna only serves as a "mile marker" for Harry's own character growth.

But mostly, though, I agree with your assessment that she's a complex character with a unique backstory and I'm glad that JKR wasn't afraid to introduce a new character (relatively) later in her story.

** Monotheistic Religion (when plot-unrelated) .

I mean , they are wizzards and witches aren't they? By default their culture is mainly deriven from the druidic one , so if they have a religion or if religion matters in the magic it has to be pagan one. Hell the existence of druids can be argued to be strong evidence about the falsity of many other religions.

So when an author goes on with a story that pretty much transform itself in pure biblethumping i just close it and never open it again (i've had a bad experience with a particuar lockhart self insert but it's beside the point).

Oh and yes , still related , *Hell* (christian or otherwise) is just a despicable idea , i mean you can be Hitler or Voldemort but infinite suffering is still immoral even if you presonally tortured millions of people the damage you did is still finite , ethernal torture is still unfair.

*** I can answer a bit of this having done a fair amount of research into the people living in the area at that time.

The earliest reference about Druids comes from Julius Caeser's account of landing in Britain in the first century BCE. Caeser only succeeded in establishing a beachhead in the area after several failed attempts. He was just coming off of a very long and successful campaign against the Gauls and was probably very surprised by the hostility of the native people of Britain. Frankly he didn't stick around long enough to learn anything about the culture of the people he encountered and it's very likely that he just made up everything he 'observed' about them. The fact that he *survived* a trip to Britain was enough to gain him a lot of attention when he finally returned to Rome. The natives were notoriously hostile to any foreigners.

Even if there /were/ such a people like the Druids they almost certainly had no idea of the purpose of any of the megalithic structures around the area (Stonehenge, Woodhenge, the Thornborough Henge, Pentre Ifan, etc). The earliest of these structures show significant homology to celestial events of the time. One of the these examples - a tomb in Ireland began in 3200 BCE- is absolutely aligned with one of the equinoxes. Many of the ones following afterwards do not. The most likely explanation for this is that the people who built the first structures died out without being able to communicate to later generations how they achieved an advanced understanding of astronomy. Many of the later structures were probably just copycat construction.

Tl;DR: Druids are probably a fiction and neo-pagans haven't done their research.

In the context of the Hp world i guess the megalithic structure are really important magical sites and they are obviously connected with "magic" and the "supernatural" (which is an oximoronic term since everything that exist is natural by definition) , that's an easy explanation why a religion wouldn't stick in such a culture : why they would believe something "on faith" if they see clear evidence of something that contraddicts such faith?

We do know that quite a few wizards are buried in the graveyard next to Godric's Hollow's church. Religion doesn't feature in the books, but the culture of the magical world is recognisable enough to assume that it evolved in tandem with the muggle world.

The real England was Catholic for like 800 years and C of E for another 150 before the fictional statute of secrecy went into effect. There's no indication that Rowling's lands had a radically different history. They have Sundays off -- what clearer influence of Christian culture is there? Oh, right. Draco's home for the Easter holidays in Deathly Hallows. That is even clearer.

I don't particularly care for proselytising in any story, but Harry running off to church is less far-fetched than some imagined druidic mumbo-jumbo. The culture is very much secular, but it's still basically Christian.

  Obviously in time muggleborns would have brought in some elements of christianity in , it's pretty obvious.

You said they defaulted to a non-monotheistic pagan religion and the existence of paganism rules out other religions. If this were true the Purebloods would never stand for another muggle religion seeping in.

****** Ture they wouldn't stand for it , but they would have no way to make it impossible (i guess going into an obliviation spree to delete christianity is pretty useless and wastefull ) . I mean probably they have "Christmas" because it's the way muggleborns call it , and purebloods just use another name for the same thing (Yule or something).

I guess that "magic" itself would be a religion of some kind , they have good evidence of an afterlife (even if it's not strong evidence) the veil ghosts etc. which doesn't seem to have christian attributes so they probably just put it together other "muggle sillyness"
