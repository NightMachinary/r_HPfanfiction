:END:
Okay, so I'm not entirely sure what all goes on, I read the story a bit ago. But basically what I do remember is that Hermione (I think either because of the Troll in first year, or being petrified in second year) is sent to Beauxbatons by her parents because they think it's safer, and they have family there to make sure she isn't alone. Her and Harry are really close friends, I don't think Ron was included in the friend group in this one.

Harry may have been in Ravenclaw, I'm not sure. I think Voldemort or someone in his circle (maybe even Dumbledore, who knows) makes it to where students have to go to the same magical school until graduation, so Hermione is forced to go back to Hogwarts, and is happy to see Harry, but also misses her other schoolmates.

This might have happened during Goblet of Fire, because I remember her being happy to see her classmates again, and talking to them in French.

Thanks for the help! If you have any more questions about the fic I'll try and remember anything else that would be relevant.


** It's not The Arithmancer is it? Although Harry was still in Gryffindor and I'm pretty sure she was still pals with Ron, that's just the first one about her being sent to Beauxbatons that came to mind!

*** That was my first thought as well, but it can't be the Arithmancer---unless two or more fics got fused in the OP's memory, which happens sometimes.

** As someone else says, this /mostly/ sounds like Arithmancer, but if you read that you'd probably remember it. I don't remember quite how Hermione gets back to studying at Hogwarts. While at Beauxbatons she is allowed to temporarily visit Hogwarts for the Triwizard tournament and iirc she stays around afterwards. She might not return "for real" until the 2nd volume, which I didn't read.
