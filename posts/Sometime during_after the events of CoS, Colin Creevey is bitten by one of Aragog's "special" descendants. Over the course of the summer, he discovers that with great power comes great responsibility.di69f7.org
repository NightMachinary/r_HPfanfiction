I.e. Colin becomes Spider-Man.

Due to the fact that the spider is different, e.g. magical in nature, rather than genetically-engineered or radioactive, Colin has a slightly different powerset.


** Oh I like it! Colin is also showing up everywhere with a camera, just like Peter Parker. Instead of obsessing over Spider Man, though, the Prophet drools after Harry Potter, and Colin becomes his personal photographer. With his abilities, he can keep up with the golden trio and never really feels threatened.

I can just imagine a Jameson type character in such a story. "Creevy! Get me more shots of Potter! That boy is a menace to society!"

******** The explanation is that spiderlike humans have a unique life force that connects them to the web of life and destiny which connects the past present and future over multiple multiverses and is woven by a specific spider totem.

Basically all humans who have spider powers are considered spider totems and have a literal connection to fate that allows them to predict the future to varying degrees.

** He discovers he needs more than a week to learn his new powers and abilities and over the course of months decides he has no responsibilities whatsoever outside of being a student, son, and a big brother. Everything else can go its merry own way without him sticking his nose in others business or playing at super heroe like a certain other idiot Gryffindor.

Colin is no charity worker, his dad taught him the value of good work and pay for his effort.

And so it came to pass that there was no magical spiderman but there was a magical reporter that was even better than Rita at getting good scoops and he never resorted to fabricated news or sensational crap.
