I'm looking for fanfics that have powerful Harry in a big brother role. He can have a younger brother or sister who looks up to him. Preferably, he has whole family but I'm okay with fanfics having siblings only. Off the top of my mind, I can think of something like The Potters by zaterra02. Any fics with good sibling dynamics is appreciated.


** Depending on how you feel about Master of Death Harry and time travel Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is has Harry who is reincarnated as the older brother of Sirius and Regulus

*** There's also another fic that has the same basic plot inspired by Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by a different user who got permission from original writer. Fic is on both Fanfiction.net and Ao3. However, Ao3 has more chapters. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922][The Heir of House Black]]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.

  AU. Harry, just another normal Hogwarts student with no evil whatsoever plaguing his life, really likes Hermione Granger, who won't even give him the time of day. How is he going to win her heart? By being a complete tosser, of course. Boys are idiots.

** Linkao3(Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai) has a really wonderful sibling relationship with Harry as the big brother.

Fair warning, it is a Voldemort/Harry fic - but it only happens much much later in the fic and it also kind of makes sense in the context of the story. I'm really not a Tomarry shipper at all, and I didn't realise this was a pairing, or I probably wouldn't have even picked the story up. But by the time I realised it was happening I was actually so into the fic it didn't matter at all. It's very AU, very well written and very focused on character, especially Harry and his relationship with his younger siblings and parents. If that's what you're looking for I would definitely give it a try.

** ...I'm going to have to rec [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And the Shipgirls]] ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][Thread 2]]) ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-goblet-of-feels-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.772633/][Thread 3]]) in which a young Harry gets adopted by a Japanese Battlecruiser (yes, you read that right...) and raised in a Japanese Naval Base, gaining a younger sister named Hoppou (who is an Elder Abyssal Installation Princess) soon after.

The fic starts out somewhat non-linear and slice-of-life, but it does build up. Harry gets a magic teacher in the form of a Miko (Shrine Priestess) who happens to be a Kitsune, he gets a pet snake who is far, far more than even she knows and he gets a solid education in addition to all of this.\\
And when he goes to Hogwarts, he gets a couple of new friends, a red-headed chess prodigy (who is studying to be an Engineer) and an undercover Shipgirl.

However, this Harry is not immediately the second coming of Merlin. His progress, while far greater than in canon, is still believable. As the primary Author noted, Harry will grow up to eventually be greater than Merlin but he has to grow up first.

**** To address the points in order.

1. The story is so big that it has overflowed the Spacebattles thread not just once but twice. This means that it can be thought of as Part 1 (pre-Hogwarts/Years 1+2), Part 2 (Year 3) and Part 3 (Year 4/in Progress). Hope this helps.
2. Yes, it's a crossover with the game/Anime Kancolle where manifestations of nightmarish warships attack humanity and can only really be countered by the avatars of human warships (aka Shipgirls).
3. Yes, it's Spacebattles. You can use the buttons at the top to switch to Reader Mode (threadmarked posts only), use the in-post navigation buttons to skip the comments or look at the comments between story posts as several of the posts can help explain the background details.Spacebattles uses a different format to FFN, AO3 etc, being far more interactive. This can lead to problems with the more sensitive as it isn't a hugbox, glaring errors and the use of the Idiot Ball will be pointed out. Repeatedly.
