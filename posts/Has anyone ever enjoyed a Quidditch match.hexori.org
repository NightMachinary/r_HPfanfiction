In surprisingly many fanfics I've been reading recently, there is this obsession with detailing all that happens in a game of Quidditch, not only in school matches, but random pickups at Weasley's as well.

WHYYYYY

In canon either: the match is skimmed over, barely mentioned, or: something wacky/plot relevant happens, like the dementors or Lockhart 'fixing' Harry's arm, or: the commentary is what makes the match, as in the case of Luna or when the Slytherins were blatantly cheating and Jordan went berserk.

Otherwise, reading about a sports match with pretty bad rules which is fairly hard to visualize and partially pay2win is just plain boring.

Dear writers, have your matches have a point/entertainment value or just don't bother. I don't need to read ten paragraphs of irrelevance and then someone catches the Snitch and the story continues.

*** Honestly, that's the way to write Quidditch. Back in the day, radio commentators got dozens of people to gather around one set. So basically all you have to do to write good quidditch is to copy what football commentators used to do, or what they still do.

** There has only one story where I actually enjoyed the matches and that was this big fourth year story. There were a lot of different cross-school competitions aside of the 3 big tests, including this big, sponsored quidditch tournament. Pretty sure it was a Harry/Fleur story. The training and matches is a big part of the story and is really detailed which makes it worthwhile to read them.

** Well, I'm into sports in general, so I'd like to read Quidditch matches, despite the nutty rules and scoring system. Could be fun.

But I rarely come accross well-written sports scenes in general, and Quidditch is not an exception.

Sports scenes, it's not the action that matter, they're just a vessels for the emotions. Suspens, dread, anxiety, excitement, hope, anger and fear, and then utter joy and happiness. Or dispair an disapointment. Sports have them all.

You don't describe the matches for game. You describe them to elicit emotions from your reader. They do have to have some importance, thought. Also a third person POV can help a lot.

*** Agreed with everything you said. I've also been toying with an alternate scoring system for quidditch that to make it a bit less reliant on who catches the snitch.

Something like points for scoring the quaffel remaining unchanged, but in addition to increasing your own teams score they would decrease the amount the enemy team gets for catching the snitch.

So for example if the score was:

Gryff - 50 Slyth - 80

then Gryffindor could still pull a win by catching the snitch worth 70 points.

But the further along the game gets, the less value that is placed on the snitch, besides ending the game.

In a different scenario, say Gryff with 120 points and Slyth with 140, a snitch capture by Gryff would still result in a loss, since slytherins 140 points would make the snitch worth only 10.

The numbers could be tweaked, but its just something I've been thinking about.

**** I think only 50 points, so it has values but not overvalue would be fine. It worths 5 goals instead of 15, which is more reasonable as a difference.

But I would introduce the Seekers at the hour mark.

For the first hour, the other players are scoring as much as they can. The more the better. But since the game won't end suddently for an hour, you can work on more manoeuvre, try more things. It could get more spectacular for the chasers and beaters because you get to try again, so at least for the first 45 minutes, you not as afraid to miss.

AfteR hour, snitch and Seeker are released; as the match continue.

Now, chasers and beaters and goalkeeper continue to play. But the game can end at any time. And all their roles are much more important. Because you either go on the defensive because your score is good even if other team seeker catch the snitch, or your in the offensive because you do need to catch up.

****** If you want, why not.

Personally, it doesn't bother me. Most team sports I watch can end up in a tie. (Soccer, Handball, Basket, Rugby). So I don't find it that absurd that a match can end up in a tie. That's what happens in sport. Ut can add to the tension and excitement. Also to strategies. If team think they can't win 5 goals in a row, (or more) then they could decide their seeker can attempt to catch the snitch when they could be tie, and go to tie-break?

Now, we do need a way to break the tie for World Cups and over events like that, when a team needs to lose.

We could go the "five throw" with chaser and goalkeeper. But that's the easy route, Like every muggle sports do that.

We could re release the snitch and have only the seeker playing. But that could get boring very fast, if the snitch isn't seen quickly.

I'd say, just for the fun of it. The game resume, without seeker nor beater...position.

The three chaser and goalkeeper get to finally rest. The two beaters and seeker play as chasers and goalkeeper. So it's 2 chasers and a goalkeeper on each team. First team who score win.

But realistically, yeah the "five throws" are the way to got, even if it's the expected way.

**** You really don't need to make the snitch worth less, just make it much harder to catch, or rather establish the background that most matches have much higher scores.

150 is a huge amount if the score ends 200-50. 150 matters a lot less 700-450.

We're told some matches go on for days, if a team can't get a decisive margin of victory in that time then the snitch works as a decider. Test cricket lasts 5 days so it isn't unheard of for sports in Britain to last a long time.

Harry is a very talented seeker, as is Krum, that's why they tend to have low scoring matches, they end it before huge scores can be racked up.

** I am currently reading the HP series to my kids (8 and 13) for the first time. We just read, last night in fact, The Quidditch Final chapter of Prisoner of Azkaban. I felt the chapter was action packed and thoroughly enjoyable. The kids did too, which is honestly the target demographic here. In books one and two, the matches may have been a bit lacking, though Chamber of Secrets' rogue bludger match was entertaining, but for reasons other than the actual game. I feel like Rowling's writing got better in the later books and the quidditch matches got better too.

As for fanfiction, quidditch doesn't really come up all that much in what I've read, though the wildly ridiculous Naked Quidditch Match story was a ton of fun. I read it years ago though, so I don't remember if it holds up. linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match)

I *have* read good quidditch scenes, just like I've read enjoyable fights, but it's pretty obvious they're hard to write well, so I think most authors should limit themselves to JKR levels of descriptions (or less) instead of play-by-playing them.

One of the reasons why Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book is because of the whole Quidditch subplot. The team loses their first match, but they bounce back and overcome spectacular odds in order to win.

Also, skill can outmatch money, as Harry proved in CoS.

** As you say, I enjoy the ones that change the rules to make sense. Plenty of stories put interesting spins on the game, allowing for fun strategy and further worldbuilding. The most interesting ones I've seen are one story which made the snitch worth a percentage of the team's score, and so forcing the seeker to switch between chasing and seeking dependent on the score gap - and also one which which kept the seeker out of play until their team reached 100 points.

Plus, the games tend to serve as good backdrop for plot and character when you write from the audience's perspective - Ron especially gets to shine as our standard exposition device. But yeah if you don't do any of the above, the matches basically just pad wordcount.

** I've really enjoyed two of them. First was in one of the gamer stories. Harry at a quidditch match he was /attending/, grabbed the snitch and stuffed it into his pocket without anyone noticing. He eventually gets a quest to return the snitch without getting caught. Five miserable days later.

The other was a lemon where Lee Jordan was simultaneously commentating on both the match and the hummer Rose Potter was giving him.

** No I haven't, for two interrelated reasons. One, Quidditch as a sport is fairly boring outcome-wise. Either the game is close, in which case none of the action matters, all that matters is the snitch, or the game is a blowout, in which case nothing matters. Either way, it isn't intriguing to read about. (And I don't buy JKR trying to say she designed it that way on purpose as a "metaphor for life").

The second problem is that when Quidditch is used as a vehicle for another development, i.e. the dementors, it's usually either a rehash or not written well. If writer's are going to use a Quidditch scene, please focus on basically anything except the game itself. The emotions, the tension, the crowd, the political stakes, whatever. But multiple paragraphs of "Katie, Angelina, and Alicia used the Hawkshead formation to break through the Slytherin defense and scored a goal, 20-10 Gryffindor" is a snoozefest.

** The rules of quidditch seem flawed, I'm rereading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse) at the moment. The author changes the quidditch rules, I do enjoy reading the matches, they seem a lot more fair. I don't know how important they are for the plot, but I'd say there's definitely some character development. Unfortunately there's no real matches until the sequel, but I highly recommend the entire series.

Apart from that I can't think of any quidditch match I enjoyed reading, mostly I find myself skim reading them

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** People like sports in general, It a University understandable concept for a story, the energy of the stands , the thrill of a close game, Plus a lot of people that grew up in the Harry Potter mania Are either in college or beyond now and for a lot of universities They have Quidditch teams as a competitive sport so people can relate to the game more, Plus a match is a good backdrop to complement other storylines

But then again, I also don't agree that the rules are bad, that it's hard to visualise, or that there's anything wrong with dependence on the quality of the gear.

Also, Slytherin wasn't cheating, Lee is biased :3
