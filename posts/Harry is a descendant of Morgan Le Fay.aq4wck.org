I've read a lot of stories which involves Harry being related to the house founders, Peverells and even Merlin or a powerful and dead good guy, with this in mind having him instead be related to Morgan Le Fay could add a new dynamic and conflict to how the wizarding world assumes and perceives him to be like.

(And, to up the ante, she could also make visual appearances throughout the story with her appearing only to Harry or sometimes to the rest of the wizarding world as well as trying to directly or indirectly manipulate him at regular intervals)


** Umm, this doesn't fit your request exactly, but if you haven't, read linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
