Pretty please?


** Here's a list of some of the one's I have saved. Hopefully I have this formatted correctly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] by wickedlfairy17

#+begin_quote
  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter
#+end_quote

I really enjoy that one, although updates are few and far between. I think its worth it though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild]] by Paimpont

#+begin_quote
  While flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance. SLASH.
#+end_quote

Updates every few months.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8366987/1/The-Game][The Game]] by Rendered Reversed >!MAJOR NON-MAGIC AU! VolDeMort, an infamously vicious PvPer. Scarred, a ridiculously lucky warrior. HBPrince, their unfortunate priest. Together, they're the smallest of the top 10 teams on CoS Online, and probably the most dysfunctional as well... Eventual TMR/HP SLASH, pairings inside.

This one is really au and some of the characters are OOC which is a given without magic and Harry's parents living.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/1/Jaded-Eyes-of-a-Prodigy][Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy]] by Wickedlfairy17

#+begin_quote
  DarkHarry snapped early on, follow his journey for revenge. Surprises at every turn and not everything is as it appears. His search for power will reshape the world by fire and the magical world will never know what hit them.Slash LVHP Full summary inside.
#+end_quote

I use to absolutely adore this one but I didn't like the ending much less the sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] by Athey

#+begin_quote
  Two boys grow up together in an orphanage, grow powerful at school, are torn apart by death and brought back together by rebirth. Horcruxes aren't the only way to live forever. Necromancy, reincarnation, TR/HP Slash dark!Harry.
#+end_quote

This fic is probably my favorite and its complete.

*** Also if you look on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey's]] favorites, there seems to be quite a few hplv fics.

**** I think so, I've read so many fics with this pairing so it's likely. Those were the only one's I had saved though.

** LVHP? Absolutely! Here you go!

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] by Epic Solemnity. Grey!Harry (more like Dark!Harry IMO). This is an AU where Harry is extraordinarily intelligent and managed to catch the eye of the rising Dark Lord. This is one of my all-time favorites. It's phenomenal. Not everyone will agree with me, of course--some will say it's so AU that its barely LVHP (without spoiling it, their argument stems from Harry's not-really-canon parents and childhood). But I think that the world-building and characters are so wonderful that it's at least worth a try! :) Warning: It does have violence, gore, torture, dark themes, language, some smut (although the author has removed the smut from the version on fnet), and slash. COMPLETE.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451855/chapters/774989][Counting Bodies Like Sheep]] by rightonthelimit. I read this a week ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. It's AH-mazing. It's a complete AU (no magic) with creepy-as-hell zombies. Tom and Harry are partners in a post-zombie-apocalyptic world. This story is fantastic. It may be my new favorite, actually (I'll see how I feel after rereading it 15748 times). Warning: It has zombie and human violence, dark themes, gore, smut, slash. And it may make you cry. In a (mostly) good way. COMPLETE.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/419407/chapters/1714156][Horror of Our Love]] by leontina. This is an AU where Neville became the Chosen One and Harry befriended a certain diary in second year. While still a dark tale of not-entirely-healthy relationships, this story is not quite as dark as the previous two, I think. I did like it--I enjoyed the rehashing of canon, and the author's retake on Horcruxes. Warning for violence (I can't remember a lot of gore), smut, slash, and some self-harm (both discussion of it, and some committed by another character offscreen). WIP.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]] by Epic Solemnity (she is one of my favorite LVHP authors). The downside to this fic (and its a pretty big downside) is that it's essentially on long-term hiatus. The author hasn't updated any of her stories since July, and one of her other stories is her bigger priority, so this story probably will not be finished for a long time. That being said, if you're fine with reading a WIP that will take forever to finish, I do recommend it! And if you like Death of Today and this fic, you should check out Epic Solemnity's other fics, like her Deliver Us From Sorrow's Hold fic, which is a crossover but similar in theme and tone to her other stories (ie. not a LVHP but a story that has a similar feel to such a fic). With a little hunting, you can find her old, old fanfics (published under the name Lightning on the Wave, I do have the .doc versions of some of them), which are not as well written but still interesting because of her immense creativity.

Just as a side note, I found [[http://monopy.tumblr.com/ficrechp][this]] rec page on tumblr, and so far I've really enjoyed the fics recommended there. There may be some overlap, but as I haven't read everything on there, you may find some things there that I (or other people) may not mention!

I have to go make dinner right now, but afterwards, I'll be sure to add to my list! I love this ship, however dark and depraved it can be! :)

/Edit: added more fics/
