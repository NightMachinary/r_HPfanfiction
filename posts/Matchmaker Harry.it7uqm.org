Harry develops an outright obsession with romance novels while with the Dursley's (Maybe an ill-thought plan to direct his attention away from fantasy and/or anything that could give him /ideas/). As a result, when he goes to Hogwarts he starts trying to push whatever unfortunate pair he decides to ship together (as a side-note being exposed to Vernon/Petunia as an example of healthy couple plus many fictional over the top bad romances his idea of what /is/ a good pairing is kinda screwed).

Possible pairings for him to push:

-Snape/Quirrel

-Snape/Lockhart

-Snape/Remus/Sirius

-Snape/(fake)Moody/Karkaroff

-Snape/Umbridge

-Snape/Dumbledore (since he can't pair Snape with the DADA professor on sixth year)

-Ron/Bullstrode

-Hermione/Goyle

-Marcus Flint/Ginny Weasley

-(real)Moody/Grindelwald

-Draco/Hagrid

-Pettigrew/Nagini... you get the idea

EDIT: Probably the worse of all: Neville/The Leastranges (all three of them).


** I can't tell what the worse pairing you just listed is.

Battle scared Moody with one leg, one eye and 100 year old Gellert Grindewald who has been in prison for 50 years.

Proper Pureblood Draco Malfoy and a half giant 4 times his age.

A literal rat and a snake.

I cannot describe how disgusted I am at the thought of these pairings.

** The Edit bit made me laugh- like GOD NO!

And now I feel bad about it... I'm guessing they are all into BDSM...
