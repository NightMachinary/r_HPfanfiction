One that points out mistakes, but doesn't make the writer abandon all hope for his/her story. What do I include and what do I /not/ include? How do I know I'm being too critical.

Edit: Changed a few words and added a sentence after reading [[https://www.reddit.com/u/nyet-marionetka/][u/nyet-marionetka]]'s comment on this over on [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]].

Edit 2: Thank you all for your answers!


** Remember that the person on the other end of the computer is also a human. I always try to compliment sandwich my criticism

So: “I loved how you did X. I think that Y might be improved if you did Z. Your characterization of A was spot on and so wonderful to read.”

But also be aware that even if you are super kind and thoughtful about whatever constructive criticism you offer it could still upset the author. You can't control their reaction.

** 1. Remember that most are writing as an act of pleasure, vicarious thrill, or as a way of improving their writing ability. You should temper your criticism accordingly.
2. Recognize the big picture - whats the most important thing to relay to the author that you like/dislike in their work? Try to relay both subjective and objective views where possible (what is technically good vs. what is appealing to you).
3. Be concise. Waste too much and the author will disregard or likely not bother fully reading your words. This is counter-productive overall.
4. Don't just write to ask for an update. Passive aggressively or otherwise.
5. Try to give an indication that you have reasonably thoroughly read their work, and have not just been skimming and then gone to complain while missing between the lines. This makes you look stupid and is overall disenchanting to writing in general.

*** All of the above, plus my recommendation to open your review with everything that you personally liked or approved of. Make sure that the author sees that you are positively invested in their work by making a tactful comparison of what you like vs. what you think can be improved upon with a suggestion of how.

ADDENDUM: And if it looks in the next update as if your advice has been ignored, do not throw a hissy fit in your next review. Assume that all of your published suggestions have been noted and discarded. That is the author's prerogative to accept or reject.

** If at all possible, ask the writer first. "Hey, I liked your story and have some feedback and ideas. Do you want to hear them?"

Solicited criticism >>> unsolicited feedback

** Make sure to pick the most inconsequential minor detail in the story and write a 5000 word rant about it.

** In a review, I never criticize more than one thing at a time, and I always include praise for the things that the author does right.

** Well, here's the thing... Not every writer automatically wants concrit. Some will say that they welcome it, but otherwise, I feel you should ask them before giving them concrit. (But do so politely, of course.)

** Beyond the obvious constructive criticism bit, if you're going to deconstruct something the author has done, that's fine, but don't deconstruct something completely subjective if you can avoid it. I've had plenty of people bash a character or plot simply because they dislike one component about it, but they have nothing to say about the quality, believability, etc. It's just “This is stupid because it should be this way” but that “this way” is a completely subjective opinion, often based on nothing more than personal preference or a desire for self fulfillment.

** Always start with what you liked/admired.

Be specific - not I didn't like Snape in your story but I'm not sure that Snape would weep quite so much.

Don't assume that something you don't like in chapter one won't be dealt with in chapter five or even fifty.

Always comment on the story, never on the author. Always, "I don't think your Dumbledore would have held human sacrifices on the Quidditch pitch". Never "Only a bloody idiot would write this."

Don't be surprised if you get an outraged reply. Some people invest faaaaar too much in their creations

If you're interested in a conversation, signal as much but don't expect it.

Spelling mistakes can be pointed out briefly at the end.

** Be respectful. Word it so it is clear that is your opinion. Not "this bad" but "I did not like this part". Be friendly. And offer solutions to what you see as problems.

** Some authors don't want criticism, even if constructive. I've seen responses to the effect that there are no changes to correct problems - they are finished and don't want to revisit. I've seen responses that any negative comments will undermine their desire to write.

** Here's my general formula for reviews:

1. What you liked about the story.
2. What you disliked about the story and, importantly, /why/ you disliked that.
3. What the person's mistakes were *and how you would go about correcting/improving them.*
4. What good things mitigated the mistakes and/or made you keep reading anyway (it's always a good idea to end on a positive).

   - Alternatively, if you cannot find a mitigating trait, then end as politely and non-confrontational as possible and encourage the author to keep trying and practicing. You can only get better with practice, after all.

Do:

- Review the substance and structure of the fic
- Highlight both the good and the bad
- Explain areas of potential improvement

Don't:

- Attack the author, their identity/politics, or their other idiosyncrasies.
- Attack the characters, especially in amateur work like fanfiction; writers have a tendency to project/empathize with their characters, so attacks on their characters can feel like attacks on themselves.
- Make fallacious arguments. Reviews need to be logical, not irrational, and based in substantial merit than irrelevant opinions.
