** I loved /Turn/! I'd recommend checking out the [[/r/hpslashfic]] sub, but some that I've really enjoyed (all Harry/Draco) are:

- White Lies by Cassis Luna - linkffn(6029161)

- Bond by Anna Fugazzi - linkffn(2493456)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/319257][At Your Service by Faith Wood]]

And pretty much anything by Faith Wood or who_la_hoop

  (COMPLETE) Draco drinks a potion that makes him know if a person is lying, and Harry, apparently at fault that Draco is this way, is forced to 'help' him with the effects of the potion. For the first time, they deal with each other with no lies to hide behind. HPDM RWHG BZNL SSRL

** Whichever fic is the one that DictionaryWrites has about Harry being sorted to Slytherin. I only stopped reading because it seemed it was going to start focusing on the themes relating to sexuality/homosexuality, and I don't particularly care about those themes. I thought the writing was good and it was building up the "Harry is gay" thing quite well.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  When Draco meets Harry he knows he's met someone special, it just takes a while and a war for him to realise why. Drarry.
