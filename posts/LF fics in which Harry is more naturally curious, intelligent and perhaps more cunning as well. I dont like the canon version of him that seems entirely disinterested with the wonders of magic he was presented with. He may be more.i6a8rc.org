#+TITLE: LF fics in which Harry is more naturally curious, intelligent and perhaps more cunning as well. I dont like the canon version of him that seems entirely disinterested with the wonders of magic he was presented with. He may be more morally ambiguous as well.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Harry Potter and the Consequences of the Trip to the Library in Primary School:

Harry figures out easily that /he/ keeps making the weird stuff happen - after all, he keeps getting punished for it, so it must be something /he's/ doing. He goes to the library to read fantasy books and figure out which ones apply to him.

The story kind of evolves from there - it does do the "stations of canon" thing, but Harry's a lot more eager to explore Hogwarts, asks a /lot/ more questions, and ends up sorted into Ravenclaw.

linkao3(12915570) Link to the start of the series. It's complete up to Book 2.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.

** Well, Methods of Rationality fits your request as stated pretty well - he's curious, intelligent, more cunning, wants to explore what magic is really capable of, and morally utilitarian, Ravenclaw rather than Gryffindor (still with the potential for Slytherin) - but Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is also frequently arrogant and condescending (albeit generous to his few friends, and honestly committed to doing good in the world). And the story, while carefully crafted and complex and funny, is first and foremost an introduction to rational thinking, with the world of Harry Potter being a means to that end, which turns some people off.

Note that although he's partly an author self-insert, Harry is supposed to represent the author at a younger age, making all the mistakes that the author recognises he himself made at that age. (No doubt the author has now moved on to bigger and more impressive mistakes.)

I generally recommend the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.
