My google-fu was not strong enough.

I know, we recently got her backstory and it made her an even worse person.

But there are sooo many different stories, at least one should have a likeable toad.

Mainly curious how it's been done, not really interested in reading them.. ;)


** Insidious Inquisitor

But it's pretty bad

*** To me this one always seemed like a reply to the Snape apologists: "she's a giant cunt because she's a spy, so it's really all that evil shit she did is not that bad". It's obviously not true for either character. Also iirc this one ends in a sudden harem and I just ignore its existence when I discuss the quality of the story.

*** Yeah this is the one that firsts come to mind for me, but I don't think its too bad, I re-read it every blue moon if I'm bored but it is kinda generic for the tropes/cliches it uses I'll admit

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] by Seel'vor, but it's less a redemption and more of a she-was-never-really-all-that-bad fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]] by Materia-Blade is a very interesting take on a soul-bond fic that includes a redeemed(ish) Umbridge as a sub-plot.

*** Too bad it's completely abandoned. It's the only H/HG soul bond fic I've ever found that's worth reading.

**** True, though I am much more fond of his Worm fanfics, so I'm happy that he is working on those instead.

** Dunuelos has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/57/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler][2 parter]] from his Lone Traveler series that deals with an alternate reality where she doesn't grow up to become the nazi toad we know. All of Dunuelos' lone traveler stories are pretty good btw.
