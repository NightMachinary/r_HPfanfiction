Edit 2: Thank you to everyone taking the time to read, give advice or just generally be helpful. It's clear \i have a lot to work on and as such \i've removed the story for now. Once I feel it has been refined enough I will upload it again. Thank you again!


** Okay. So why should I read it? You don't have a summary here, and the summary on ffn is not really compelling.

A lot of star wars fics/crosses get super angsty and stupid with the dark side, when they're /evil/. Too many authors are obsessed with it. By putting it in your title, that worries me. The actual title itself helps my worries, by implying that he won't actually be evil, just worrying about others, but I don't know.

So ultimately, sell me on your story first. I'm sorry, but without a good summary, I'm not going to actually open the first chapter. Summaries are vital. People do judge books by their covers. Sorry. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Quick edit: A good summary is like a trailer, it shows a bit of plot and why you should care. Your summary is like a teaser: it seems like it could be interesting but contains no information/information that could apply to many fics and doesn't ultimately narrow down why I should care.

*** That's okay, thanks for taking the time. Edit:Again thank you, tried a different summary that has somewhat more to do with the plot than short utterances. Appreciate the tips, if you can keep them coming all the better!

**** It's definitely better, but it could also definitely be improved. I have no idea what Tython is. I'm guessing that it's one of those live through the history stories, but in star wars.

Something feels derpy about the later part of the story part of your summary. Besides the question, that is. You might notice that summaries that have questions tend to be bad. Stuff like, will he defeat the winter king, can x prove to y that he really loves her. Stuff like that, that seems like it would be read in a dramatic movie voice. Your question is a ton better than stuff like that, but something feels off besides that. I dunno.

I will say this: you've upgraded your summary from pass, to save to read later, cause I plan to get around to it at some point. Whether I actually do... Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Next step up is reading it immediately.

Take what I say with a grain of salt. I feel kinda bad commanding you to rewrite your summary, especially without other comments or without being an expert/author myself. I do read a lot of fanfic though.

I genuinely plan to get to your fic at some point. Expect to see my username in your review section eventually. Though it might be a little while.

***** I don't mind the commanding bit, it's actually good advice. I am by no means an expert writer and it shows on both the summary and the story itself I'd say. I mostly posted it to get the opinions of people who read a lot of fanfic so i can gauge approx where I need to move with it, whether there's enough suspension of disbelief, more dialogue, narration, stuff like that. Not knowing what Tython is for example is already telling me I might be on too obscure waters. Personally when I don't recognize something in a fandom I look it up but I realize that might be a stretch when every second word might as well be mandarin.It's probably better that you don't read it straight up because at right now the DarkSide-side of things could use a lot of improvement, displaying motivations and actions instead of just showing their results. Thanks again for any advice you have, always good to hear from someone out to help!

****** Really, actually posting is a huge step, even if it isn't great. While I do some writing aspirations, even getting myself to write is a pain because I'm a perfectionist. I know it's possible to read good examples, and see if my writing is good compared to that, but that takes a ton of effort, so I don't even get myself to sit down in the first place. That's ignoring actual work and other stuff too. It's worked well enough for doing schoolwork in college though, rather than making study groups, though I know I should.

It is good to ask other people how you're doing, even if it isn't 100% necessary (though it is necessary at higher levels).

Regarding readers not knowing, that's fine. Think about original fiction. Readers know nothing. You just need to introduce stuff right.

Also, (I say this not having read your fic yet) but one of the best pieces of advice is show don't tell. Figuring out how that applies to every bit is important. The best fiction makes you feel like there is a world with actual people, that have motivations and are complex, not words on paper.

******* My biggest problem is I'm just as much a perfectionist. I keep rereading and analyzing the SW crossovers that are considered the best, like Havoc Side of the Force, Discordant etc... and trying to analyze their "formula". But I keep hitting that roadblock where in my head it is clear what happens why and I believe it is perfect. Then I realize it can't be. That and my rush to get to the scene I keep in my head. The next milestone so to speak. So I posted it basically to see what mistakes other people find so I can try to correct them or clarify what's what. Normally I wouldn't write either but with the holiday season over I found myself with a lot of time and not enough that I enjoy doing.

******** Yeah, you're at the point then where it's right to share.

A difference between you and me is that you found writing as something to do whereas I just end up finding something else and procrastinate instead (in this case, a five year old Mario game).

Advice maybe: instead of rushing to the next scene, outline all the ideas you have first, then write it out. Then, although it sucks, iterate on previous scenes and revise them. I've found in writing that continuously making something better is a lot more successful than rushing forward and hoping for the best. Don't get stuck, though, because with some authors, all they do is rewrite the same chapters and never post anything. It's a balance between improvement and getting your work out there. Lastly, remember that the difference between an amateur and a master is that the amateur is proud to make one decent work and hates throwing it away, while the master makes many decent works and loves no individual one. Don't worry about throwing bad work away. (Though I don't think that's your problem ðŸ™‚.)

I'll definitely try to read your fic at some point though. Also, do you read the advice in [[/r/writing][r/writing]]?

********* Up until just now I was unaware of its existenceðŸ˜‚. I will get back to those chapters and work on them, I just don't want to end up with a large endless jumble of words. I've read too many a fanfic where they keep running circles around the same thing over and over again and wanted to avoid getting too... wordy, if that makes any sense.

** As a purveyor of HP/SW crossovers, I gave this a whirl. I'm currently writing chapter 6 of my new hp/sw fic, so I am curious as to what other people are working on.

First thing that stands out to me is the title. What does it even mean?

Continuing on, barely 30 seconds into the story and you're already talking about wards. That's a gigantic red flag.

Then, it's revealed that Harry has the Elder Wand. How is that possible if Dumbledore is still alive? Secondly, you say that Harry has droves of power thanks to the wand. The wizard makes the wand, not the other way around. Still, that's a red flag to me as well. Like, personally casting spells like a buffoon, just because he can? What's the point of even writing sentences like that?

So at this point, it seems like this fic is eschewing any form of nuance and instead just going for the generic, uninteresting route. But in the interest of fairness, I continued on.

Next thing that pops out at me is the idea that instructors at this Cairo school are allowed to use the Cruciatus for disciplinary reasons. Why? To make the story more edgy? And, that's not to mention the existence of this school to begin with.

I don't get the duel. Seems out of place, and it was over in a blink of an eye. And, Harry lost. So, does that mean he's no longer the master of the Elder Wand?

After that, there's a couple hundred words analyzing the duel. Boring and dry.

So at this point, one thing has become very evident to me, and that this Harry is extremely OOC. He comes off as petulant and entitled. He sleeps through classes. He knows that being the defeater of the Dark Lord gives him power. And he just comes off as a crybaby when talking about the 1 second duel.

From here on out, and into the second chapter, it stops reading like a story. It reads more like an outline. Decades pass in one sentence, next sentence describes some power ups, rinse and repeat. In the span of a couple of paragraphs, cities are created and the ancient jedi order is formed and battles happen and Harry and Dumbledore are immortal.

There really isn't much to say. Timeskip. Timeskip. Timeskip, chapter 2's done. It's just a mishmash of disjointed battle scenes that have almost no meaning to people who haven't drudged through endless pages on Wookieepedia.

This story has some very major flaws. From the very beginning, the story lacks focus. Everything seems like filler so far. But, using the word filler suggests that there is a beginning and an end, and I'm just not seeing it. After all this, all I'm seeing is that Dumbledore sacrificed himself, and Harry's body disintegrated and now his spirit is wandering. You know what that sounds like to me? That sounds like that should be the beginning of the story.

Like, why bother with the Cairo stuff at all? It's not very interesting, and the only bearing on the story it has is to show that this isn't canon!Harry. And in chapter 2, we're pretty much stripped of any semblance of anything that feels like the HP Universe. Magic has already been replaced by the Force, and other than using apparition, this barely feels like an HP crossover at all, and Dumbledore and Harry both feel like pretenders wearing their names.

I can take some guesses as to where this as going. But the issue is that reading about the minutia of anything is going to be really boring after thousands of years have already been skipped by, without really establishing any of the character as anyone we should care about. Like, should I care if some named character from the original trilogy suddenly comes into contact with the spirit of Harry? If /that/ was chapter one, and all the earlier stuff was the hidden intrigue that the reader learns over the rest of the story, then perhaps. But that's not what this is.

*** Hello! Thanks for taking the time to write! As discussed above even these two chapters aren't really finished and serves more to find flaws like the ones you encountered. The timeskips are intentional since I wanted to establish a background for Harry in the SW universe to get rid of the veil-of-death or random spaceship landing as a way to get him there. The character adjustment is, while intentional, you could be right in it being poorly done. As said in the discussion above I've certain scenes in my mind that I rush to get to when previous ones could still use tons of work, like descriptions of things I'm aware of but others might not be. The story's lack of focus I think is due to the fact that, as you said, it is only the beginning of it. It was basically one long prologue cut in two to cut down words per chapter. Thanks for your time! Edit: do you think it'd explain more about the story, characters and title if I finished the entire thing and posted the proto-fic in its entirety, then refine it? Or just root out the problems chapter by chapter as they arise? What do you usually do?

*** Thank you! the story was posted so as to test the waters and I've taken it down to work more on it and hopefully improve upon all the flaws the people above pointed out. It's true that looking at it from an outside perspective it was kinda all over the place and I need to adjust my writing to account for the fact that readers don't have access to all that's going on in my head. Once again, thank you for your interest!
