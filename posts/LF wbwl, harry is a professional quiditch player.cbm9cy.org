His parents ignore him, they favor his younger brother. He's playing quiditch in school, and some people take interest in him, he does tryouts for the team (puddlemere I think), and he makes it into the team. And they play professionally. I think he catches more than the snitch. (he also catches bludgers etc.),.

After his debut its everywhere in the newspaper. And his parents are suddenly proud and want to talk.

He gets to know his brother more, calls him brat as nick name.


** Is he a Ravenclaw and dates Fleur? Then it's probably linkffn(6864381). Or it could be linkffn(7017751). But I don't think he's a seeker in either, though. Hmmm...

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
