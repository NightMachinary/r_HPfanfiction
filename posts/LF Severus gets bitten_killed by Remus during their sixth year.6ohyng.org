Hello, I am wondering if anyone has a fic that uses it as a point of divergence?

And am generally interested what anyone's thoughts on that is. How would Lupin deal with it? Will marauders fall out? Will Sirius feel guilty? Will Dumbledore get sacked? How will snape handle being a werewolf?


** Considering Snape is the one that told about the prophecy... would Harry and Neville's parents still be alive?

I honestly think Dumbledore would try to cover up the fact that it was a werewolf.

Actually scratch that, I think James and Sirius would have covered it up (and Dumbledore would probably let them get away with it) but Remus would have left school afterward and maybe taken his life or something after some years as an alcoholic.

*** I can definitely see them covering it up and it would probably be easy - didn't Barry Crouch Jr transfigure his father's corpse and bury it? Maybe they even hide it from Remus. Good friends help you move, great friends help you move bodies. Depending on how one characterizes the Marauders it could be an emotional turning point for good OR bad.

** I recently read one where he's bitten. linkao3(A Wolf to Potters)

Dumbledore will definitely cover it up, because reporting Sirius for attempted murder means Snape expelled, Lupin expelled, and Dumbledore sacked. I suppose the marauders could go either way. They might try to be better after that and support Lupin, they might fall apart and blame Sirius for everything. Both makes sense. I think the most interesting point to think of is that if Snape got bitten and couldn't tell Lily, their end of friendship could be even worse than canon, leaving with him even more reasons to be dedicated to supporting Voldemort. And on the other hand, if he could tell Lily and she didn't drop him because of that, it could drive him away from becoming Death Eater, with the possibility of werewolves not accepted as a proper DE.
