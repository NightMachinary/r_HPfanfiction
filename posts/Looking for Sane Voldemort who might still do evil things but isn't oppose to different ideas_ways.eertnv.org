Even if it's not 100% like the title I was wanting, all I really want is a more sane Voldemort, really.

I'd rather Harry still be on the Light side, even if he's not necessarily on Dumbledore's side.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione If there are these pairings please not have Ron bashing if possible.

No Weasley Bashing

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** Oh, thought of a second one. It doesn't really go anywhere before ending and is half fluff, but linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen) features a more sane Voldemort who sends Harry to a different dimension and then splits his time between conquering Wizarding Britain and picking Harry's brain on various things. It features Voldemort reasoning with Harry and listening to Hermione about the power of Muggle society.

This story features a Voldemort that becomes more sane over time and a MasterofDeath!Harry that is perpetually reincarnated to defeat different versions of Voldemort over and over again. Harry is intrigued by this particular Voldemort and remarks several times how different this one is from the others he has defeated.

The author said it's going to be HP/LV but it hasn't quite gotten to that point yet. It's a WIP that is regularly updated and I have been following (and recommending) it since it started.

(I also generally recommend this author - I've read their /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ , a BWL!Neville which was one of my favorite Harry Potter AU fics and I'm working on another one of their fics right now (/Practicing Liars/ a Drarry Severitus which I am enjoying in spite of myself) while waiting for this one to update.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.

** One fic idea I have is Voldemort, by the idea of a Death Eater, being willing to beat the Order at their own game. A secret DE causes someone on the fence to join, not the Death Eaters, but the Order, with the premise of thus getting a backdoor into it by being this person's close, seemingly complete benign, friend.

** Oof, I'm so close to a perfect recommendation, but it's Harry/Hermione. If it's not a deal breaker for you, linkffn(Honey by Mark Geoffrey Norrish) features a more sane Voldemort who attempts to convert Harry to his side, or at least away from Voldemort's side. Without spoiling it, I'll say it's definitely not a black and white, good vs evil story. I don't remember any bashing in the story and I like to think I'm sensitive to it.

*** How is it? I'm fine with Harry/Hermione, as long as Ron isn't bashed... I just tend to stay away from Harry/Hermione on principle because authors like to bash Ron if they write Harry and Hermione together.

**** Totally understand that, I feel similarly. It's been a while since I read it, but from what I remember it's a lot of Harry interacting with Voldemort, as well as a mystery about what's really going on in the Wizarding world. I think Ron is portrayed as being super chill about most stuff and just wanting to be a good friend to Harry, but he doesn't get involved in the larger mystery.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/178070/chapters/261970][The Hush of War]] has a Voldemort who grows more and more sane as the story goes on, and although it's been a while since I read it, I don't remember any Weasley bashing in it.

Summary: Voldemort has made a bargain with Harry to stop killing muggles and muggle-borns (when at all possible, of course) in exchange for Harry's cooperation. While Harry thinks he's using the time to find a way to defeat the Dark Lord, he will realize that Voldemort is always one step ahead, and so long as he isn't killing anyone...what's the big deal? He has bigger things to worry about now, anyway. Includes dementors, pureblood culture, the prophecy, what exactly happened with Lily's sacrifice, magical breakthroughs, children Death Eaters, and portraits of family.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.
