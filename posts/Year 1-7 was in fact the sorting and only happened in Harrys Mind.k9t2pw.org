Just imagine that everything that happened in the time until harry takes the second killing curse to the face was just the hat sorting him. Everything was constructed by Harry's Mind

He dies everything becomes white and suddenly he finds himself back sitting on the stool beneath the sorting head. The Hat's mouth drops open, closes again and then he goes "Mr. Potter.... I gotta admit you have a very disturbing Imagination... and how do you even know some of the people you imagine? Well never mind lets just get this over with... better be" and out for all to hear he shouts: "Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute - ALBUS GET THAT BOY SOME HELP WILL YOU??"


** HAHAHHAHAHA I LOVE THIS. And it would be even better if it's all the truth like harry is a seer or something and now they dont know what to do because by the time they know it was the truth it's to late and Voldemort has the stone and now what was the future is no longer what it should have been

** ‚Äú.... the hall was slowly starting to get louder. The reason? It was three AM and they still hadn't finished the sorting. A Ravenclaw had run to the library and came back saying they had surpassed the former longest sorting by at least TRIPLING its length.

As everyone was ‚Äòjust power napping' at the tables, one boy was having the weirdest dreams. And the worst thing was, he wasn't dreaming alone! The hat that was covering everything from his nose upwards was experiencing this also! The poor Sorting Hat was, for once in his existence- at a loss for words. Those that had been awake when ‚Äòit' happened would all agree on one fact: the hat was shocked and slack jawed.

‚ÄòAll was well.'

‚Äú....I must say Mr. Potter... that was the most batshit crazy thing I have ever experienced. I have half a mind to ask Hogwarts to retire me. What the bloody hell is wrong with you?!‚Äù

The whole hall went silent. The hat was speaking his ‚Äòthoughts' to the whole school! They saw the boy under the hat start, and then whisper something, but the hat was having NONE of it.

‚ÄúChild I have sorted some of the most insane people to EVER walk the earth and even then, I was able to think of something. My god I don't even know where to put you now!‚Äù The hat yelled, before twisting his brim in thought.

By this point, the staff table was worried. They could hear the hat mumbling things like ‚Äònorbert' and ‚Äòhorcrux' and ‚Äòhallows' in between a myriad of very impressive uses of curse words. Finally the hat groaned and sat up straight.

‚ÄúThat's it. I can't do this right now. Try again next year son. For now I place you IN THERAPY!!‚Äù With those words, the boy under the hat was transported to St. Mungos, where for the next year straight he wrote all that he and the Hat saw, into a large book series. It would sell them to that lady he saw in the coffee shop Dudley loved, and he'd laugh all the way to the bank in royalties.

All was... well enough.

** The Sorting Hat essentially used Legilimency and "broke" through a mental barrier in Harry's mind that was keeping his Seer abilities back so all the things he should have seen previously came rushing out all at once. Now, he must solve the mystery behind this mental block and escape from Santa Rosa.
