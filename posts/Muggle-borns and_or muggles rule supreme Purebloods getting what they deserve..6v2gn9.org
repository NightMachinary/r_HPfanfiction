The story must be well-written and no slash. The fic needs to illustrate why you shouldn't mess with muggles and muggle-borns, yet doesn't show them in a /completely/ villainous light.

Bonus: The wizarding world has been transformed to be more technological and equal.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** If I recall right, The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig linkffn(7135971).

The muggles are somewhat rightfully against wizards and witches after a young woman is raped and oblivated, sparking a massive war that the wizards lose, badly, and they attempt to flee with the titular starship Hedwig.

No one's really right in it, muggles overreact perhaps, but considering the implications of wizard criminals and mind wiping... Could they really have risked it? Especially as they probably figured out/the prime minister probably eventually told everyone about the corrupt ministry and Voldemort
