It's a new and creative idea that I find interesting and captivating, shipping Tom R. Sr. and our One and only, Hermione G.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter][In the Bleak Midwinter]] is an excellent comedy fic that seems to be heading that direction. linkffn(13013582)

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Tricked into holding what she'd thought was a broken time-turner, Hermione was sent back to 1926. She was stuck in time and lived in the Leaky. While struggling to build a new life, an odd couple caught her attention. No way could a man love such a woman so intensely, right? A simple answer: Love potion. Little did Hermione know that she was intervening to the newly-wed Riddles.
