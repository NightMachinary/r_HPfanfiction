*** Yeah, one of the basic paths i came up with has this OC kind of turning into the light's Tom Riddle, with the twist that a "good" Tom Riddle would basically just be a low-empathy, ruthless, kind of well-meaning, tyrant (Dumbledore's approach and Voldemort's ego and relentlessness, basically)

** I have this one where a wizard family returns home from the camps umbridge setup to torture muggleborns to find their home, store, and so on destroyed. It's essentially a song fic based on fort minor's Kenji but it depresses me so much whenever i sit down to peck at the idea.

** Mine is a "negotiator" of hiding society built on ideas of meritocracy, symbiosis, honesty, personal and collective development. Notice that human-ness and the like are not mentioned though...

But hes not really negotiator, he was sent away because of some acts that, being not forbidden yet, put him in category of "counter-productive for both sides to keep him here". So he takes his associate and goes on a looong recruiting mission on big continent.

He is locked between inner morales(which are still encouraged, just optional), rules of prev society and rules of new society. That is a first line of story, how they clash and which one of three wins where.

Second is him actually doing stuff: whom he recruits, what researches are made, and how all of it interacts with books eventline.

** I have a OC for a Hogwarts future story knocking about in my head.

In my previous (now completely lost ðŸ˜£) draft, she was a gray Slytherin. I have a tragic outline formed in my head, I just need the backstory for her now.

I'm kind of nervous about putting it down on paper, so I'm focusing on my Auror Gregory House character. (Not a cross over, just based on that cerebral +snarky+ asshole character)

** If the oath is strictly not to hurt Harry, you could have a villian who did a lot of terrible stuff, but who flees from Harry to not risk the vow. Since something like by blowing up a wall causing bricks to fall on him would probably break the vow. Depending on the vow's wording, he could still have his henchmen go after and try and kill Harry.

** That's a very interesting story. And to be honest I feel it would be more straightforward to make this a Delphini-is-born-early AU rather than make him an OC boy with still more or less the same role... but hey, your story. I'm interested either way.

As for me, I don't exactly have anything like that in the sense that I /have/ put my various OCs in my story already, or have a good idea of how and when I will do so. For instance, I have an alternate Defence Professor called Alexander Max (who is sort of a scarier Professor Moody who's /not/ a villain in disguise; his thing is that he likes Dark lore a lot, finds Dementors fascinating, etc.), a Boggart-turned-human called Maximilian Candy, etc.

*** Funnily enough, i didn't even know of Delphini's existance :p

Still, after reading the wiki, she does have a few key aspects that go hand in hand with the caharcter i have in my head. But also some pretty big differences. One being, for example, that my char is more alike Tom Riddle from the flashbakcs rather than Bellatrix or no-nose Voldemort. Another that he's loyal towards his genitor simply because he was made to be. Remove that enforcement and you have someone groomed to be like a megalomaniac/sociopath realizing they'd abused their whole life

It's basically a story about a mind-fucked person who was never given the chance to be his own person, and resents that. Actually, since you mentioned boggarts, the shortest way to explain all of this is saying that his (boggart) would look like Tom Riddle, with the implication that his biggest fear is not Voldemort himself but turning into him

Have you published your stories? If so, could you give me the names? I'm reading a lot of OC fics these days, and i especially found myself liking the ones with OCs as Professors. Must be quite a pain to do, tho, since Professors are kind of incompetent in canon

**** Delphini turned out the way she did from never having /known/ either of her parents, and being raised in their late shadow by a harsh, borderline-Dursley-like guardian. My reasoning was that it's quite imaginable she'd turn out how you describe your character if she had been born earlier, and thus, /raised/ by Bellatrix and Voldemort.

And yes, I have published the story with all those characters; linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor).

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

** I have a couple OCs kicking around. Haven't found much time to write about them though.

The first is a muggleborn Ravenclaw whom, due to tragic deepest lore, ended up developing an obsession with perfection. Everything she does is revolved around the goal of perfecting herself. However, she eventually wants to extend that goal to the rest of wizarding society.

The second is a replacement History of Magic professor. She's immortal and was present throughout history to be able to witness events personally. She uses a pensieve projector to show battles and other events that occurred, given to her by old friends and students that were present.
