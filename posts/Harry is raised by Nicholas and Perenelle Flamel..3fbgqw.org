So the Flamels have protected the philosophers stone (and the resulting wealth) for centuries, likely have extensive magical knowledge and apparently live a life somewhat excluded from the magical world.

Seems like an excellent choice of guardians for the boy who lived.


** The Thief If Hogwarts by Bluminous8 is pretty awesome and has mentor/guardian Flamels.

*** I really don't believe in this trope of immortality making people not care about anything. We all know that we and everybody we know is going to die, and even really old people who have seen lots and lots of friends die care about their remaining friends or grandkids. And for every death immortals would see, they'd also see that much more life, so I just don't think they'd somehow become numb and uncaring. Maybe some might, but not in general.

The idea is plausible enough for a premise, in any case, and fresh.

Not sure this is what you're looking for, but it has a great HP/Flamels dynamic. I'm pretty sure it features a fully grown Harry Potter dimension traveling, and the Flamels become technical guardians, but they're more equals. If I remember correctly the Flamels also fit all your details. Be warned though, it's pretty good and has a nice length, but it's unfinished and the last update was in 2013. It's at the top of my "please update" fics actually.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?
