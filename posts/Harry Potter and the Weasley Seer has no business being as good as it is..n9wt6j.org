It takes a completely crack topic and makes it fascinating. It has one of the best final battle scenes I've ever read. It makes the final battle between a very powerful Harry and a understandably over powered Voldemort seem believable. I cannot recommend this fic enough!

** That fic sounds like someone who is on Felix Felicis 24/7. And everyone knows about it so they actually listen to the outlandish "prophecies"

** Agreed. I can't exactly tell when the fic went from being crack to having a real plot.

*** I think the explanation of how magic worked was believable enough and there was still some work involved for Harry to become a "powerful" Wizard

** Been reading this on and off for most of the afternoon since I saw this, and I'm absolutely loving it. It was clearly started as a crack fic, and still has elements of that even pretty far on, but it's mostly serious and fantastic throughout

** I started reading this thanks to this thread and love it so far. :) Only about halfway through as I'm doing it in between other stuff, but I'm enjoying it. And actual development for Ron, so that's wonderful. :)
