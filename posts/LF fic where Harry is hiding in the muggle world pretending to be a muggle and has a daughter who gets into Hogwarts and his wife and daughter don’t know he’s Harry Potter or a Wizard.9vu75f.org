Title. Iirc his daughter starts writing letters to him as Harry Potter when she gets to hogwarts but doesn't know because he uses a different name in the muggle world ao he starts giving her everything he owns as Harry Potter. Also Hermione and stuff were trying to cover up the ‘bad' events of wizarding history like removing dementors from all books and sources.

Thanks

Edit: I also remember his wife ended up falling down the stairs in Hogwarts and dying

** This fic's writing is terrible. It swaps between first person and third person so quickly I get dizzy.

*** I wouldn't use those exact words but I'll say the author seems very young and enthusiastic and I'm a little whiplashed already and I'm only in chapter 1.

**** Honestly if Harry had wanted to escape Wizarding Britan, he could easily have gone to America or some other English speaking country. That way even with magical children, he'd just send them to Illvermony, instead of Hogwarts, where the likelihood of running into painful memories was absolutely 100%.

I'm sure there's some excellent fiction to be mined from this premise (Harry spurned by wizarding world, leaves for Muggle world but has to face the fact that his children have magic), but this author and this fic don't do really that IMHO. The incredibly heavy handed way he deals with his daughter while corresponding with her as Harry Potter, the way his wife just flat out dies towards the end, the frankly stupid way Hermione of all people acts, etc etc

** It's not often that I read a gen fic. I actually don't remember a single other one I've read in 10+ years of constantly reading fanfiction, since I'm a romance reader pretty strictly.

But holy fucking shit, this is one of the best fics I've ever read, and I'm glad you found it. Absolutely astounding-- I just read it all in one sitting, and I'm sad that it's over.

*** REJECTED lol.

But seriously, this is a request thread. As in, they wanted to know the name of the fic so they could read it.
