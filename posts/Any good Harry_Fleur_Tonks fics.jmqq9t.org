Any rating, preferably complete and long, but any length is fine.

I'm reading The Horcrux Hunt, and quite enjoy the pairing so far, and am curious if there are more fics that use this group.


** Most of the fics with Fleur AND Tonks tend to be Coven stories. Not sure why that is. By far the best Tonks story I've come across was one where Tonks is an Unspeakable. Harry Potter and the Summer of Change is the fic. Harry ends up a bit OP... but he earns it. Little bit too much tit grabbing, but it does go with the story. Not that there's anything wrong with (consensual) tit grabbing...

Have you read the big Coven fic? Either the "clean" version or the not so clean, maybe a tiny bit too weird version? The second one is called "Hermione's Furry Problem" I think. Not sure I'm comfortable with a full on recommendation for that one. But I DID read it. So there you go. There were some cool concepts in that story.

*** Sorry, is the name literally â€˜the big coven'? Otherwise, yeah, I noticed that as well. I have hfp on my reading list, I'll get to it eventually, but yeah, it's a bit of a shame people don't play with this group more.

**** Sorry, the one I'm talking about is Moments in Love. If you intend to read it AND Furry Problem, you should know that there is a fair amount of repetition. I read them in that order, and took Furry as a rewrite with the same core concept but extras sprinkled in.

Links are against the rules? I see a ton of them here and they are awesome. Kind of the whole point. Trying to see if the bit will find this one for us. Anyway, this story is by Gandalfs_beard,

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

Been awhile since I read it but I enjoyed the take on Tonks, as having a slight mania like Bellatrix, and being excited at a duel.

  Fleur and Tonks' plans for the future get derailed. Now they are pulled into Harry's hunt for horcruxes. How will things go with an Auror and a trained Curse Breaker along? Rated M for language, mild violence, and sexual situations.
