  “What's this best friend [Tracey Davis] like, then?”

  “Awfully genuine, and probably the least Slytherin person in Slytherin I know, all years included. She isn't particularly dramatic, which --” Daphne frowned -- “I'm pretty certain the Sorting Hat puts students in Slytherin based on their dramatic potential.”

  Iris thought of Draco Malfoy, Daphne Greengrass, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, Salazar Slytherin himself putting a basilisk into his own stone head...

  Especially that bit in the graveyard with Tom Riddle. Or the Chamber. Those moments with Voldemort were probably some of the most awkward conversations she's ever had in her life. “Ah, woe is me, Potter, for I was born in an orphanage, left wretched and destitute...”

  Wasn't he like seventy at this point? Why is he still monologuing about his childhood? And what was she supposed to say to that?

  I'm very sorry? Maybe get therapy?

  Iris thought of her newfound riches and how she could probably have footed Voldemort's humongous therapy bill.

  “Iris?” Daphne said, interrupting her reverie.
