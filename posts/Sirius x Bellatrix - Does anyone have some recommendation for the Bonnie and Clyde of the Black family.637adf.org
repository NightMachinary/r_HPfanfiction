I know, I know... Its weird 'cause they're cousins. Doesn't matter!

I've read the oneshots "Bright Young Things" and "All The Unsaid Things". Both great in vibe and mood. I also wrote my own BellaxSirius fics, but didn't have the time to further explore those stories.

So, I'd be interested in actual, long fics featuring those two together for whatever reason. No matter if they're abandoned, as long as they're a few chapters long.

Super-mega-bonus points for complete fics. I highly doubt they exist, though...
