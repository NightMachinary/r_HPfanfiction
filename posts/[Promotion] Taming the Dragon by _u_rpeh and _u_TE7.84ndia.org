Though not yet posted, sources tell me famed FanFiction authors, [[/u/rpeh]] and [[/u/TE7]], have begun collaborating on what is being hailed as a sweeping romantic epic, tentatively titled "Taming the Dragon." [[/u/TE7]], who fiercely supports intimate pairings in his stories, has let slip that Taming the Dragon will be of a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger nature! This comes as a pleasant surprise as the community that advocates such a couple has been navigating an arid landscape of new stories featuring them. Indeed, [[/u/rpeh]] tells me, "We [[[/u/rpeh]] and [[/u/TE7]]] discussed at length the pairings that are less common in fanfics, and Charlie/Hermione was the one we picked!" The wacky duo is enthusiastic to break ground on this highly-anticipated tale. "I already have six chapters outlined," [[/u/TE7]] tells me with a large smile. "I'll be sending them to [[/u/rpeh]] soon to see if he agrees with the direction I'm taking!" No official date has been given as to when Taming the Dragon will be published. Stay tuned for forthcoming details.

****** Considering I have never played DnD and have absolutely no idea how to write a campaign or any idea what so ever what would be involved with it and that it's something I don't want to do at all, and want to do even less knowing the amount of research and effort I'd have to put into it just to even understand the rules.....

A lot. Far more than anyone on the internet is going to pay me.

*** It isn't ever going to happen. We trolled him a bit on another thread because he asked me to write a Hermione/Charlie story and I would literally rather shoot myself in the head while shoving rusted nails into my eyes than write a story based around any sort of pairing.

This was his response, which I'm assuming was mostly to troll me. I did not provide said quotations and highly doubt [[/u/rpeh]] did either. I debated reporting it but figured that if I can't take a little trolling then I shouldn't do it myself and decided to just shrug and talk about tacos.

** I'm not famed for anything, let alone being a fanfiction author. Well... the London Enlightened hate me for making their lives difficult in Ingress, but that's as far as it goes.

In case anyone missed the original thread and is taking this seriously: No. There is no story. There will never be a story.

Quite apart from anything else, with all the grief I give [[/u/TE7]] about his writing, there's no way on this or any other planet that I'm giving him any of my writing to critique.

** I think it's really interesting that [[/u/TE7]] is taking the time to announce this new story. It must mean he's winding down on Limpieza de Sangre and is preparing to finish it. Which is great and kind of makes sense, because he said in another thread somewhere that he was going to go ahead and finish that story with an epilogue pairing of Harry/Male!Bellatrix which seemed like an odd direction, but who am I to argue with genius?
