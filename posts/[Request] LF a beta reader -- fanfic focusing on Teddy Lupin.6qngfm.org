Hi everyone! I'm looking for a beta reader or just someone to give feedback on my first fanfic. It's about Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts: his evolving relationship with Harry, him coming to terms with his heritage, and the prejudice which still exists in the wizarding world.

The first chapter is here: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12594590/1/]]

Message me if beta'ing is something you might be interested in doing? Or just any feedback is really welcome. Thank you all so much!

EDIT: Or any advice on how to find a beta?


** Just had a read. Feels quite nice to read, flows relatively well. Bit hard to pull strings with the first chapter, but keep in mind that, obviously with the main plot being the mysterious murders, that you have sub plots to tie into it to keep the reader entertained.

I really like the interactions between Victoria and Teddy, highlights how Harry wants Teddy to have the childhood he didn't have, with Victoria being Ginny and Teddy being Harry.

Looking forward to updates, just don't fall into the trap of letting Teddy jump over every hurdle without scraping his shins, character development will be the main driver for this story.

I have a feeling that your plot with Teddy dealing with his Godfather's spotlight will be /much/ better than what Cursed CHild tried to pull off!

Can't wait to read more :)

*** Thanks so much for the offer and the review! :-D

I should have a draft of chapter two sometime in the next week.

You've hit on what I am most worried about/want most to execute well. I think the biggest thing I'll need from a beta is feedback on pacing of the plot and character development.

Oh and in response to your q on the review -- Andromeda does remind Teddy that his mum was a Hufflepuff, but I think he just has too many other expectations/fears to be fully aware of it.

*** That would be wonderful. I should have a draft of ch 2 sometime within the next week.

Is it taboo to have two betas or anything like that?

**** Don't think so - since you really aren't obligated to take anyone's advice unless you want to. But I like where this is going and am glad to give as much input as you'd like.
