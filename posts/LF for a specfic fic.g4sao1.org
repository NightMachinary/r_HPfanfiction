:END:
I can only remember a single scene from this fic so

harry throws a pin, which he made from a matchstick in transfiguration, into draco's eye after draco threw something inconsequential at him then draco took it up with snape and harry argued that draco's word wasn't enough but snap ignored him so harry said drace had attacked him multiple times in class, even though draco didn't, and then snape asked for proof to which harry replied isn't saying something enough proof. Then he said draco had tried to stab him with a massive sword right here in the great hall as this was during mealtime. Then snape said we were all witnesses that it didn't happen to which harry said you need witnesses now?

It's a kinda long scene but if anyone knows this fic pls tell me


** you just wrote half of it. add some actual dialogue and you'd have it.
