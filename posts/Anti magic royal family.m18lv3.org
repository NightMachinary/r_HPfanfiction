Are there any stories where the muggle government particularly the royal family are the bad guys and working against the magical world? Like the opposite of blood purists that view muggles as beneath them. Muggles view wizards and witches as evil or beneath them.


** No fics that I know of, but here is a little prompt of mine:

[1933, Minister of Magic Hector Fawley's Office]

Minister Fawley: Did you just say that the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, knows about us and hates us?

Deputy Head Auror Perseus Scamander: I'm afraid that's the case, Minister. If he becomes the new king of Britain, which is likely to happen over the few years given his father's poor health, he might threaten the Statute of Secrecy, and will certainly add more complications in our fight against Grindelwald. We cannot rule out that the prince might be even under Grindelwald's influence.

Fawley: By Merlin's Beard, that's the last piece of bad news I need to hear today! But since you are here, I assume you have something planned and need my approval?

Perseus Scamander: Yes, although that plan is my own idea, and even my immediate superiors don't know, because it has to be done in utmost secrecy.

Fawley chuckled a little and asked: And what is this top secret plan?

Perseus Scamander: An MACUSA Auror friend of mine volunteers to adopt a Muggle identity and love potion the future King. She will keep him under constant surveillance then. She will also create a scandalous identity and hopefully prevent him from becoming the King. But that's uncertain since his brother, the Duke of York, is a stammer and generally seen not befitting of a ruler.

Fawley: Can you help him?

Perseus Scamander: I haven't talked to the healers yet, and I think this needs to be done discreetly and gradually too, as not to evoke suspicions among Muggles.

After several minutes of contemplation, Minister Fawley spoke up again: You have my approval, Scamander, but you will not get anything formal from me. Should things go wrong, I reserve the right to disavow any knowledge of it.
