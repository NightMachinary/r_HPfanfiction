** My pet peeve is when writers say â€˜Harry's POV' or something like that. Like I understand it's sometimes necessary but when its in the middle of a paragraph or something like that its annoying.

****** It's been a long time since I read those, but if I remember right the story had huge sections dedicated to each POV and intertwined them just enough to keep them related but not whole relying on each other till the end. Same deal as the lord of the rings. I wouldn't mind finding that more in fanfiction, but usually I find the quick bounces between the good guys and the bad guys explaining everything that's gonna happen in the next chapter. Not only does it spoil the story incrementally, I honestly couldn't give two shits about what the bad guys are doing if it they aren't directly influencing or interacting with the main characters in a given moment.

My exception to hating POV switches in fanfiction though will be if it's a story that focuses on multiple main characters that are usually interacting in the third person and the POVs only follow those main characters individually for the sake of furthering the action of the plot.

**** Do you mean switching POV as in first person POV that switches from person to person, or as in third person limited POV that switches from person to person? Because switching POV in third person limited is a pretty standard storytelling technique, while switching POV in first person POV is jarring.

Third person switches are acceptable, depending on the story, when the switch happens at the chapter point. If it happens mid-chapter, I'm probably out.

I don't like reading first person stories at all and I'm not here for POV switching at any point.

Did reddit eat your symbols or did you really mean a white space? Because just an extra line can be confusing as a scene break and feel accidental, and reddit is not the only place that eats formatting, which is why many writers choose actual words as scene breaks instead of symbols.

** a new paragraph still including the same quote. I don't really know writing rules, but it bothers me. a quote should stay in one paragraph. unless the person is telling a long story. but like two sentences should stay in just one.

speech in italics. some people do this instead of using quotes. it's especially bad if it's a 3rd person view and then also thought are written in italics. it gets too confusing to read. people should just learn where on their keyboard the quotes are.

speech in quotes /and/ italics... (unless it's parseltongue, that's perfect for it. that way you know it's parsel and not normal speech and you also know it's not thoughts.)

paragraphs that are too long; or too short, where each sentence is a new paragraph.

I don't like parseltongue in bold tbh. I think it should be italics in quote. or single quote. just as long as it has its own formatting. I also think of italics by themselves (no quotes) as thoughts. that's kinda universal in most fics. I just don't like bold, and it should be reversed for articles.

not really a formatting peeve, but it fits. when it's not clear from the text who said what. or who did what. eg. talking about two males and it goes "he said..." but you can't be sure which one.

I kinda like this formats:

"speech"

*articles*

/"parseltongue" or/ /'parseltongue'/

/thoughts/

'quotes inside quotes' (could also be in italics)

/emphasizing a word/

** My two pet peeves:

1. Listing whose POV it is after a scene break. Just put the name in the first paragraph, and we'll know!
2. "Flashback" and "End flashback" labels. Just like the OP says, if you properly use a formatting change (italics are common/standard), these are completely unnecessary.

When I see otherwise talented writers use these, it really frustrates me because they're so close, and yet so far.
