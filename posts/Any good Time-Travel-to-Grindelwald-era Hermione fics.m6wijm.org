Lately I've been thirsting for a time-travel fic that involves HG going back to the 'set' of FB. I have not found anything. I've even considered writing one myself, but I have never written anything, so I don't know ðŸ˜‚. I'm looking for a story in which Hermione goes back in time to that era and helps in the fight with Grindy, probably interacts with Tom Riddle junior, etc. Something along the lines of 'Altered destinies' but a bit more updated in terms of cannon. If anybody knows about one that would tick that boxes I would appreciate it! Thanks!
