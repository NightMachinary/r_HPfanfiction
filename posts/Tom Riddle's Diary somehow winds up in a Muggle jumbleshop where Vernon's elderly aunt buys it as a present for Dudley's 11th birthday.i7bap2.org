** Lucius had heard about the new raids, and how Mad-Eye Moody would be coming out of retirement to lead them. He couldn't even begin to risk his collection of dark artifacts and he was far from foolish enough to try to store any such items in Gringotts.

No, he had found a perfect way to make money off those idiot muggles and keep them far away from his house for now. He had found a muggle shop that would keep them in safety and pay him to do so! They called it a pawn, as in the chess piece, a fitting name. Where they would hold his items until he came back for them.

What foolish beings muggles were!

He wasn't worried about his items and waited patiently for the raid to come. It would make it all the easier to force through a few changes in the Wizengamot after they found nothing.

Marge was in the back of Troy's pawn shop having an afternoon tea as they discussed possible buyers for her newest litter. She loved to poke through the items on pawn, she could find some of the nicest gossip on these shelves.

She saw a box that had just came off pawn, it was filled with many rather strange objects but the Diary at the top was really nice. Made of excellent leather, fine vellum pages, and the binding was still wonderful. She noticed a lovely brass nameplate on the front. She was sure this had cost a mint when it had been first purchased. The thing was empty, excellent! She needed something to round out the presents for Dudley. She would give it to Vernon, he could take it in to work and score the name off before adding Dudley's.

Vernon had thanked his sister for the presents and said of course he would care for the book. Soon as she had left he snorted and threw the book at the freak.

"Throw that garbage away, like Dudley needs a diary! No sir, I'll not have him being some pansy boy!"

Harry nodded and rushed out the room. He stuffed the book in his pants acting like he threw it away. He had wanted a diary for ages but knew better than to every ask for one.

He hide it in his cupboard and made do with his chores.

That night he took out a pen and started writing in the journal. Of how he hated his family, how he wanted to not have to do so many chores. How it was not his fault that freakish things happened with him!

Then something even more freakish happened! The book wrote back! It said it was a special magic book that had been made in secret by a wizard! A wizard named Tom Riddle! That it would promise to keep his secrets! That it would teach him even!

He wrote with Tom late into the night before finally beginning to get tired. To more he wrote in the book the greater he got a headache. He told Tom that and Tom said it was probably from working so hard and staying up so late.

That made sense, so he wrote goodnight and hid the book.

Over the next few days until Dudley's Birthday every night he wrote to Tom and his headaches kept growing worse. Tom wrote that it was likely Harry's magic unlocking itself now that he knew he was a young Wizard. Nothing that was good came free and magic always had a cost, or so Tom wrote.

He didn't like the pain but Tom was so nice and understanding. He fought through the pain every night so he could write to his one friend in all the world.

He wound up having to go along to the Zoo with Dudley. He wrote to Tom right away about the funny trick he had played with the snake and Dudley.

Tom had been really interested when he said he could talk to snakes. The headache had grown stronger rather suddenly and he had begged off writing anymore that night.

It was a ten days before his birthday when the headaches spiked and he passed out one night while writing. He felt tremendously better the next morning though his face was covered in a filthy sweat from sleeping face first on the floor.

Oddly he had to take his glasses off as everything was blurry and could see far better with them off then while wearing them.

Hiding the book he washed his face off quickly and got to his chores that day. For some reason Tom wasn't writing to him that night and he shrugged. Perhaps Tom's Magic Diary, as he thought of it, needed to fill back up with magic?

He noticed his scar was fading rather fast as well a few days later. Tom still wasn't writing back yet so he stuffed it under a floor board in his cupboard. He soon had greater worries as letters addressed to him began flying about the house.

- He finds out the Illvermorny would love to have him
- Illvermorny also teach muggle subjects and the clincher is will let him summer school there as well.
- He leaves for Illvermorny and shit gets crazy back in jolly old Britian.
- Eventually the ICW gets involved as Dumbledore gets removed from his post in backlash over losing Harry Potter to the Americans.
- Dumbledore loses his ability to interfere in ICW probes into what the fuck is going on in Magical Britain.
- Harry is uninvolved except for having to be the one to push Voldemorts baby body into the Americans Death room to make sure the prophecy is fulfilled.
- He goes on to be a teacher in Illvermorny and lives happily every after making lots of little potter children.

** It's not the same, but this fic is somewhat similar and might interest you.

Linkffn(Yes, I am Harry's Brother by Ynyr)

I can't remember the exact set up, but Voldemort ends up in a kid's body and installs himself into the Dursley household as Harry's brother. He doesn't kill Harry because he wants to figure out what this "power to vanquish the Dark Lord" is. While he's trying to figure that out, Voldemort manipulates Harry into becoming the best right hand man he can be under the guise of brotherly supportiveness.

By the end of the fic, and these are pretty hefty spoilers, Voldemort has the Elder Wand, and he's the Supreme Mugwump and the Director of the DMLE. Harry is the Headmaster of Hogwarts and the Chief Warlock and his wife is the Minister. Voldemort hasn't yet figured out the prophesied power to his satisfaction, but he's still working on it.
