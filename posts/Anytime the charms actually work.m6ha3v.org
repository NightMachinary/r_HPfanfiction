Quick question. are there any pics out there where any of the anti-theft charms that people always seem to have on things like money bags or watches or other stuff are actually shown to work? like, someone tries to steal Harry's money bag but then the charm activates and we can see the effect of it. cause I've read many books, and yet have never seen any of the multiple charms like that that have ever activated, and I dont know burned their hand off or paralyze them.


** I'm not sure if you're going to find something like that because protective charms are just, well, meant to protect and prevent theft and I think many authors interpret them as such. Although I think you might have some luck finding what you're looking for in fics focused on anti-theft curses, particularly those placed on Egyptian tombs and what not.
