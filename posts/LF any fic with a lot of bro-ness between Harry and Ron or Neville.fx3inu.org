Like any fic where they fight back to back and do a lot of bro stuff, Harry and Ron fighting back to back just sounds like it should be a thing as does Harry and Neville doing the same.

Just please don't make it slash

Thank you and stay safe

******* Wow, people really don't seem to care about this threat or something, yes it's just the flu and a fever for healthy people but it can kill people very easily if they don't have a good immune system, I don't see why people ignore the risk. Telling people to stay safe is just polite in my opinion.

Sorry for the mini rant

******** You're fine, no worries about the mini rant. Especially since my grandma and I are two of the many people it would probably be a death sentence for. Well, it might only put me on dialysis, but the regular flu or common cold has the potential to do that to me too.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.
