Like in the title. I recently read something similar where Harry was with Ginny and he helped Andy raise Teddy but Ginny didn't like it. Are there any similar plots? thanks


** Oh, can you give the link? It sounds really interesting.

** There are a couple but it is a very very minor plot arc

And a similar initial story idea but includes time travel. The Disorder of The Phoenix by JacobApples

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.

** I read one a while ago where Teddy is absolutely hated by Ginny (I mean, she's evil to him to the point of not being realistic) and whilst escaping from her trying to batter him, he finds a time turner in Harry's desk and ends up back in 1994.

I think it ends with him back in "his" time and Harry breaks up with Ginny when he realises what's happening, but the conflict over Teddy, and indeed Harry and Ginny's relationship, are minor plot points.
