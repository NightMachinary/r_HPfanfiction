I'm looking for any well written Harry x OC fanfics. I've already read Grow Young With Me, so you don't need to recommend that.

*** It's sequel is really starting off with a bit of a fizzle though, I don't really even understand why he split the story bat that point.

** Linkffn(6186581) and linkffn(6421660) both are Harry/OC, the first better than the second imo. Well written? I wouldn't go that far but the reading is tolerable and the characterization isn't bad either.

*** You and I is clearly written by someone inexperienced when it comes to sex and it shows. Two adults, both with a year long dry spell, start making out but call everything off when they realise that they don't have contraceptives. Instead of, you know, apparating to the next store/gas station and buying a pack of condoms, getting some morning after contraceptive, have oral sex or use magic for the problem. 5 years and they decide to blueball themselves even further.

Also there was a lot of strange drama, like problems with a stain on clothing. There's this thing called vanishing charm, which could be used to remove each pigment from the fabric, but like very often, it seems that the author forgets that they are writing in a universe with magic.

  Post- DH/ AU. Healer Sadie Lewis never knew that fixing Al Potter's broken leg would lead to such a profound romance with his father. Harry/OC, Ginny/Dean, all other canon intact. Rated M for later chapters. All reviews appreciated!

** I really enjoyed [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/ofc/bnw/a/0/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][A Brave New World]] - it's very different from other 5th/6th year fics. It's got a ton of interesting OC's, including the romantic interest. It's even got 3 OS's (Original Schools) :)
