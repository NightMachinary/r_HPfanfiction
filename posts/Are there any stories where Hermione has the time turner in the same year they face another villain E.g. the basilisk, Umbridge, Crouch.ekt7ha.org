If you don't know any, I guess this is a prompt!


** I have some where she has a time turner in later years, but she goes back to the past, either to the Marauder Era or to her younger Hogwarts years. Is that what you're looking for?

I don't think I've seen any where she uses the time turner to defeat any villains in the same year.

Linkffn(12783124) - Draco and Hermione go back to before Voldemort rose to power

Linkao3(3993391) - Hermione goes to another dimension and tries to defeat Voldemort.

Linkffn(13306252) - goes back to 4th year. Read author's note (lots of bashing)

Linkffn(10807718) Harry and Hermione return to first year

Linkffn(11026550) Hermione uses time turner in 6th year, but goes back to the 70's

Linkao3(13849008) linkffn(13356655; 13251214) - Hermione voluntarily goes back in time

  Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to find her way back to normality, she can't help but get involved when she realises that her memories of things that suddenly never happened could be the key to thwarting the plans of this world's Voldemort. She has to wonder, though... will she ever be able to get back to her own reality? And even if she could, would she really want to go?

  “Are you familiar with Time-Turners Miss Granger?” The question was the catalyst that sent Hermione back on a secret mission to stop Voldemort before October 31st, 1981. Her work with the original order was important, but clearly nobody relayed this to her partner. Young and not yet tainted by the pain of loss and Azkaban, Sirius Black was a lot harder to manage than Ron or Harry. When he wasn't making every situation the punchline to a long winded joke, he was making his salacious intentions well known.

  They thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters are still ruling, using politics instead of hexes. With the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, they must go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power to fix what broke in the past. Nominated for Best James and Best Peter in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  Summary: Hermione had just kissed Harry on the cheek and watched him leave with the Dursleys when she learnt that Time Travel doesn't always work out as planned. Sometimes, things double up.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals?

  At the beginning of 6th year, Hermione uses her time-turner to find Harry, but the timepiece malfunctions and sends her back 18 years instead of 2 hours...to the Marauders' era. While Hermione tries to find a way home without altering the past, she also tries to find a cause behind a mysterious illness affecting only Muggle-borns and to battle her growing feelings for James Potter.
