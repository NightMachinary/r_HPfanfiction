** I remember a fic where they showed Atomic Bomb videos to wake up everyone to reality... But I can't recall which one that was.

Here's a neat one-shot that deals with cleaning up Hogwarts as a whole instead:

*** Eeh...it dumbs down Lucius Malfoy a bit too much. Why doesn't he just go to Saint Mungos, seek out an antidote for that potion, and in the meantime call the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and bring charges against those four for poisoning him in the first place?

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
