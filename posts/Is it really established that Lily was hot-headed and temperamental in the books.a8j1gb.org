It seems like many fics describe her as a very emotional and fierce person. I don't recall the books really saying she was that type. All I remember is that she didn't like James, but she did stand up for Snape when James bullied him. But I don't believe one scene should define much of her characterization, especially when it was an extreme circumstance.

Couldn't she be a cool-headed, chill, and/or unemotional person instead (and not be a dark fic)? Are there any fanfics which portray her like this?


** Slughorn says she was cheeky. That's about the only description of her in the books that I can remember.

***** Wise not to be too close to drunk wizards.

More seriously, this is during the bit where Harry took the Liquid Luck potion to get the memory from Fudge. So he's sitting away from them because that's what the potion indicated was the best option.

**** Though it's odd they wouldn't make the leap James bullied Snape, therefor James was a hothead.

Like it seems way more logical than Lily (other than the redhead stereotype, I guess).

** She's not as hot headed as fanfics portray her to be, but she's not exactly ice cold either. She shows plenty of emotion in the scene with James, and plenty of emotion in Snape's memories.

She's delighted when she shows off her magic to Petunia, and is very upset at Snape for dropping a branch on her sister in the next memory, and at Petunia for calling her a freak in the one after that. She's a bit pissed with James and Sirius for not letting Snape take shots at James' father the first time they meet in the train. She's more than a little disturbed at Snape's choice of friends, especially when he tries defending their actions.

In the photo album Harry has, she's usually smiling and waving.

She's a regular girl.

** I don't know about being chilled and unemotional, she obviously had an opinion about many things and didn't hesitate to say them. Like when she stood up for Snape or cried because of Petunia. I don't know about hot headed though either, it was just never shown. Character wise I always imagined her to be similar to Hermione for some reason.

** No, it's not. In fact, I always assumed that many people thought of her that way because of the fact Harry ended up with Ginny (a firey, temperamental read-head). And the running joke (although based in reality) that people are often attracted to significant others who share certain defining traits of their parents.

We don't get many glimpses of her with regards to book descriptions, mainly having to rely on second-hand information (memories) providing insight into her actions and temperament. But in the glimpses we do get, if anything she seems to act more like Hermione than Ginny. An incredibly smart and bright individual, beloved by teachers, who when pushed can be quite emotional and cheeky/fiesty, and even break some rules, but for the most part is quite level-headed.

Not quite the same I agree, however, the point is that she does not appear to be hot-headed, or tremendously temperamental from the information in the books.

*** Sort of. Dumbledore said Harry's deepest nature was like Lily's. I always took that to mean his moral character and kindness rather than his outwards character. He's also a lot like Lily in that he's willing to sacrifice himself for others.

**** But willing to sacrifice himself is something he got from both parents.

I mean Lily stood up for those she loved/liked, James even put himself in harm's way to protect someone he couldn't stand

And James was often described as very loyal and forgiving towards his friends. Lily not so much.
