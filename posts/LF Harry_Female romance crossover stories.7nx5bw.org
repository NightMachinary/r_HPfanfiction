Looking for crossovers in which Harry is paired with a woman from the other fandom, and preferably stories in which Harry finds himself in the other world/universe whatever rather than vice versa, such as The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger, or where many of Kathryn518's stories appear to be heading eventually. They don't have to be romance-centric, but I'd like for there to be at least an element of it. Any crossover is fine, thanks in advance!


** Going to recommend /Something Wicked This Way Comes,/ a Harry and Etna from Disgaea fic. Totally great. linkffn(5501817)

** Not sure if you are looking for romance or just pairings but here are some i remember.

linkffn(11759933) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11759933][In all things in balance]] is a 2 part star wars crossover that eventually has some romance with a SW character. The story is pretty good but is dragging on a bit in the sequel and has been a bit slow on the updates.

linkffn(11789589) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11789589][The last hero's heir]] is a game of thrones crossover that is a bit of an adventure with some humor, harry hooks up with a pre novel/show era character and has some good messing with how things were.

linkffn(11483808) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11483808][Blood Stained]] is an avengers crossover where harry hooks up with black widow. It tries to take itself pretty seriously but comes off feeling like its written by a teenager. For all of that its not terrible just a bit more of a teenagers wet dream than i prefer.

linkffn(11388514) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388514][the last lion of house reyne]] is a game of thrones crossover also set in the pre novel era, harry is born into a family in exile and grows up learning to be a knight as well as remembering his past life. I thought this one was pretty well done.

linkffn(11132113) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113][The difference one man can make]] is a game of thrones crossover where harry lives north of the wall and has a wildling for a wife.

linkffn(11753897) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11753897][Dragon of the north]] is a game of thrones crossover. I dont remember much about this one its been a while since i read it but i think its a bit more graphic than some stories.

linkffn(9068231) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9068231][last second savior]] is a star wars crossover. If you have read kathryn's stories you should read plums as well.

Linkffn(8933408) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408][Wizard runemaster]] is another plums story, this one set in world of warcraft. I had not read one set there yet and it was amusing enough.

kb0 is a good author in my opinion and has a couple crossovers well worth reading linkfffn(10552630) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552630][harry's trek]] is a star trek crossover and linkffn(10477045) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10477045][harry potter: the avenger]] is an avengers crossover. They are not long but quite enjoyable.

linkffn(2857962) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962][browncoat, green eyes]] is a firefly crossover. This one is a classic. It doesnt really go anywhere but its a fun ride none the less.

If you are ok with fem harry i found these 3 avengers crossovers to be pretty good linkffn(10524028) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028][The observer effect]] linkffn(8311220) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311220][Blackdog]] linkffn(9935403) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9935403][Petal]].

Im sure ive read others worth linking but i cant remember them offhand.

It may not be what you are looking for but i also rather liked linkffn(9860311) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311][a long journey home]]. It is fem harry but she is thrown WAY WAY back in time and you see some of her life on the way back such as with merlin or in egypt or india.
