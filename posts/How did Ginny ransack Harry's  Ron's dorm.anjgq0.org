** I have an idea females can get into the male dorms but not the other way round. Doesn't Hermione get into Harry and Ron's dorm at some point (Christmas morning?) and when Ron questions it she says the founders must have thought girls more trustworthy than boys.

** That always annoyed me, that girls can go into the boys dorms but not the other way around. Girls have hormones and can get up to inappropriate activities as well ya know. It's not just boys.

**** Were they though? Myrtle's bathroom was a later addition as well, given the earlier "alternatives".

****** As far as she knows. Hogwarts, at least as described and depicted, uses architecture which was not around during the Founders' time by at least 200 years.

******* It changes its internal structure because magic. Why not its exterior? Did the hidden passage into Hogsmeade exist then, before Honeydukes did?

** As /y/Slytherinrabbit said, in perhaps one of the few examples of sexism in the Wizarding World (though it's no doubt an artifact of the 11th century standards of the Founders and little more). Boys can't get into girls' dormitories, but not vice-versa. Indeed, Hermione comes to visit plenty of times.

As for when Ginny found it empty, my first guess would be during a Quidditch match, off the cuff, but maybe I'm forgetting some reason or other why that couldn't work in the book.

** Its canon, Hermione shows up in the boys dorm one time and explains that the stairways only turn into slides for the girls dorms.

*** You know, now that I think about it, slides aren't particularly effective deterrents for wizards. I mean, there might be more, but there might /not/ be more, too.
