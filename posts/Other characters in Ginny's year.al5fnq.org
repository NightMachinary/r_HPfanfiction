I'm working on a fic dealing with Ginnys crowd, who are some canon characters on Ginnys year?


** I looked into this when I was writing NFO and as far as I am aware the only named ones are:

Luna

Colin Creevy

Demelza Robins

** I think Astoria is in her year, but I'm not sure that was ever explicitly mentioned. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Sorted_in_1992]] the wiki shows there weren't many year mates mentioned in canon.

** I can't recall any off the top of my head except Luna Lovegood.

I believe Zacharias Smith was also in her year, but I'm not 100%. Michael Corner is another possibility, but I'm far from certain on that one and can't look it up at the moment.

Luna Lovegood and Colin Creevey were in her year, however.

**** Yeah, I can't recall any girls at all being mentioned as in her year except Luna, so no known Gryffindors - because of course we miss the Sorting that year.

**** None were mentioned aside from Vicky Frobisher, so you have to invent some.

I came up with these, though I haven't used them in-story yet: Amy Hilditch [loud laugh, cute but ditzy], Ursula Bamlett [pinched fashionista] and Mildred Crickmer [overweight and nerdy but a caretaker like Molly Prewett]

** I ran into the same problem you did, with Ginny's year. I ended up filling it out by adding an OC male Ravenclaw and shifting Astoria into that year as well, giving me five characters in Ginny's year (with Luna and Colin).

Since Astoria has no fixed year, it works. Indeed, I don't know that she has a canon house, either - I have her in both Slytherin and Ravenclaw (since it's a multiverse fic).
