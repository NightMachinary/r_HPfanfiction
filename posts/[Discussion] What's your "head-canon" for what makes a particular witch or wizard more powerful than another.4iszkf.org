** My headcanon is that magic is chaos and it's our willpower forcing it into the shape we want. The less willpower one has, the less ability. And as it is chaos, it touches those who have greater willpower/affinity and marks them, such as dumbledore's eclectic style, the Potters' untameable hair, perhaps even Hermione's mane.

*** That's actually a really good point with your examples, how would you argue for or against Voldemort being touched by chaos? He was seemingly a picture-perfect boy throughout his Hogwarts years.

** Hard work.

Although there's no canon reason to believe so, I think the reason why Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and TMR were so powerful compared to others in the series has to do with their willingness to sit down and put in a lot of effort to perfect their spells.

*** Weren't the three of them described to be prodigies who were able to do things they weren't supposed to at a young age? For example TMR was already actively displaying signs of strong magic before he had any magical instruction.

**** Yes, from 'The Secret Riddle' chapter of HBP, we know that TMR was able to perform wandless/silent Hovering Charms and a host of other feats, many of them geared towards punishing people he did not like. In my view, JKR cheated her narrative a bit here by making TMR special by default.

I wasn't able to find a quote to substantiate the claim that AD and GG were able to perform extraordinary magic without any formal education. Do you have one handy?

***** Sorry, I can't find one, I don't have the books handy but I do remember that Albus had several of his papers published while still in Hogwarts - if Hermione Granger, the epitome of hard work was not mentioned to have had a paper published, what does it take to get one published? Sometimes I wish J.K. Rowling did more world building and went into the past of more individuals. All I know about Grindelwald was that he was expelled from Durmstrang for being too into the Dark Arts or something of that nature?

- I'm not disagreeing with you that hard work and effort should make a person more powerful magically, but it doesn't really fit in with J.K. Rowling's world. It just seems that people become weaker or stronger depending on what J.K. Rowling wanted to accomplish.

****** JKR's world building basically goes "What do I need right now for this plot to work as I want it to?" So, trying to extrapolate anything from canon is a rather shaky affair.

*** Piggybacking on this: I don't write fanfiction but I always liked the analogy that magic is a muscle, and the more you use it, the bigger it grows.

**** It's my favorite analogy, but for me I just haven't found a fanfic that used it well. How would Harry ever beat Voldemort, a man many decades his senior? Same would go for Voldemort ever beating Dumbledore.

** Knowledge, experience, wand-compatibility, and at least three polygenetic traits (yay 10th grade biology class!) limiting the ability to absorb, channel, and focus magical energy.

*** I hate how in all the fan-fics I've read, not a single one of them describe the interactions between wand types. The most a fic will do is go over how the Elder wand is supposedly made out of Elder wood and Thestral hair. I think it would be amazing for a fic to describe how different woods and cores enhance or weaken a person's magic.

** Natural Talent for (some) spells

Experience (Spells known, knowing what to use when, combat experience)

Skill with a wand (Aiming, shaping, precise casting, speed of casting, etc.)

Physical conditioning (Stamina, dexterity, dodging)

** I am personally of the opinion that the more you use a certain spell, the more powerful it becomes. This kinda makes sense due to how in canon, most witches and wizards primarily use one or two spells for combat.

** My answer's super boring, but I think it's just like real life talents. You need some level of innate ability, practice, and confidence to do well.

Innate ability (and genetics): examples would be the entire Weasley family (Head Boys, Quidditch players, good duellists, have the ability to do well on OWLs), Harry and his parents (overall considered talented, each with their specialty subject too). Like sports or music, some people have a natural affinity for one sport/instrument over another. Or maybe you can't play anything at all (non-magical).

Practice: Ron and Harry do really poorly in some classes because they're dicking around, but can do stuff really well when they apply themselves (almost straight-E OWLs, Harry learning /accio/); whereas Hermione always gets stuff before anyone else - I assume she's the type to look at spelling words before the pre-test - and overall does exceptionally because of her worth ethic. Practice makes perfect.

Confidence: Neville Longbottom is my example here. His early spells are powerful-ish IIRC, but he has a difficult time getting stuff /right./ I assume it's a confidence/motivation issue, because in the DA he's 'one of the fastest improving.' After years of thinking he's practically a squib, he probably lacks the confidence. I used to play volleyball, and I sucked at hitting because I always second guessed my timing, whether I could get it over etc.

Back to comparing to sports - I also think wands are as important as sports equipment. Using a hand-me-down is okay, but not ideal. I can play hockey with a righty stick at a mediocre level (secondhand wand), but a lefty stick (wand that chose me) brings me to a better level. I can hit a low quality volleyball, but not nearly as well a good quality one that's pumped to my preferred hardness.

So yeah, that's my boring description. I don't headcanon magical cores or natural superpowers. I just think some people are better at magic than others the same way talents work IRL.
