:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A couple years back I read this fanfic and I was wanting to read it again. It was set after Sirius fell through the veil. Sirius set a gift to Harry for either his birthday or in case he died. I believe it was a necklace or an amulet. Harry wished on it and it sent him to an alternate dimension where his mom and dad were alive but divorced and Lily had married Severus and had kids. The Harry of that universe had died in the department of mysteries. It's mostly about Harry coming to terms with being in this new reality and having a family that cares. Sorry that about all I can remember that would be helpful in finding it. I've looked everywhere and it's driving me up a wall. I used to have it saved to the old fanfiction app but it got deleted when they updated/replaced the app.
