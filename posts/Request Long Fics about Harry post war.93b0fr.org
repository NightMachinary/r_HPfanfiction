Like does he go into government? Be an Auror? Find out hes actually rich as hell and decides to peace out? anything and everything so long as it is very long and focuses on harry's life after the war. I have a long road trip coming up and would like some reading material along the way


** I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249][War Is Over]] (and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727][Inter Arma...]]) as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] (and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]]). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]] is also very much worth reading, but it does involve Dark Lord!Harry.

**** I read it a while ago so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but it starts right after the battle of Hogwarts and is about Harry joining the Aurors, and often clashing with the Ministry. (Its sequel is set about 20 years later, when Harry's kids are in school.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird]]

This author has basically written every detail of Harry's life after Deathly Hallows. Some of it is a bit bland, but it does fit your request rather well.

** My current WIP might be of interest to you. It begins in Dumbledore's office right after Harry wonders about a sandwich and continues... well, honestly I'm not sure yet how long it's going to continue. Currently 18 chapters, 150,000-ish words:

** Harry Potter and the Summer After the War ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11593633/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Summer-After-the-War]]) and it's sequel, Harry Potter and the Winter After the War are great reads and could have continued on into a third story :( Canon compliant as well.

If you're looking for a non-canon compliant (Snape does an adult adoption of Harry after he defeats Voldy early) after the war series, the Resonance series (Resonance, Revolution and Resolution) by GreenGecko found on at least ff.net and HPFF are massively long but detailed 100% and so well written I dream of writing as well as GreenGecko has with these. (Fanfic writer and reader myself)
