where Harry, Neville, and several others construct essentially their own Manor towns in expanded trunks, all linked together. Can't remember the name


** Quidditch Tales on Fanfiction.net.

I can't link it as it has a fair bit of smut.

*** I don't think this this is it, I remember a little of this fic and it was a HHr iirc. Also,I think I remember harry's parents being alive due to a switching spell/stasis charm (but he didn't find out until later).

**** Huh, interesting. I've never seen that one then, I was sure it was Quidditch Tales as that's a major element, the whole trunk towns thing.

But good to know. If you find it, please comment as now I'm curious.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
