  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

** This is one of my favorites. Harry and Hermione travel back in time. There is a Sirius/Harry pairing in there, I hope you don't mind.
