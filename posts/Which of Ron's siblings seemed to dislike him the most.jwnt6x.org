** The twins brutally terrorized him when he was a child. They turned his teddy bear into a spider (a spider the size of a teddy bear! No wonder it's his greatest fear), burned a hole through his tongue with acid pops, and nearly succeeded in making him give an Unbreakable Vow. All of this is canon.

Don't know if they dislike him, or if they're just sociopaths.

There's a story where it shows their actions as the full-out bullying they are, in which they *did* succeed with the vow. It's a chapter in one of those "all my story ideas in one file" things, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/][Ickle Ronnikins]] by Perspicacity.

*** Damn, I just read that. The twins are full-out assholes, who don't even care about their brother. I swear, this is full out [[/r/KidsAreFuckingEvil][r/KidsAreFuckingEvil]] content in there. I hope they figure out what Fred and George did, but it's a oneshot.

**** Okay, this whole thing is going under a spoiler tag.

They made him swear that he would never tell his parents about any of their so-called pranks. Then Ginny got injured by one, and they sent him to get his parents while they gave first aid. So, to save his sister, he lost his magic. At the end he's being sent off with the squib accountant cousin --- who turns out to really be James Bond.

** I don't think any of them disliked him at all, let alone disliked him most.

Bill and Charlie were living in different countries by the time Ron was eleven. They weren't interacting much, and when they did interact it was in an adult-child way, not an "equal footing way." When Ron was on the cusp of adulthood in the last book, Bill loyally hid him even while telling him that some of his life choices hadn't been impressive. No signs of real dislike.

Percy was frequently frustrated with all of his siblings because Percy didn't fit in: different personality, different priorities, different political views. He yelled at Ron a lot in a way that was more generic than personal-- and certainly less than he yelled at the twins. But he tended to freak the hell out when Ron was in danger (see him going pale and dragging Ron out of the lake after the Second Task). And since by the end Percy announces in so many words that he was wrong, I don't think we can hold their falling out over the war as dislike of Ron personally, especially as Percy's anger was just as intently directed at the other siblings.

The twins, Fred in particularly, bullied Ron. Tried to make him take an unbreakable vow, burned a hole through his tongue, killed his puffskein, made jokes at his expense. They also taught him how to talk to girls. They showed up for DA meetings. George eventually invited Ron into the business he and Fred founded. Not dislike. Just close-in-age brothers stuff.

Ginny bristled when Ron tried to insert himself into her romantic life and made some nasty comments about his Quidditch failings (generally when Ron acted like a jerk first). She also hung out with him and his circle of friends by choice, up to and including marrying his BFF so that their lives would be forever entangled.

They probably all had moments of dislike when Ron did something obnoxious and annoying. But I don't think a single one of them gave the impression of disliking him in general.

There's a part of this sub that doesn't care to remember the twins are just two years older than Ron when discussing their torment of him when he was a kid. Fred is 5, 7, and 9 in 3 of these incidents. Idc how people feel about teenage Fred and George, but I always find it super odd when they want the little kid versions bashed or told off, especially for something they did at 5 and 7.

** I don't think anyone disliked Ron. I mean Fred and George were the worst, but as they got older they were even worse to Percy, while at younger age they targetted Ron more.

Ron and Percy got along least, but most of that dislike was from Ron's side as far as I could tell.

Ginny probably disliked him most, although that was to be expected given how they were only one year apart and thus he was the older controlling brother she had to deal with most, which she did not like.
