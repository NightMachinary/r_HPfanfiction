Any good fics featuring an AU/dystopia?


** linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl) is everything one can desire from a Voldemort wins the first war fic. Really great although awful update times.

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) is arguably dystopic and is pretty well done. Again, awful update times.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** This was the first time I read Champion, and now I'm grumpy because I want more. It was really good (usually I hate Triwizard plots but this was a good one in an interesting world).

Oh well. I'll follow it in hope that it updates in the future, but I won't expect anything.

** *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): although Voldemort fell, hardly anything changed, so Harry decided to fight them. But as pointed out in the epilogue, life under the Dark Trio was hardly pleasant, and Flitwick said plainly that the best they could hope for was ruled by another Grindelwald.

Or just, you know, flair your posts, whichever is fine.

Also i'm pretty sure flair only mods are a thing... not sure if it's user flair or post flair only or both.
