Looking for some incredibly well written fics about, as the title would suggest, politics.

I am willing to read anything, as long as it's complete or actively updated. I read fast and waiting for updates is frustrating. The longer it is the better, I read fast.

I'm very interested in different time periods as well as alternate Harry forms (fem!Harry, OP!Harry, etc)

Thanks!

Edit: Added more info on what I'm looking for.

Not everyone on the same side of the war has the same political views when it comes to things unrelated to Voldemort....

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** I am not sure if this fits but it is the only “political” one I've liked.
