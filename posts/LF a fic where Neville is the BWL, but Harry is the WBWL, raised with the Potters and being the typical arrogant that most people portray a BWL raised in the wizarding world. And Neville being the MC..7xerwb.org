IDK if i made sense, but what I'm looking for is that trope with the MC(which in this case is Neville, and not Harry or his twin or something) being the actual BWL but ppl believing Harry Potter to be the BWL, which he isn't, and also being that arrogant prick Malfoy-esque that is usually used. Pairing doesn't matter as long it isn't slash (femslash is OK, but the it wouldn't be Neville, i'd think).


** I don't know what MC or WBWL or BWL means
