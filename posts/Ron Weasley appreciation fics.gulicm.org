I've been looking for fics where Molly, Hermione or anyone else appreciates Ron.

Post-War, Hogwarts years, AU, anything is fine.

Weasley is our King


** 2-4-6-8, Who do we appreciate? Ron Weasley!

It always brings a smile to my face when I see a thread like this. Here's my personal recs with a brief description. There's a mix of stuff unfavourable to Hermione but there's a warning added jic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

(SELF-PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). It's more Hermione-critical than outright bashing. AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike.

So what if they have? They know opportunity when they see it, and that was their chance. Let [[/u/YOB1997][u/YOB1997]] bask in the glory of positive perspectives of Ron!

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

** This might be a bit of an out-of-place question, but I am writing a ron-centric fic and currently deciding on the pairing. It won't be much of a big part of it, but still. Anyway I'm wondering if there's any interest in a ron/pansy parkinson pairing. I saw it once somewhere else and quite liked it.

Pansy would be OOC (just less mean, really, but I'd try and make the character change gradual) but still I'm wondering if people would hate that. I wasn't sure where else to ask.

Any other pairings you'd like to see/wouldn't go near with a ten-foot pole?

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot. Some may have already been suggested. Sorry if so!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951044]]) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2044746]]) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24003130]]) it's a Ron becomes a vampire before 6th year fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/]]) Percy centric but has a lot of Ron! What happens when the Weasley parents die and Percy has to take over?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2594688/1/]]) Solstice Muse is an amazing author. Highly recommended for everything Ron!

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

**** Before you start, here's some stuff you should know about the story before you begin.

I've been following this story since around 1 million words. I enjoyed the Ron-centric POV and some parts of the plot. The issue for me is that this story comes with a lot of baggage. The writing style is bland and the author insists on capitalizing oddly, sometimes for emphasis and sometimes for no reason at all. Character arcs regarding Ron's relationships with his family and friends keep repeating. It was okay the first three times but after countless arguments with his friends and family that are resolved only to occur again, it ends up being too much.

The character arcs and slice of life sections end up creating a fic with horrendous pacing. The story is at 2 million words and at the end of the third year. The arc with the French veela families took countless chapters to resolve and the arc could honestly have been contained entirely in one of TrueSpartan's longer chapters. The politics is also disappointing. There's a lot of the posturing behavior in political fics that's cringy. Ron's hatstall leads to some of the Slytherin kids look for "new allies with Ron" instead of Draco. Theo and Blaise lecture Ron about his eating habits because they want a powerful ally. Getting a haircut is treated as a huge deal. Despite how the story describes seating and posturing as the end all to politics and the future, the end goal of all the Slytherins is winning the house cup. Don't forget the 11 year old being appointed as an ambassador to the French (did they not have one previously?). Suspension of disbelief is required as to how he achieves said position. The only consequence for Ron not actually doing his job as the ambassador is that his boss threatens to fire him if it happens again.

There are other issues as well. Ron thinks about women in the context of sex constantly. I find it hard to believe a 6th year is really pressing her breasts into a first year's face and arm because she enjoys teasing children. Who knows? Maybe it's more common than I think. Regardless, after countless incidents of Ron admiring the body of <insert whichever woman or girl>, it starts detracting from the story and piles onto the horrendous pacing. Even the magic used by Ron's auror trainer to heal him has to get him erect, because it adds a few more paragraphs. The magic system feels disappointing in some ways. Wandless magic is treated as more powerful, Dumbledore is disappointingly weak, and there's a magic dummy that can outduel and outthink aurors (but I'm willing to bet we'll never see said dummy in actual combat despite its ability to be repaired). There are a few upsides to the magic system, but not many.

Money makes no sense.

It's not all bad. Theo and Blaise have interesting characters and backgrounds. Some parts of the plot are interesting, but in the end, the story is a wish fulfillment story. That said, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine, and I do eagerly await every chapter. I wouldn't recommend it to others unless they desperately sought a Ron-centric story though. It's the Red Knight but with the problems compounded. 2.5/5, rounded down.

***** I'm nowhere close to completing the fic, but I lost interest when each chapter again and again Neville talks about how Ron is suspiscious, Ron is bad, etc etc. It was fine the first time, since it showed that there is conflict and all, but it just became annoying as the author keeps repeating the same scene over and over, Neville complaining about Ron, and Hermione being angry at him, ad infinitum.

I stopped reading when Ron was beating Harry up in the duelling club (I think - it's been a while since i read it) for hurting his friends in Potions class (I think). It seemed really OOC and out of place.
