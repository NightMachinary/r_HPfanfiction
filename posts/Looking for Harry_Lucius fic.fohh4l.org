:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I read awhile ago, the rating was nc-17 I believe. The main things I remember are:

1. a creature fic (so Harry and Lucius are mates)
2. They discover their bond at the Department of Mysteries battle, Harry does some telepathy with Lucius
3. dom Harry/sub Lucius (small detail that amuses me but Harry was shorter than Lucius)
4. Harry takes a parental role in Draco's life, and Draco knew about their bond before Harry and Lucius.
5. There's no mpreg until basically the last chapter

It's possible that the website it was posted on shut down, I read it in 2018/2019. I scanned almost every Harry/Lucius rec, and couldn't find it.
