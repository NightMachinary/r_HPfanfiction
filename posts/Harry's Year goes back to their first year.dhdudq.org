So I saw this fic a long time ago, where only Harry's year survived the war, but it was all of them, so they decided to go back in time to their first year of Hogwarts and were all buddies.

I think when they entered the great hall for the sorting Harry and Draco were like doing flips or something? Idk

If there's multiple fics like that then please send them all to me


** Sounds fascinating, I hope someone links it

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
