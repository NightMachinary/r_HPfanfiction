Let's say, for example, you first shipped Harry/Luna, then somehow it became Luna/Neville, but now you find yourself shipping Neville/Hermione?


** I went from Harry/Daphne to Harry/Luna to Harry/ Fleur to Harmony and Bill/Fleur to Hermione/Bill and Harry/daphne again...

** I used to ship Hermione/Ron and liked the idea of Ginny/Neville or Luna/Neville. Now, if I had to pick a set of ideal ships, it would be Luna/Ginny, Ron/Harry, and Neville/Hermione.

I still have a soft spot for Luna/Neville/Ginny and Ron/Hermione/Harry though.

** Not really, I've always shipped HP/HG but I also like luna.

I guess Lunar Harmony exists for indecisive people like me lol

I don't hate other ships but I can't get interested in them so I don't read them. Like, if you pair Harry with tonks most of the time the fic will be centered around lemons and sex jokes.

If you pair him with DG the fic tends to be lots of boring politics (to me), same with draco.

I don't intent to talk bad about other ships, that's just what I've seen so far.
