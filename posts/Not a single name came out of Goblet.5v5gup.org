Many days ago, I read a oneshot in which no name came out goblet. It was probably a time travel crack fiction. Can you suggest fictions based on the idea?


** I suddenly have this vision of someone tossing the Sorting Hat [probably the one from 'The Lie I've Lived'] into the Goblet of Fire. When the ceremony comes around, the flaming hat bellows out in the voice of R. Lee Ermey "Yer all worthless and weak! Nothing but a bunch of slack-wanded lollygaggers! Why, I haven't seen such a complete waste of my time since Merlin ran through the tournament as three different versions of himself!" etc.

Point of order, that doesn't sound like a waste of time at all.

Now I want to see a fic like that; when the Tournament is actually used as an attempt to assassinate Harry, a time-turner-using Harry masquerades as Cedric Diggory, with a clone standing in as Krum, and a parallel-dimension she-Potter swapping in for Fluer, in order to protect the time/space native Harry throughout the tasks. No wonder the first two are so good at Quidditch...

**** Alright. Now I want a Harry Potter version of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12147427/1/Old-man-Naruto][Old Man Naruto.]] The whole plot is about an obscenely powerful old guy coming back in time to make his younger self's life better but accidentally killing people he was close to and replacing them with clones of himself.

Dumbledore doing that would be hilarious.

**** Yeah, that sounds like something to read, even if it would probably end up being a “guilty pleasure” story.

On a more random note, I'd also love to see a story where every single task goes wrong in a way so insane that nobody can actually finish them, like the four champions deciding to go with each other to the ball and someone having a derp moment when it comes to choosing hostages and thus the task beginning with all the champions at the bottom of the lake.

The tournament can be hilariously broken in oh so many ways ...

** It isn't exactly on the topic, but do you happen to have the name of the story that made you post this?
