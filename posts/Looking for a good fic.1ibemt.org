I would like one thats finished, and no slash (I'm not homophobic, i'd just rather not read about it) Thanks :)


** The vague is strong with this one.

There are over 300,000 /completed/ Harry Potter fics on fanfiction.net alone. Admittedly, you can drop about 250,000 of those between asking for 'good' and 'no slash', but we need a little more guidance if you want recommendations. Otherwise, check out the stories referenced in the recent requests for comedy, next gen, and ones similar to an awesome story you probably haven't read yet (Prince of the Dark Kingdom).
