In detail what I mean is stories where there are certain elements that are substantially different, but the main canon story and ending is still mostly intact.

A potentially clich√© example would be; Harry, Ron & Hermione are sorted into Slytherin, Hufflepuff & Ravenclaw, respectively, but still end up friends. The main story then proceeds as usual, just with some minor changes here and there to accommodate the changes. Maybe they hang out more in the library or great hall or the grounds, since they don't share a common room. Some issues with house rivalry sometimes maybe, but main story mostly unchanged, you get what I'm saying! I hope...

Hope I explained well enough what I'm looking for.


** Have you read the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar series]]? Each one is a different AU scenario - Harry as a girl, Neville as the Chosen One, or Harry Raised by X and Y, written as quick ~10k word oneshots that cover the main canon highlights.

The AUs aren't particularly groundbreaking, and the story and endings are pretty much the same as canon. I found them boring because of that and the plot railroading that breaks the logical sequences of events, such as Sirius's death in the DoM, which happens in EVERY SINGLE AU, when in canon it was an unfortunate coincidence that involved Narcissa, Kreacher, Umbridge, Snape to happen but you might like it for that very reason.

The prose style is better than average, too.

Yeah, that's exactly the type of stuff I was looking for! It's nice we can have different tastes! :) Thanks for the recommendations! :)

** I can think of a handful, though it will depend on your taste:

- linkffn(On the way to greatness): Harry sorted into Slytherin, this is probably the most realistic version of what if canon Harry was sorted into X-house.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): a lot of the plotline is similar (with added NBWL story for Harry and twin), though the scales are usually bigger with more characters. This is a fic where saying it really does improve over time doesn't actually mean you shouldn't read it too.
- linkffn(Victoria Potter): basically a revamped, but more "magical" version of HP with a fem!Harry too. Slow updates, but the quality is there for anyone to see.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Good fics with major changes, but remain in HPverse with magic and recognizable canon characters:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), has a blind Harry who never went to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), has a Harry raised by his own parents. He never made friends with that usual crowd, and Ginny Weasley was his main adversary for a long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), diverges from end of CoS and never looks back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), still visits a few canon stations such as PS, CoS, Sirius Black, and Harry in TWT, but their resolutions are quite different. Things then become totally different after Voldemort got his body back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), also revisits many canon stations with vastly different outcomes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), diverges from Halloween 1981 and features a totally different plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363), has Harry raised by Gilderoy Lockhart, and of course things should become completely different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853), is a very interesting story with some major blemishes. But overall speaking, readers looking for novel plots should try it.
