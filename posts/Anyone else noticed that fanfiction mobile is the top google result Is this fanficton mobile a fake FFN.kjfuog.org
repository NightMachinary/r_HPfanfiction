So i'm on PC and since yesterday if noticed that the top result if you google fanfiction is fanfiction mobile usually it's fanfiction.net. I haven't clicked the result just in case it was a fake but I do know it doesn't have "[[http://www.][www.]]" at the begainning.

So is the fanfiction mobile a fake FFN or just the mobile version of the real site?

Thanks.


** When you click on the "fanfiction mobile" result, it takes you to normal FFN, but I think that [[https://m.fanfiction.net][m.fanfiction.net]] is the mobile version of FFN

** Ffn has a app. It's the best and use it more than the site.
