Hey guys, if you've seen any of these threads before, be assured that I save them for special occasions! My ongoing audiobook podcast for the excellent Alexandra Quick series of fanfictions by Inverarity has finished the release of the second book, Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below!

The podcast can be found with this RSS feed link:

or just by searching on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, or anywhere else for Alexandra Quick and the Audiobook Project.

The third book, Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment, has been recorded in full and is over two-thirds edited. The fifth book in the series, Alexandra Quick and the World Away, will release its final text chapter this Friday, so now is a phenomenal time to get into the series if you've been putting it off. Thanks everyone for listening!
