  Harriet Potter knew she shouldn't have picked those three Hallows... but she did, and now, she's immortal, and the gods have a proposition for her : help the heroes of other universe to save her mother's soul. And to help her, they'll give her a tool : the Gamer's Ability. First stop : the Mafia World. fem!Harry, MoD!Harry, gamer!Harry

*** I have read pretty much all gamer stories on Fanfiction.net. I was hoping I had missed one were more than just the main character got gamer like powers.

sadly is seems like there are almost no Litrpg stories on Fanfiction.net
