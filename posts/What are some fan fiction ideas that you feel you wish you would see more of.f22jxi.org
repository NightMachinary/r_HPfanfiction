Blood Crest by Cauchy is a great example of a fic that does it well. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820]]

**** Canon werewolves are a bunch of murder machines who, when asked to choose between staying out of a conflict, decide to join the magical Hitler spin-off who considers them vermin because they get to kill under him. Canon werewolves are a lot closer to their mythological origin as ancient city buster, not misunderstood creatures who need a hug and civil rights as fanon makes them out to be. Which is not a bad thing IMO since they are a manifestation of mankind's primal fears.

Also, the orcs in Tolkien have a rather interesting past with the whole "broken by torture" thing and their enslavement. Although admittedly, that isn't the only possible origin, but generally some kind of evil sorcery is involved to make them what they are.

******* The HIV allegory being clumsy is irrelevant.

Unless you think werewolves are inherently bad people (which biological determinism is an actual far-right talking point), then there's no reason why werewolves shouldn't have civil rights. The werewolves being easily radicalized and siding with ethnic cleansing probably has more to do with the failures of the wizarding world's ostensibly neoliberal, stratefied and bigoted system than anything else. You can't put oppressed people into a corner and not expect some form of extremism.

Also, I think unless you really do think werewolves are inherently more evil than the average wizard, there's actually not a big distinction between the kind power the average wizard holds to potentially cause mass destruction and that of a standard werewolf.

******** A werewolf is a walking biological weapon. Unlike HIV victims, they feel a need to attack and spread the curse. They don't turn into mindless monsters and I think that Lupin proved quite well that even the "good" werewolves cannot be trusted with the potion (although some of the blame there falls on Snape as well).

The majority of werewolves made it their mission to inflict as many civilian casualties as possible. That action, even the willingness to do so, are IMO more than enough to forfeit any and all rights they could otherwise have possessed. Lupin could not even get a single werewolf to side with the good guys.

And given whom Voldemort put in charge of his own ethnic cleansing (Umbridge) as well as his how opinions on their worth, it was clear that they were not siding with a liberator or someone who gave them rights but merely someone who unleashed them upon the general population.

********* That's literally advocating for profiling based on a minority class.

Your justification for profiling was exactly some of the scaremongering of HIV patients in the Reagan/Thatcher eras. There were stereotypes that these mostly (gay) men couldn't control themselves, they were a walking biohazard, that they enjoyed transmitting the disease to others, etc..

No one person or group of people should have to be a representative of their kind. Besides, Lupin didn't take his potion because of extremely rare extenuating circumstances, not out of any malice.

Again, the capacity to inflict mass destruction is functionally no different than the capability the average wizard has. If we rule out any racist implications that werewolves are inherently evil, then that leads to enviromental factors being the culprit. Werewolves have no real incentive to assimilate into wizarding society. They have no access to jobs, they are ostracized and they are subject to hyper-surveillance. They are basically non-people to the wizarding state. Why would they be persuaded by Lupin to side with them? Voldemort may not have afforded werewolves any real respect or solidarity, but at least they were afforded some level of self-determination.

******* I believe that it is actually from a statement made by JKR on the subject - that Lupin/his condition were meant to draw from HIV.

Specifically:

#+begin_quote
  Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS. All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

***** One downside of the whole 'new school' thing is that you have to draft up a ton of new characters, since we know basically 2 people from Beauxbatons (Fleur and Madame Maxime) from around Harry's time. Part of the appeal for HP is being able to reuse characters who are around - either prominently or not.

There's also the thing with canon being super vague with the non-British schools - like Beauxbatons apparently being /the/ school for like half of Europe. I've thought about doing some sort of hopping over the channel and doing more with France, but it'd almost have to be in an entirely AU version of it to really interest me.

** Using minor characters like Amelia Bones, Rita Skeeter, Tracey Davis, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Ernie Macmillan, et cetra. In ways that aren't just for the romance but actual plot and character development.

Using stuff like Room of Requirements, the Chamber of Secrets and other similar things used more.

Thinking of different ideas or such. Having characters like Ron used in more positive ways instead of negative.

Sirius getting a trial or getting proven as innocent in some sort of way, more competent adults and characters in general.

USA, or other places helping the Wizarding World out with Voldemort. I mean, if Voldemort wins he could potentially try to overthrow other places, eventually, and that'd be bad for them.

On a seperate but still related note: If you do end up deciding to pair Hermione with someone else do NOT bash Ron. They can still be friends, they don't have to develop romantic feelings with each other, or they can and try it out and it just not work but still be friends.

** Time travel which takes the disparity between the traveller and his former contemporaries into account. A war veteran would not be able to connect to a bunch of 11 year old children. Even the seventh year students would be difficult, but I feel like that would be the likeliest approach.

Hestia Jones could have shared one year at Hogwarts with Harry, Tonks' birthday would need to be shifted to the second half of 1973. But an interesting premise would be Harry walking up to them and going for a full reveal, using the knowledge from being friends with them during the war to prove his status as time traveller and plot with them to prevent the future he came from.

*** I was reading a couple fics with time-travel, both are Fleurmione and are currently WiP, first one: They lost the war so Hermione is "chosen" to go back in time to fourth year to make more allies and "fix" stuff if she can. She's aware of how strange is to be a 19 year old, and having to do all over again, she has to choose when to change the course of things. Second one: In the battle at the Ministry, Fleur and Hermione use a Time-turner to prevent stuff that happens there, but things go wrong and they ended up in fourth year.

Since both fics are in early stages (like only 6 chapters posted) I don't know how well the time travel things is going to work out, but it's an interesting point of view.

Maybe he would be able to negotiate something with his job and the headmaster to make a kind of dragon ‘grounds' where they would stay but it would need to be warded, and well too (or maybe only know by the professors). We don't need an ‘unknowing student walks into a dragon is burnt to a crisp' situation.

** Crossovers that actually make use of both narrative universes and explore shared concepts or morals, or, alternatively, contrast divergent morals and explore one universe using the other as a lens.

That means don't just shoehorn one character into another universe so they have a greater choice in sex partners. It means not having a first chapter that says 'X was betrayed by everyone and now he's in Y, but lets now forget everything else about X's universe'. It means not having one universe shit all over the other universe.

If one universe is significantly higher in the power stakes than another, find something more interesting to write about than big fights. Consider HP/Game of Thrones. Most writers either nerf the HP powerset, or have Westeros get curb stomped by magic. But that's not interesting, and it completely ignores the themes of both settings! A central theme of HP is power doesn't matter, its kindness, determination, friendship and moral fortitude that really matter. In Game of Thrones, everyone believes that it is power that matters, but over the course of the story it is shown to be a fickle thing, veneer thin.

So use that. Have an overpowered wizard in Westeros take over and try to bring about a better world while their kingdom schemes and backstabs all around them. Explore how difficult it is to remain good when the whole world just seems to hate you more for it. That's a story I'd love to read. Doubt I'll ever see it though.

**** linkao3(932445) is a good look at a female Tom Riddle. It's a short one-shot, but does a good job looking at her character.

linkffn(Thunderstorm) is a fairly vanilla Harry/fem!diary!Riddle fic. It's probably the most tolerable for general audiences.

linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) is a well-written fic about Harry learning about Voldemort after she's resurrected at the end of GoF. Handles itself quite well, but the climax and ending leave a lot to be desired.

linkffn(Power is Control) is a Harry/fem!Voldemort fic where Voldemort is attracted to Harry due to the horcrux in his scar. That desire doesn't make her any less insane of bloodthirsty, though. The concepts and portrayals are very solid, though the prose is a bit off due to the author's self-admitted weakness as a writer.

linkffn(Departure from the Diary) is my own fic. diary!Riddle detects the horcrux in Harry's scar and decide to fuse with it in the Chamber, as that would result in less scrutiny than if she were to kill Harry and Ginny. As of right now, she's a voice in his head who sometimes takes control of his body. I'd of course say that it's good, though it's a very slow burn and I will freely admit that it delves into exposition and worldbuilding far more than necessary.

** Runaway Harry Potter I find is difficult to find (probably because I've read a ridiculous amount of the ones available) these ones are difficult because I find that most of them have the runaway and then by the third chapter he's adopted.

Also, this one is probably an odd one because of specifics. But a situation in where Harry is for some reason given a baby (his own child(or her for fem!harry), magical new cousin, Dudley's child(magical or no), etc.) and has to deal with parenthood while in school, and alone. Single parent Harry is hard to find.

Another one thinking about it that I look into every so often but can never find is, secretly female Harry. Harry is Born female and she knows it but hides it from the Wizarding world for one reason or another. I think I've read like three of these and that's all o could find.

What about a murder conspiracy case featuring 28 year old openly gay Teddy Lupin (auror liasion to the department of mysteries), a realistic Harry/Ginny divorce with no bashing, great Draco and Astoria interpretation, and one of the most creative magical murder methods I've seen in a fic?

It does have magic though. The idea is that canon Hermione travels to an alternate universe and she eventually manages to harness magic & science to return to her dimension. Ron & Harry might not have magic, but it's interesting to see their character development in this AU and they do feel like Ron & Harry, if not our Ron & Harry. It also has one of my favourite Luna & Dumbledore portrayals ever.

And the story has actual Ron & Harry in it, if that makes it better. They've appeared in the latest chapters and they're quite interesting.

This all comes before a teenage girl experiences puberty in a teenage boys body.

Then you could habdle the drama of separation after so long together. Does a codependency develop? Do they have communication problems because the others emotions are no longer available to them?

All the while the magic itself could be extrapolated on. Is magic tied to the body or the soul? Can Ginny perform magic independent of Harry while inhabiting Harry's body?

Draco gets Obliviated by The Dark Lord's minions, probably Pettigrew in 3rd year and gets trained to be the perfect little death eater.

or

In second year Draco Malfoy gets possessed by Voldemort's Diary in his second year becoming the heir of Slytherin.

I'm thinking that Lucius puts the diary in his cauldron either by accident or on purpose, if it's on purpose then you have way more options with what you could do with Lucius, making him way more evil than what he was in canon and that could be a reason that Draco might defect to the light side, if you want that in your story.

**** I'm working on one of those fics myself, and it's a jumble of things really, such as:

1: When did he travel back from? 7th year, maybe older?

2: Who won the war?

3: What are his views on blood purity at the moment?

4: Would he keep his last name? Or maybe he would change it to something like Black, if he wants to change the outcome of the war so that Sirius and the Marauders don't die then he'd need to get Sirius and the others attention which would happen if he had a pureblood last name.

If he does decide to keep his last name, then he would need to have a backstory that he could have worked on with Dumbledore who would, of course, know about Draco. Possible backstory's are:

1: Amnesia, he doesn't remember his parents or his family, Dumbledore ran an inheritance test and saw that he was a member of the Black family.

2: I saw this in another story but it goes like, Draco was left at a Muggle orphanage as a baby and once he started showing his magical prowess Dumbledore came and adopted him.

That's what I have for his fake backstory, the rest can be up to you if you want.

***** Hmmm I like that idea of him having the Black family name, as then he and Sirius could ‘team up' as the ‘white sheeps' of the family. That would be a nice start, gaining the trust of the light side. There's a lot of ways this story could be taken.

****** Yes, which is why I absolutely love this rare trope, there's so many ways this could be taken.

I personally like when Draco knows about Lupins lycanthropy and when he stops the marauders from bullying snape, because if he stops the encounter with Snape calling Lily a mud blood so many other things could be changed like Snape doesn't become a death eater.

Really i have tons of rare tropes that pop into my head at times.

******* I feel like in canon, Snape is one of the only adults Draco has a semi-positive relationship with or respects, outside of his family. I think if a reformed Draco went back in time, he would sympathise and care about young Snape a lot more than Sirius (a random relative he never really knew), especially if Narcissa had told him about Snape's vow to her.

I don't see why he'd get involved with the Marauders at all, let alone Sirius. Imo he would probably see Sirius's behavior (bullying a poor kid, even if he was abrasive) as being too much like his own bullying against the trio and would probably hold a bias against him.

He might feel guilty that his aunt had killed someone Harry cared about (idk how he'd find out about it tho), but I genuinely doubt ensuring Sirius's safety would be on his mind at all. Honestly, he'd probably care more about Regulus (being forced into doing stuff for the dark lord sounds awfully familiar), Snape like I said, his parents, and maybe the parents of his friends in canon. He would try to stop the radicalisation of Slytherins rather than have anything to do with the Marauders themselves. It would be a pretty unique story.

******** Absolutely and thank you for the complement!

​

Well, when I first had the idea of writing a Marauders time travel fic, what I really did was try an analyze the characters in the Marauders era as well as Draco. The first one was Lily:

Lily Evans was the best friend of Severus Snape as we all know, however, there were always things that baffled me about Lily.

1: Severus was her best friend at least until 5th year, and James had been bullying Severus ever since their first year, sure Lily defended Severus with words, /words,/ this could be excused in first year because they were just starting to earn magic, but she still could've gone to Mcgonagall or Slughorn which would have at least been a temporary solution, she did not however, and she saw that her words were in no way helping Severus, she just stood by and frowned upon him for going into the dark arts when she herself barely made any efforts to help him from getting out of that situation, sure she talked to him, but those talks normally ended up in fights.

She should have taken a better approach or at least have tried to understand things from his point of view. Severus was trapped in a house that supported blood purity when he himself was half-blood, he did what he had to do to survive, and him getting into the dark arts was a side affect of being around those types of people for 5 years, which continued on to 7 and longer. His mind was slowly shaped by their beliefs which helped to support his own.

I do not believe that Lily Evans tried her best to help her friend, I feel like she didn't understand the impact the bullying had on Severus.

Now onto Severus Snape:

Severus snape's dad Tobias was a muggle, and there is evidence in canon that Tobias was a man who did not like anything which included magic.

Tobias would be Severus' first look into Muggles, and the fact that he lived in a run down neighborhood couldn't have helped his image of muggles, the only muggle he knew abused his mother emotionally and maybe physically maybe even him as well.

This affected his view of muggles, which could have made him hate them as a secondary hate of his father.

You have to look into the psychology of Severus' situation, his father was a muggle who abused his mother and himself, the muggles in his part of town weren't much better, but then he sees Lily, a muggleborn who had part of Tobias' ancestry in her but she isn't that bad?

This would lead him to question pretty much everything he knew.

I can't continue now but I will soon.

********* I agree on both points.

Lily never truly attempting to save Severus and just expecting him to choose the good side without her help, despite her knowing his situation, was always a little strange to me. (Or at least that is what JK has implied)

I'm curious, but alas I must wait for your writing excellency to come back. Godspeed my ramen friend :)

********** I have returned!

Now where was I? Oh yes, Severus.

Severus may like Lily, but the impact that Tobias made to his mind was still very fresh, he went to hogwarts and what happened? He got bullied. And who did he get bullied by? James Potter, a gryffindor, someone that was supposed to represent everything that was good in the magical world, or at least that's what people made it seem.

He was sorted into Slytherin while Lily, his only friend and possibly the only person who cared about him, was sorted into the absolute opposite house of Gryffindor.

Now, I imagine that Severus either learned the ropes in his house very quickly or Lucius Malfoy helped him, or even a bit of both. Severus must have shown a lot of potential for someone who was as full of himself as Lucius was to pay attention to. Severus is clearly very talented in potions and shows a good degree of magical potential. The only problem was that he was a half-blood, Lucius would believe himself above Snape.

Lucius was already in good graces with Voldemort, making it easy for him to put a few good words in for him as Snape grew older, while he manipulated his mind while he himself was at school once Lucius graduated however he would use the other Slytherins to do his dirty work when he graduated.

Therefore, as Snape grew up, his views on blood purity (even though he himself was a half blood, so I would assume that he was worst on muggleborns) would be drastically influenced as he grew up, it didn't help that he had to go home every summer, back to Tobias, and as he grew up and his views changed he and Lily would pick more fights together, Lily's reason being that she doesn't want Severus to express intrests in the dark arts, while Severus defends himself.

However, I believe that they were /both/ lieing to themselves.

Lily was sorted into Gryffindor, and even though she had a good home life (aside from Petunia) she would also be surrouded by people who would influence her beliefs as she gre up. Most people in Gryffindor, I imagine, wouldn't be okay with Lily's relationship with Snape, and they would express this to her, but as she grew up she would also begin to question if what they were saying is true. I see James influencing what the others say as he develops a crush on Lily.

Now Snape and Lily are both stuck in these toxic situations where the main goal is to destroy Lily and Snape's friendship. And, well, mission accomplished.

Even if they didn't have that disastorus fight in fifth year I believe that their friendship still would have never lasted unless they had a real conversation, and either of them would never instigate this conversation. This is where I believe Draco would step in, he would instigate the conversation by using sly methods (he is still a Slytherin after all) such as asking Severus to meet him at The three broomsticks and Lily as well, if they say no, then he would just have to make sure that they 'bump into each other' and make sure that absolutely none of their housemates are there either.

Then he would very subtly mention points that would bring up the topics that need discussion, such as when Lily evidently starts mentioning Snape's obsession with the dark arts Draco would counteract with his house situation, which Snape would perhaps start contemplating himself at this time, as he does indeed care about his relationship with Lily and would wonder about what went wrong.

Lily would have never thought about his house situation, so therefore, seeds of doubt have been planted in their minds, now to make them sprout.

Draco would keep briging up points, such as blood purity and maybe, just maybe Severus' home situation. I believe Draco would be able to relate with Snape on the blood purity matter as it is something they both have believed in before and have started to doubt.

_______________________

The next matter is The marauders themselves and Dumbledore himself.

Sirius Black:

Oh where do I start with Sirius? I've always imagined him as the light's version of his family, he may believe in different things than his family, but he is just as cruel as the rest of them. The only difference is that he is reckless, which makes him all the more dangerous

The shreiking shack incident should be enough proof of that, he was willing to make his friend a murderer just because of some grudge he had on Severus.

However, I don't think that it was just a grudge he had on Severus, I think he sees Severus as an embodiement of his family, his families belief and their house as well, so when he says that he bullies Severus just because of his house, it's true, just not as one dimensional as he makes it sound.

Sirius is, however, loyal to his friends, Draco could use advantage of when he manages to capture Sirius' attention because of his choice last name.

Showing Sirius that not everyone from his family is bad would be a big turning point in his life, however, he would still bully Snape until intervention from Draco and Draco telling him about why he feels so much resentment towards him, and when Sirius learns about Snape's homelife that is when I think he would question his actions.

Now onto the next Marauder, the leader of the group, James:

I hate him. That's it. /I absolutely loathe James Potter./ He bullied Severus firstly because of his black and white views of the world and his absolute hypocrisy. He hates Snape because he's a Slytherin and all Slytherin's are 'evil' when he himself instigates almost all of their encounters.

First he bullied him because of his view of the world, and there wasn't even any blame that lied with his parents like Draco's, his views of the world were purely his own and the ones that he decided were true.

He would have still bullied Snape no matter what house he was in.

Hufflepuff? Oh, so you're a pushover?

Ravenclaw? Hah! Bookworm! You think you're better than us?

Gryffindor? I don't care, you still look creepy, when was the last time you took a shoer Snivellus?

But, for the sake of the story, a friendship with James is needed, the best way to get him to lay off Snape would be to show him his homelife, which wouldn't happen until later on, or, Lily, Sirius and Remus team up and tell him to stop, which would only be a temporary solution.

James Potter is arrogant becaus he's a Gryffindor and can do no wrong and I hate him.

*********** Now onto my favorite of the group: Remus Lupin

Remus is kindhearted and sadly, a bit of a pushover when it comes to his friends. He hasn't had any friends because of his Lycanthropy, and when he finds friends, he doesn't stand up to them when he sees how they treat Snape because he's scared that he'll leave him.

He finally has friends, and friends that actually care enought about him that they disregard his condition and actually become animagi because they care that much about him.

The big point is that he felt sorry for Severus and when Draco befriends him and tells him to stand up against the other Maruaders, I feel like he would listen, with a tad bit of convincing of course.

Peter Pettigrew:

He is now weak. He is a coward.

There isn't much to say about him, what bothers me though is when people think of him as weak. He is not.

He managed to become an animagus at 15 which takes astronomical levels of pateience and magical potential.

He is however, a coward, someone who fears death and will do whatever it takes to not die, which includes betraying his friends.

From a story point of view, I'd imagine Draco getting the marauders to dump Peter, such as using his friendship with the Slytherins against him, at this time the Slytherins would be talking to him and trying to make him join their side, which in turn, if Draco could get proof of these interactions happening, then the marauders would dump Peter.

Dumbledore:

Frankly, he shocked me with his behavior, he let Sirius and James get away with letting Snape in the shreiking shack on a full moon!

Without even a suspension at the very least!

There isn't much to say about the headmaster, I do see him being byist against the Gryffindors however.

From a story point of view Dumbledore doesn't have much value other than teaching Draco magic, making him more powerfull, essentially making him the new chosen one.

In conclusion: Draco would need to gain Snape's trust by getting the marauders to stop and getting him away from his toxic housemates and family which would in turn fix his relationship with Lily.

He needs to befriend James, Remus and Sirius so that he can get Pettigrew out of the group, saving James and Lily from death later on in life, but, James and Lily would not get together as Draco stops the encounter in 5th year from ever happening. Dumbledore teaches Draco magic, making him the new chosen one.

And if you want you could add the original order of the phoenix into the mix where Draco joins as Dumbledore's own mentee, or spy because of his last name, as the Black family would indeed interogatte Draco, if Draco's answers the question how they want him to, he could be like a replacement Sirius, making him a great spy to have since Voldemort would express intrest in him, as he was introduced by Dumbledore himself and seems to have a good relationship with him.
