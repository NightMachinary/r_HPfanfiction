In the first DADA class where Umbridge is questioned of the use of magic in class, there's always some great responses in fanfics - but it amazes me how often the main issue is ignored (and I know I've read it in a few fics but not all that many really) - it's a school of magic. If you use no magic you are basically a muggle. Umbridge goes on and on about superiority but can you really be superior when you don't even do the one thing you advocate. Magical people are not magical if they don't use magic. Well I guess they still are but they may as well not be.

I feel like more students should have objected. I feel like Malfoy should've been like "you dare tell me not to use my wand". I want to read a confrontation where Umbridge has to explain how she expects a magic class to be taught without magic. I feel like someone should've snapped her wand. Oblivated her after. Or stolen it under the Cloak. She's not strong magically - or at least there's no indication she is. I want demands to see her cast a patronus. Or a protego. Or last in a duel or something. Stunned her every lesson. And shouldn't there be more laws? How come Hermione doesn't examine the law books for more than just Hagrid? I feel like she should be pulling out obscure clauses left right and centre to back her up.

** What amazes me in this scene is how Umbridge is playing the whole "There is no danger at Hogwarts, or even out there", even thought:

- Sirius Black is still a free man, and 2 years prior, the Ministry seemed adamant this man was dangerous, and ready to target Harry and anyone close to him. Not to mention that, while proclaming that "The Dementors are all under controle", the Ministry also admitted that they went out of bond at least 3 times during Harry's 3rd year, making them more dangerous than the criminel they were supposed to protect the student from.
- During the same year, and "dangerous beast" lived in the castle for a whole year and even taught children, proving that Dumbledore was really losing it, but also that danger could enter the castle
- By their own admission, by shooting dangerous lies, Harry proved himself to be dangerous.

Umbridge was main mission was to take the control of Hogwarts while discrediting both Harry and Dumbledore (and if possible silencing them), but seriously, "Voldemort is back" was pretty much the only thing Harry should not have said. Anything else would have been impossible to silence by the Ministry, and admitted by the rest of the school.

Hmm...that makes me wonder, Harry /can/ point at any of the other disasters that struck the school in the past few years. There weren't many witnesses to the troll, and the basilisk is more of a run-like-hell thing, but what about the time the Dementors swarmed the Quidditch match?\\
So, what if, the reason Harry only brought up Voldemort...was because he was Confounded? By Umbridge, who needed a strawman to argue against?

** 'So we'll have to learn like muggles?' said a Slytherin, putting his hand up 'Unacceptable! This is a school for magic, we will learn magic like the wizards we are.'

(This could be a good start for a fic. I'd like to imagine that the slytherin here doesn't care about blood supremeracy and is indifferent to it, the only reason him standing up to the teacher would be to use her prejudiced beleifs against her so as to not detriment his/her's education. I'd imagine that other slytherins would gain the courage and manage to convince Umbridge to let them use wands0

** Wasn't Umbridge checking/stealing mail?

There was a fic where Dobby dropped a letter off to Hermione's parents, and then had Hedwig deliver the same letter, and they compared it. And then they did something else, like Bones or something.

That's really not how Harry Potter works. Laws mean nothing. You have the "I was imperiused! /cough cough/ */drops gold/* /cough cough"/, a Minister who illegally arrested Hagrid and threw him in Azkaban. Just so he could be seen doing something. Don't forget that farce of an underage magic hearing. Executing Crouch without a trial. Sirius not getting a trial. Placing dangerous Dementors around a school.

In the world of Harry Potter, laws are only meant to hinder the protagonist, nobody else.

** They were 15 year olds. How many 15 year olds rebel against a teacher that tells them they don't have to do actual work in class? Harry understood the importance of actually being prepared because he had just recently faced Voldemort in a life or death duel in a graveyard and Hermione was way too rational for her age. Malfoy, on top of that, was probably under instructions from his dad to suck up to her.

Also it seems like people around here seem to treat memory charms as something very simplistic, when in fact there is an actual job specifically designated for using those charms. Do you think that if every wizard was competent enough to cast it, they would need a position called Obliviator in the Ministry? Even on pottermore, in Lockhart's entry, JKR states that Lockhart was particularly good with memory charms even if incompetent in other fields.

Edit: also there's no indication that Umbridge is magically incompetent. She can cast a corporeal Patronus (maybe helped by the locket) and she is fully confident in casting a Cruciatus curse.

**** Fair enough... Now this is another question... how long do you want your victim to forget? What specifically do you want them to forget? How do you replace a memory with another? Most muggles only forget their encounter with magic. Also Hokey or Morfin Gaunt did not forget who they were either. Yet Lockhart became illiterate.

Realistically, it's probably something JKR didn't think the whole way through but if we were to discuss it, maybe there are various levels of memory charms... some stronger and some weaker. In any case, it's clear that most of them don't actually wipe out the memory but mostly lock them somewhere in the back of your brain. Otherwise Voldemort would have not been able to crack through Crouch's memory charm on Bertha Jorkins.

Edit: Also Hermione is able to completely change her parents' personality with a memory charm.

***** I kind of feel sorry for JKR sometimes. I mean sure, she put an amazing amount of work in to creating backstories and meanings and mythology for Harry Potter - but she was only one person - who expected it to turn into a runaway hit with millions of people debating, obsessing and nitpicking over every word she spun and continues to spin? And with the amount of creativity out there, someone is always bound to be disappointed when the canon doesn't match with their fanon.

We don't know what she did with her parents. The books stated nothing, and the movie said she used Obliviate. Both agree that she used a compulsion spell to make them want to move to Australia.

In all of this, in how you use it I'd imagine. As for Lockhart that answer is simple and two-fold. One he used a damaged wand, and two he cast the spell but didn't "command" it, so it just removed everything it could. Both Hokey and Morfin's memory charms were commanded to remove what was removed but nothing else, thus they retained themselves.

****** Well Ron was supposedly the owner of that wand (although if I recall correctly it might have been previously belonged to one of his brothers) and it still struck him when trying to hex Malfoy for calling Hermione a 'mudblood'. I think the book implies that Lockhart gets struck with the memory charm because he was using a damaged wand. And he wants the damage to be as powerful as possible because, as he says, Ron and Harry were supposed to be so grief-stricken when they saw Ginny's mangled body that they completely lost their minds.

******** I guess we agree that there are various levels of complexity to the Memory Charm and it probably can't be used easily by everyone. Anyways, my pet-peeve is the fact that a lot of people think Memory Charms are such a handy solution to all problems when in canon they are only used by Obliviators and a select few skilled wizards and witches. Just like, if every wizard or witch who got annoyed by someone would cast an unforgivable curse on whoever annoyed them, not even out of malice, but out of spite or anger. Sure, some may say that casting an unforgivable curse will land you in Azkaban... but unless a taboo curse was put on those spells, it would be hard to identify who did it. And Voldemort made use of them willy nilly as a kid and still didn't get in trouble.

********* On that note. There is using it, and there is using it so that you can't tell it's been used unless you truly look for it.

Most would only fall in the first category. For me I'd tie it with Legilimency and make it nearly impossible to do a passable job of it without that. And to have a chance of making it perfect, you'd need perfect legilimency.

Though then again, if you were that good at it you probably wouldn't be doing government work unless you were extremely good/nice.
