Hi I'm searching for a specific time travel story that I read a while ago, and I cannot find it again. Hermione, Ginny and Luna goes back in time to just before Halloween 1981, where Hermione suddenly (as a toddler) act way more mature, and convinces her parent to take her to Godrics Hollow to warn the Potters about the pending betrayal. Harry was also brought back into his younger self, and keeps trying to kill Wormtail. The warning is in time and the Potters are saved. They realize that Dumbledore set them up as Martyrs to end the war, and the families involved band together and as a result Harry ends up with a harem.
