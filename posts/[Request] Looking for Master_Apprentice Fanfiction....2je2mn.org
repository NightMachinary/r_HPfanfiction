** I think perhaps this fic may be similar to what you're looking for.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1462606][Falling is Sometimes the Best Route]] by kisslicknipsuck. "In order to get out of having to take an Eromenos, Severus asks the one person he's sure will say no---except he says yes."

It's Harry Potter/Severus Snape, and the "Eromenos" position is something like an apprenticeship to a master.

*** Wow! Thanks! It's just so hard to find good fics in this genre that don't just turn into smut.
