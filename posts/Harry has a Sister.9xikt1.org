Are there any good fics where Harry has a sister but Dumbledore put Harry with the Dursleys and her with a different family following Halloween 1981? Kind of like how Luke and Leia were hidden with different families?


** Literally Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed. Harry is with the dursleys and his sister stayed with Snape. I suggest you give it a shot, it surprised me in many ways. You can find it here. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/12201337/1]]

*** It's a good story, but boy does Harry get boned at every opportunity. Pretty much everyone is lying or manipulating him at every turn, "for his own good", lol. I sometimes think I wouldn't begrudge him poisoning the whole cast with basilisk venom.

It's a fun fic where Harry's sister plays an important role in his life after he finds her. There's a lot of divergence from canon, too.
