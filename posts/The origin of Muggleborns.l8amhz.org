What if all "Muggleborns" are actually the result of some wizard having some fun and obliviating the victim afterwards?\\
That would actually bring up the question how there are not alot more of them.\\
With the many methods available(Polyjuice, Confundus, Imperius, Obliviate, Love Potions and probably many, many more) and the general disregard of anything non-magical of most wizards I would assume it would not be hard to get away with quite alot.
