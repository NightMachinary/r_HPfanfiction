Is there anything close or similar to linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]])? It doesn't matter if it's during or after canon :)

***** I'm at chapter 6 now, there are some glaring typos that I know shouldn't be there. The grammar and prose is just fine, but it's like simple mistakes that even Word would correct. Here's to hoping it gets better lol

** Grow Young With me is the best of that genre imo. One already commented, Behind Blue Eyes. It's decent, but too angsty to my taste. You can also try:

It's a fine read if you can overlook the fact that it was a love at first sight story. Literally, they looked at the other and fell in love right there. Almost ruined the story for me tbh, but the author fixed that and it turned out to be better toward the end.

A quirky story where you get to experience it from the OC's POV. Quite interesting despite its length. The part where the OC looks forward to Harry's return each summer, and her imagination runs wild when he was away at Hogwarts really put a nice spin on the canon events that we all know too well already.

*** I'll give them a read thanks :). It's a shame there aren't more of them to be honest, would think the trope would have taken off but oh well.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
