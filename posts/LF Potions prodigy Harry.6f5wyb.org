Pretty self explanatory a Harry who develops his own potions and later begins to brew more dangerous illicit potions preferably AU. Potions are interesting


** It may seem weird, but the best potioneer-Harry fic that I've read is linkffn(Shadow of Angmar). In it, Harry ends up stranded in the Middle-Earth without his wand, and due to that is forced to use the only kind of wandless magic he knows - potioneering. But as the plants differ from his world, he has to improvise and use his best guesses and logic to create new potions.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** See the problem here is it's not Harry, it's Harriet. She also masquerades as her cousin so it might not be what OP is looking for.

**** That may be, but it still has a pretty amazing study of potions. And other magics as well.
