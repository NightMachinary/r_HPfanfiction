I am looking for a fic I saw on TV Tropes' Recommended Fics page a while back. It had Ron Weasley being Too Dumb to Live, he repeated the first year four times, was tutored by Umbridge, and the professors entered his name into the Goblet of Fire in a desperate attempt to kill him.

All I can remember of the name and website is that it wasn't fanfiction.net


** Anyone have any answers?
