*** I found this thing while it was still updating. it's still one of my utmost favorites.

It gave me my adoration of snape/harry friendships/mentorships/etc, among so many other things. Like the magic. Like the werewolves. like.. like... everything.

I wish I coudl read it again for the first time. Even with the pain of the abrupt non-ending.

** The Sacrifices Arc by LightningontheWave is one of the longest I've read.

It would have been worthwhile if it were shorter. Even a 20% reduction would be a huge improvement.

It had its problems, like trying to come up with vast, intricate pureblood traditions, but the interpretations seemed far too specific for the amount of detail, and the sheer number, if that level of detail were representative, would be daunting.

Its length is in part due to pacing problems.

However, it shows a grandeur of magic that I rarely see. It has an interesting progression of its major antagonists. It has some unusual magical abilities. There's a lot to admire.

*** It's the only fic I've read that really shows just how /horrible/ magic could be while still being completely believable within its own world/rules. I agree that the dude could have used a serious editor, though. Harry's...journey to self-esteem, for lack of a better term, got a bit repetitive. As [[/u/colbywolf]] put it:

**** Girl, not "dude." LightningOnTheWave is a woman and an English professor (then English grad student at the time she was writing the /Sacrifices Arc/).

The story is basically one long first draft, since she wrote basically a chapter a day for 2+ years. Definitely has some pacing and structural issues in general (almost the entirety of Book 6 in the series felt like padding to me or could have been significantly reworked). It would be interesting if she ever returned to it to revise it and tighten it up, but I doubt it.

**** aw, thanks for the mention :) made me feel all warm fuzzy :D

It's kinda reasonable, in ways, that such a thing would take time and effort to achieve, personally... but that doesn't mean it's necessarily good reading. The statement about an editor being needed is very, very true. It's not a BAD story--just, a touch frustrating.

But then, it can be frustrating to watch someone we care about make the same mistakes over and over again. Even in real life.

This. Any time I read a fic that has a hint of highly developed branches of magic, theory or abilities, I get excited. Nothing has ever delivered to the degree that the Sacrifices Arc did, but you get bits and pieces here and there.

Yeah, I'd say these were worth the read with some frightfully competent bad guys, some cool duels and an interesting AU world. It was written before half-blood prince but it still holds up in my opinion.

** I'm not going to mention the ones already in here.

Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822]]

660,444 words, and totally worth it. It is sort of a canon retread, but very well done and manages to stay interesting.

linkffn(9883718)

This is the longest one I read that was absolutely not worth it. This fic is exactly how not to do a canon retread. You might as well do a find and replace to change harry into a girl, and add in some romance scenes with George.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.(Greek Myths Abound) Fem!Harry

** Longest one I've read and just absolutely wanted more of would be linkffn(Prince of a Dark Kingdom)

Longest one I've read and liked at first, and then on a re-read years later realized is pretty dogshit. Would be the linkffn(A Second Chance At Life) series by Miranda Flairgold.

Both of those are really good examples of how to do an AU and how NOT to do an AU respectively.
