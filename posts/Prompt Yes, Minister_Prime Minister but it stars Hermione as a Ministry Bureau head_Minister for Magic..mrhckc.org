Yes Minister/Prime Minister was a political satire on the BBC in the 1980s.

It apparently was very accurate to what its like working in British Government. In fact Margaret Thatcher enjoyed it quite a bit and even rearranged her schedule so she could catch it.

A fic that is like that, except with Hermione as a Ministry Bureau head or the Minister For Magic would be quite funny.


** If anyone can write this and do it without simply recycling jokes from the program itself, they're far too good for fanfiction. The BBC would pay a lot of money for someone who can write something as funny as Yes (Prime) Minister.

*** Eh, fanfiction is a great place to start.

Besides, the problems of the Ministry are unique to itself.
