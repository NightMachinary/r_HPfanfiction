I'm looking for fics where the scar Horcrux talks to Harry like in Accidental Horcrux. The only other well-written fic like this that I've found is 'The Devil You Know' by SilchasRuin. Preferably no slash

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?
