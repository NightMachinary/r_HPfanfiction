I am looking for at least decent quality Dark!Harry, or at the very least not fluffy, saving people thing, family guy Harry. Can be as gruesome as possible so long as it is none of those things. For examples to how gruesome it can be just know that I like the Downward Spiral series. I am asking for any recommendations because I feel like I have already read most everything of quality available and I'm sad... I also highly welcome crossovers of any kind. Especially any Marvel crossovers of this quality. I would also say DC since it is my more favorable universe but I doubt I will get any recommendations for them since quantity in that fan fic crossover area appears to be severely lacking unfortunately. Star Wars is also a great crossover. Again, any crossover is welcomed. Though where crossovers are concerned I prefer them to stay mostly out of the Harry Potter universe, unless the fic does it really well. Nothing against MC slash, but in most of my experiences it is done horrendously bad in my personal opinion so I tend to stay away from them. Rise of a Dark Lord is the only MC slash story I can think of off the top of my head that I liked, but that was purely due to plot even though I didn't much like at all the slash. I don't particularly love harems, but I'm desperate so it doesn't matter. Send them my way if they fit the description. Please help me if you can. I would be extremely grateful. Does not matter how many stories you give me so long as they fit the requirements. Feel free to DM me any recommendations rather it be due to a too long list or because for some reason you can not post it on this forum. THANK YOU to anyone that is willing to recommend a fic that can take me out of my current depressing state.


** Have you read Antithesis? I'm always reluctant recommending it because it's quite dark and heavy but you seem to want dark and heavy so Antithesis 😊.

Linkao3(Antithesis by OceanBreeze7)

Also, if your looking for something a angsty and heavy then try Remus Lupin or Black family stories. Torn up werewolf, shunned by society and disowned and hated aristocrat are fun dynamics. It cures all my dark, angst needs anyway.

Linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) and link(Styx by TheDivineComedian) are two dark Black family stories that are very good.

Linkao3(Let Slip the Dogs of War by itallstartedwithdefenestration) is not the best Remus lupin story but I think it fits in with the tone your looking for.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13854705/1/Interrogated]]) is a good one too.

I don't know if these are any good to you? I know most arent Harry I apologise but hey, if they're not your thing, dont read them. Id highly recommend them though.

**** Errm... Yeah, kinda? But jesus, he's a goddam mess. Like, he doesn't suddenly become "ooh cool I'm a good hero now!"

It's more a sarcastic, suffering arsehole who finally realises how everyone has been using him. He hates the light side. He doesn't fight for them he fights for himself. He's never a "good guy". His character doesn't randomly change. It's a long sequence of events that force him down a particular path...

I'm bad at explaining things without spoilers but essentially, no he doesn't randomly turn good and happy and Harry Potter whoo look at me I'm a great person! right at the end no.

Anyway 😊 sure it's up to you.

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** Can think of two who are mainly mainstream, so you likely read them already, plus one that is a bit more obscure, if I can think of any others I will send it here. Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts), Linkffn(Too Young to Die), linkao3(Time doesn't fit in my bottle (but maybe a piece of you will)) those are not really the grim-dark gore feast variety, but it has Harry going to extremes and deciding to do some really messed up stuff. The Sum is probably the most tame and relatable with him trying really hard to keep his morals while Too Young is by far the goriest where he goes to any lengths to achieve his goals and shreds morality pretty early, Time is somewhere in the middle but is by far the one which better describe the scenes of gore.

He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong.
