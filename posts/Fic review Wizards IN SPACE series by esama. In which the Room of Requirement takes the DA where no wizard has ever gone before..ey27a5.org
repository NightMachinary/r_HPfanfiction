Edit: Short self-plug - I now have a very [[https://draquiareviews.wordpress.com][basic blog site set up where you can view all of my fanfic reviews]].

So I set out intending to read and review D.S.S Requirement within a couple of weeks. But I stalled, and I took a really long time finishing it. And when I did finish it, it was only 37k words after all so I read its short sequel as well -- D.S.S Enterprise.

Likewise, I'll try to keep this review short, since I feel like there is a reason I dragged my feet on it for so long even though I've got quite the backed-up reading list by now. These short fics are the two parts of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818][Wizards IN SPACE]] series, which I believe to be completed as it was last updated in 2016.

So what if, let's say, the Room of Requirement really could become anything you wanted? And, just say, a Muggleborn student wanted it to become a spaceship? In this story, set in OotP, the DA become the crew members of a seemingly abandoned spaceship, which really exists out there somewhere but is only accessible via the Room of Requirement. The spaceship is based on Stargate, and the fic is considered a crossover for this reason, but there are no other crossover elements to the fic, so it can be easily read and understood by anyone who has never seen an episode of Stargate in their lives (i.e., me).

D.S.S Requirement is told from Harry's perspective, and Harry alone seems to feel quite removed from the fervour and thrill that the rest of the DA are feeling when they discover the ship. He is the steadying influence, the voice of reason and the hand on the reins, which is very out of the ordinary for Harry. D.S.S Enterprise is told from the perspective of Marietta Edgecombe's mother, and how she gets eased into her daughter's incredible new world, examining the impact the ship will have on the upcoming war and wizarding and muggle society alike.

It should be said that I am not the intended audience for this fic. If you have a nostalgic love of science fiction, feel within your soul the wonder of the endless possibilities of space, and your eyes light up at the idea of the world of Harry Potter crossing over with those possibilities, then you will love this story.

If any of the above does not apply to you, you might find yourself wondering when the plot begins.

There's a feeling of childlike excitement in the discovery of the ship and the effect is has on the members of the DA. It's a safe, happy place with a safe, happy, feel-good story that way, because everything else about the Harry Potter series sort of falls away. We no longer worry much at all about the goings on with Umbridge, or what Voldemort might be up to, and all interpersonal conflicts between characters just stop. And since I'm not someone who can lose myself in that particular fantasy, some of the zest and flavour of the Harry Potter series just goes away with the conflict, leaving it feeling bland.

This is not to say it's badly written. It's a little on the unpolished side, but overall writing quality is good. It's just that it feels like a baseline -- a springboard for a much larger story, and not a standalone. Nearly the entire fic -- including most of the dialogue -- is exposition. You know, like when you go visiting the department of backstory? You keep waiting for the snap back to reality, to the present. But D.S.S Requirement is more an experiment in world building than it is a structured story, and that wasn't something which captured me.

I think this one is a recommendation for sci fi fans as a kind of sugar pill, but probably a pass if you're not big into the genre. If this is indicative of author's writing style in general, then I'd say that their strength lies in developing really interesting premises and prompt-writing, but might need someone else to take the baton and write a plot to do their scenarios justice, because this absolutely could be the opener for a wild story.

** You hit the nail on the head regarding Esama's writing - I find they write some of the most unique premises in HP fandom, but often leave works unfinished or only barely delve into the topics. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603]]) is my dream concept for a fanfiction, essentially The Martian with Harry Potter magic instead of technology, but it ends very quickly and leaves a lot of the plot up in the air.

Sometimes it's better when they do a less detailed story, however - linkao3(1113588) is an interesting premise, especially since it forgoes actually involving characters from the Sherlock/SH universe, but really couldn't have been more than a one-shot and I think the author did a good job not artificially weakening Harry to come to a conclusion of the canon issues. Likewise, linkao3(1149623) is better served by glossing over the details, as it could very easily get bogged down otherwise.

All three do feature retrospective story-telling, as you noted, so it's safe to assume that's just the author's style. I'd avoided this series in the past because I'm not familiar with Stargate, but I should have realized that the author does a good job of handling crossovers without needing excessive knowledge - I'm no more familiar with the world of Temeraire and still thoroughly enjoyed Island of Fire.

Very excited to see your thoughts on Valbone, reread it a few months back and thought it had some high highs and low lows.

Edit: Bot had some weird returns when searching by name, let's try story IDs.

Indeed. That is - apart from the story being unfinished, and the lack of a decent core cast - my biggest gripe with the story. Harry's the only character that consistently appears; the story cycles through the DA's roster, which means every character only appears as barely more than a cameo. If it had been the trio, and perhaps Luna, Ginny or the twins, we would have had a cast to care about and relatioinships to develop. With the entire DA all taking almsot equal spotlight time, well... it's all interchangeable. Only Harry seems to matter past "solving this problem".

And Harry feels "off". He has no passion, no drive, he doesn't appear as the charismatic leader people follow, which would have been somewhat plausible - he's the wise guy. The "team parental figure", so to speak. He has no real close friends either, as far as I remember; Ron and Hermione are barely more than acquaintances based on his actions and priorities.

I don't think that fits him at all - the voice of reason and planner would have much better fit Hermione, with Harry being the Kirk type leader who charges in and takes risk.

** Like most stories Esama writes - it starts out great, but goes nowhere. It has makings of a great story, there are some good ideas and general build-up, but there is nothing that really brings the story together at the end. No conclusion or culmination. Few ideas (like gold) were tad silly.

I loved the beginning and would have loved to see it evolve into proper story, but yeah. Most of Esama's work is just essays for story ideas. Rarely anything is finished.

** I enjoyed both. I'd agree that they feel like setup for a much larger story, which maybe someone will write and maybe they won't. Could be pretty epic if they do.

(Also, you have a duplicate paragraph.)
