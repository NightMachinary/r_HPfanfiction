While I'm not going to claim that the R-Series is perfect (Andromeda is way too passive about Harry's treatment, exaggerated Dursley abuse, pranking the Dursleys in return), the overall idea is intriguing and the interactions between the kids are cute.

So are there any stories where Harry runs into another student or soon-to-be student, they become friends and then they work together to get Harry away from the Dursleys? The story does not have to start in book one.

I don't mind cracky stories like Luna's hubby, so feel free to recommend similar stories. Please, no slash, no good Snape or Malfoy and preferably no Ron/Hermione.


** I dunno the R-series, in this story Harry becomes Cedrics brother linkffn(4084005)

  Summary: What if there was a small mistake in 1981, causing things to not be what they really seemed at #4 Privet Drive? Would Harry be different when he showed up at Hogwarts? What if a few things were done differently when Harry went to school? H/G
