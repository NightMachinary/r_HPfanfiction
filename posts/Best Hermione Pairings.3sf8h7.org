Some that I've tried and liked:

-h/hr

-remus/hermione (time travel)

-sirus/hermione (time travel... already read 'mia potter' and it was amazing)

-james/hermione (time travel)

-lily/hermione (time travel)

Things I would be interested in trying:

-severus/hermione (time travel only, the age thing sorta squicks me out... unless its like a forced mariage or whatnot... I can understand if something forces their hands)

-fred/george/hermione (either, both, anything... or even just short smuts would be interesting. Though I do prefer whole plots and stories.)

-tom/hermione (time travel? Idk how this would work, but am willing to try)

-anything else that comes to mind. Am open to ideas.

Prefer topics such as time travel, angst, love, animagus transformations, post hogwarts, etc.

Thanks in advance!


** Tom and Hermione stories in my opinion are often quite well written but are regularly unfinished. One issue I regularly have with it is that it's tends to be rather abusive.

If you feel like checking some out I'd recommend Ultima Ratio on ff.net by WinterBlume (on mobile sorry) or Carnivore by ReneeHarts oneshot also on ff.net.

** Hermione/Ginny

Harry/Hermione/Ginny - this is actually my favorite pairing, and there is one very good fanfic: *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382)

Hermione/Harry/Ron - This pairing actually makes lots of sense without breaking the canon story, but is certainly too adult themed.

** I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Draco/Hermione, considering it's the most popular pairing on FFN. It's not my favorite pairing, since those fics tend to be OOC or spend a lot of time on Draco learning not to be a bigot.

That being said, just due to the sheer number of fics, it's possible to find well-written stories, even if it's not your cup of tea. I've enjoyed a few that are set years after Hogwarts, since they can start fresh with Draco's character. For example: linkffn(5498748; 3878384).

** I would say "When a lioness fights," is the best Snape and hermione. However I personally like h/hr stories. Mostly because I see her as the strongest female character/alternate protagonist in canon. I like stories where the protagonist has an equal who is great to read about. Hermione being incredibly smart and powerful fits for me. Madscientist on portkey has written a few great h/hr stories. As background I love the sword of truth series because while the main protagonist is powerful and interesting his wife is also the same.

** linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) is a really really good time-travel Severus/Hermione. The author's summary is dreadful, but I was completely engrossed. Over the winter holidays in Hermione's sixth year, Dumbledore sends her back in time six months to get extra training. And then continues sending her back and back again. Real plot picks up after Voldemort returns at the end of the 4th book. Hermione is essentially in her late 20's but she's never turned back before 1994. She's as isolated and damaged as Severus and the story picks up from there.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** This is a niche one but Hermione /Theo nott. He is completely a name in the books and hardly fleshed out, but if you like Hermione with slytherins and smart men, he usually fills that gap. And also because we know so little about him, authors usually use him as their own unique character. What we do know is that he's friends with Draco and they were close ish based on something JKR said, and that he is quite clever. So in my mind I think it may work.

** Well. Thinking about it, the obvious answer is Percy Weasley.

They would be the only the only two people who could stand each other all the time. Anyone else would get annoyed by the other. Both of them refuse to acknowledge that they're in the wrong until it stares them in the face, so that's another quality they both have. Both go on and on about rules, but break rules themselves when they see fit.

Sounds as good a match as it can get.

*** Sounds like a recipe for disaster, even more than Hermione & Ron. The best couples have different but complimentary traits- if one is brash the other is diplomatic. One is ambitious then the other should be supportive. The important traits to align would be values, feelings about child-raising and money-handling, similar senses of humour and agreement on sexual expectations. This doesn't require identical belief systems, just agreeable ones.

Percy and Hermione would compete in the same arenas with neither likely to give an inch if they're strong in their convictions on something. The sex might be great, but the relationship would be a fiasco.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5497778/1/Bookends][Arthur/Hermione]]

I don't think it's the best, seriously my all-time favourites are Draco/Hermione and Severus/Hermione, but that very unusual pairing somehow kind of worked out in that fic, so in a thread about Hermione pairings I thought I'd link it.

People often say Draco has to be very OOC for dramione to work out, but I don't believe that. In the last two books he is getting a serious dose of reality that made him question things he had thought to be true all his life about what is right and what is wrong. How far isn't clear in canon, but you can be perfectly canon compliant while claiming things Harry doesn't know, as long as it doesn't interfere with his observations.

Although it's a tragedy, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3187054/1/For-You-Always-For-You][For You, Always For You]] is one of the better (short) dramione fics there is.

And since you asked for it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5500156/1/Tempora-Abducto][Tempora Abducto]] is my favourite tomione story so far.

** If you want to see a canon timeline Snape/Hermione that is well done, I highly, highly recommend linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria). It was the first SS/HG fic I read and it really showed how such an improbable relationship could have developed during the canon timeline. For SS/HG time turner fics, linkffn(An Unwritten Future by Aurette) is probably my favorite.

Also Draco/Hermione is probably one of the most popular non-Harry centered ships in the fandom and great fic for that pairing is linkffn(Isolation by Bex-chan).

** My all-time favourite SSHG time travel would have to be linkffn(Pride of Time). I think the author really keeps both Hermione and Severus in character. I actually have a whole list of fics I've read and asterisks next to the ones that I particularly enjoyed. Let me know if there Is a particular pairing you're looking for, and I can check my list. There's also a few crossover pairings with Hermione that I enjoy. Spencer Reid (Criminal Minds)/Hermione is one of my favorites.

I ship Hermione with almost every male out there, except for Death Eaters (minus Lucius) the older Order members, and Peter Pettigrew.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Personally, I think that Hermione x Power is my favorite even though I can't remember any right now. My post canon headcanon for her is the marriage to Ron failing horribly and her just snapping one day over how brainless everyone else is, faking her own death in some kind of explosion that kills Ron and becoming a dark lord.
