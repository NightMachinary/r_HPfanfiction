I'm a Harry Potter fan along with a fan of several other series. I have noticed some authors put the CW tv show supernatural in some of their fanfics as a side story or other characters to run into. Problem is I can never find them cause you type supernatural in an search engine it's not usually the tv show that comes up. While if you search specifically for the tv show Supernatural... that is stuff of nightmares. A good example would be the story “To be a Demon God in Marvel.” On Web Novel. Which is a mix of marvel, Harry Potter and other shows and series in it he ran into dean winchester in the submarine and arc of the covenant episode where dean went back to world war 2 I thought that was an awesome touch and am looking for more book like that. Where it isnt just Harry Potter at hogwarts and dumbles bashing. (As much as I love a good fumblemore bashing)
