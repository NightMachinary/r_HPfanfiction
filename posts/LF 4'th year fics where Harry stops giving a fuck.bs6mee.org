Dragon? Giant Squid? Sphinx? Wormtail? Why bother with strategy when you can just one-shot them with unforgivables.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

**** The author wrote and published a 200k+ story after abandoning Daft Morons though. The same, tired excuse of his muse not being there.

You have to get over just about every trope in HPFF that Sinyk REALLY throws in your face in just the first few chapters, only to find out he'll never finish it. It starts off like maybe Harry is going to actually grow a back bone, but as it progresses he lets everyone walk all over him, and he whines all the fucking time.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** I won't say I disagree with that entirely, I'm surprised their friendship could survive a blow like Ron abandoning them regardless of their long friendship and the.... "mitigating circumstances" of the corruption of the locket... Heck, I'm surprised you could throw two depressed hormonal teenagers in a tent together for months alone and not have Hermione end up pregnant by the time Ron got back, particularly after their night of dancing in the tent, but still, despite the fact that he has a jealous streak a mile wide, at his core he's still a decent person, although in Harry's shoes idk if I could have trusted him regardless after the GoF incident, much less after he completely abandons them in the woods to go home and cry to mommy >.>

****** Harry told Ron to leave in the tent, while Ron was wearing a horcrux to boot. Not to mention they had absolutely no plan and no idea where to go next, thanks to Dumbledore. Ron didn't have to stay there with them, he chose to, and when he questioned whether his family was okay Harry snapped at him. He immediately regretted listening to Harry, but couldn't find the tent to come back.

As for GoF, yeah I agree Ron was a jerk, but he never picked on Harry. Even Hermione was on the fence until all the authority figures came out and said "He didn't do it!", so Ron's not entirely to blame there either.
