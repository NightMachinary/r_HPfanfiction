Exactly what the title says. I'm looking for a good plot and characterization and slow burn romance. Long and complete is preferred, but I'll read anything if it's good!


** Linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities)

Hermione is supposed to be with Snape to comply with the Marriage Law. There's good plot, especially the line involving McGonagall, and a slow burn romance. It's long and complete but somehow I've got the feeling it's not what you're looking for.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play
