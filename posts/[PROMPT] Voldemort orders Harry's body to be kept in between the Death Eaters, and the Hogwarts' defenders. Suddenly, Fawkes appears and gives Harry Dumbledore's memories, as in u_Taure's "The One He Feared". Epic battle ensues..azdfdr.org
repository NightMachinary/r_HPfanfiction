  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Harry gaining ownership over the Elder wand and beating Voldemort was already a deus ex machina pulled by JKR. What exactly is accomplished by Harry gaining Dumbledore's memories at that point other than look cool in final duel? It worked in The One He Feared because it was right after Dumbledore dies and the trio still needed to hunt for horcruxes. The only way it might work is if its a One Shot of the final battle and an epilogue. Even then its simply going to undermine Harry and the Trio's efforts to win the war.

** You know...I just had a mental image of such a scene going the way of Super Metroid. In a one-on-one duel between Voldemort and Harry at the gates of Hogwarts, in full view of both sides, Voldemort brings Harry to his knees, but Fawkes suddenly appears and intercepts Voldemort's killing curse.\\
Flying over to Harry and shielding him with his body, Fawkes revives the Boy-Who-Lived with his tears and other magic, and imbues Harry with knowledge of Dumbledore's most powerful magicks, before he's destroyed by some of Voldemort's darkest magic.\\
Harry soaks up Fawkes' ashes, and it gives him tremendous magical power, which combined with the aforementioned shared knowledge lets him curse the heck out of Voldemort.
