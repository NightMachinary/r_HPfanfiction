The fics that never fail to keep you entertained


** The chessmaster. Slytherin trio AU, not Dark or evil. All three have their strengths and weaknesses and there's no Ron bashing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11543934]]

Into the Arena with your head held high. Post apocalyptic AU. Absolutely awesome fic by LullabyKnell who's an awesome author in general. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270]]

Face death in the hope. By LullabyKnell as well. Harry Potter Time travel fix it post canon. It's a WIP but it's absolutely worth it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366]]

The Definition of Normal. Slytherin harry AU, because of child abuse. Good Harry and a lot of world building integrated seamlessly into the fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464]]

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. Twin Wrong Boy Who Lived, Slytherin Harry. Good If morally grey Harry. Awesome plots and a ton of interesting world building, exploring concepts of Time travel, other magical communities, methamorphmagus and wild magic by using logic integrated in a plausible way with magic. Better than Methods of Rationality in my opinion. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15828654]]

World In pieces by Lomonaaaeren. Somebody Keeps summoning alternate Harrys to take care of their Voldemort problem. Snape mentorship, gryffindor Harry. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488]]

** Finding Himself by Minisinoo (Cedric/Hermione). The world-building and characterization is just absolutely phenomenal. You'll find yourself hating Umbridge even more. linkffn(4594634)

And also, the sequel: Dulce Et Decorum Est. Not complete per se, but the author did explain what the ending would have been at the end, so there's closure, at least. linkffn(7311272)

EDIT: I see that someone has been downvoting almost everyone's suggestions here. Why? I don't get it. Does someone out there just not understand how linkffn works or someone really, /really/ hates all the fics being suggested here?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is a great, Ginny-centric fic where she is placed in Slytherin. Incredible character growth and development, and lots of world building and inter-house mingling.

I haven't read a ton of James/Lily fics but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530029/1/Where-the-Air-is-Rarefied][Where the Air is Rarefied]] is an excellent one shot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31644?view_adult=true][A Life so Very Much Less Than Ordinary]] is a funny, heartwarming, slightly cracky fic about a middle aged Harry muddling through marital issues and parenting. Features some of the best depictions of Harry's adult children I've come across.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18196214/chapters/43042808][Harry Potter and the Metamorphogus]] the best of Harry/Tonks IMO; an interesting read - but beware, it's rated M for a reason.

Hope that helps!

*** I never in my life thought I would have liked "A Life so Very Much Less Than Ordinary" just based on the couples in the story. But I really really did. I breezed over some of the sexy stuff (which is not really my thing) but still found the characters very enjoyable, and even found myself relating to Ginny despite what she did. Thanks for rec'ing it! I've read the first two and figured that if we agreed on that much then I might as well give the other two a try. So I'll have to read the Metamophogus one next!

** My Unordered Top HP 20 Fics: a newly edited copypasta.

Most of these are either Hinny, Peggy Sues or both.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

Ongoing: Before I read Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. A classic.

Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: Astronaut!Ron, CleverGirl!Hermione, and the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a few things I take issue with, like the whole age line thing for instance. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and because I'm Hinny trash.

Finished: That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]]) is the only crossover in this list, that being with Doctor Who. That being said, you don't need to know a thing about Doctor Who to enjoy this story. Essentially, one of the most powerful monsters from that show is Harry's boggart, and the monster has some unique attributes that make them immune to the Ridikkulus spell. Honestly, the less you know, the better. Enjoy the thrills!

Finished: Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/]]) is a classic comedy fic. Instead of the main character being Harry, it's the part of Voldemort that became the Scarcrux. Hilarity ensues because Harry's insane, but not evil.

Finished(sort of): Like A Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/]]) Harry has red hair, and so is mistaken for a Weasley. They don't mind, and in fact, they adopt him. A classic crack fic, that's basically a fever dream crafted by Fred and George, and McGonagall is close to having an aneurysm.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Three's the Charm by MissCHSparkles linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

Ongoing: A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14041326]]) and it's sequel by Shrikanth1808 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14082594]]) is tagged as a “reverse parody,” in which it takes the premise of Umbridge finding and reading out loud to Hogwarts the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, and attempts to takes it seriously. There are a bunch of fics out there like it, but this is by far the best executed.

Ongoing: Strange Visitors From Another Century by Izzyaro linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/]]) In an accident in the DoM's Time Room when their trying to rescue Sirius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up stranded during the time of the Hogwarts Founders. Salazar doesn't have a good time when he learns what the future thinks of him. They learn that there have always been and will always be Dark Lords. The version of the Founders in this fic is my official headcanon.

Ongoing: The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/]]) is a fic where Harry, and then eventually Hermione and Dean all either live at or become a common visitor of a Muggle facility for disadvantaged kids. Only for both the doctors and the kids to realise they can do magic. McGonagall doesn't know what she's in for when she arrives with letters.

Abandoned: Second Chances by Mara Rome linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4564794/1/]]) is the only traditional Severitus fic I can say I've completely enjoyed so far. Harry and Snape aren't related in any way, thank god, and it has all the things I love so much in hurt/comfort fics. It's set in the summer between GoF and OotP, and it all starts off when Harry uses a glamour charm when he gets checked on by Arthur. Cue warning from Ministry, Snape wants to catch the brat red-handed, only to find very familiar bruises.

Finished: Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/]]) in which Luna steals Ginny's diary and become friends with. Naturally, Tom hates every minute of it, and it's great. Not only is it funny to see the lord of evil just BSoD at all of the Luna he has to deal with, but it also has a really heartwarming ending.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Fridays.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(Too Young To Die) I like the portrayel of dark magic in this fic a lot. Writing isn't quite up to scratch though.

linkffn(Harry Potter And The Boy Who Lived) One of the best fanfics ever, hands down.

linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow And The God-Emporerless Heathens) Warhammer40k crossover, very good crack fic.

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) Good Romance.

linkffn(Betrayal) See above

linkffn(Emporer) Very different take on dark Harry.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) Embitterd!Harry. Very well done.

linkffn(Learning To Breathe) very good romance.

** Here are two I've read recently that I think everyone should read:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][“A Very Secret Diary”]] - one of the best fanfics I've ever read, really quite haunting as it goes along. Chamber of Secrets but told through Ginny's writings in her diary. Some mentions of Ginny having a crush on Harry, but it's not particularly important part of the plot and should absolutely not dissuade you from reading it. Genuinely terrifying, especially towards the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][“The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks”]] - Another haunting one. Harry remembers a small girl at his sorting called Sally-Anne Perks, but he seems to be the only one who remembers her. He and Hermione investigate, and eventually discover a chilling but also heartwarming truth about love and loss in equal measure. Set during third year, a brilliant mystery.

** I'm a huuuuge sucker for Marauder's era fic. I just finished linkao3(Glass of Water) and it's my new favorite -- it's STUNNING. It's written from Lily's POV as she becomes friends with Sirius during their sixth year. Genuinely beautiful writing.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is one of if not the best fanfics I've ever read. Don't let the seemingly unreasonable character decisions at the start put you off, by the end of the first book you'll have seen that there's a good reason for every characters decisions. It's just a superb fic all around.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(12388283) - The Many Deaths of Harry Potter - probably the best AU fic I've found so far. Great pacing and doesn't fall into a lot of the common time travel tropes.

linkao3(The Politician's Wife) - A post Hogwarts slow burn Draco/Hermione fic. Really nice character development that makes for an actually believable romance.

linkao3(Blackpool) - beautiful but heartbreaking fic if you're interested in the Black family's dynamics. Couldn't stop thinking about it for hours after I'd read the ending.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]
