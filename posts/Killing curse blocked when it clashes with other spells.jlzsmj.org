Am I the only one who likes this. In the movies when the killing curse clashes with other spells, it is blocked.

Perhaps I like it cause it looks visually pleasing.


** I think it doesn't make sense because unforgivables are unblockable save for physical shields. If it was known that any magic could destructively interfere with them then that would be used to devise a new shield spell for them. Frankly, I don't think that it makes sense at all for spells to stop/explode/redirect the unforgivable curses. Why are only shield spells suddenly different from other spells in interfering with unforgivable curses? Makes no sense.

** in the books it's always hard to tell how fast spells are moving.
