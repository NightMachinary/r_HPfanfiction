So we don't really know what the truth potion does with the mind, but I like the interpretation that it basically makes you incapable of lying while also forcing you to speak, like those babble spells from canon. I also like it when interrogations or sonesuch include the interrogated person keeping their accent and way of speaking, or essentially having a conversation rather than being in a trance, only that they absolutely have to tell the truth at all times.

It doesn't really make sense in canon, because people could just talk around the crux of the issue until it runs out, but it's fun. So what I'm looking for is people defeating it through various covert means;

For example, a parselmouth answering only in parseltongue, or a person obliviating critical memories first, or using fanon occlumency to truly make themselves believe what they're saying, or wandlessly messing with the potion and then faking the effect, anything like that.


** Can't say I love it as much as some, but I adored the Veritaserum workaround in /The Sum of Their Parts/.

** Special treat just for you, an excerpt from a story I'm working on, but won't post until I finish one of my WIPs. Sal, Fin, and Gil are the fake names of Sirius, Fred, and George, who have time-traveled to the first wizarding war. They're wearing disguises and pretending to be three brothers. Here young Sirius, Remus, and James are trying to test if these three mysterious brothers are legit:

Sal locked eyes with Remus and gave him a slight nod as he accepted his teacup. “Thanks.” He drank his tea as soon as it was a tolerable temperature. “Drink up, boys,” he said to his new brothers. “Don't want to waste good Veritaserum.”

“Wicked!” said Fin and Gil, downing their tea. They set their cups down with simultaneous clinks. “What was Angelina's favorite position?” Gil quickly asked Fin.

“Cowgirl,” said Fin. “Rode me like a broom, she did. You must know that, though. Didn't you ever pretend to be me and try her out yourself?”

“I thought I was discreet about it. When did you figure it out?”

“Just now. Anyway, it's what I did to all your girlfriends, so it makes sense you'd do it to mine.”

“I hate to interrupt,” said James, “But we have more important questions to ask before the Veritaserum wears off.”

“Really?” asked Fin skeptically.

“You haven't experienced Angelina,” explained Gil. He turned back to his twin. “She did call out ‘Oh George!' at a significant moment, so she must have known it was me. Unless she usually did that. Did she?”

“Never,” said Fin.

“My question may not have been specific enough,” said Gil. “Even with the help of Veritaserum, questions must be phrased right for the answers to be significant. My question implied that you managed to bring her to such a state that she called out anyone's name, which may not be a correct assumption. So to rephrase---“

“But are you three really from the future?!” James exclaimed.

“Yes,” the time travelers said in unison.

Fin addressed Sal. “In your dog form, did you ever---“

“I'm asking the questions here!” exclaimed James. “Why are you three tampering with time?”

“I apparently was fated to die in 1998,” said Fin. “Heroically.”

“When I saw his body lying there after the battle...” Gil's voice broke. “It took me a year, but I figured out how to steal a time turner and rescue him right before he died. So I'm from 1999, making me about a year older than my slightly older twin brother. Neat, I can say that under Veritaserum. I'm older than my older brother!”

“So this Angelina---“ began Sirius.

James quickly conjured a rolled-up newspaper and whacked Sirius with it. “Shut up. We're trying to do an interrogation here. Now Fin, what death did Gil, or George, this bloke here, rescue you from?”

“At the Battle of Hogwarts---“

“The what?” interrupted Remus, aghast.

“When Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts in 1998,” said Gil. “The professors, and the Order, and the older students defended it.”

“Which side---“ started Remus.

“Were you fighting for the Dark or the Light?” interrupted James.

“No,” said the twins simultaneously.

“It's not that simple,” said Fin. “We were part of the Order, of course.”

“You were working for Dumbledore,” surmised James.

“No, that old fool got himself killed in ‘97,” said Gil. “He wasn't the great strategist everyone thought he was.”

“You died in the same battle as Fred,” said Gil to Remus. “And your wife. I saw you lying there with the rest of the corpses. You left your baby an orphan, with Harry as his godfather, as if he'd have any clue about how to raise a baby, what with how he was brought up.”

Remus and James looked shocked at that, but didn't say anything.

Gil continued. “So I thought about rescuing you from the battle too, but really, there were so many people worth rescuing, it seemed inefficient to do it piecemeal.”

“So once he'd rescued me and stopped blubbering,” said Fin, “we decided to do this on a large scale as a team effort, and what better team than the Marauders? The good ones, anyway.”

“We decided to get Sirius first, as he'd definitely believe us after Halloween of ‘81,” said Gil.

“So he could introduce us to the rest of you, as so he has.”

“So you're really on our side?” asked James.

“Of course.”

“Definitely.”

“Absolutely.”

“You're traveled through time just to save lives?”

“Well, and end a few,” said Fin.

“Depends on the lives,” said Gil.

“Who are you here to kill?” asked James.

“Well, I suppose Azkaban might be a better place for him, but I wouldn't mind killing Pettigrew,” said Fin.

“And Bellatrix Lestrange,” added Gil,

“And Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange,”

“And Barty Crouch junior,”

“Wait,” interrupted James. “Barty Crouch is the head of the DMLE.”

“His son's a Death Eater,” said Fin.

“Made a pretty good DADA professor, though,” added Gil.

“I'll grant that,” said Fin. “Oh, and I wouldn't mind killing Alecto and Amycus Carrow.”

“We can't forget Dolores Umbridge!”

“And I'm not fond of Lucius Malfoy,”

“Or Fenrir Greyback,”

“Or Igor Karkaroff,”

“Or Ludo Bagman.”

“Wait,” said James. “You mean the beater for the Wimbourne Wasps?”

“He cheated us out of our World Cup winnings,” explained Fin.

“Not that we want to kill him over that, exactly,”

“Just make him suffer a little,”

“Or a medium amount,”

“And various other Death Eaters.”

“Like Evan Rosier,”

“Walden McNair,”

“What's-his-name Nott, Theodore's dad,”

“Crabbe, Vincent's dad,”

“Goyle, Gregory's dad,

“Antonin Dolohov, before he kills Gideon and Fabian and Professor Lupin,”

“Ooh, that's a good one. And Augustus Rookwood,”

“And Something Avery,”

“Gibbon, not the monkey, the Death Eater.”

“Jugson,”

“Mulciber,”

“Selwyn and Travers, for what they did to Mr. Lovegood.”

“And Corban Yaxley, earlier this time,”

“Thorfinn Rowle, although his incompetence may have hurt his own side more than ours.”

“Yeah, I'm not sure about him. How about Petunia and Vernon Dursley?”

“Hm. Do they deserve death, though? Maybe just imprisonment. In a cupboard.”

“Wait,” said James. “You mean Lily's sister?”

“Yes. Although if we're going to name them we should also name Albus Dumbledore, although he has at least some good qualities.”

“Do those good qualities make up for him plotting to kill Harry, though?”

“What?!” exclaimed Sal.

“He had this overly-elaborate plan of human sacrifice for the greater good,” explained Fin.

“It sucked,” said Gil.

“But Harry...” said Sal.

“You don't mean...” started Sirius.

“My godson,” explained Sal. He looked at James. “Harry James Potter. Your son.” He looked back to the twins. “You're saying Dumbledore's plan involves killing him?!”

“Yes,” the twins said in unison.

James fell off his beanbag. “What?!”

“Does Harry turn out evil or something?” sputtered Sal.

“No.”

“Harry's a good friend of ours.”

“Best seeker the Gryffindor team ever had.”

“Invested his Triwizard Tournament prize money in our business,”

“Married our sister,”

“Saved the wizarding world.”

“But Dumbledore is a snazzy dresser,” said Fin.

“True. Gave us candy,” added Gil.

“Very true. Let's just wait for him to kill himself.”

“All right. Well technically he had Snape do it for him.”

“How about Snape, though?” asked Fin.

“Hmm... No, we probably shouldn't.”

“He sliced your ear off. Got professor Lupin's old tweed jacket so bloodstained he had to throw it away, and what he wore after that was even shabbier.”

“True. Harry likes him for some reason though, so let's not.”

“Maybe because Snape killed Dumbledore.”

“Yeah, that does make Snape more likable.”

“We're running out of names of people we'd kill.”

“Except---“

“Don't say it.”

“I don't like this question.”

“You're making us sound like rampaging murderers.”

“Ask something else, quick.”

“I have a question about those pills,” started Remus quietly.

“No distractions,” said James.

Remus shut up and faded into the background in that way he had.

“They're trying to fight the Veritaserum,” explained James. “They're hiding something.” He turned back to the time travelers. “What are you trying to hide? Who are you really here to kill?”

“Voldemort! Oh shit,” said all three brothers at once.

Gil tilted his head to the side. “Did you hear that?”

“Sounded like apparition,” said Remus. He was instantly on his feet, wand drawn. “He has a taboo on his name.“

“Guess you should have thought of that before giving us Veritaserum,” said Fin. “Disapparate! Evasive maneuvers, then meet you at the Shack.” He turned on the spot. “Fuck, anti-disapparition ward. All right, we stand and fight.”

Gil started pulling things from the inner pockets of his green dragonhide jacket. He distributed a pair of flimsy black-plastic-framed eyeglasses to each of them. Each pair was equipped with bushy black eyebrows and a large pale nose. “Put these on, fast.”

“Disguises?” asked James, looking at his pair skeptically. “I don't think---“

James stopped talking when Gil reached into his pocket again and drew forth a small black box. He opened it, and that was the last thing Sal saw for a moment. The world went black.

“I suggest you put the glasses on,” came the disembodied voice of one of the twins, his grin obvious in his voice.

“Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said the other twin. “Those glasses are the only way to see through it. Patented.”

Sal put on the glasses and found that he could see, but only in shades of grey, like an old muggle movie.

Everyone drew their wands.

“About time,” Gil said with a wicked grin. “This meeting was getting dull.”

“How convenient!” said Fin in delight. “Our targets have come to us!”
