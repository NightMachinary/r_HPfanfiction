Yesterday in the thread about King's Cross,many people were bringing up Molly's love potion story and acting like her drugging Arthur with it is canon

It's not. It's pure fanon shite . We don't even know if Molly actually used it or if it blowing up and stinking out Gryffindor Tower is the funny story she tells Hermione and Ginmy

You can cook Meth just for the fun of it, but doing so is rather suspicious and most people who do that don't.

** Pottermore implies it was less than innocuous, although the real reason people harp on it is because Molly was an obnoxious piece of shit to Sirius in his own home, she believed Rita Skeeter about Hermione, and well that's pretty much it.

  Molly Weasley, you dark horse. Hard to believe but Mrs Weasley admitted to Hermione and Ginny to making a love potion in her younger days.
#+end_quote

That's just a repetition of what was mentioned in the books, so there's nothing new to put the info in a different light. We still don't know how or even if she planned to use the potion.

Actually, in some cases it /is/ a compliment. It's bit weird that the article used the term without context, but it could have been referring to her unexpected defeat of Bellatrix.

******** Mostly about it being little known.

Making a love potion itself isn't complimentary either.

But like I said earlier, it's mostly because of her /winning/ personality in Canon.

** I remember about twelve years ago I read a romance fic of her and Arthur getting together that started off with her trying to dose someone for a prank or something, and accidentally copping Arthur with it instead. Hijinks ensue, and after she gets him to drink an antidote they end up dating.

Thought that was a good way to disarm something that JKR tossed in there in her characteristic blithe fashion.

*** It still doesn't work. Dosing someone with a date rape drug isn't "a prank". The mental state it puts the target in and the vulnerablity they have towards taken advantage off isn't "hijinks".

****** I mean, quite a lot of human activity is nudges to make people more likely to date you. Like wearing a nice shirt or going to the gym. I don't think it's reasonable to say you raped someone if they wouldn't have slept with you if you had made a bad first impression, and I think (hope) that most love potions are more on that level

(Yes, it was a few months old, but given how easy such performance enhancement are, that's not a point in favour of the Potions).

Is it dawning on you why love Potions are not just a small nudge then?

Nope, completely legal over the counter stuff that's been lying around for some time. And that was just the legal stuff.

** Not only Molly did brew a love potion, but Arthur is addicted!

​

"Molly, I want the good stuff!"

​

Molly knew better than to think by " good stuff" her husband meant what was between her legs. /Well, I suppose it is my fault./

"Try not to snort it all, will you?" She had quickly discovered the powdered version of her modified love potion offered the best results: it was scentless, tasteless and by snorting the powder, Arthur´s kidneys were not as affected.

"Molly, my little Potions Queen! You did it again! " Arthur smiled maniacally at her as he snorted more and more of the pink powder. " You gotta start brewing for Harry- our Ginny needs those galleons!"

Molly sighed. How could she have known that reading those stupid books would turn Ginevra into such an obsessed fangirl? /Well, I guess it is my fault also- I made my bed, as they say./ " I had hoped Ginevra would not need my help, Arthur."

Truth be told, she also did not need to poison Arthur at all. They were going steady and surely, he would have proposed. But Molly badly wanted to lose her virginity in a broom closet and Arthur had wanted to wait until they were married.

So, she created a potion to allow Arthur to overcome his inhibitions so that her lust would be sated

She fell pregnant with Bill on her first time- probably, another side effect of her potion.

"The girl needs all our help- this could very well be our ticket out of this shithole!" Arthur earned well enough to support their family in relative luxury, but his addiction meant that great part of his paycheck would end up at Knockturn Alley...

Molly nodded. /Oh my, I will have to go myself- poor Errol found my secret stash again!/ " Should I also brew for Ron?"

Arthur considered: " Why not? I hear dentists are pretty rich...that Granger girl must be loaded!"

** She tried to make a love potion, so basically a rape drug. And it is shrugged of as a fun story to tell the girls.

Now imagine if it was a man telling two boys about how he tried to drug, rape and manipulate a girl he liked.

**** Apart from her whole story about making it at least. So we know that she at the least intended to use such a thing. Buying, or making a "rape drug" is pretty damn bad in, and of itself. While we don't know what happened, we know what was intended to happen, and crimes are always about intent. Almost killing someone, and almost murdering someone are two very different things, one was an accident, or unintentional, the other was premeditated, and *intentional*.

So while we have no proof, we at least know that she had intent, and what she intended to do was quite horrible.

** Well, is there WoG that she didn't? I mean Arthur is such a non-personality in the books (he's the whipped man of the overbearing (and lazy, because with magic you can do chores in minutes and there's no excuse to stay at home when all your kids are at school and your family is poor!) Molly Weasley who he hides from in the shed to tinker with muggle items!)...so it might very well be true :(

ps: Yes, I am biased because I frankly don't like Molly!
