So, 13 years ago (god) just a few weeks before Order of the Phoenix was released, I found what was purported to be a leaked copy on a file sharing program.

[[https://archive.org/details/FakeOrderOfThePheonix]]

Obviously it wasn't the real thing. I was disappointed and didn't read it. However, years later I found it and its sequel, [[http://www.angelfire.com/planet/matrix-darkside/E-Books/Harry%20Potter%20&%20The%20Ring%20of%20The%20Ancients.pdf][Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients.]] and I decided to actually read them.

The books were, in my opinion, very silly. Draco and Dudley suddenly become nice, Draco gets with Ginny, Voldemort is Harry's grandfather, Voldemort was working for Dumbledore the whole time, a couple of super edgy cool kid OCs, etc. And huge chapters are nothing but wizard duels and wizard card duels. Despite all that, I found it a really fun read, in a sort of "wow i can't believe this" sort of way.

So...I guess what I'm looking for is some novel-length fanfiction that's not great, necessarily, but the author was clearly really into it, and maybe more in the style of pre-OotP speculative books. I'm also interested in good novel style fics, just ones that really capture that feeling of being at Hogwarts for another year, be it alternate canon or 8th year fics.

Kind of a vague request, but maybe something will come to mind, though I realize it might be difficult to recommend something that doesn't get much in the way of good reviews. Thanks, guys!


** Try the Psychic Serpent trilogy. Probably exactly what you are looking for.

** Perhaps a bit too divergent for what you're looking for, but you might like A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight (and its sequels).
