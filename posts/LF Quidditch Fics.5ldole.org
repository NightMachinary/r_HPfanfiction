Hello homies. Can any of you guys recommend fics with quidditch as the focus? Anything with a fair bit of well written quidditch scenes would be good as well. Happy New Year homies.

*** Vitam Paramus by the same author is a way better quidditch story. And also longer. And also just got an update. >.>. I'll go back to hiding in my corner now.

**** Yeah but I feel like Quidditch world cup has more quidditch scene than Vitam Paramus. Also the epilogue wasn't exactly what I expected but good job finishing the stiry.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.
