The fight scene:

Hugo leads a blindfolded Hermione into the backyard.

#+begin_example
         ON THE BACKYARD 

         Ron's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a 
         FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all.

         Ron stands behind it all, in a tux.


     Hermione 
         Well, might as well wait for your sister. 

                        Ron 
         What? 

                        Hermione 
         Your sister

         Huh? Just then: 

         VOICE (O.S.) 
         Hello? 

         From inside the house steps out... 

        Ginny

                        Ron
         Era!

                        Ginny
         Hi, brother.

         WTF! And right behind her... Harry. Holding a bottle of 
         wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.

                        Harry
         Ron?


                                         Ron
         What the hell are you doing here?

                        Harry
         What the hell are you doing here?

                        Ginny
         Wait, you two know each other?

                        Hermione
                        (STILL BLIND)
         Hi, Era. 

                        Ron
         Wait, what's going on?

                        Hugo
         Hey, Era.

                        Ginny
         Hey, Hugo.

                        Rose
         Hey, Era.

                        Ginny
         Hey, cutie.

                        Harry
         WHAT THE HELL IS AN ERA!?

                        Ginny
         It's me, I couldn't pronounce
         Ginevra when I was little -- wait,
         so how do you know my brother?

                        Harry
                        (REALIZING)
         Oh, God. 

                        Ron
                        (FREAKING)
         I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING
         ON HERE!

                        Ginny
         Ron, this is my boyfriend, Harry.

                        Ron
         No. No. No. No.

                      Hermione
         I want to see the boyfriend!
              (STRUGGLING WITH BLINDFOLD)

         Can someone please take this off?

                        Harry
        YOU HAVE A SISTER!?

                        Ron
         YES!                        
                        Harry
         WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?

                        Ron
         YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY FAMILY!

                        Ginny
         So you two, like, really know each
         other?

-Xeno picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF COURSE, readies to bash it over Ron's head. Luna throws herself on Ron.

#+begin_example
                        Luna

Daddy, stop!

-This breaks Xeno's trance. He hesitates.

                        Hugo
              (PROCESSING)

#+begin_example
              Ron
#+end_example

                        Hugo
                    (TO Ron) 
#+end_example

#+begin_example
         Everyone turns: Draco Malfoy stands in the doorway. 
         He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand.

#+end_example

-In an accusing manner

Draco Malfoy...

#+begin_example
                        Ron
#+end_example

-Eyes squint slightly in anger.

         Draco Malfoyâ€¦

             Harry
#+end_example

Okay

-Takes off his ring and walks over to Draco and Ron follows.

#+begin_example
                        Draco  
#+end_example

Is this a bad time?

#+begin_example
                        Hermione
#+end_example

Yeah---

WHACK!!! Harry LEVELS Draco Malfoy with a right hook.

#+begin_example
                        Ginny 
#+end_example

Harry!

-Xeno starts to make his way over as well

#+begin_example
                        Harry
#+end_example

Do you know how much pain and suffering you caused my friend you dumb bastar--

-Before Harry can finish, Ron grabs a hold of him awkwardly.

#+begin_example
                        Ron
#+end_example

Stay the hell away from my sister!

-Xeno grabs ahold of Ron

#+begin_example
            Xeno
#+end_example

You stay away from my daughter!

-Draco gets back up and also grabs onto Harry

#+begin_example
            Draco
#+end_example

#+begin_example
             Harry
#+end_example
