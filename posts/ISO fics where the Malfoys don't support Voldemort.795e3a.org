I just read Harry's Cousins based on a recommendation in another thread, and really enjoyed it.

I'm looking for stories where the Malfoys either change their minds about supporting the dark lord or where they were reluctant to become death eaters in the first place but did it because it was expected/required of them.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Malfoys were good guys in the other dimension.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy was actually pretty cool in this story.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Linkffn(Dragonkin by Fyreheart)

Forewarning, this is a slash fic. It's tame by all standards and has no explicit scenes if I remember right. In fact I read a lot of it before I even realized it was a slash fic. Not my usual cup of tea, but it fits your description of the Malfoys very well.

It's not really a huge focus in either of those though. Or at least, I don't think it is.

Edit: fixed a word.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
