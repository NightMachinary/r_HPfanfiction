#+TITLE: Looking for story where Harry and crew are on a hill (possibly) looking a city Voldemort has created where he is the leader. My distinct memory is airships in the sky? Also, the people in the city live by a caste system where purebloods have the nice houses, etc down to muggles cleaning up the shit.
