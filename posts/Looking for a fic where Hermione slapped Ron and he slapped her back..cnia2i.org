Read it a couple of years ago but I'm pretty sure it was a pretty old fanfic. I don't think it was that good, but I kind of felt like finding it and reading it again. The whole premise was Ron and Hermione getting in to an arguement and then Hermione slapping Ron couple of times. And then he slaps her back in a moment of anger. Obviously Hermione and Ron are distraught and break up. I'm pretty sure the endgame was still romione and they get back together after some time. I remember Hermione's mom being in the story as well. And iirc they were teenagers still, not really sure. But they got back when they were a little older.
