** My guess is that sometime after some people got angry about Hermione being black in the Cursed Child, JK Rowling said that Hermione /could/ be black even though it wasn't supported in the text. Not just physically, but socially Hermione's reactions to blood purity are of someone encountering prejudice for the first time which doesn't make a lot of sense for a minority character. This was before people had universally jumped on the "Rowling is ruining the canon" train.

After that, people on the internet just went "well, there's nothing in the text that explicitly /says/ James can't be Indian" and there were a number of tumblr headcanons that arose from that. I'm not familiar with the current tropes, but I wouldn't doubt that it grew from there.

Personally, I don't quite think it fits within canon, but it's really not hurting anyone to have diverse characters. Also, it's not like canon is a Sacred Cow. That much became obvious somewhere between when Rowling said that purebloods used to shit in place and vanish their poops, and the entirety of Fantastic Beasts.

*** I don't object in principle, but I was reading a story recently where the Potters had come to England from India hundreds of years earlier, presumably married English people all that time, and yet, Harry (whose mother was a redhead) was still super dark-skinned, and, upon learning about his heritage, started wearing traditional Indian clothing (despite having lived all his life in England). There's a fine line between representation and exoticism, and that kind of thing can feel a bit clunky and obtrusive. If you want to write about Indian characters, why not write about the Patil twins, for whom those kinds of themes could be a more natural fit? Why not write about Dean or Angelina or Lee or Kingsley rather than making white characters black when it doesn't really fit their story? It's like people want the cred for writing characters of color but don't /really/ want to write about characters of color, and it just gets weird sometimes. Not to mention the stories where it's like, "Black Hermione (who was black) walked blackly into the room and smiled at her non-white friends, white teeth gleaming against the extreme blackness of her skin. 'Isn't wonderful not to be white?' she exclaimed. 'White people are the worst!'" - like, I get that your intentions are good, but you're overdoing it and starting to come off like a character from Get Out.

This is the sibling of the "Harry instantly becomes treated like a powerful lord and taken ultra seriously because he just learned he had titles the day before" trope.

** No no, this is how it should be:

- James - Indian

- Sirius - Italian

- Remus - French

- Pedro Pettigrew - Mexican

- Lilyfu - Japanese

Now you have all the best cuisines covered.

*** Korean food and Thai food are both pretty dope though. Maybe the Weasley's and Hermione can be that. We also need someone for BBQ. Plus banh mis and dim sum are both pretty great too. Maybe we can get a half Indonesian half Dutch character so they can eat some rijsttafel. What celebrity chef should be the potions professor. Gordan Ramsey was already done, so this needs someone else.

*** Mainly because alot of people view doing this as a kind of reverse white washing of the characters. Especially since outside of someone REALLY trying to make the changes apparent and important to the plot they tend to not be.

As an example half Indian Harry would be fine if he was raised by his Indian father since he might still have some idea of what being Hindi means and maybe an Indian accent. But most of the time people only use Indian Harry as an excuse for the dursleys to hate him when they don't need the added excuse, they hate him for his magic already them hating him for being a minority doesn't add anything to the story. It also doesn't help that he would literally be the same character but have brown skin, nothing changes since again he isn't raised in the tradition to make the changes noticeable.

Edit: mind you I didn't downvote you but I'm just explaining why some people might downvote the topic. I personally love the ideas of Irish Harry

***** And that would work out, I'm just saying that most writers (mainly inexperienced ones) use it as an excuse to have the Dursleys hate him when again the Dursleys really don't need further excuses. Honestly I'm not against Harry being part indian, i think it'd lead to some interesting world building especially if his father left him something that explained his heritage to him, but the problem is most writers just follow the stations of canon instead of thinking of something new.

Also alot of Authors ESPECIALLY my fellow Americans seem to the think that someone who is a third generation indian who's abused by his aunt and uncle would know anything about his fathers culture outside of maybe what he learns from the library. Like he absorbs the full on knowledge of his culture through osmosis of the dead or something.

It's like expecting Goku to know what being a saiyan is like after he bumped his head and never met one for the first 18 years of his life.

**** Harry having white skin doesn't add anything to the story either. White is generally the default for protagonists, but there's no good reason to keep that default setting.

*** I think a lot of people have a knee-jerk reaction to downvote anything about race. Your question seems perfectly reasonable to me. You're just asking for the source of the trope, like which story started it.

I'm curious too now. I've seen Indian Harry, but not the Thai or French ones. Remus is a real surname in France, so I can see someone extrapolating from that to make the character French. I've seen someone argue that the “correct” way to pronounce his name is to use the French pronunciation. I argued that there's no evidence that he pronounces his name in any way other than the British way, and his mother is canonically from Wales, not France. He'd have to keep correcting all these British characters mispronouncing his name, and I can't see him doing that.

In fanfic, we can do whatever we want of course.

** I believe that it is a result of trying to force diversity into the fic. I have not read too many of these types of fics ever since I read a Indian!Harry fic in which the author was trying so hard to make Harry and Indian(or atleast what Americans think Indians are like) that was so cringy it was painful as an Indian to read(also slightly amusing realizing that that is what the Americans think we Indians are like)

** I think the trope became so big because people argue against it. I don't care for black Hermione, but the amount of hate I have seen under black Hermione fanart made me willing to defend it. People are annoyed by the outright racism and start adding other ethnicities to annoy the people that can't fathom headcanons.

There seems to be no problem with female Harry fanart or Harry being the descendant of 838 magical families or the fanfic where he actually isn't James and Lily son. Fae Luna is pretty common and halfgoblin Flitwick has pretty much transcendent. People are well aware that everyone was white in the books and are just having fun.

  here are so many fics that have James' being Indian, Sirius' being Thai, and Remus' being French
#+end_quote

Care to link a few? In all my time on here, I can't remember a single fic with any of those ethnicities for the above characters. Heck, even with all the talk of Desi!Harry, I think I've only read one fic with that and it was a throwaway comment and not exactly clear if he was part-Indian from his mum's or his dad's side.

** I have seen Indian James on /one/ fic, the only other time I have seen something similar to that is in artwork where people draw him to have a much darker skin tone, which makes no sense at all, but OK, it's just a change that doesn't give anything to the story.

I mean, sure, you COULD make something where Harry could reconnect with his ancestors' culture(perhaps with the help of the Patil twins?), you would also need to change his family tree a bit, but that's the easiest part.

Remus Lupin being french would be weird, he could be Italian too I guess, but I don't see how that could change the character.

Sirius would require a bigger explanation than Harry, his family were xenophobes of the highest order, I guess they would accept people with large lineages(the LeStranges) but still, more worldbuilding.

Again if someone does this just for the sake of having a diverse cast, well, it's not interesting for many and some will just ignore it unless it's relevant to the plot.
