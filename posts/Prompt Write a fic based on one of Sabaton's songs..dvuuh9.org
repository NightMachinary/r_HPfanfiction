** "The Final Solution" and "Rise of evil" can be about Death Eaters, Umbridge and Voldemort as they are. They are not-so-subtly inspired by the Third Reich after all. We burn would fit Voldemort's agenda as well

Last Dying breath, together with the speech it is based on, are a good match for the Battle of Hogwarts. As is Uprising. The choice here would be depending on the intended tone. Last Dying breath would fit a charge into certain death or a last stand, Uprising if you want it to be about the fighting spirit.

#+begin_quote
  ”Soldiers, exactly at three o´clock the enemy is to be crushed by your fierce charge, destroyed by your grenades and bayonets. The honour of Belgrade, our capital, must not be stained. Soldiers! Heroes! The supreme command has erased our regiment from it's records. Our regiment has been sacrificed for the honour of Belgrade and the fatherland. Therefore, you no longer need to worry about your lives: they no longer exist. So, forward to glory! For the king and the fatherland! Long live the King! Long live Belgrade!”

Resist and Bite can match the DA during DH. A small number being a great annoyance at great personal risk. The RoR would be their Ardennes forest. Unbreakable would match them as well.

#+begin_quote
  No matter our fighting

  The numbers will still count

  We're outgunned and few in numbers

  We're doomed to flag of fail

Saboteurs could be the inspiration if one was to write a fic about the resistance against Voldemort. Inmate 4859 as well if you want the resistance in Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?

  Soldier in Auschwitz who knows his name

  Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison

  Hiding in Auschwitz who hides behind 4859

White Death if Harry (or someone else) goes Death Eater hunting and picks them off one by one.

  After the dawn

  When morning is broken

  Snow once white turn to red

  Blood red snow tells

  What happened last night

  A tale of a sniper is born

In Flanders Fields for the aftermath of the war or the dead on the Order/DA side, but that one isn't technically by Sabaton.

#+begin_quote
  Take up our quarrel with the foe:

  To you from failing hands we throw

  The torch; be yours to hold it high.

  If ye break faith with us who die

  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

  In Flanders fields

*** Last Dying and Uprising could both be used in the Battle of Hogwarts, Last Dying in the initial fight, the losses and death, Uprising after Harry's suicide attempt, representing the reinforcements that came for the second battle.
