there's this time travel/master of death fic i've been reading. it's only got a eight chapters out rn but it's totally underrated. it's got a good amount of favorites but not nearly as much as it deserves. like honestly the only time travel fic i've read that's better that this (in my opinion) is i'm still here. it's by RagingSmurf and honestly it needs more attention. please go give it some love i don't want him to abandon it. it's on fanfiction.net so check it out!
