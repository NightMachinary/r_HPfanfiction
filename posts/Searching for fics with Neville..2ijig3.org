Anybody know of any good fan fiction where Neville is one of if not the main character? I don't mind too much about pairings (I like Neville/Draco and Neville/Harry but I know these are quite rare), so long as it's not Ginny because I can't stand that girl. I just love Neville.


** I am a huge Neville fan too! I actually have my own WIP that's Neville focused. It's Neville/OC and the OC is Draco Malfoy's twin sister, so if you like Neville/Draco I think you would be interested. It's rated M, over 300,000 words and takes place 6th year after Draco took the mark.

Also, I see someone recommended Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness and I just want to say that I personally love that fic, so you should definitely give that one a read.

** Greatest Neville/Draco ever is the [[http://ajhall.shoesforindustry.net/ebooks/8/ajhall_lust_over_pendle/][LoPiverse]]. (Though not canon compliant with the later books.)
