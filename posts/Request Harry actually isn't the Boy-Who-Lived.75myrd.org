So there's a lot of those Wrong Boy/Girl who lived stories where Harry ends up being the real Boy-Who-Lived. I don't want that.

I want a story where Harry actually isn't the Boy-Who-Lived. Now rather or not the real Boy/Girl Who Lived is Neville Longbottom or a brother/sister or whoever else I don't care.

I don't want people thinking it's character B when really it's Harry all along, I've read a fair few and don't particularly care for them too much. (No offense to anyone who does).

So yeah Harry is NOT the Boy-Who-Lived in anyway in the story. He could help the Boy/Girl who lived if he wants or not, but he isn't the Boy-Who-Lived.

Can be as canon as possible (with this change) or as AU as possible or anywhere in between

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather not have character bashing, don't like it. But if it makes sense for the story it's fine.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing any other pairing is fine

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine


** In linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Neville is the BWL and Harry's parents are in the hospital. One of the best fics I've read this year.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** linkffn(9057950) I literally just finished reading this like 20 minutes ago and it fits your criteria. Also features harry as a massive asshole and is genuinely dark. Not like "haha I'm dark but still friends with hermione and I'm still a chill dude" but dark like conducting magical experiments on classmates and oblliviating them dark.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash. She knew all about it because she asked a lot of questions and her aunt and uncle believed in answering them.Why is the sky blue, auntie? Why are b's and d's like in the mirror? Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.

*** I just read the first chapter of The Ilvermony Champion. It sounds like the poster child of WBWL stories. And from the first chapter, the author began his campaign of bashing Dumbledore. And it doesn't make sense in the story either.

Honestly, this is better than a lot of stories, and earns points with its use of Magical American terms, but it also doesn't meet the Original Poster's request at all. Why share this then?

And my suggestion to this thread: Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi linkffn(5353809) . It's quite famous, and maybe you've read it, but this is the first thing that came to my mind when I read the first post. (Contains Ron bashing, which I hate | doesn't have Dumbledore bashing, which I love)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11511190/1/][*/Hermione Granger's Guide To Gender Flip Fanfiction/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1865132/Hyaroo][/Hyaroo/]]

#+begin_quote
  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.
