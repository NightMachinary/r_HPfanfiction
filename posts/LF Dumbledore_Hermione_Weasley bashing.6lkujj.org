Not just regular bashing, but MAJOR DICK-SLAP bashing... I just want to feel the HATE against these characters...


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), has very serious Dumbledore/Hermione/Weasley bashing, but Harry didn't get together with Daphne here. On top of that, Amelia Bones, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, Pomona Sprout, and every Order member were all mercilessly bashed.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

**** Not really. The Sorting Hat never said that he was destined for Slytherin, just that it would lead him to greatness. Remember, Harry didn't really want to be great. He was just Harry.
