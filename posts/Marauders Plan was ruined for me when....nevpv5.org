Remus literally gets coerced into sex by Tonks when she KNOWS he's emotionally vulnerable. She promises that they will ONLY sleep in bed together and then insists on sex (even after he has turned her down many many times). She falls pregnant and ONLY Remus is blamed for not casting the contraception charm and nobody adresses Tonks' disgusting behaviour other than Sirius having an offhand thought about it. They then get married (unbelievable) because Remus believes that would be the honourable thing to do (after Tonks insists on keeping the baby). On top of all this, we learn that Tonks is quite happy to marry Remus even though she's essentially forced him into a horrible situation he doesn't deserve.. I could barely keep reading after this point! Tonks literally NEVER understands what she's done and Sirius only comments that she's immature and has made a mistake - but she's a grown adult for Christ's sake! She's not held even a little bit responsible for this entire thing and Remus is left to “do the honourable thing” once again and trap himself into this horrific shotgun wedding.

In books 6-7 the McGuffins became the entire story. Horcruxes, Hallows, memory seeking, the cabinet, etc. It was a video-game plot from there on out, always in search of another item rather than using magic to accomplish things.

**** It exemplifies how bad JKR was at writing romance. Keep in mind that this is the same world in which just-out-of-high-school kids start a store where they openly sell date-rape potions to kids and the girls think it's great. The same world where a ninth- or tenth-grade girl tried to use an even more powerful date-rape potion on Harry, hit Ron instead, and faced ZERO penalty for it even though everyone knows she did it. The same world in which Molly Weasley openly admits to teen girls (including her own daughter) how she used date-rape potions to capture the interest of her husband. The same world in which memory charms are just a daily-use tool for police and anyone else who can learn them. The Potterverse is a terrible, terrible world if anyone spends more than a minute analyzing it.

*** This.

Well, that and the "Wizards are Victorian" trope, which plays into the subject of this post. As I recall, that's why Remus was given all of the blame, and he was convinced to marry Tonks because the political ramifications would be bad for the entire Light Side if he didn't, which is even worse on a structural level.

We don't see any out-of-wedlock births or divorces in canon (that we know of) probably because it's a children's book, but people's /attitudes/ certainly don't seem Victorian. (My headcanon is that magic provides 100% foolproof birth control, so it's almost never an issue.)

Edit: and I think the "family magic" bit was /less/ subtle than in most similar cases.

** That sounds like good canon characterizations. I mean, canon Tonks literally grabbed and shook Remus when he was crying over Dumbledore's death, and told him it didn't mater how many times he told her no, she was going to keep pressuring him until he said yes. It's clear he eventually just broke under the pressure. Their canon relationship was abusive. It seems like whoever wrote Marauders Plan captured that canon abusive dynamic well.

Like there are cross overs but like...it's hard to explain it without really going into it but being a werewolf is a very physical and mental and social issue; like there are so many things going on that it's not just about Remus not accepting himself. The way people talk about werewolves is so incredibly full of different variables and she's like ‘well I don't think you're a bad person' like dude, what?

it's so wild that people from a privileged position tend to say ‘i don't care if you're...' which is honestly really shitty, because it takes away a whole bunch of environmental and societal issues and pressures that you have no control over, and is like addressing this person's struggles not by what they're experiencing, and the reasons they might not be wanting to enter a relationship at that time (which honestly in the middle of a war? It's a valid reason to put off or not want to be in a relationship) but by what other people say it is

And just the way people/like society as a whole treat people who are sick and won't get better is actually pretty similar in broad strokes to how people are treating lycanthropy in canon so I feel comfy saying that Tonks is being a shit by talking about value judgements others say when addressing why he wouldn't want a relationship, but if I was really digging in to the whole ‘illness' there would definitely be differences and similarities, because as fucked up as my body is and as shitty as people are about illness and poverty I haven't once craved human flesh (and thankfully I don't go a whole night every month that I can't remember, which would also be so unbelievably traumatising I find it hard to think about how that would be)

So like I'm defs not being like ‘we are all werewolves on the inside' or something but like, pain and social isolation and constant value judgements and all these other things really suck

I think in one of my stories though lavender goes on some big rant about lycanthropy being a curse and not a disease, so I defining am not saying it's the same thing

*sorry I just saw your last point and yeah, that was jk's thing and it's so unbelievably problematic that she went with that, just...on so many levels.

***** I really disagree. Copied the whole text. It is literally repeated a few times by both Tonks and Reus that the only reason keeping them apart is him being:

- a werewolf
- old
- poor

I honestly think it is quite offensive to victims of domestic violence and abuse (including my own mum) to put that on the same par as rape, emotional abuse, physical abuse, gaslighting etc.

EDIT: You only provided one example of why you think it was abusive, nothing else.

--------------

“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”

And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.

“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still wants to marry him, even though he's been bitten! She doesn't care!”

“It's different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely ---”

“But I don't care either, I don't care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin's robes and shaking them. “I've told you a million times. . . .”

And the meaning of Tonks's Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.

“And I've told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . .”

“I've said all along you're taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur's shoulder as she patted her on the back. “I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. “Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.”

“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.”

He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.

“This is . . . not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding everybody's eyes as he looked around distractedly. “Dumbledore is dead. . . .”

“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.

********* You're taking "seizing the front of Lupin's robes and shaking them." in a "HARRY DIDYA PUT YER NAME IN DA GOBLAROFAR" direction.

Using the above quoted section it is just as possible, and given Rowling's intentions, far more likely that what is meant here is an emotionally desperate action, to seize onto something, anything. Such actions are often taken by those /without/ power. You can imagine for instance a dickensian Wandless /seizing/ and /shaking/ the robes of a wizard in desperation. A child /seizing/ and /shaking/ the robes of a parent abandoning them, "please, don't go!"

I for one certainly don't read the actual canon passage as seizing and shaking /violently/, or with intimidation, or coercion. Unless you perceive honest heart felt communication such- she did lose her powers afterall. She was genuinely in love, and Remus also shared feelings for her. The issue is one of marriage. Remus is not rejecting Tonks advances. Remus is not lacking in feelings for her. Remus is saying I should not marry you because of how he views /himself/. Namely, as a danger, and unworthy (not young, not whole, no career, cursed).

Again, the situation is a young french woman showing she (still) adores her husband, a now maimed soldier. An ex-professor then saying, "his body hasn't been ravaged, he's got a career, and youth. The cases are completely ---” and his lover /seizing/ and /shaking/ - not him, bodily, but - his gown, saying, "I don't care if you - have a sickness or condition, have a criminal past, are a social pariah, are poor, are old, or if you were maimed, too - because I love you, and want to marry you anyway."

And then having three mature, morally upright individuals suggest support in their love and union. With several more who show no sign whatsoever of disapproval on her part or the situation.

And yes, I acknowledge that seizing and shaking another's clothes /could/ be, and would often be, violent and/or intimidating, but I really don't think that's how it was intended, how it was written, how it was perceived by Harry, Molly, Arthur, Minerva et al, nor how it should be perceived by us.

In short she wasn't being abusive, browbeating, manipulative or anything. It was simply "you shouldn't marry me, I'm no good," says insecure person, "you're wrong, and I do," says the other. I still think her character and Remus' and their relationship (if any) could have been handled much better, but so it is.

Considering that Tonks has much more power than Remus, she needs to be extra careful that she has his full consent, and she obviously doesn't.

Imagine for a moment that Remus genuinely didn't want to be in a relationship with Tonks. How was he supposed to express that? Wouldn't it look an awful lot like how he actually expressed himself? If he wanted out of this relationship, how was he supposed to safely do that? Would you want Tonks as your angry ex-girlfriend?
