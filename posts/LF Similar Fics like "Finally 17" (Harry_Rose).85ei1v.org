in this, Rose gets 17, so off-age, an proceeds to follow her Crush/Love on Harry, who is really hesitant at first, but then they have a Relationship. What i also like in that is that its hinted that Hermione would be willing to share her Bed with Albus or James (rather than Pansy), unfortunetely, nothing on this Side happens. What i dont like in this Fic, is that Rose gets Pregnant on their First try and Harrys reluctant and hesitant Behavior in telling the rest of the Family about their dating, despite Hermione as one of 2 Mainpersons already know about them. But i now want to know, if there are similar Fics, so: Harry has a (much) younger Girlfriend (after divorce?) or Ron. Im also interested in the said happening that Hermione and Albus/James might have a Relationship.


** These Dreams by Jeconais does it, but Harry and the OC's relationship doesn't come about until the end of the fic.
