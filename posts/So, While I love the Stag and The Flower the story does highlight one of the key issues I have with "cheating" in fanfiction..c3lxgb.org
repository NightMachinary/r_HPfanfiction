** It's not just fanfic. You can see that in regular fiction as well. And then you get to read the reviews where those who were cheated on criticise this approach. It's all in the name of true love.

** Literally just read the update, while I love this fic, you bring up a good point. Honestly most of the times cheating in fanfic is used it's used as a way to progress the story it's very hard to find a good story that does it right.

** To be fair, you'll see such justifications and mental gymnastics from the cheaters in real life as well.

** Could easily be solved by saying "Bill cheated you" instead of "cheated ON you" since the relationship between Fleur and Bill probably started as equals so for him to neglect her it'd be like taking advantage of her not leaving.

** I dropped the fic because, even if the escalation of such a relationship could possibly be this quick in real life, and out of the blue, I didn't feel it was justified enough. Now seeing this exchange between them, I think I made the right decision. It's a shame I can't tolerate drama and angst as well as I did in the past, i was curious about the cure for Neville's parents.

***** It does not lmao

Bill had been cheating on Fleur for a long time by that point. It's a huge point in the story, and it's mentioned multiple times. The people that upvoted your post obviously didn't know that, and just took you at your word. The cheating bit you bring up makes sense, but saying that she left Bill only because he didn't love her is factually wrong.

I hate cheating in all forms of media and life, because I was cheated on. I think it's horrible and despicable. But your post is wrong.

** That's why I like that other Harry/Fleur fic where Fleur and Bill are engaged, which name I can't remember... But unless I am forgetting something, they basically don't try to make excuses. They both acknowledge that it is wrong, and yet carry on with the relationship, which is also common to humanity and thus relateable/interesting, but isn't depicted that much in fiction (at least that I have seen).
