WARNINGS; mental illnesses (various). EDIT: I tried to make it more succint, since it was really long xD

Usually; 1) Protagonist has mental health issue.

2a) This continues to grow worse until emergency services are needed.

2b) This continues to grow worse until outside parties (usually friends/family/love interest) discover issue.

2c) This does not grow worse for long, as this is a short fluffy fic about the protagonist being able to trust their new family.

3) Recovery/mental health issue improves or becomes manageable. It's very rare to find a recovery fic where the protagonist dies/does not recover.

Things not often touched on; Harry and Narcissism (main character trait is humility and not wanting to be a celebrity, it'd be cool if someone could twist this around while Harry remains in character), Horcrux (identity issues, DID, pain management)

Sirius; Dark magic withdrawal, Black Family Madness, struggle with morality (Dark vs. Light etc.)

Dumbledore; senility? (it's joked about a lot, especially with bashing fics, but it could be interesting to actually approach this seriously, and with other age-based illnesses like dementia), lemon drops as an actual addiction.

Interesting spins (tell me if you find any others!)

1. Fic where outside parties don't notice, and protagonist comes to the realisation on their own through a long slow burn journey through observation and interactions.
2. Recovery fic with two+ majoy arcs, an initial recovery and an in depth second recovery
3. Fic that once the person is recovered, they turn out to be a horrible person. (touches on people's reliance on mental health issues and how ingrained it is into someone's personality. I'm not sure, xD that could end up being really edgy and offensive so be careful)
4. A recovery fic without the issue to recovery from (is this possible? I'm intrigued to know)


** /Strange Reflections by LeQuin/ deals with Harry's PTSD after the war with Hermione acting as his anchor. It's complete. Linkffn(12307886)

/Love and Love Again by foreverandnow/ deals with a Harry that has been missing since Voldemort's attack on the Potters (both parents survived) and living on the streets, and all the issues that come with it. Linkffn(7624618)

*** These both sound good! I like the idea of Harry dealing with reuniting with his family and those sort of expectations :)

** The fic “Unforgiven Pride” deals with Severus Snape's recovery from physical and psychological damage inflicted on him, basically throughout his life. The author is very precise and detailed about Snape's medical treatment and Ministry-ordered cognitive-behavioral therapy. Her therapist is one of the best OC's ever! It's shown as Snape/Hermione but the relationship is in very early stages. Snape is staying with the Trio while he recovers enough to stand trial for various crimes during the Second Voldemort War. The author is currently researching the British judicial system in order to write the Trial chapters. She's incredibly detail-oriented and I have enjoyed her (novel-length) fic.
