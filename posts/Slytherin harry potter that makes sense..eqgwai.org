I'm looking for fanfics that place Harry in slytherin that actually make sense. Snakes are typically sneaky right? Well I'm pretty sure the dursleys bred sneakiness and snake traits in him.


** The following link contains what I consider to be the greatest piece of FanFiction ever written, one which is shockingly underrated and obscure. The author has been working on the series since 2001 and is on book seven. It revolves around Harry and Draco befriending one another in Madam Malkin's and moves on from there. It is just brilliant, in every sense of the word.
