I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. They were in their 6th or 7th years, dark activity was starting back up, Teddy is an auror. I want to say she had 20+ Chapters up. I /think/ it was by tinkerbell.... Something. It, along with everything else on Checkmated (RIP), WAS SO GOOD. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Actually if anyone has ANYTHING archived from Checkmated, hit me up. I'd be forever grateful.
