Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you know if there is a story about Lily coming back after the war and then ending up with Snape who managed to survive Nagini? I am dying to read a fic like that but I haven't managed to find it... Everything I read happens during the Marauders era and usually ends badly... Any suggestions?


** My two favorites: Ananke and Obscura Nox Animae. One is about Lily surviving because her soul split from her body and attached to an animal - sounds stupid, and I usually don't even like or read Lily survives stories - but this one is awesome. The other is about an after school Lily travelling to the future and meeting Sev.

**** FF :) they are really awesome. Obscura Nox Animae is a bit better (Ananke is also fantastic but loses a bit of its momentum in the last chapters) and is also on AO3 :)

** linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me) has a dual-Peggy Sue where this happens. Parts of it is set in school but it doesn't follow typical Marauder-era setup.

FWIW, most SS-centric Marauder-era fics I read doesn't end badly, I guess we read different things. Then again, the pairing has a very high rate of things going to shit vs things working out, so there's that.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

** Well, linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) is probably not what you expected, but still it is one of the best fanfictions I have ever read.
