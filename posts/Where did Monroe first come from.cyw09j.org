I've seen characters named Monroe in multiple fics, including A Black Comedy, Methods of Rationality and Parselmouth of Gryffindor, and I'm wondering who first came up with the persona and in which other fics it's present.


** The name was used in "A Black Comedy" first. The author of HPMOR reused the name as an homage to that fic. He also references a few other well known fics throughout the story, such as "Wastelands of Time" and "Getting the Hang of Thursdays".

I don't know about "Parselmouth of Gryffindor".

** I'm not sure I understand the question. Monroe is just a name, usually a last name but sometimes a first name (usually for girls). Or are you saying that there is a character named Monroe that is exactly the same in all three fics you listed?

*** There's usually a few things in common, both ABC and HPMoR had Monroe actually being a version of LV, and in PoG Monroe turned out to be a dark witch trying to free Grindelwald.

** Per Google I'm seeing two sources. The first is a Scots Gaelic surname meaning "from the mouth of the river." The second is a Scottish topographic surnameâ€‹ from Gaelic words meaning "foot of a hill."
