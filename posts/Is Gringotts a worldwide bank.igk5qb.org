Do you guys know if Gringotts is the only bank in the Wizarding World? I know it's the only one in magical Britain, but don't you think they would have different banks in other countries?

Then again, Hagrid said "Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe", but was he exaggerating?


** Bill Weasley worked for Gringott's as a curse breaker in Egypt. I'm not sure if that was a special assignment or if he worked there full time, but in PoA the family goes to visit him there.

*** I might have explained myself in a bad way. I meant more like, if Gringotts has banks and caters for the wizarding population in other countries. I always just thought Bill was participating on expeditions to Egypt, not that the bank had a branch in Egypt.

Then I did some more research, and found that different countries have different currencies (if you consider the Fantastic Beasts films), so there has to be different banks in other countries to manage those, right?

**** Well, you might take it as an indication -- a very natural interpretation is that Gringotts has several branches, and this is the reason they can offer someone to work "abroad" (pamphlet in OotP) in the first place.

But yes, it's not conclusive. Other than that, there is just the statement by Hagrid:

#+begin_quote
  “They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold---an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.”

  “Wizards have banks?”

  “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”
#+end_quote

We don't know more. Up to you if "Just the one" refers to Britain or the world.

**** Oh I gotcha. In that case I doubt they have many branches outside Britain. In her post-Potter worldbuilding, Rowling has shown that countries are populated by their culture's own magical beings. As Goblins are different from place to place, maybe it's possible banks outside of Britain are run by different creatures? Plus, Gringotts has a Latin motto, so I'd imagine there could be different banks with non-latin mottos in places like Asia or Africa.

As for different currencies, Gringotts has a currency exchange so presumable it could still operate as a worldwide bank, if each branch has its own currency exchange.

** It's not really stated in the stories and I would take Hagrid's statements with a grain of salt. After all three teenagers managed to break in, steal something and then break out and their plan wasn't even that great or meticulous. Voldemort managed to break in without anyone knowing who the culprit was and his only problem was that Hagrid picked up the stone before.

In any case, my headcanon is that Gringotts is more or less active in most parts of the former British Empire except for those colonies (such as US) who completely rejected the British culture.

** I always thought of Gringotts as European. They may dip their toes in other territories but mostly the stick to the clientele they know best. I like to think other parts of the world have other banker creatures. It feels like something JKR would do back in the day.

*** We know that there are a different kind of goblins in America, as seen in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, if you count that as canon. I haven't looked into it much, but I got the sense that "Goblins", being different in America, working in places other than Gringotts, Gringotts must not have existed, at least in a functional enough form to support them all. I don't have much evidence for that, though.

** Gringotts is probably international, but its also fair to say that Hagrid has a somewhat Anglo-centric view of the Wizarding World.

There are likely other banks.

** I would expect Gringotts is only one of many Goblin owned banks. Goblins are probably investing through the banks into Wizarding economies, (possibly better to say magical economy, as wizards aren't the entirety of the economy),and possibly even muggle economies, maybe through a tie to a muggle bank in their respective countries. Gringotts possibly invests in other countries too.

A finance-nerd can build up all the areas of Gringotts. Muggleborns with good math might find work with them, as the ministry is so often pure blood and halfblood focused in fanfic.
