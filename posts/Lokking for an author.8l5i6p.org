Read a story from an author on her site. The story was H/Hr and Harry came to school after being raised by Sirius (?). It was a long story, Hermione ended up being adopted by McGonagall and McGongall was Harry's godmother(?). The author was named something like karo/Kario or something. Can't for the life of me remember.

Help?
