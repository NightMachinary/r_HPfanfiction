Hey! so I am retyping this request : I am looking for any long preferably novel length harry potter fanfictions that are non-slash and involves harry joining grindewald in some way shape or form. One story I'd like to find again is one where harry is thrown in nurmengrad (Spelling?) with grindewald and together they escape. But Any story will do I just want to see some new outtakes on fanfic that I haven't read mostly to be honest.


** Two off the top of my head. linkffn(Hail Odysseus by Brennus) is the first one. It has... mixed reception. I enjoy it, though I don't think it is great. Like all Brennus fics, the ending falls flat. And the scene in the Forbidden Forest is /hilarious/ (you will know which one).

The other is linkffn(Escape to Darkness by kmfrank). This one is brought low by the simple fact that it is incomplete, and kmfrank will probably never write another word of fanfiction.

***** There's is some small hope - he hopped onto IRC a few weeks ago. But, the last time he did that and posted new chapters, they were almost completely disconnected from the previous parts of the story.
