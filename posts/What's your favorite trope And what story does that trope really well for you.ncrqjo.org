Can be a popular trope or not.


** Sirius gets legally found innocent.

nice Dumbledore-fics (where he has a bigger focus as a good person)

Fics that deeply explores the bond between Weasley's and Harry.

and... well this is more a genre than a trope, but god dammit do I have a guilty pleasure for 'characters reads the books'-fics. So ripe with potential for character-moments and deep emotional exploration of characters.

** honestly the Gringotts goblins being awesome trope, and the Harry Potter is raised by others trope are big favourites particular to the HP universe.

In general fanfiction though, I love the friends to lovers trope, because it's generally pretty angst free (except when people put in a needless love tirangle in it for no reason, ugh!)

And on that point, I do love the fanfiction habit of not having a love triangle and just turning it into a polyamorous relationship instead, lmao

** The ones where Harry runs away from the Dursleys and is raised by magical creatures or people who aren't named in canon. The author's of these stories usually have great world-building skills and we get to see different magical cultures than the one JKR described.

linkao3(fantastic elves and where to find them)

linkao3(blood crest by Cauchy)

linkao3(to leap and love the fall) This one was written by someone taking a social anthropology degree, and you can really tell. The cultures and languages of the different magical creatures are so well fleshed out.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there.

  AU: After 1st year, Harry is warned by Dobby not to return to Hogwarts. He runs away and is gone for nearly a year before he is tracked down/rescued by Snape. His enrollment is revoked, so he can only stay at Hogwarts if he's taken on as an apprentice. Can Prof. Snape's firm hand mentor him and help him prepare for his future? Mentor/Guardian. Sevitus. Severitus.
