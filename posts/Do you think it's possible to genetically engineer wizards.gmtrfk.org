If there's a magic cure for cancer then it's likely that there's a way to magically repair DNA damage which makes gene editing and cloning wayyy easier.

If there's a gene for magic somewhere in the genome then you can probably use CRISPR to add it into muggle IVF babies to create more wizards.

If there isn't a gene for magic but it's something else in the cell then you could take an egg cell from a donor witch, replace the nucleus with one from a muggle woman, and thus create an IVF baby that's genetically from the muggle parents but the cell is from the witch so it has magic. Probably even easier than messing around with individual genes.

Either way it should be possible (at least with near future biotech + magic) to artificially create more wizards and boost the population of the magical world by several orders of magnitude. And if someone does it in secret it'd take several years until people find out that there's a sudden surge in muggleborns, all of them test tube babies from the same few clinics.

What do you think a massive increase in population size over the span of a generation or two would do to magical society? What would happen to the economy? Would there be shortages of important goods like wand cores? What would the impact on politics be? Especially if it's just one country with massive growth, how would others respond? In the long term, how would a larger population change the world?

Edit: Not claiming that it'd be ethical to do, merely speculating on whether it's possible and what the ramifications would be and what a story in such a setting could be. It's a concept quite similar to the common marriage law trope.


** I doubt it.

Think about animagi. Sirius can turn into a dog and he still has his magic (which he can use to turn back into a human), even though a dog isn't a magical species.

Or think about Voldemort. Even without any body at all, he was still a magical being capable of possessing people.

To me, these suggest that there's an aspect to being magical that isn't biological.

We know from JKR that you need the right genetics to become a wizard. But something being /necessary/ doesn't mean that it is /sufficient/. I suspect you need to have the right genetics *and* something else, potentially something relating to your soul.

*** I'm assuming that a unfertilized egg cell doesn't already have a soul, and it forms sometime later, either at conception or at birth or somewhere in between. If you edit the DNA in the cell before doing the whole test tube fertilization thing, then the soul would form with the edited DNA, magical baby. Of course giving an existing person magic would be something completely different and far, far more challenging. Editing the DNA of an existing person is only possible in superhero comics, while editing the DNA of a new baby has been done already (illegally on humans once in China, and thousands of times legally on animals).

**** Even assuming that the soul appears after the body, my point was that the soul has its own characteristics /independent/ of the body. Having the genes would not be enough to guarantee that you would have a magical soul.

***** What would decide whether you have a magical soul? Whether your parents had magical souls? How would it decide who your parents were if you were assembled in a test tube from DNA fragments of more than just two people? I think regardless how it works, there's almost certainly a workaround where you can trick it into accepting a magical donor parent as source of magic while keeping most of the DNA of the muggle parents.

** Magic is from genes so yeah its possible.

My headcannon is that there are way more magicals than stated because of things like expansion charms, squib lines, the high frequency of them living past 100 and that wizards can produce more food because of magic and don't need to use as many calories to function.

I calculated about 274.8 million magical humans on Earth existed as of 1990

** Yeah, I'm not sure in a magical world where mere concepts have power (the unspeakables study things like 'love' and 'fate'), that any combination of amino-acids is the difference between being able to alter the world and not.

Indeed, it would probably be a magical feature that decides wether someone can wield magic or not.

Perhaps you can engineer something magically, but I honestly don't think that this would be worthwhile or probable.

** I don't know if it is or isn't possible. But it shouldn't.

IT'S MAGIC! If you turn it into just some exaggerated sci-fi concept, then it looses its mysticism, its wonder.

That's why I don't like fics that go too technical. Consistency and proper magic syster is good and all, but not everything needs to have a concrete solution. Not everything needs to be explainable.

Remember canon: "Well of course it's happening in your head Harry. But why should that mean that it's not real?"

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

*** I never claimed that anyone doing it would be morally right. I was just speculating on what would happen if someone did it.

Genetic modification is certainly possible, even if it hasn't been done on humans yet. Apart from the three gene edited babies currently living in China.

Genetically modifying human babies to, for example, have a lower cancer risk is something that has been seriously discussed for quite a while, and many people see it as far less ethically problematic than other attempts to "improve the gene pool" as it'd be an optional medical procedure not unlike cosmetic surgery. Of course many are against it as it can easily turn into a dystopian eugenics state.

Gene editing is a serious topic. It works. It's been done with countless plants and animals. If gene editing humans to decrease cancer risk is a thing that people might be doing in a few decades, editing in magic might also happen in the HP-verse. And that allows for some interesting scenarios. Utopia where everyone has magic and is always in perfect health? Or dystopian GATTACA crossover? Considering that a form of eugenics (keeping the blood pure, excluding/killing muggleborns, discretely erasing squibs from the family trees) is already a thing in the HP-verse, it'd be very fascinating to speculate how it'd compare to gene editing.

The one doing the gene editing might assume that they're morally right, since the Death Eaters are killing muggleborns and the gene editor is only gifting people with magic in order to increase the numbers of muggleborns to no longer be an easily persecutable minority. Meanwhile other people might be appalled at the idea of messing with the very essence of living things and consider it a sin worse than even what Voldemort is doing (at least he's only mutilating his own soul!). And the muggles involved might dislike the fact that nobody even asked them if they'd like a magic baby.

**** Or a dystopian AU in the matter of GATTACA. There's enough marriage law fics where the government does horrifically unethical things to keep the population up (or a lazy writers excuse to hook Harry up with ten women). Concepts don't need to be ethical to make for an interesting setting for a story.

*** What the OP is proposing isn't eugenics; it's genetic engineering. That said, there is very little stopping an enterprising wizard from impregnating a hundred or more Muggle women per year, flooding the wizarding world with muggle-raised halfbloods a decade later.

He may even be able to do it ethically. "Hey, baby, how would you like your kid to have magical powers and live to 200---but you won't be able to remember how until they turn 11?" may well be an effective pickup line if one can prove that one can deliver.
