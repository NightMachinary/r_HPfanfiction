Hi everybody!

I've been in the HP fandom for a long, long time. I'm a shipper, so I read mostly fanfiction about love and relationships, although I do sometimes read and write purely adventureous stuff.

I was a really active author & reader in 2012-2013, then I paused the thing till several months ago. And I get this funny feeling that less people read HP fanfiction these days: there are less comments as far as I can see, less views etc.

Do you get the same impression? What changes have you noticed about the HP fandom? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on the actual state and/or future of the fandom!


** I think the fandom has now more or less entered a fairly stable state. There was a big drop in activity after DH was published in 2007 and Twilight entered its peak years. And for many years after that, activity continued a steady decline.

But in the last 5 years or so I don't think I've noticed any substantial decline in the amount of discussion going on online, or the fics being published. I think we've reached a new "post-Potter" equilibrium based on the long term fans who aren't going anywhere plus a trickle of newcomers.

That fandom basically died overnight when season 8 was done. It had such a strong grip on pop-culture (just look at the hype/shock surrounding the Red Wedding) and was referenced everywhere ("Winter is coming", "You know nothing, Jon Snow"). Nowadays, the Mass Effect fandom feels more alive despite also having a "controversial ending".

Almost everything still follows the stations of canon even if there are 58765 points at which canon events should not have happened based on the divergence.

IMO Fanfics based on the show are way worse than those based on the books because the show messed up that bad.

If I change a detail in canon, I need to roughly estimate how Dumbledore, the Ministry, the student body, and Voldemort would react to this, and do this for every mayor plot-point I introduce.

Hard, but manageable. But for GoT? Not a chance in hell would I be able to do this, simply because of the sheer vastness of the world. And yeah, that is a disadvantage

He is taken to Last Hearth as Crown Prince, where he is proclaimed King.

Now, obviously, that impacts every other player. But does that mean that you have to show that? Because Littlefinger might throw a fit and Cersei as well, but until their actions directly influence the North and therefore the story, it does not have to be mentioned.

*** People speculated that the Fantastic Beasts movies would lead to an influx. I don't think anyone noticed any substantial change.

I think this was for two reasons:

1. While the FB movies contain lots of treats for established fans to enjoy (depending on their preferences), they're not brilliant as stand-alone pieces of story-telling.

2. The nature of the FB storyline is that it doesn't invite much speculation as to what happens next/what we don't know. The HP series created so much fanfic because it presented so many unanswered questions within an easily-replicable, predictable structure (Hogwarts years). FB films don't have that.

I suspect that there isn't really anything that could reignite the HP fandom short of a new series of novels as good as the original 7 books.

And that's ignoring the thousands of deaths and the fact that most people are goddamn indoors and not actively taking a drink or showering as it's happened, or how that the solution is the most egregious deus ex machina ever.

As a child, my school had no trouble setting us books from the US and having us work out what they meant, with adult discussion. (The vast majority of our books were British, but if an American one was about then all the Americanisations were left in.)

I think the Philosopher/Socerer's stone was a decision by US publishers? It strikes me as infantilising people in the US. One of the oddest changes of all for me is that Dumbledore enjoys eating sherbot lemons, surely the knowledge that it's a lemon sweet is enough without calling it a lemon drop? Or sneakers instead of trainers - my class of 7-8 year olds were expected to work it out in reverse (I initially though they were wellies, admittedly - because the character was wearing them on a farm.)

Also, none of those 3 words are nouns, they're adjectives, so best to just say trans people or transgender people when referencing trans people overall. And also yes, there are people who accept gay people, or are gay people, but hate and view trans people as unnatural.

** Your observations are likely correct; I definitely know anecdotally that I'm not as active a reader as in years past. It has to do with how far removed from the source material we are; we're now more than a decade removed from the last book, and almost a decade removed from the last mainline movie. Everything that's come out since then is too polarizing to bring in a large influx of new readers/writers. It mostly reignites interest for those that were already it the community.

Also another thing that you notice when you've been in the fandom for long enough (personally I've been reading/writing for about 15 years) is that the focus of the stories changes. When I started the rage was 5th-6th year fics, because those were the next books that would be released. Nowadways, we see a lot more fics based off of Fantastic Beasts, and post Hogwarts fics, because those are the most recent releases. I don't know what fics you're reading specifically, but it could be that the fics that you are interested in have fallen out of popularity, while other types have risen in popularity.

** The Fandom is stabilizing now. We've had a few chaotic years, especially after DH was released and everyone wanted to fix it, but since then no true canon was released anymore. The Fantastic Beasts movie was good, but still just a pale shadow of what the books were. And the less said about the seond one and CC the better.

We are now in a state of self-perpetuating writing - the books form a baseline and the community creates its own content. We, unlike many other fandoms, have somehow managed to become not about the books, but about the things we write. And make no mistake, this community and [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] are very much seperate ones. While that one is dying slowly but surely, ours is thriving because it's not /really/ about harry potter, but about original fiction written into its world.

** I would disagree. The fandom is pretty stable right now and I think more and more fans find out about fanfiction as the years go on. A lot of authors have created a following and on those stories I see hundreds of comments, thousands of views, etc. It really depends on the ships/tropes, as some are more popular these days than others. Some authors themselves have a following with Facebook groups and Twitter.

On tumblr someone made a graph of HP fanfic on [[https://toastystats.tumblr.com/post/111930409603/fanfictionnet-fandoms-over-time-toasty-says][FF.net]] over the years and on [[https://fffinnagain.tumblr.com/post/111864689778/harry-potter-fandom-on-ao3-cross-posted-from-the][AO3]].

There was a drop after DH, a spike after DH2 movie, and steady rates after that, but this is all dated 2014-2015 so not sure how true this holds today.

I don't think the fandom will ever die out, but authors may have more constraints on their free time as they get older.

If HP gets a full length TV series, fanfic would definitely spike again

Plenty of fandoms continue to live after a series ends- just look at Star Trek and Lord of the Rings for example. There are still plenty of Harry Potter fans.

Want to talk about small fandoms? Just look at some underground music bands or old video games. I used to play this game- Red Orchestra 2. It has had less than a thousand players for over two years. And yet it's still active. Compared to this, the Harry Potter fandom is absolutely huge. It isn't called a "global phenomenon" for nothing.

Not trying to promote gatekeeping and all that but having been reading this stuff for nearly a decade now it's clear since the main films ended that there's been fewer but of far more quality fics out there than the torrid of "what if Harry danced with Hermione at the Yule Ball"/"Harry is a god now"/"Molly is a manipulator" type angry rants about the creator that all largely hit the same beats and SI stuff that at one point dominated the fandom.

Hope and Healing is updated actively. A Different Kind of War was updated last a few months ago, but I think the writer will continue once school is done for the year. As for the others ones I don't know when/if they will be updated again.

The Half Blood Romantic has been decently received even on DLP and everyone on there is highly critical. That one hasn't been updated in a year though.

There are a few more that I'm keeping my eye on only because they just started and don't know how well they will turn out so these are the best ones out there right now.

** Without new content, all fandoms eventually die. But this is a very slow progress, and is slowed down further (or even reversed for a while) with new (canon) content that does appear occasionally with this universe.

So yes, I suppose that in a sense, the HP fandom is dying in that it is progressively losing activity over time. But it will last for a very long time until you see the fandom being genuinely inactive. So I wouldn't really say that the HP fandom is dying myself since it implies that in a year or two it will be dead -- which isn't true at all.

** So many changes. But I've been here since about 2004, so probably a veteran compared to a lot of people!

After HPMOR (ironically, despite the general sub opinion on that fic vs the general gender breakdown of the sub) a /lot/ more men came into the fanfic sub-fandom space - which may have covered what was a general dropoff in the number of contributors.

I do know that some former prolific authors have sadly passed away, and the destruction/shift of communties (LJ, certain forums, the shift in tumblr) have had an impact as well.

I would say that people who are /pure book canon/ creators (and to an extent, readers) /have/, yes, dropped off significantly. The movies have had a huge impact which has morphed to an extent what the fandom consists of, and what Harry Potter the fanfiction fandom means to people and why it brings people in. I would put at the feet of the movies a /huge/ amount of the sympathy for Draco, Lucius, Narcissa, and even Bellatrix - who I would say now are more popular characters or at least on a par with retro mainstays like Sirius and Lupin - who were disserviced in the movies by being aged up.

Nowadays though I think the fandom is fairly solid. There's still new content coming out in the form of the Fantastic Beasts movies - the fact they're now relying on original canon characters keeps them in relevance and direct fans back to the original movies. The Harry Potter movies themselves are also now arguably classics and occupying the same space as e.g. the original Star Wars trilogy, which still has an active fandom that excludes all followups today. JKR herself is infamously active on Twitter - which will bring people in to check, or correct, her after-the-date claims, and even Buzzfeed with its endless 'which Hogwarts house are you?' quizzes is, one could say, keeping the magic alive. To say nothing (probably for the best) of The Cursed Child which will continue its theatrical runs for as long as it stays popular.

So ultimately I'd say while the fandom has /changed/ and will continue to change - maybe become near unrecognizable to those of us who are old hands, eventually - I don't think it's in any danger of disappearing any time soon.

*** I agree with your points, I've been a HP fan for about 21 years now and have read HP fanfic since after DH (I made a conscious effort not to read any fanfic before the books were done because I was a weirdo and didn't want to spoil my reading experience lol. I've been reading fanfic since 2002 so I did have plenty of opportunity)

I personally never read much fanfic centered around Harry, to me his story has been told and I am content with it. There's some off shoots and what if's I'll occasionally indulge like a good WBWL or time travel ones. But for the most part I've always loved reading Maurader Era fics, Next Gen, and some Side character fics. Basically most topics not already explored by canon. Since there is no canon at the moment to contradict these types of fics I don't see myself stopping reading them anytime soon.

Very interesting point that makes a whole lot of sense. I too have noticed that in pretty much most fanfic it's assumed that the Malfoy's (at least Draco and Narcissa) are actually decent people not the bully's they actually are in canon. Definitely has to do with the movies like you said, I remember it even being a joke with the early films that JKR was concerned because everyone had a crush on Tom Felton who's supposed to be the bad guy lol.

The movies definitely were a disservice to the Maurader generation by aging them up as well as not properly telling any part of their story (one of my biggest pet peeves about the movies tbh). As dumb as it sounds I remember I had like a huge crush on Sirius reading the books purely from the description of him as a teenager, so of course I cried when he died in the books. Watching the movies I was like "Meh, whatev, you didn't even know him that well Harry get over it" lol

**** I didn't mention it in my post (admittedly because I forgot) but I would say the movies account for a /lot/ of the pushback against Harry/Ginny and Ginny in general too, as well as almost single-handedly spawning Harry/Luna and Neville/Luna.

I feel like the character of Harry also has evolved in general fic/fandom consciousness as well, just from elements the movie adaptations condensed or took out. For example, the fact that essentially a big part of Harry's character is that he's...a jock, albeit one with a heart of gold - thanks to the movies pruning quidditch after the first few. Canon Harry is also imo a good deal more chaotic than Radcliffe's Harry who has a quiet intensity to him - which has probably helped to spawn the Harry-the-genius subgenre of fics.

On that note, a pretty key point of the canon books for me is also dumb luck and media criticism. The entire point of the 'The Chosen One' rhetoric is greek tragedy, self-fulfilling prophecy. But in the movies, the thrust seems to be that Harry actually /is/ Voldemort's equal - able at 17 to contend against him in a one on one duel! So I can see where the confusion starts to creep in between writers using one source & readers essentially familiar with another.

***** Totally agree again! I pretty much treat the books and the movies as their own separate entities. When I do that I can enjoy the movies more when I'm not comparing them to what they left out from the books.

The main three characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione definitely suffer the most in fanfiction due to their movie portrayals. Hermione/Ron is so hated because of movie portrayal. First you take away most all of Ron's good traits in the books and make him into the dumb/goofy sidekick then try and pair him with movie Hermione who is not only the smartest person in the whole world, but she is also portrayed by Emma Watson, a very beautiful woman who is much more attractive than Rupert Grint (no offence bud). No wonder people think Hermione is lowering herself by being with Ron.

Ron and Ginny definitely got the short end of the stick in the movies. Yes the Harry/Ginny romance in the books was quick but imo it still made sense, there was buildup about everything Harry likes in a girl being shown in Ginny when he finally gets to know her past Ron's little sister. Movie however was so unbelievably cringey I can't blame people for not getting on board.

Basically it's no wonder everyone in fic wants to pair the MC with other people when their movie portrayals make no sense.

** I believe it's a sensation we old timers have because we're used to look for fanfics in places like this subreddit. As years go on, we see more and more threads asking always the same questions and recommendations that we have already seen plenty of times, and many of those threads are shot down rather viciously, or people just don't find them as interesting anymore, so they refrain from commenting in those new threads.

Another thing is that when we first started reading fanfiction, there was an entire ocean of works published, and we had a seemingly endless supply or fics, and as years have passed, and we read through that massive list of fics, and we learned to filter our fics better, we're running out of works to read, or at least we feel like they're coming out at a slower pace because we don't jump from fic to fic in a random way anymore. Instead, we curate our libraries and spend more and more time waiting for something good to catch our attention. Then, again, as years pass, we see the same tropes in every fic that is published, and we see it as water under the bridge, so those fics are not worth reading, or they're just not as memorable as the first ones we read.

Then there's the fact that the books are way too old now. The first one came out in 1997, think about it. That's a whole 23 years. Deathly Hallows came out in 2007, that's 13 years, more than a decade. I'm surprised they managed to stay relevant for so long. If no new works come out +(Cursed Child? What's that? How you eat it?)+, there's not gonna be too much of an influx of new readers, which causes the community to stop growing as fast as it did before. I'm not saying the community is dying out, it's just not growing as fast as it did before.

Then there's the Fantastic Beast series, that while it is set in the HP universe, it's not about a character as maleable as Harry. Newt has a very well established personality and he's not as flexible to work with, unlike Harry, who many people used as a wish-fulfillment character, and since he was so young he didn't have a set path, so his story could diverge massively from canon.

That's how I perceive it, anyway, I'm not saying that everyone has the same experience and perception as me, but it could help explain why we feel like the community is dying.

An immense lot of people were the same age as Harry when the books came out, so they identified themselves with Harry more than they would do with Newt in the later series. I think it's not so much that Harry is a more interesting character, but that he's more malleable. Not having a set job or career makes him a wildcard to steer him in any direction, so it's an easier character to work with. And the magical setting opens millions of worlds of possibilities. Quite literally, we have crossovers for a reason. But again, that's just my opinion. Other people might perceive it differently.

** I started writing Potter fanfiction as an adult in his late 30s (very late, as in 39).

Is the fandom dying?

Well, [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] is still posting a few hundred stories a day... Though most of those are stories with 300 word 'chapters' and the entire 20 chapter story coming in at less than 8000 words. There are still very good longer works being produced, but anyone who has done a search for a new story knows what I'm talking about.

The First and depending upon how you count them Second wave of 'major writers' have by and large retired from the field. Whether the ones who replaced them are as talented is up to the reader.

I have to admit to laughing out loud when I see people complaining about how 'cliched' the stories from the early 2000s are... ignoring that those writers created those cliches.

Potter was a unique phenomenon, as it drew in kids who were not readers and got them involved in the story. The fandom continues, but it's composed for the most part of readers.

I predict that writers will continue to vanish from the fandom, hopefully without the childish deletion of all their stories that has become so common among those who rage quit.

I have no current intention to stop myself, as I need to finish so many stories and have multiple insanely stupid ideas I want to write (including a Wrong Boy Who Lived story where Peter is not a traitor and after trying and failing to defend them, is put in a body bind before being forced to watch as Tom kills the twins. The spell bounces off Harry's head, destroys Tom's body and kills Peter. Peter is staring at Harry as he dies, and the Fideius collapses on them, erasing Harry's existence from the world, except for his brother, who can see and hear him. The Potters think he's the twin's Imaginary Friend. Working title: Imaginary Harry)

As long as someone is reading and someone is writing, the fandom will continue... Just probably with other people.

** Meh. HP is never gonna die. I find myself thinking the same thing for a couple fandoms that i read in and im pretty sure its because im just looking in my lane. As for patchwork reviews, some people just dont review and simply read. You only really finds tons of reviews on inflamatory fics, or popular writers, as well as some higher quality fics (this isnt a fact, just something i personally notice).

That and theres also burnout as well. It wouldnt suprise me if a lot of communities are slowing down because of all the free time. Doing one thing so much/often can tire some people out.

** I see it as a levelling off. A lot of the original HP fandom have grown out of it (no shame one way or the other) and have full time jobs, families, etc. But HP has entered a new generation as more kids find it and then subsequently find the fandom. I think for the past seven years or so we've held steady because between Cursed Child and Fantastic Beasts fans have returned a little. Those who are just finding the fandom and those returning seem to balance out those who have left.

** I think it is nearly impossible for the fandom to die given it's cultural staying power at this point. But I don't think we'll ever see the "heyday" of fanfiction like we saw in the late 2000's and early 2010's again. Unless significant new pieces of media that are widely beloved are added, but that seems very unlikely at this point.

I think we've reached an equilibrium point for the time being in the fandom. Trickle of new readers and writers coming in with a similar exodus out. I personally, didn't engage with the fandom/fanfiction for a good bit and then came back to it with a renewed vigor. So perhaps based off of my experiences we might see tiny swells here and there.

** Hah. From my perspective, it's been dying slowly since the end of the three year summer.

It depends on when your era was. Everything keeps changing in all fandoms. They stop being the one you recognise and you can't necessarily follow all the developments in the same way you used to. It's like tarot- the death card just means change.

** Agree with all the other comments here. Fandoms don't die. I believe this community, given how so many of us have been here for so long, will never die. I believe Fantastic Beasts and Cursed Child led to some new people getting interested in HP but probably not into this community. This community exists for several reasons, back in the day when the HP series was not complete, the fanfic communnity was a way for hardcore fans to explore potential future plot points on how HP will progress. I believe many of the early writers like Jeconais served this purpose. As of now, members of this community exist because even though we like the HP books, we want something more. E.g. I dislike Romione in the books, so I'm here to read Harmony fics etc

** I feel that it's actually easier to find a good fic these days, as many of the hardcore fan writers are still going. (After all this time.)

It's definitely much smaller and this community is different to the communities I lurked around before. Dedicated livejournal communities are all but ghosts and I've never got into tumblr fanfic. Namely that people are very anti-slash, whereas I prefer gen but will take any gender configuration; I'm not interested in the sex scenes anyway, so what does it matter?

I think - hope - it will still be around for a while yet.

** There have been a lot of changes in the fandom since I "joined" in 2004. It was pretty active, though there would be a rise and fall between books and movies. My most intense period of activity was from 2007-2011, and I think that was the height of fandom activity. The books were over and people needed to plug the hole left behind, but there were still movies on the way.

I started to make my exit just before the last movie came out, since I was gaining new interests and wanted to find something to plug the hole so I wouldn't be too distraught at the end (I don't handle endings well, when Star Trek: Voyager ended I was depressed for /weeks/). By the mid-2010s I was gone from fandom in general because I was busy with getting my degree in creative writing and didn't have time anymore. I graduated college about two years ago but still didn't come back because I had a teaching job that started literally three days after I graduated (I graduated May 4th, moved May 5th, unpacked on May 6th, and started teaching May 7th). Coming back to fandom didn't even occur to me until September of last year. My students were talking about Halloween and what their costumes would be, and then... "Miss Loon, do you know about Harry Potter?"

And now I'm back.

Nowadays there is definitely less activity, but that's not the only change. All of the tropes present today were either absent or just getting their start. Inheritance tests and pureblood wank weren't around. Indy!Harry and marriage contracts were just getting their start. Daphne Greengrass had not yet begun her ascent to power. There was bad OCs and crack abound (of which I ate up, I love bad OCs). "Mary Sue" was a term freely tossed around, and you either embraced it or lived in fear.

The quality of writing has largely improved, too, probably because there are a lot more adults writing fic now.

The biggest shock to me was the decline in the use of the term "Mary Sue." How long was I gone??

** A decent amount (not sure how many, but I know a few) of fanfic writers have turned to HP roleplay, which is as stable as the fan fiction community and often overlaps. Sometimes, people swap between the two as well, so it could be a lull in one HP writing community but a boost in another.

** At least most of the obvious or easy plotlines have already been done a hundred times well and ten thousand times poorly. With that early surge of fics spent, new fics have to come from either retreads of existing concepts/challenges (I wouldn't be surprised if there are /still/ people writing "Don't Fear the Reaper" fics) or new ideas, but as each "new" idea gets written up, it ceases to be so new and further shrinks the pool of available material.

It's unfortunate, really, since there are so many good(?) ideas already floated that nobody has written fics on, and yet so many new fics are just rehashes of what's already been done to death.

** I feel that a lot of people aren't reading newer Harry Potter fics on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] because of the big purge they did to a lot of old fics, and the fact that they've just recently begun shoving ads down our throat. On the website, it seems that there's an ad every few paragraphs that are about two inches big, which takes up a third of the page. Sometimes they even cut paragraphs in half. It's annoying.

Though, I think more people have jumped ship to AO3. I don't have the experience you have with the Harry Potter fandom since I've just recently begun to read, and write, fanfiction for it. There are plenty of fics being written, though, from what I could see.

How many Harry/Lavender fics are around? Harry/Katie with them bonding over being the "younglings" in the Gryffindor team over the years? Harry taking let's say Demelza Robins under his wing or finding an honorary "big sister"? Harry in Hufflepuff which is not just a collection of tropes or crack?
