** Antosha is probably the best Luna writer in the fandom, though she's usually paired with Harry or Ginny instead of being the sole protagonist.

Google his name to find his profile pages on different fanfiction pages.

** Tehan's Luna from [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating_Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] is the most spot-on Luna I've ever read.
