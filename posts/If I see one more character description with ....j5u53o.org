.. "Hair down to their waist" I will scream! Boy or girl, how many people in your whole lives have you seen with hair reaching their waist? Do they not realise how impractical that length of hair is for anything? How much time it would take to manage? The adventure would be over by the time they brushed their hair in the morning, and it's not like you can just leave it. I especially hate it in fics where they then go off galavanting in woods (elves!). That hair would be caught on every branch and bramble from now to evermore. Seriously people!

And breathe. Sorry for the rant. Was reading random fics and all three gave the main character (all boys, Harry Potter if you must know) hair down to his waist, and every time I read it, my eye twitches.

Edit- okay, I'm off to try sleep, so sorry if I dont respond to you. It's been brilliant reading all the replies. It seems 50/50 from people the people over the 3 subreddits I posted this to if long hair would be unmanageable or not, but I will definitely be able to read future fics with less eye rolls thanks to this thread! Thank you.

Edit 2- Awake now. TIL waist length hair isn't as long as I thought it was! I thought it meant down to your butt, but all your comments seem to say its shorter than that. It's been great to wake to find all these comments!


** Do you realise that less than a century ago pretty much all women in the western world had waist-long hair? That's how they had such complicated and intricate hairstyles.

** I have, actually! And yes, every word you say is completely true. That hair takes more care time than most children, and the amount of money they spend on maintaining it is /eye-watering/.

Though there is a simple solution in HP Fanfic.

MAAAAAAAGIC. :)

If Bellatrix and Lucius maintained their hair throughout the war, there definitely has to be a spell for that. :D

**** Longer hair is heavier, so it doesn't stick up at angles so much. Hair spray or gel is then much less important. If you use a hair tie it generally stays out of your face. In some ways it is more manageable.

** H'okay, so, while having long hair is a fanfiction trope and many people who write it clearly do not have long hair you clearly do not have long hair either.

I have a ridiculous amount of hair. When I take the time to straighten it (which is not often as that is a time consuming and annoying process) it comes down to my knees. When I let it fly free in its natural curly state it falls down to the top of my butt. It does not take me a ton of time to manage it, I'm very much a 'wash and wear' kinda gal. I have officially reached a point where long hair is a legitimate style and I do not have to worry about regular hair cuts, styling products, or whatever hair fashion trends are happening. I comb it when wet, braid it to sleep, and if I need it out of the way I can clip it back or coil it up and jam some hair sticks in it.\\
My morning hair routine is probably about 30 seconds. I have elf princess hair, and I have embraced this fact.

Having my hair long makes it easier for me to manage than when it is short--to a point. When my hair is shorter it floofs out and I have a terrible case of triangle head. The weight helps pull the curls down so that they don't stick up everywhere. I have passed the "easier for me to manage" point into the realm of absurdity because I like my hair longer, but until my hair hits mid back it is a nightmare to manage. If I went very, very short I could avoid the snarling, the floofing, and the frizziness, but I'd be trading that for having to pay someone else to cut it regularly, and having to take the time to style it in the morning.

Annoying things about long hair include: sitting on it weirdly and then trying to get up but being impeded by your hair, strangling yourself with your own hair if you are a restless sleeper, taking longer showers, wondering how in the heck you went through conditioner so dang fast, and the terrible, terrible process of cleaning out the shower drain that somehow manages to get clogged no matter how many different drain blockers you use.

My hobbies include hiking, camping (in the woods!), playing way too many video games, oh and sleeping in because it really doesn't take a lot of time to do my hair.

Um, yes, sorry about the rant there. But in short--everyone's hair is different. The best way to manage one type of hair is not the same as another type. And the things people find annoying to deal with in regards to their hair are going to vary a lot, which means the "best" solution to their hair problems are also going to vary a lot.

** I can immediately think of three people I've known with hair that long or close to it. And two of them were guys.

So sure, it's definitely not common, but it's not necessarily unrealistic. If anything, it would probably be more common in the magical world, since there are probably magical ways to grow and care for hair.

** ?????

If you have straight hair and use good shampoo/conditioner it's annoying but not that big of a deal. 20 minutes or less to brush, under 2 minutes to do a braid. Wash every other day.

Short hair is way easier in a lot of ways, but being able to hold it all together with a braid is way more convenient than short/medium length hair where it's constantly coming out of ponytails or too short for them and constantly in your face, and the only way to use an elastic is to do it tightly which can cause headaches. Also need way less frequent hair cuts if you don't particularly care about taking good care of it.

** It's really not that bad. When my hair is wet it reaches the small of my back, just above my waist. I wash it and wear it in a braid, no big deal. If I am dressed up I'll wear it loose with just the sides pulled up. It takes about 30 minutes or so to wash, comb, and braid.

** That is ridiculous now that you bring it up. My hair probably goes down to the middle of my back, or maybe a little past the middle of my back, and even that is hard to manage! (Currently brushing it now, if you must know.) I mean, it takes time to brush through every tangle, so i can't imagine how hard having it waist length would be!
