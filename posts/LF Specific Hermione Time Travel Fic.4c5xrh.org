In it, she time travels (unplanned, I believe) and ends up at Hogwarts when Bill and Charlie were there. I'm 99% percent sure it's a Hr/BW fic, but it could be Charlie.

Whichever Weasley it was waits for her to catch up, the whole time his family knows only that he's in love with a girl named Jane or Jean who had to go away but he's sure will come back. None of them have met her or really met her, and some kind of resent this girl for keeping him on a string all those years. Charlie (or Bill, if I have the pairing backwards) is the only other one who knows Jean/Jane is Hermione.

Anyone have any clue?

  Hermione thought that using her time turner would help save lives; instead she found herself back in time and falling for the wrong Weasley. HG&BW

*** Ah, yes! Thank you! I had actually looked at this and for some reason decided it wasn't the fic I was looking for. But it is, thanks!
