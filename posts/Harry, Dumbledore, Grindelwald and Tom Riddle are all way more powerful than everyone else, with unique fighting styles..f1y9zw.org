I just read Realignment and the only thing that really bugged me was that Harry didn't let go of his grudge on Riddle after it was clear he had changed. Either way I would love a story where they are pretty much gods, would be cool to happen in the past so it isn't Voldemort but Tom Riddle. Not gonna be too fussy though, give me what you got!

This could also be a prompt


** I imagine it would be pretty hard to let go of a grudge against someone who had tried to kill you multiple times and who had created a future so bleak and desolate that you had to leave everyone you loved behind in order to attempt to stop the person. (I'm biased as hell though - I love Realignment) I love the request show, I love powerful Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindewald though I prefer Harry to be a touch less skilled than Dumbledore and Voldemort.

*** Yeah, I know and Realignment is now one of my favourite stories. However I just don't like how it ends so bleakly for Harry and Lady Cara. I believe at least Harry should get to leave and live in peace as as he puts it â€˜nothing matters anymore'

He is too driven by hatred

**** Huh, my interpretation of the ending was that it was left up to the reader. An explanation for Harry's survival is that as master of death (and with Tom's soul piece in him still), Harry could survive a killing curse from Tom. An explanation of his death of course is that the Horcrux piece ceased to matter after Tom's resurrection and the master of death part cannot protect the master from death. I like to think Harry survived personally. He's definitely too blinded by hatred, though I think it's a reflection on Harry as a character as opposed to a reflection of the quality of the writing. He may abhor Tom but he is clearly driven by other things. There's still a bit of that "saving people thing" you can see. I think Harry's character works for the fic.

***** I can not deny the writing is truly brilliant. I do like the way you think it ended. So possibly Harry was nursed back to health after effectively disappearing of the face of the earth.

****** Well for some recommendations, there are the common ones of course. Some lesser known ones would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106612/1/Lesser-Evils]] (Harry isn't on the level of Voldemort but is sort of a prodigy like Riddle and Dumbledore) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies]]. The second one has what you're looking for but it's of questionable quality. Mind Arts suggestion is definitely good though it is now abandoned. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher]] is definitely what you're looking for as well. Some more:

****** Is there some type of alternate ending in a seperate chapter or something? All I remember is it ending with Riddle AK'ing him in the back after Harry killed Grindelwald.

******** The ending has great similarities to 'a cadmean victory' and makes it easier to think up a happier ending. Though tbh the writer made no effort whatsoever to make us feel sympathetic towards Harry. Not that we feel sympathetic towards Tom either. Neither did he/she explore the character of Clara very much which made the impact of the ending far less heavy that what you get in a cadmean victory.

** The Mind Arts has something like this. Harry, Grindelwald, Dumbledore and Voldemort are referenced as Centennial Wizards, wizards who only come about once a century. I might have gotten a few things wrong, it's been a while since I read it.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
