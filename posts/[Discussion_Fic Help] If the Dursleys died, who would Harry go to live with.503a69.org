So I've got a fic where the Dursleys (inc. Marge) get killed the summer before third year. (By a Muggle, no magic involved.) Now I'm left with the dilemma of who would take over Harry's guardianship.

*TL;DR:* I know the Weasleys are an obvious option, but I'm interested in other people's ideas. Who do you think are possible, realisitic candidates? Augusta Longbottom? Remus Lupin? The Tonks family? Someone else entirely? (The fic isn't AU enough that the Malfoys or other 'dark' families are a plausible option.)

*Longer Discussion:* Who do you think actually has a say over Harry's guardianship? Dumbledore left him at the Dursleys, but do you think he can actually decide who Harry's meant to be with or was he just the delivery man? (Petunia is Harry's only blood relative so no one would argue her getting custody.) If it's not up to Dumbledore, do you think there's a wizarding world social services? Do wizards have foster families? I'm guessing they don't have orphanages or Riddle would have moved instead of staying at the Muggle one. How much are the wizarding authorities even interested in Harry's placement? And how much would Muggle social services affect things?

In hugely simplified summary of my fic: Harry avoids getting killed with the Dursleys by the timely appearance of Sirius, who knocks out the murderer, and then they run off together.* (Harry figures Sirius can't be all bad if he saved his life, and is also intrigued by the fact Sirius is a wizard and calls him godson.) Two weeks later Harry and Sirius part ways and Harry bumps into Snape, who dumps him at Leaky Cauldron and alerts Dumbledore. Pettigrew will be revealed earlier, Sirius declared innocent of the 1981 murders, and he'll initially take in Harry but then shit happens and he won't be able to look after Harry after Christmas of third year.

Obviously the Muggle authorities are going to be looking for Harry during those two weeks Harry's on the run with Sirius just as much as the wizards are. Even when Harry's delivered to the Cauldron, the police are still going to have to be alerted that he's safe so they stop looking for him, and at that point they're surely going to involve social services. They'll have to be told when Sirius takes custody (or dealt with--memory charms, etc, if necessary), but given that the wizarding authorites only seem to give a crap about Harry when (a) there's a supposed mass murderer escaped from Azkaban, and (b) Voldemort's proven to actually be alive, it seems plausible that when Sirius is no longer an option then the wizards might just let Muggle social services handle things. Especially as the police are still going to be in contact with Harry about the Dursley murders at that time--he'll be a witness in the trial--so just completely ignoring the Muggle side of things would be difficult.

What about emancipation? I don't know much about it or the restrictions involved, but do you think a 13 year old Harry could get himself emancipated? I can see the idea being extremely appealing to him. He has the means and skills to look after himself; the only trouble might be buying/renting a place to live.

So, opinions?

*Theoretically I could have Sirius turn up early enough to save the Dursleys, too, so Harry could go back to them, but other shit will happen later that will prove the Dursleys as unfit guardians by the end of fourth year so I'm still going to have this problem.

Also, just to note, Voldemort won't be a problem in the fic until fifth year; PP is in Azkaban from September of third year so V will spend longer in Albania and I have other plans for Crouch Jr.. Moody will be just Moody and the TWT will run without problems and only three champions.


** If you didn't kill her, Aunt Marge is a horrific but amusing possibility. Here's the reasoning: Dudley would likely go to Aunt Marge, and the Bond of Blood Charm will continue to work so long as Harry shares a roof with Lily's blood. Arguably, Dudley fits that criteria. So Harry has to stay with Dudley to maintain the blood protection.

*** It could be amusing, or potentially disastrous, but both her and Dudley are dead so unfortunately not an option. Also, personally, I can't see her doing it. She clearly loathes Harry and short of magical coercion I can't see her agreeing to take Harry in. Which I suppose could be an option if I went that route; I believe the blood protection needs willing agreement to live together and it's Dudley who'd need to agree, not Marge.

I did consider a random OC who's Lily and Petunia's cousin or something, but that feels like a cop out. Minimal chance of conflict and risk of losing readers who dislike OCs.

** Emancipation would definitely be appealing to the Harry you are describing but, it takes away the potential conflict and intrigue you would be able to include if he went to live with someone with dubious or mysterious intentions. I also personally think it's taking the easy way out, unoriginal, and quite boring to read. I would be more interested if Harry /tried/ to get emancipated and live on his own, then ultimately fails.

I doubt the wizarding world would allow Harry out of their grasp again. He's a celebrity, even more so now that he's in the public eye (school). Many wizarding families would want the prestige of raising The Boy Who Lived and would likely petition to adopt him when the news of his relatives travels. Dark families would obviously want to snare him as well, and his placement could become a political conflict between them and Dumbledore. The Headmaster would want to place Harry somewhere close at hand where he can ensure he remains on the "good" side. Him having the authority to do so is doubtful. It would likely be up to the Ministry, hence the struggle between the dark, light, and strangers to persuade the magical government to give Harry to them to raise "the right way".

That being said, what about Augusta Longbottom taking him in? I don't think I've read that before and it certainly makes sense. She's well off and likely has enough sway with the Ministry and other powerful families to convince them she's the best choice. She is "good", so Dumbledore would be satisfied with her as Harry's guardian. She is also a pureblood, which is the type of person the "dark" and older families ultimately would want caring for Harry in order to teach him their history and beliefs.

**** I could be mistaken, but I think she already hates having to care for Neville. Or maybe Harry would become her favorite because he's more magical and then there would be a sort of reverse situation compared to canon with the Dursleys and Dudley. That would be interesting, to see how Harry would react if he was in Dudley's place. I can also see Harry wanting freedom as a 13 year old, not having to put up with another horrible caregiver

** Simply because I would have a blast reading it, I'd suggest McGonagall. Shes a teacher and well respected in the wizarding world, so I don't see anyone going overly dramatic about it.

If you keep with once established fanon and have Dorea Black as his grandmother, both Andromeda and Narcissa have equally strong family ties and are currently out of Azkaban.

Something I myself am currently trying to formulate into a story is Dumbledore himself taking Harry. With emotional closeness he eventually refuses to let Fate have its way and tries to brute force through the prophecy,...

But it could be interesting to deal with the awkwardness of "my teacher is now my mum". (Not that he'd call or even of think of her as that exactly, but you get the idea.)

** Funilly enough, I was debating on this just yesterday, with the diference that in my scenario this happens when he's still a baby.

Now here's something, I didn't found clear, does Dudley survive the attack? If he does, DUmbledore would want to keep them together, since he's now the only person able to keep the blood protection. If he also dies, then the protection is broken.

If you ask me, Muggle protection services or authorities are a non issue. Due to Harry's "status", I'm sure the ministry would just take no problem in obliviating as necessary to keep him in the magical world.

The decision would likely fall legally onto fudge. Fudge who, as you may recall, can't really make a decision on his own. It's the third year, so he'll still be listening to everything Dumbledore has to say, but he'll also be receiving money from Lucius Malfoy. And I'm sure Harry woul have a say on it too, it's not like Fudge can just decree "You're goinna live with Malfoys now" and he'd have no say in the matter. You don't want to stay on the wrong side of the boy who lives, not when he's adored by the entire magical britain.

Also remember that on third year, Harry would be more than willing to trust Dumbledore almost implicity. If he were to tell Harry this place would be the best for him, he'd accept, even if begrudgingly. So overall. Id say wherever you think Dumbledore would want him, it's msot likely where he'd end up staying.

ALTHOUGH, I have to say if the blood protection is gone, Dumbledore might just not be to bothered where he stays, within reason. So anywhere Harry would chose that wouldn't make Dumbledore go "oh shit not there you idiot" is a reasonable place.

The weasleys being the obvious candidates. Can't see Harry willingly want to stay with Hermione over Ron (unless you're changing the world so that they're madly in love or something), not can I see Dumbledore favouring a Muggle family over a wizard one. Lupin comes to mind, sure, but... AS much as Dumbledore trusts him, I'm not sure he'd trust him enough for this. An accident could happen. And Lupin defintely doesn't trust himself.

If Sirius is ilibated, then he'd be the natural candidate. With you making him available, I'd say it's perfectly plausible for his closest family to do it, by which I mean Tonks and her parents (I'm not sure if TOnks would be living by herself at this point, if you want to make it so, either her or her parents could be a possibility).

And then there's of course just out of the box ideas. You could make it so an extremely wealthy family with no clear connections to the dark side wants to take the boy who lived in. Harry kinda likes them, Dumbledore sees no problems, it could happen.

As for emancipation... I don't know. It does kinda feel in character, but then you also just turned your fic into one of the thousands "indy!harry" that already exist. Why not do something mildly diferent, since that's not the main point of the story anyway?

Anyway, those are my 2 cents on the subject. Actually, that's probably more than 2 cents. I kinda got excited midway.

It's very easy for adults to ignore children as individuals with autonomy. It seems odd to me for an established politician to fear the political clout of a third year student.

If this story's Harry had already demonstrated political power, that attitude wouldn't seem out of place to me. I'd sooner write it from a perspective of avarice than fear: give the kid his cookie today and tomorrow he'll publicly support your rule.

**** Yeah, that's more or less what I ment. I mean, if Fudge just ignores Harry's wishes and forces him to do something he doesn't want, Harry might speak about it, the news spread, and suddenly Fudge is the guy that's siding against the saviour of wizardkind. OF course there's several ways you could spin this, you can have fudge take control of the DP earlier and try to turn the public opinion against harry earlier (Sure, there's no dead Cedric or mistrious Tri Wizard cup win, but the Chamber incident just happened, so you can use that), you cna have Fudge try to manipulate Harry (or at least, having him order someone to do it, since I believe he lacks the savoir-faire to do so himself), I think there's lots of possibilities.

*** Dudley does die, so the protection is gone.

I do want Harry to have some say in his placement. His decision would probably be the Weasleys, but I would like a bit more conflict out of the situation than it being:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, who would you like to live with?"

  "Weasleys."

  "Okay then, have fun!"
#+end_quote

I hadn't considered the option of the Tonks taking them because of the connection through Sirius (I was thinking more along the lines of fanon "the Blacks are distantly related to the Potters" so they get custody). Tonks living alone and taking Harry in could be... interesting.

I considered an OC, but it feels like it'd be a bit of stretch, plus I risk alienating readers who dislike (unnecessary) OCs. If I did use OC, I'd probably go for a Muggle who's Lily and Petunia's cousin, rather than a wizard, so I can at least argue that it's for the blood protection.

#+begin_quote

I'd like to say that it wouldn't be even if I did go for emancipation. Most of those seem to include suave!Harry who can charm all the ladies and out-politic all the politicians and goblins. I think canon-Harry, and certainly the Harry I'm writing, would just find somewhere to live and the nearest grocery store and that's it. Maybe set up a fireplace with floo access so he can visit the Weasleys, but certainly none of the other trapfalls of indy!Harry stories.

Your 2 cents (and more) is appreciated!

**** You could do it through a potter-black relationship, I was just trying to keep it as canon compliant as possible, but hey, most people are still using Dorea and Charles potter anyway, I'm sure no one would bat an eye if you did so. But If Sirius get Ilibated, as Harry's natural guardian, he'd have to have a say on where he's staying too, that's why I was thinking of the Tonks family in general, and Tonks herself in particular. Like you said, interesting, since I don't think I've seen it before.

Quite frankly, I don't care much for OC's either. I just mentioned for the sake of argument, since that seemed like a possibility in-universe.

** If Sirius has a say, then he would probably ask for either the Tonks family (as the only relatives of his that he actually likes) or the Weasleys (for their existing relationship with Harry).

If the ministry is deciding, things could go very weird. The Malfoys would have sway, and would want him quite unprotected. Fudge would want him with someone loyal to the Ministry. His guardian would definitely be about politics then, not about any real suitability. Dawlish comes to mind as a ministry loyalist, so Fudge might consider him.

** It would likely come down to Dumbledore. If, for whatever reason, he felt it was better for Harry to go back to the muggle world during summers to get away from the insanity that happens in the WW, I could see Harry being handled by child services.

However, you'd imagine if Hermione found out that Harry was to be shipped off to a group home or something, she'd beg her parents to take him in for summers, especially considering he could pay them for expenses and they seem to be fairly well off anyway. Hermione would want to do it for Harry, but also for herself, since having him there would mean she would feel less isolated from the WW during summers.

This situation could cause conflict between Harry and Hermione, Harry and Ron, or both. Hermione because they'd be spending all their time together, and the things they find annoying about each other would become more apparent. This could ultimately strengthen their friendship as they're forced to be mature and accept their differences and blah blah blah. It would also mean that, for the first time, Harry and Hermione are sharing moments that Ron isn't part off. Cue jealousy.

I think Augusta Longbottom is a good choice. Potential conflict with Neville, Harry learning what it's like to live in the WW outside of Hogwarts, exploration of Neville's childhood, etc. Only problem I can see is I can't see any motivation for Augusta to take him in. She doesn't seem like one who would care that much about having the prestige of being guardian to the BWL,

** Well first of all you have to consider how public you want to make the Dursley's deaths. Who even knows that Harry lives with them? Does the Ministry know? Is it common knowledge or did Dumbledore keep it a secret?

Depending on that answer i can see several outcomes. Either you have some kind of Ministry Department making the decision, which would probably put him to his closest family which if you go with fanon and have Dora Black as Harry's grandmother would be either the Tonks family or the Malfoys, or maybe with a godmother that you can make up on the spot.

I can't really see Dumbledore ever letting Lucius Malfoy get custody even if he wanted it (which i don't think he would [i mean he would have probably wanted it just after James and Lily died but not when he's already 13]) so that's out. I don't think Dumbledore would have a problem with Andromeda taking custody and you could make Tonks an older sister to Harry which is always awesome.

Now if you go with the secrecy route, Harry would probably just end up with the Weasley's and that's it. I don't think either canon Harry or anyone else would have a problem with that.

I can't see canon Harry pushing for emancipation at age 13. He's a follower and would probably just do what DUmbledore tells him to and therefore end up with the Weasleys.

Edit: As for Remus: Nope for several reasons. Remus himself wouldn't trust himself around Harry and neither would the Ministry.

*** The Ministry would surely know; they sent him owls, after all. Wiz. society isn't fully explored, but I believe they at least have something along the lines of a national census and registered addresses, etc, for all the wizards in Britain. General public wouldn't know initially, but a classic Skeeter Article^{TM} at the end of third year makes the Dursley deaths public and might prompt a sudden rush of "We'll look after him!" from people that just want to be able to say they're guardian to the BWL.

I agree with your thoughts on Lucius and Remus. I know the Weasleys are the most obvious and likely option that's canon compliant, and would be Harry's first choice, but I'm reluctant. Not toally sure why except that it maybe feels too easy--he knows them and fits in, it feels a bit "happily ever after" (even if this isn't the end), no conflict of "am I going to like living here? are my new guardian's nice?" etc.

My personal choice would be the Tonks family if you don't want the Weasley's simply because i always enjoy Harry and Tonks interacting.

The only other option that could potentially create some sort of conflict would be putting him with Augusta Longbottom. It would make him closer to Neville and Augusta isn't someone i would consider a loving motherfigure so that might prove interesting. You could make Alice Longbottom Harry's godmother, that should be sufficient reason for him to end up there.

Of course you could always go the Marriage Contract route and put Harry with his betrothed. The Bones and Greengrass family are the most popular options for that afaik.

Augusta definitely doesn't seem to be the best parental figure, but in different ways to the Dursleys so it could be interesting to explore those differences.

** Emancipation is only a remote possibility. However, it's not clear that he has the skills or the means to look after himself. We're only given a hint of his wealth and how it compares to the cost of living. There is a lot involved with being an adult that is not necessarily obvious or easy to navigate. With Statute of Secrecy, this is only worse.

I'm imagining Harry getting out on his own, finding a cheap hostel in the Muggle world, and thirty days later getting hit with a series of owls: failure to register place of residence, 500 galleon fine; insufficient warding on a magical person's residence, 500 galleon fine; possession of magical artifacts in the domicile of unaffiliated Muggles, 2,000 galleon fine and seizure of the artifacts in question; notification of failure to claim Wizengamot seat within the prescribed time, with impending auction of said seat...

This is a post...about a fanfic...in a forum about fan fiction...it's all fan fiction. I'm talking about fan fiction. Not canon.

You might have had a hint because the original post started with "I've got a fic" and proceeded to ask for advice about how to proceed with that fic, which diverges from canon. You might have had a hint because this subreddit has "fanfiction" in the title.

So why are you complaining about a suggestion violating canon? Do you automatically hate all stories with any canon divergence and want to force everyone else to hate them too?

Besides, none of that was fanon. It was an idea I had that could lead to a one-shot. It's no more fanon than my story about Harry having the official Tri-Wizard Tournament switched to an gobstones competition completed within ten minutes of his selection. It's no more fanon than my story about Voldemort wearing the Diadem of Ravenclaw instead of immediately turning it into a horcrux. An example of fanon would be Severus Snape being Draco Malfoy's godfather, or the existence of magical guardians -- things that are persistently believed or widely used in the fandom or fan fiction.

I don't have much personal fanon or headcanon. Any two stories I write might have widely diverging precepts about how the world works. In this idea, there are strict requirements about the red tape and requirements for where to live, if you're living in a mundane community. In another story I write or think of, there might not be enough people in the magical world to enforce such laws, so they've never been crafted. In another, Arthur Weasley managed to craft laws carefully to allow much greater integration than you might expect. In another, the government might have explicitly forbidden magical persons from living in mundane areas.

That's because it's fan fiction, and while I must be consistent within a story, I don't need to be consistent between stories. And none of it needs to be consistent with canon.

Since you seem not to understand this, maybe [[/r/hpfanfiction]] isn't the right place for you to hang out.

#+begin_quote
  all that needs the magical world to give a crap about Muggle laws and statuses
#+end_quote

Did you even read what I wrote? It was about /magical Britain's/ laws about adults choosing their place of residence.

The only things it requires are the magical world recognizing Harry's emancipation and someone finding a reason to let Harry board there over the summer when he's only fourteen. Since Dumbledore arranged for Harry's original adoption, it's reasonable to assume that either the adoption / guardianship systems are in some way integrated (likely with the help of the Obliviators), or Harry's placement is primarily in the purview of the magical world. In either of these cases, Harry would be emancipated in the eyes of the magical government, and he would possibly be emancipated with the Muggle government.

But that's about canon. A fanfic author can choose the type and nature of legal integration between the magical world's legal system and the mundane government. They could choose where Harry's emancipation takes place. Similarly, if you object about magical guardians, even if that were a canon concept, a work of fan fiction could include it or not according to the author's preference.

As for convincing a hostel owner to let Harry board there when he's just a kid, there are a half dozen simple ways to handle it, and a half dozen obvious alternatives that might not involve hostels but still get Harry living with people who aren't his relatives and therefore aren't cleared to be around magic.

See, again if you'd stopped to think for more than two seconds you'd realize there are two ways for this to go. Either Harry gets emancipated via Muggle channels (which he legally can't in the UK, being under the age of sixteen here, but let's entertain the thought), in which case there is zero indication that the magical world would recognize that he's been emancipated since they operate via different laws and a different system of majority - in other words, as he's still a magical minor he's not the one being slapped with all your fines. Or he gets emancipated via magical channels, in which case during the process of emancipation he would be informed of what he's supposed to file and what he's supposed to do (and in fact, if you're building off real world emancipation he would have to first demonstrate that he has a suitable abode before he can be emancipated). Like, how do you think the law even works?

But again, feel free to rant.

****** You're so focused on portraying my idea as terrible that, as soon as you come up with a potential objection, you rush to tell me about it without considering whether the objection is insuperable, or even vaguely reasonable.

- Economics are off: I gave some numbers off the top of my head, and I'd come up with a specific value of the galleon before writing the story. Canon economics are horribly inconsistent anyway.
- Muggle minimum emancipation age: magic-only works, or move the events to around Harry's sixteenth birthday.
- Disconnect between muggle and magical emancipation: again, move it forward a couple years. Or magical government officials use their magic to run rough-shod over their muggle counterparts. You can't argue that that's violating the spirit or letter of canon.
- Someone would explain to Harry the laws: what world are you living in? Seriously. What percentage of the law did you have to learn by your sixteenth birthday?
- This is obviously the setup for a crack/humor fic. Why are you trying to apply strict logic to it?

*** In that situation, I can see him just saying fuck it and getting someone to be his guardian. (Assuming emancipation can be undone. I know nothing about it.) Also dealing with being poor after paying all those fines.

** There is a lot of fun you could do with this, the simple answer is that he'd just go live at Hogwarts. At 13 he's old enough to look after himself without constant supervision. He just needs somewhere to eat/sleep where he'll be safe.

** I think Ted and Andromeda make the most legal sense. If you go with the Longbottoms there'd have to be a pretty convincing reason why the Tonks get knocked out of the running. Not only would Andromeda be Sirius' first choice blood relative, there's the additional bonus of Ted being a muggle; they'd be able to demonstrate cultural stability for Harry to courts. On top of that, their daughter is an auror. Assuming she still lives at home, that's an additional measure of protection and ministry ties for Harry.

Obviously the Malfoys would be doing their damndest to get their hands on him too, having just as equal a blood claim and even more money--I'd think this would also be a natural plot point.

So if you go with Augusta you'd have to overthrow these considerations to make it believable IMO.

** Remus wouldn't be allowed for the simple fact he's a werewolf. The public would go nuts.

Andromeda would be a no as well. She's a Black. Suspect. (That made me feel racist)

The Grangers could be likely.

The Weasleys would be likely but Malfoy would likely point out how poor they are and how it looks like they're after Harry's money, possibly suggesting himself instead.

Longbottoms are pretty likely if you go fanon convention that Alice was Harry's godmom.

I think, with what i got from skimming the text, that his staying at Hogwarts over the summer would be the best choice and probably one that Harry would jump at, potentially annoying Hermione which would then lead Harry to frustration as he becomes her research mule as he has to look up things for her in the library she can't access but he can. (this could be a pretty funny short story, in fact, where owl after owl arrives with Hermione in the alley, looking at the book list of the school and the books in the stores there, making notes of things she absolutely must learn immediately(then harry realizes the house-elves can copy the books with a literal snap and soon he has an assembly line of a hundred house-elves copying the info Hermione wants while he lazes in a hammock with a drink with an umbrella in it. Then Albus is all "Have you seen any house elves, Harry? I had to go to the village to get dinner" and Harry is guilty looking))

  his staying at Hogwarts over the summer
#+end_quote

I hadn't even considered that, unless he was made the ward of one of the teachers who chose to spend the summer there instead of going home; it's pretty clear students at Hogwarts in the summer is a big no-no.

You present an amusing scenario, though. You gonna write that one-shot?
