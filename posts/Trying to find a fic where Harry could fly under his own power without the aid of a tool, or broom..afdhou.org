The only thing I clearly remember is that it got to at least second year(probably further, but second year at the least). That's really all. I think he could do it without wings, but I could be wrong. Also even if it doesn't meet my personal requirements, please put any fics where Harry can at least fly, again without aid, or broom. Just so that there is such a recent list on here for others who might be interested.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Pretty sure Rise of the Wizards has it. I can't remember the name of the fic but there was one where he could fly because he sacrificed a ghost in a ritual.

*** If you could find that ghost one i'd greatly appreciate it, and owe you one internet favour. I've never read a fic where a ghost died, or was sacraficed to power something. This greatly interests me.

Thanks,\\

**** I'm pretty sure the ghost one is linkffn(The Soul Within) where the piece of a soul that splintered from Voldemort merged with Lily's protection and created another soul, with a merge of personalities from Voldemort and Lily, and Harry goes dark trying to find a way to create Violet a body.

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!

** I remember atleast two fics where he can fly without any aids... In the Hero trilogy.. In the second book of the hero trilogy he was capable of flying without aids.. As well as the third book of the series.. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4042356/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Defiance-of-the-Hero]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4413991/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Soul-of-the-Hero]]

Harry potter and the Wastelands of time and its sequel Harry potter and the Heartlands of time also has a flight capable harry. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

**** Pretty much non-existent. There's a scene with emotional Ron that accuses Harry of something he didn't do, but its like a 1 minute conversation that Harry simply doesn't give a fuck. That's it, basically. Dumbledore is really nice in this, specially towards the end.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

** I'd quite like to see such a story too!

Funny you should mention it now, as in my /Parselmouth/, Hermione's just learned Unsupported Flight from the Dementors and intends to teach it to Harry, though he hasn't mastered it yet. But that's obviously not what you're looking for. Best luck finding it!

*** I may actually read it. I've been trying to branch out a bit with my stories, and try to follow other characters that aren't the main character. I mean variety is the spice of life, and i've mostly been sticking with salt.
