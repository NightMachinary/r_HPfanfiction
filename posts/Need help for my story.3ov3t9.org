I've got a plot bunny in my head but I need technical help to make it sound realistic. It's inspired by halo and i'm writing about the augmentation. What magical version of augmentation can I use that would sound realistic?


** My favorite theory is that magic serves as a natural boost to the health of witch or wizard. Depending on how magically powerful you make a character you could theorize this grants them above normal human abilities.

Seriously, Dumbledore is pretty spry for someone who was pushing over 115, he retrieved 2 Horcrux's, albeit one had some assistance.

*** Marchbanks was at least 130+, I think it's pretty safe to say that magic gives people longer lifespans, at the very least.

*** Eh, its always best to stay away from 'how magically powerful' someone is. This isn't dragon ball Z, Harry's powerlevel is not over 9000. Dumbledore isn't more magical than anyone else, he's just better.

** Something based off of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Re'em_blood][Re'em Blood]], perhaps. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorn_blood][Unicorn blood]], [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Salamander_blood][Salamander blood]], and [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wit-Sharpening_Potion][Wit-sharpening potion]] also come to mind, and that's with a bare minimum in research.

You could just peruse [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Potions][Potions]] and [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Potion_ingredients][Ingredients]] to see if anything fits your needs.

** I'd say be careful. If one character can do it, so can others. Harry becoming a match for Voldemort would be unrealistic. Voldemort is known to use magic to augment his power (Horcruxes), and he would be the most versed and most extreme in this. In order to keep a character from becoming too powerful, augmentation should come with a price - super strength would put bigger strain on the body, causing injuries from overexertion, etc. If it's a good idea for one character, other, more experienced practitioners, would do it /better/.

Be careful to stay away from super!Harry cliches, as it is very hard to write good fiction without proper challenges for the protagonist.

** If you want to use magical power granting tatoos, you've got a wide range of "augmentations". Or you can look at Shadowrun's adepts for examples of magical power boosts. Then there's the very canon "wear and use magic items" route.

** Make it based around objects, I think. Things like Moody's enchanted eye - have their purpose be based around whatever the enchantment is cast on. Increased perception time? An hourglass, perhaps, or a pair of eagle eyes. Agility could be the paw of a weasel or something akin to that.

** Make augmentation random, like it enhances you but you don't know how. Obviously done could kill you like suddenly getting gills and suffocating. It would be up to you if it's a handy but small thing or an op thing like killing people with your mind

** You can have the transmutation or transfiguration of bones into metal or a similar hard substance to help with durability. You could have a potion that increases tissue density. You could easily recreate a Spartan's HUD with a combination of the enchantments made for the foe glass, sneakscope, Marauder's Map, and Mad Eye's eye thingy. You could also have runes etched into a helmet to not only offer greater protection, but increase reflexes, vision, and the mental areas too such as intelligence, memory, and creativity.

The thing about the Spartans in Halo though is that all the augmentations had nasty side affects if they didn't work just right. If the bones weren't an exact composition, the blood wouldn't flow properly. Drastically changing your tissue so drastically could cause your heart to fail. Altering your vision could lead to permanent blindness and increasing your reflexes and response time could increase your hand-eye coordination... or it could give you Parkinson's Disease. If the augmentation is done on somebody, they have a very slim chance of actually surviving, let alone being in actual fighting shape.
