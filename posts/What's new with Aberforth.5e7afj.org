It's been a year since the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3kpbua/aberforth_fics/][last Aberforth Dumbledore request thread]]. Anything new and exciting in the world of the better, or at least more alcoholic, Dumbledore?


** Well, he plays a major role in my AU story "Patron", though he doesn't appear for the first 15 or so chapters. The story does explore his past, and his relationship to Dumbledore.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
