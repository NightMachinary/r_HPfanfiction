I am looking for a few fics one where harry is trained by James Potter( alive) the difference a father makes I think it was called.

Another Sirius raises harry and trains his to survive and fight it has a lot of dueling and learning warding magic( black family death wards are mention in the story)

another is Lily has a brother who trains harry named Mark or Micah Evans . He is military and trains harry Dudley Harry and Neville in combat aNd to wage war


** I couldn't make much sense of that wall of text but given the title here's one where Hermione organizes a boot camp and Harry and Ron join in later on, lots of shooting death eaters and cool explosions. Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  A baby is left on a doorstep, only this time Petunia Dursley isn't the one who takes it in. Charles 'Hawk-Eye' Potter, retired Sniper of her Majesty's Army is surprised when his adopted grandson turns out to be his own flesh and blood. Now Jamie has to deal with learning magic on top of his regular studies. It's going to be a bumpy ride if he wants to be a pilot in the RAF!

  If there's one thing Lal hates, it's Vongola craziness. On the other hand, perhaps being randomly thrown back in it time is a good thing. After all, she had so many regrets before she joined the military, and now she has a chance to do things right. There's only thing she didn't anticipate the fact that the guy who had a crush on her forever has a few secrets of his own.
