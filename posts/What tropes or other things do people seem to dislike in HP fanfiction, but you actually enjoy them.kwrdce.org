** Family magic I kinda of really liked the thought of skills being passed through the bloodline. Good Weasley's I love these redheads! Free! Sirius Do I need to explain why I like this? Snape bashing I just hate the guy.

**** The bot hates me üôÑ The only one I know by name is a mauraders plan of ff.net by catsarecool it has one of my favorite ways family magic is presented. HOWEVER that fic ends the story with a heavy dose of victim blaming. Which is not cool. So maybe avoid the last ten chapters if you give it go. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

****** There is a female character that gets drugged and sexually assaulted. While under the influence of the potions she betrays Harry and company. The author sends her to prison for it.

** Things I like that some others don't: -I read stories where dumbledore is good and that's fine but I think the canon character was manipulative and shitty so i am all for bashing

-Snape bashing

-I don't think marriage law sucks tho I understand it can be done poorly. But I am a sucker for forced proximity tropes and it leaves a lot of room for chaos and funny stuff

-I like the traditional pure blood culture. I'm reading All The Young Dudes and they show the differences in the Black family and Potter family despite them being both pure blood and I think it's really interesting to read about this super conservative tradition obsessed suffocating family structure. I also like the political slytherin/pure blood family characterizations

-apparently no one likes Angelina but I really like her and like her with George or Fred.

** Bashing

Certain characters like Hermione are so glorified in fanfiction for the most part so it's nice to see the opposite sometimes. I just enjoy seeing characters shown in a different way. Yeah, sometimes it's not well written and the dialogue is awkward but I still enjoy it

** The Pureblood nobility trope. No matter how many times I saw that trope being used, I still always loved it.

** I don't know if a lot of people actually dislike this one but: Harry ending up in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. Better than Gryffindor (done in canon and so many fanfictions it's not that interesting) or Slytherin (overdone in fanfiction and is often used for edgy indy Harry and almost never interesting).

The downside to this is that Hufflepuff Harry is usually just Gryffindor Harry in different colors. And I read Ravenclaw Harry in hopes of seeing him become the magical equivalent of a doctor or scientist or something. Or since the stories don't tend to leave Hogwarts, I'd at least like to see Harry being nerdy as a student. But it never happens. In place of actually being characterized as a smart person, we're always just told that he gets good grades and reads a lot of books as a throwaway line.

So, I'm stuck with either stories that are stale or stories that pretty disappointing.

*** I agree but one of the things I would like to see more in the WBWL community, one of my favorite tropes that a lot of people hate, is a higher amount of Huffelpuf and Griffindor Harry I think I found 1 of each in that community.

** For me it's the combination of lordship trope and the wife per line trope. It makes sense for me that the old families want to retain their political power but have the wife per line trope so no one has to much political power. To me Harry at most would have 3 lines though. Potter, Prevell and Black.(maybe through some godfather ritual made Harry eligible for the black family)
