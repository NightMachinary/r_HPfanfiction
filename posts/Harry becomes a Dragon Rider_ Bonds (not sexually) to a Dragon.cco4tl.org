:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There is this fanfic that had Harry kidnapped in 4th or 5th year summer because he was 'chosen' to become a dragon rider of a sort. Goes to this training school, basically gets beaten every day because he is 'just a human' and had no prior experience with a sword let alone elemental magic. He had an inner guardian Dragon (I think) and it advises him and guides him into being the best student in the training school (Hidden of course). He makes friends with a wind elemental who figures out who the mysterious, insanely strong, student was.

Anyone who can help me?


** Sounds like it could be this old school fic:

** I'm sorry, I couldn't stop laughing at the title.

Check out scaled mother. It's not the fic you're looking for, but it's pretty decent.

*** I mean do you call a Pern like bonding sexual? Nobody screws their dragon, but when the dragon mates the riders do too, whether they want to or not....

**** No, I don't consider that to be sexually bonded, when I state (sexually bonded), I mean that somehow the dragon mates WITH their rider, or something similar. Of course, I don't shame those who enjoy stories that have those aspects, I just wanted to find a particular Fan fiction.

*** He doesn't do anything in that series that OP said he did.

Other than bonding to a dragon, he leads his group and all the training in it. There are also no wind elementals in it. He also doesn't go to a hidden super!school.
