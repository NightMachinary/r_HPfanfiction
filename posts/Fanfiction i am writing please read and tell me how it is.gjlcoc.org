** I don't like the fic, but that is just my own feelings. You really, really need to get a beta though.

*** A beta isn't to fix laziness. Although I suspect that riotous laughter you hear now is [[/u/rpeh]] after reading my opinion there...

It doesn't capitalize proper nouns. The sentence structure is choppy at best. ESL is a bit of an excuse but the only real coherent part of the entire story is the part plagiarized from Goblet of Fire.

It is not the beta's job to fix everything for you. He needs to read more about writing and come up with a better understanding of Grammar.

I'd recommend Strunk and White's 'The Elements of Style'. If I were to beta it and my first thing is that it cant be bothered with basic capitalization and punctuation..why would I bother? Why would I even think it would listen to me.

If it's not even going to capitalize names it's pretty much a lost cause.

**** Actually although I could accuse [[/u/TE7]] of a lot of things, even in the absence of the CCTV from that incident outside the pet grooming salon, I'm not going to accuse him of laziness. Procrastination, maybe, but it's not exactly lazy to write a 65,000 word (and still growing, ffs) "epilogue" to one story purely because you don't want to write the next bit of your main story.

*** First time writing , thanks for the review .

to register with the site as a beta-reader and offer your beta services, you must meet *ALL* the qualifications below.

1. Be a registered member for at least 1 month or more.
2. Must have published at least 5 stories on the site OR have published entries totaling at least 6000 words.
3. Must accurately complete both the Profile and Preferences part of this beta section.

I haven't met the conditions so i can't have a beta.

** Well let's start with the positives.

First, it's good that you've taken the plunge and started to write a story. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step and, well, you've taken that first step.

Second, I like that you decided to explore a clear "what if?" scenario rather than doing something really boring like simply retelling the canon story as you think it should have gone, which happens far too often.

So there's something good to take away.

On the negative side, spelling, formatting, punctuation and grammar are poor and make reading difficult.

The main plot point, that Lily and James survive, has almost no impact on the story. Take chapter 4, for instance, where the entirety of HP Chamber of Secrets is described in a couple of hundred words and Harry's parents' contributions are to be summoned into Dumbledore's office and then for James to laugh.

Again, you've taken a brave step in publishing your story and you're to be congratulated for that but I think you need more practise in writing English before you take it any further.

*** Thanks mate. First time writing and got a bit lazy. I have tried to make up for that.I am planning for james and lily to have a bigger part in 5th year and further.

And you are correct. I need to improve a lot.Writing a story for the first time made me lazy and that was reflected in my writing.
