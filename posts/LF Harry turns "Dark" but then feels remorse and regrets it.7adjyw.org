I was recently reading a grey!Harry fic and in one part, Harry is very reluctant to embrace the Darkness of Magic and still has a moral compass. I just thought it would be interesting to read a story where Harry turns dark for various reasons but then feels remorse and then decides not to be Dark anymore.

Does anyone have any suggestions? It doesn't necessarily have to be Harry who feels remorse, it can be any other character.


** Most grey fics have a Harry where he questions himself every step of the way. Looking for an author to be decisive with their characters is like asking for water to turn into gold.

*** Yeah, that tends to be a common theme. I think it's inevitable in Harry-turns-dark fics that try. I just think it would be interesting to read about a Dark Harry who turned "good" again, so basically the opposite way of Harry questioning himself.

*** I'm not sure I would call that an indecisive author. It is more that the easiest way to create a grey character is to have them fence-sit.

Most of the time you have a character say "Screw you both My way is better" you end up having grey vs grey not light vs grey vs dark :P

*** I don't really think a reluctant Harry means the author is being indecisive.

** Well, there's remorse of a sort in "Resurrexit", but I might be giving too much of the story away by saying it has a Dark Harry.

Ah, meh, so what. On second glance, it looks like the darkness is pretty apparent from the story description. This Harry wants /vengeance./

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...

** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)

The best slytherin harry out there. He's not the goody two shoes that he was in canon and dabbled heavily in dark magic. He's also quite conflicted about his place in the war, and only the fact that Voldemort killed his parents is keeping him going.

***** Yeah but I just remember reading and being years in, and Harry is still struggling through Hogwarts.

Just that he isn't very "great" and doesn't seem to be getting that way.
