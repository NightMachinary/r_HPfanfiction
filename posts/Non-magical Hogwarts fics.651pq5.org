So I just read a really interesting fic, linkffn(9305868), where the world of Harry Potter gets placed into the Pokemon world. Now, I've never read a pokemon fic, haven't watched the show since I was a kid, don't play the games, but this is an incredible story! Basically this story is Harry Potter without magic and with Pokemon. So there is still Hogwarts, Voldemort, Harry, Remus, all his friends, but they live in the pokemon world.

Its a really refreshing take on the characters and honestly you don't need to be super familiar with all the pokemon. Just a quick google and you have an image.

So my question is... Are there any other fics that take this drastic transformative direction? I know that there's one where it's a spy school (Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, maybe? Can't remember). Het/Slash don't really care.

Yep, that's the one. I'm about an eighth of the way through and it's pretty good so far. I've heard it gets even better in the later chapters. It is a "crossover" with James Bond and Alex Mack but only in name, really. There are some references to those, but no common characters or anything.
