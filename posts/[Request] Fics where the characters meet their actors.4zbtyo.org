I'm looking for something where various characters from the books (or movies) end up in our world and meet the actors that played them. It's weird, I know, but my interest was sparked when I read what Daniel Radcliffe had to say about Richard Griffiths' (Vernon Dursley) death, and thought it would be a shock for Harry to see himself speak so fondly of a man he despised.


** Do your actors know the outcome of the story?

If yes, then that's no different than 'characters reading the Books' fics.

Actors replacing their characters with full knowledge of the outcome can be fun, such as *Sean Bean Saves Westeros - Book 1: Sean Lends a Hand*, linkffn(10557480)

** In my fantastic four xover story in my anthology, harry and Hermione are made into real people by franklin richards based off a fanfiction representation of them. Harry and Daniel Radcliffe meet and are basically bffs but i don't ever show it in the story, just reference it.
