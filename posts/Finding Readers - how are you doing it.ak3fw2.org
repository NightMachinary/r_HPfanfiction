I am genuinely at a loss as to how to go about this. I have a story, that I wrote over the course of five months, and now I'm finally posting it, and updating consistently. Twice a week. It's up to 21 chapters. And I have some really, really amazing readers, who leave wonderful reviews (and I love them so much!), but overall there are only a few people finding it, and it's barely getting any views. I'm curious as to what I can do, to try and find more. I do post it here occasionally, and on facebook once or twice, but I'm starting to wonder if my concept might be too out there, and is scaring people off. Do you guys have any suggestions, or maybe can you tell me if it, honestly, /is/ the concept?

Basically, it's an AU 5th year story, where Harry switches places with the actor who plays him - who is an OC that I've made up. It is kind of RPF-adjacent, but it's not actually an RPF - or at least I don't feel that it is, since all the non HP characters are my own OCs, and it doesn't do any of those things that an RPF story is typically associated with. And those are things which personally I don't enjoy. The only similarities to real life are that, obviously, there are actors who play HP characters, and I've given some of them slightly life-inspired names, just for fun. But it's an adventure/mystery story, and I mainly wanted to play with the switching concept, and with having my Muggle OC discover real magic and explore Hogwarts, while Harry is stuck in Muggle London, trying to sort out how he's supposed to be an actor, and how he can get back to Hogwarts before Voldemort finds and murders the OC in his place, because of course Voldemort is out there trying to kill Harry and I thought it would be quite fun. And it really, really was. To write, I mean. Do you guys think this could be scaring people off? I'm honestly curious!

Thank you for reading this!

EDITED to add, thanks so much for all this very helpful feedback. You guys are the best, and I appreciate it a lot! :)


** Honestly yeah that does sound a little out there for my tastes. I'm fairly vanilla, but you'll find that everyone comes to fanfic for different reasons, and I can't think of fics that are universally popular. For you, something that will put a lot of people off is the OC. People don't tend to read fanfic for new characters, they like to read about their favourite. So as a new author with a first fic, you have to think, why exactly would a reader choose my OC?

That doesn't at all mean that your fic isn't good or you won't be able to find readers, you just have to recognise that it's such an original idea that it will never be mainstream. You definitely have the right attitude and it's so important that you're finding it fun to write, so if I were you I would just treasure the readers who are clearly loving your work

*** Thanks, I really appreciate your thoughts!

It's kind of what worries me, which is unfortunate, because it /does/ actually focus quite heavily on Harry as the main character regardless of the additional OCs, as well as plenty of other canon characters like Ron, Hermione, and Sirius. Ironically, in its development it follows a very canon-esque storyline otherwise in terms of the plot. I guess I'm just feeling a bit down about it all lately, but I do absolutely treasure the readers I do have, you are right. Thank you!

** I actually tracked your story down after reading your post and had a question. Any reason why you aren't using the real life actor's names? It's a small thing but the different names...especially the odd spelling of of Daniel/Daniyel make it harder to read. It's an intriguing idea and making the 'alternate universe' based solely on the real life actors might resonate more with readers as they are familiar with and invested in Daniel, Emma and Rupert. If you've changed it because you're worried about legalities I'd at the very least use their real life first names.

From a practical standpoint I've found that chapters posted on Sunday morning/mid afternoon Eastern Standard time seem to do the best for me...I'm guessing because it catches the folks in Europe on Sunday night and everyone in the U.S. for the entire day.

*** It's a good question. In my original version of TP I /did/ use their real names, but when I decided to work on the re-write, I really took a moment to think about it and I realized I did not want to write a story about Daniel, Rupert, and Emma. It's not so much about the legalities, but Daniyel, Ella, and Robert are not, in fact, real people. They are nothing like the real counterparts that may have inspired them, and I really wanted to draw a line there and make that clear, because writing about real people isn't exactly something I feel comfortable with or actually want to do. Daniyel is actually a real name, albeit with odd spelling, and I do pronounce it the same way in my head. :)

If you do find the concept intriguing, I do hope you'll consider checking it out despite the spellings.

Thanks so much for the posting day tips!

**** Your explanation makes sense but I honestly think it may be hurting your views/reception. You've chosen to create an alternate universe kinda/sorta based on real life but not actually which makes it even less accessible/relatable. The negative impact of using OC's would be mitigated by basing it on "real life" names but you've lost that advantage. It is clear that you are referencing Dan, Emma and Rupert with the names you've used so why not go all in on the concept?

I know it's stupid but when I read the name Daniyel it sounds in my head like 'Dan I Yell' every time and it immediately takes me out of the story...same with the use of Emily and Rob to a lesser extent. Every time I read 'Rob' I initially think of 'Ron' then realize it's really the actor...it makes it harder to get lost in the writing when I'm having to think about which universe I'm in at the time.

I'm going to keep reading as it is an interesting idea...I just think you may have put up a few unnecessary hurdles for yourself in an otherwise unique concept.

***** Thanks so much! Those are all good points, which are probably all true. You've definitely given me something to think about, and I really appreciate it. I didn't actually think about how people would read Daniyel in their minds. I had actually considered going with David instead, but I wanted to be able to shorten it to Dan, still. You should actually see the list of names I considered, beside setting on Daniyel. It was quite... /amusing/. ^^;

** Speaking from personal experience:

- Post on Saturday or Sunday evening GMT. That way you are in the "prime" weekend slots for the US readers, who are by far the largest reader base on FFN.

- Rare fandom favourite characters are a sure way to remain visible because they are popular but there is not a lot of content. Tag accordingly. And we are talking about characters like Nymphadora or Andromeda Tonks, Fleur, Pansy, Daphne, not Snape or Malfoy (way too much content to be visible without an established reader base).

- You need to have Harry tagged. Otherwise, you will get a lot fewer views. If your story does not include Harry, you have to expect a lot less attention than you would have otherwise.

- Your story needs to stand out and the description has to make that clear. You have a few hundred characters to convince people that your story is interesting and not just the usual recycled ideas. Avoid questions.

- Archive is not really worth the effort. The comment interface is better, but I had several long discussions via FFN PM while the feedback on Archive was pretty bland and short. And no responses to my answers. It will get you a few additional views, but don't expect much.

*** Thanks! I've been posting on Saturday mornings and Wednesday, but are Saturday evenings better? I may give that a go next time.

For tags, are you referring to Ao3?

I'm definitely getting a lot more readers on FFN than A03, so I think you're absolutely right there. The one thing I like better about Ao3 is more space for a description.

​

That said... about the description, I've reworked it on FFN several times. Would you mind telling me, if it sounds at all intriguing?

/When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?/

**** No, I mean the story tags on FFN. Four Characters (and if they are paired), two genres and a universe (Founders, Marauders, Books, Movies, Post-Hogwarts, Next-Gen IIRC). On Archive it's not an issue because you can have a hundred tags (even if that makes your story look like shite), but on FFN you have a very limited amount of tags to present your work.

I believe that a lot of people search for Harry and Character X, which is why the popular background cast is a good way to stay visible for the people interested in those characters. And those are the people you want as readers the most. They are already invested in your cast.

As for your description. Daniyel is a stupid name because it looks like it was chosen by a mother who tried too hard to make her child stand out. Grammarly tells me it is spelt wrong. Questions do not belong in a description because the answer is often rather obvious. You have not tagged it as a tragedy, so the answer is "probably not very high. A few background characters may bite it, but that's not really bad."

**** I don't usually read OC stories, but the description sounds interesting. The name Daniyel instead of Daniel really puts me off the story though. I would imagine it would drive me nuts to read a fic where it's spelled that way the entire time.

I would take his name off the summary and make it closer to iniga123's suggested rewrite.

I don't understand why an attack on Hogwarts would lead to him ending up in the muggle world though. I would think the switch would be due to some ritual, potion or spell gone wrong rather than an attack on a school.

***** Thanks! I'm definitely getting enough comments about Dan's name to consider actually switching it back out, so this thread is incredibly useful - and I did just adjust the summary as per Iniga's and Hellstrike's suggestions.

The switch /is/ actually the result of a spell going wrong, as you mentioned, which happens during the attack on Hogwarts - maybe I shall reword that as well.

I do hope you'll consider checking it out, if the description interests you. The name does read the same way as "Daniel" and that's how I read it in my mind.

** Hi there!

As you know, I do follow your fic, and I can assure anyone out there who's considering it that the wordcraft is excellent, the plot is tight, and the characterizations are good.

That said, I wouldn't have chosen your fic to read if I hadn't been reciprocating your very kind, very inspiring reviews to MY fic. (To be clear, I now read because I enjoy it. But the first click was reciprocal.)

The reasons I wouldn't have chosen it have been covered here: I'm hesitant to read about a non-canon character and I don't like real person fic on principle. These are pretty common turnoffs. However, your fic really isn't heavy on non-canon characters and it isn't RPF at all. I wonder if changing your summary would help.

You currently use: When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

I think it's just as accurate to say something like: A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. With Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

Out of curiosity, may I ask what specifically about this type of story, doesn't appeal to you, besides the spelling? That is - does the concept make you think that it might be silly (maybe a comedy) or something like that? Or is the idea of Harry running around London not exciting? Or does it seem like it might be lacking in some aspect of HP that you usually look for in a fanfic, because of the addition of the switching component?

Well, I primarily read fanfic to get lost in the magical world of HP, alongside the characters I know and love.

Fics that put the HP characters in a non-magical environment don't appeal to me at all, and my assumption was that Harry wouldn't have access to magic for some reason in your story (or it would be trivial to get back to Hogwarts).

That said, I probably made a lot of assumptions about your story based on biases I've formed over the years of slogging through thousands and thousands of fanfiction summaries. Anything that reminds me of the "reading the books" trope, or inserts Dan/Emma/Rupert into Hogwarts, generally sends me running for the hills.

I'll give reading your fic a shot this evening.

***** Thanks so much for taking the time to write all that out! That is really, really good to know.

That is really cool, that you want to check it out anyway, despite these totally fair concerns. In that case, let me give you a slightly better, maybe description that may be helpful.

So TP is set half in Muggle London and half at Hogwarts. Initially, I spend a lot more time at Hogwarts exploring magical things there. Harry does have access to magic in Muggle London, and /does/ use it there as needed, though not a whole lot so as to not draw attention to it - basically like any wizard walking around with Muggles would. But I've tried to set up several situations where magic there is necessary. It is not simple to get back to Hogwarts, and the reason is tied into the plot, so I don't want to go into that.

But mainly, I do think that that element you mentioned, of getting lost in the magical world, and with characters you love - it /does/ have that. In essence, that's exactly what Dan is doing, while he is there. And in terms of plot, without spoilers, I actually approached it in a very canon sense as well. That is, there are classes at Hogwarts, Death Eater incursions, learning new magic things, and eventually a showdown with Voldemort, as per every HP book. And I've tried to really make use of canon characters and develop some of them quite a bit. There is one minor canon character, in particular, I do a lot with, but I really don't want to spoil that, in case you end up reading it. And again, thank you for writing all this, and for considering it, even though it's outside your preferred genre!

And I'm so glad the new summary is working out better, I really can't thank everyone here enough for helping out with it! This is such an awesome subreddit, I'm so glad I found it.

I totally agree, Harry not having magic would be entirely boring! If you end up checking it out, thank you!

**** Just finished chapter 8, and so far it is a very good read. The characters are well written so far. Harry feels very angsty and depressed so far, and its hard to relate to him. Hiding that he is not Daniyel from Daniyel's parents doesn't make sense, it would be a lot easier with the truth, and we kinda lack an explanation for his hiding he is Harry. The fight in hogsmeade was VERY underwhelming. Travers seems mad and doesn't seem to pay attention, but they still only send one spell each back and forth, i got a bit annoyed at Ron and Daniyel for not taking the fight seriusly. (Like not using one spell, wait to see if it hits, wait for the opponent casts back, the fire one spell back) Besides the dissapointing fight the actual story, plotlines, and overall feel of the story is great. Will definitely keep reading!

Edit: the aftermath is well done, and i can see why you went the way you did (untrained dan reacting like a muggle, ron on defense) so it makes up for the lacklustre battle. Now i just wait and hope Harry soon starts taking charge, and stops moping around xD

***** Thank you for checking it out! Yay!

I'm glad you're enjoying it. Good points. It's picking up after GoF, so I was trying to capture some of Harry's angsty Cedric feelings from OotP but without going the full route of depression like JKR did, since he didn't spend any time in Grimmauld Place, so that's the main reason I tried to make him a bit sad there. He does stop moping around eventually. Haha

Oh hmm! Do you think he should have told Daniyel's parents he's actually Harry? I'll admit I hadn't considered going that route, Harry seems to have a trusting people thing, and I didn't think he'd want to tell anyone, it's a bit of a crazy thing to happen. But that may indeed have been interesting... for Harry to have parental figures he trusts.

Ah but Travers IS mad! :D But battle comments noted, thank you! I haven't actually written any real battle scenes before that one so that is very much something I'm working on. I'll have to take a look at some of the upcoming ones again and see if I can add more there.

Thank you so much for reading it and for all the feedback. Much appreciated!

** Super AU... I'm not sure I can dig it and I read all sorts of stuff.. but I don't read like.. non-magic Highschool fics, and this sounds sortof in the same vein.. I think your gut feeling is right, its just too niche / odd for the everyday fanfic reader so you get low views.

Luckily you are writing for yourself....right? it's the only way to do it without going insane with insecurity...or writing cliches. Cliches are what casual readers are looking for.

*** Hi thanks! Yes, absolutely true, writing for myself. But I do like to share. :)

If I may tempt you though, it is actually entirely magic everywhere and not high school at all. Harry has magic in Muggle London, and there is, of course, magic at Hogwarts already.

** Your numbers don't look that bad to me. I think it's the luck of the draw, to be honest. I never managed to get much attention on my fics and they were all regularly updated and completed. Some of them even had popular main characters! I never did work out why some fics do well and others disappear without trace.

You'll find a particular set of opinions on here, but this sub isn't really reflective of the larger fandom.

*** Hey, true, that is a good point! I just browsed on over to your profile, and several of your fics sound very interesting! I'm going to have to stalk. :)

Thanks so much, I appreciate the comment!
