#+begin_quote
  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
#+end_quote

The description for this story does not lie. I have never read a trilogy like this one, and it has instantly become one of my all time favorite fanfic series. It is by far the best example I've ever seen of Sirius raising Harry, and contains many other very well executed elements. I found this story on a another author's favorite list. I had never heard of it, never seen it recommended. I intend to fix that. Everybody on this sub owes it to themselves to give it a try.


** I've read it after someone else mentioned it in this sub earlier. It was quite good.

*** While I didn't have any problems with the second book, I do think that the third book is better, and probably the best of the three. Even things that were awkward in the second book, such as the Draco/Harry stuff, are given good payoffs in the conclusion of the series.

** Does Harry enter Hogwarts at some point in this series? I've read a couple of these sorts of stories before, and I distinctly remember getting very frustrated, when 300k words in, Harry /still/ hadn't gotten to Hogwarts.

*** Yes, Harry starts attending Hogwarts at the start of the second book. During the first book, much of action is still set at Hogwarts, depicting how events from the books have played out with Harry's absence.

** ... I really have bad experiences with Sirius raises Harry stories.

A part of me wants to cringe so hard at the premise since all of the Sirius raised Harry stories I ever read indulge in hardcore character-bashing (Dumbledore is evil/senile/callous/etc, Snape is a moron/pedophile/evil-to-the-core/etc... everything to retroactively justify the Marauders, Ron is a narrow minded borderline racist redneck, etc)... and end up with Harry/Hermione being together (or the disturbing Sirius/Harry pairing), Draco being rather nice (because most people who like Sirius like Draco too, as rich, handsome, pureblood people who are cool to their friends and violent jerks to everyone else are their type).

I could really forgive all that (well, less so character bashing), if I had found one which had some mature writing. Tell me that this story doesn't fit my profile too well, and I'd be glad to read it.

*** This definitely does not engage in Dumbledore, Snape, or Ron bashing. Those characters all have moments in the trilogy in which they are criticized, but they also have moments in which they are presented as admirable and heroic. It does end with Hermione/Harry, as well as with Draco joining the good side, but neither of those conclusions come quickly or are badly written.

While it does contain some of the tropes that you are worried about, I can assure you above all that it is never an example of immature writing. That's what engaged so much in the first place, because I'm sure I've read some of the same awful Sirius raises Harry stories that you have. This isn't those stories.

**** I'll give it a shot then... hoping for the best, but really not keeping my hopes too high due to this premise being host to some of the absolute worst moments in fan fiction history (good guy Sirius "humorously" and "accidentally" rapes a twelve year old Hermione caused me to insta-close the last one of those I started reading).

** I can't believe how angry this made me. The redemption of Draco Malfoy never makes for a good story and this is no exception. And what about that off-screen Hermione/Krum incident in book one? I was waiting for an explanation and a resolution, but as far as I can tell it didn't come. The out-of-character behaviour of others was at least obvious, because they were featured in the story. Krum was only mentioned.

I can't suffer through the epilogue, so maybe there's an answer there, but it didn't come during the main story and it really should have. As it stands: awful, don't read.

*** It sounds like you object far more to the trope of redeemed Draco rather than anything about the story itself. I thought that arc was very well executed in this trilogy, but I guess its not everybody's cup of tea. I can see how some would want more detail about the Hermione/Krum incident, but personally I appreciated that the author didn't dwell on it.

Honestly, what else was there to the story for the last 15 chapters or so?

Not dwell on it? It was swept under the carpet. For what happened it needn't have been a named character. From the way it was written (Snape carrying an unconscious Hermione up from the dungeons) it was clear that there was supposed to be more to it. A mystery to solve, a criminal to catch, retribution to deliver. What do we get instead? Nothing and the alleged rapist is running free.

Don't you think it would have been more believable, if one of the characters returning to school had something to do with it? They are well versed in the use of unforgivables and polyjuice, after all. For fuck's sake, as whiny as this Harry was, wouldn't he have forgiven Draco for this as well?
