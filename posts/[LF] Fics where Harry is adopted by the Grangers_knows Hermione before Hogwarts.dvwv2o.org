Exactly what it says on the tin. Any fics where Harry is adopted by the Grangers or fics where he knows Hermione before they start Hogwarts? Gen is preferred, or at least for Harry & Hermione to have more passion sibling relationship, but I'll accept Harmony recommendations with this premise as well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][*/The Perils of Innocence/*]] This one is nowhere near complete, but is fantastic. Harry is raised from the age of 6 in a home for children with psychological problems. Hermione's parents send her there because they are afraid of the "events" that happen around her. Pre-Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308470/1/][*/Frootlooped Dumbledore/*]] Dumbledore goes out of his way to give Harry the best childhood possible. I would probably say that it is in my top 10. It's just so heartwarming, funny and filled with fluff. Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/][*/Quoth the Raven Nevermore/*]] Harry is a raven animagus, finds a home at the tower of London. Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948152/1/Elfish-Welfare][*/Elfish Welfare/*]] The Potter's house elves raise Harry. Harry and Hermione meet in primary school. Harry does know of magic. Pre-Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8993792/1/][*/One World/*]] The Grangers get to the house before Hagrid does, gains custody of Harry. In this one they are actually just siblings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][*/Blindness/*]] Harry is blinded by the killing curse as a baby and doesn't go to hogwarts, Hermione has the speech center of her brain horribly damaged in the troll attack and is pulled from hogwarts by her parents, they meet in a mundane school for the disabled. Harry and Hermione do lots of magical experimentation and self study. Harmony.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][*/Innocent/*]] has Harry and Hermione meet in mundane primary school. Harry already knows of magic thought. Best friends. (as far as I know)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026760/1/][*/Dahlia Evans & the Broken Bridge/*]] Pre-Harmony where Fem!Harry gets adopted by the Grangers.

Harry is adopted by the grangers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][*/The Accidental Animagus/*]]. it is complete but its sequel isn't. In this one they are actually just siblings.

I'm only including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][*/A Different Halloween/*]] for completeness. It is a Robst fic with all that entails. Has Lily Potter meeting Emma Granger as the reason Lily lives through halloween 1981.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13367218/1/][*/A Solid Foundation/*]] Super-Pre-Harmony (they are 5). The Grangers come across a beaten and battered boy being protected by a starving black dog. Went a bit off the rails in later chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13137899/1/][*/There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving/*]] Harmony.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  "I cared about you too much," said Dumbledore simply. (OotP, ch37) What if Dumbledore chose a more reasonable way to express his care and went unreasonably out of his way to ensure that Harry enjoyed his childhood? Oneshot from 1982 to wrap up after fourth year.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
