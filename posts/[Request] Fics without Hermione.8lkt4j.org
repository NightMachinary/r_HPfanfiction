*** That's an odd way to spell Umbridge. But in all seriousness people shouldn't be downvoting just because of the preferences of the OP.

**** Umbridge doesn't annoy, she make you hate her. She make you sick. Hermione just annoys me. But thanks for the support :)

*** I don't know either, because OP /isn't/ being downvoted more than upvoted, standing at +10 as of this writing. Stop playing victim.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Totally agree. She is just a lazy solution for Rowling to fix everything that's wrong. What's even worse is that she is even more of a Mary Sue in fanon.

** Not sure if this is what you are looking for... linkffn(12240216) doesn't have Hermione befriending Harry. In fact, Hermione is in a different house. Still, Ron's interested in her.... But if slice of life, non-Voldy fics are your thing, this is a must-read

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.
