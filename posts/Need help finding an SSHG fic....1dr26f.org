So someone please tell me if I'm mixing this plot up with another fandom (I remember reading it when I was involved in several fandoms at once). Snape and Hermione were together and happy, Hermione becomes pregnant. Snape freaks and sends her away because he thinks that he cannot have children. Hermione has the baby anyway and I'm sure there was a happy ending somewhere.

Please help!


** There are a lot of SSHG fics that have that plot line. Do you remember any more details?

** I think I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember the title.

Does she end up bringing the child up in the Muggle world, and does Andromeda end up opening up a childcare center for Muggle-born magical children?

*** That sounds like something I've read before, but I don't know if it's the same story. I've read a lot and didn't really keep track of them =/

**** Well good luck D: That's why at one point I bookmarked everything I read that I knew I would want to come back to. Unfortunately, then my hard drive got corrupted, all of that data was wiped, and I switched to Google Chrome without being able to transfer the stuff I had before.
