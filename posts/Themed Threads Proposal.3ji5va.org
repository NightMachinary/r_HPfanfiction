** Hey [[/u/kemistreekat][u/kemistreekat]] I just wanted to thank you. I know your introduction to this sub has been, well badly received, for various reasons but I feel that it's obvious you are trying your best to become a part of our subreddit. So thanks again.

--------------

As for the themed threads, while they are a good idea at first, if you haven't already noticed we are a very small sub with specific tastes. Those tastes happen to have only two ways with no middle ground, for example "shipping". Either you're a Harmony fan or not. The vocal minority here are always fighting with each other over things like that so I think your proposals that are broader subjects such as "AU day" are fantastic ideas which will work with our small community.

Whereas a "shipping" day will just end up in an endless circlejerk about how one ship is superior and everyone else is wrong with comments being down voted simply because their opinion isn't the same as the majority.

Just because something hasn't been a common topic of discussion/requests does not mean no one will be interested if it's brought up.

Yeah look at my comment history. The last dozen are me posting threads discussing these exact topics. Not only are they coming up regularly but suggested here are sad, moody and sappy threads. They're the same thing. Why bother with 3?

Also why on earth would you bother with recommendation threads being automated in the first place? People ask for fic recommendations because they're interested in reading them, the automated ones are pointless.

**** I supported this idea in the survey because [[/r/femalefashionadvice]] bases their weekly postings on a similar idea, and it works really well. Naturally, things wouldn't transfer exactly the same to our hpff thread, but my experience in FFA is that the scheduled posts take up a lot of the repeats (oh my god, another slytherin!Harry thread?) and the clutter than otherwise clog up the front page.

I really support the idea of hpff adopting a themed discussion thread of some sort. I love this sub, and think some sort of scheduled posting will give the sub life besides a reservoir for collecting recommendations. I think the book club is a great example of life beyond the request/rec cycle, and I'd love to see more of it! I hope that the good discussions threads continue, and that they give people another avenue to interact with fanfiction.

Just wanted to have a voice from the 80% minority sound out too. (:

** Hey so I was probably one of the most vocal people who opposed you becoming a mod and I really appreciate you doing this, I think it's awesome that you're trying to get more involved and that you've at least realised that HPMOR sucks, so please don't think this is personal, again like i've repeatedly said you seem awesome.

That all being said I don't think this is a big enough sub to implement this. Like we have 6,000 subscribers and of them I reckon I could list by name the 40ish people currently online because so few people take part. I just don't see this taking off (but by all means nothing wrong with trying) due to the small number of people. Mainly because nearly every single one has had its own thread in the last month.

I do think it could be interesting for some topics though but most here are just the names of rec threads that come up when someone wants to read a fic. You'd need to get topics that aren't related to general areas cause most of the interesting discussion happens here when someone sees something in a fic they're reading and wants to talk about it and things like that would be really cool to have because they aren't likely to come up anyway. Like a more intense book club thread.

*** I think this could work, as long as it isn't too frequent. If there were more than one, /maybe/ two threads a week, I completely agree with you - there aren't enough active subscribers for that. However, if this is a semi-regular occurrence with one theme per week, it would be a nice way to group fic recs by theme, which I don't think happens enough with broad ideas. Also, by making it a sticky, more people will contribute to that thread.

If it works well, then instead of every "Sad short story" thread being Twine Bracelet, Cauterize and Eternal Return we can have one master thread with those three and a few less well-known ones as well, as people will hopefully recommend fics that haven't been mentioned yet.

****** I know. I've just seen them before recently and I guess I don't get the appeal of having a mod post them every week.

This sub has a dedicated userbase so when a discussion thread is popular it'll get a few hundred comments and be off the front page in 2 days max, making ways for new content. I just don't see the benefit of adding a stickied thread that'll be there much longer than active discussion. Then any more frequent turnover removes any purpose in posting your own thread.

I seem to be in the minority though so I'll have to wait and see. :)
