** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons with Hagrid]] is a decent one-shot with a good ending.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord.

*** I like this fanfic. Wish it was novel length though. Still enjoyed it :).

** It's short, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4026294/1/Friendship_and_Memories][Friendship and Memories]] is a nice little scene between McGonagall and Hagrid.

** Er, I don't know about /good/, but there's a fanfic out there where Hagrid fucks Dumbledore with his pink umbrella. If that sort of thing tickles your fancy, I think it's called Hagrid's Pink Umbrella or something like that. Putting keywords into Google will find it.
