Okay so I'm debating on writing a fic, but I'm not sure on pairings. So it will be an Addams crossover and I can't for the life of me figure out pairings. I already know who I'm going to pair Harry with, but I have no idea for Ron, Sirus, and a few others. Who would you pair up between the two universes.

*** Well yes I could not do a pairing. I was just curious who people who pair him with. I kind of want to do a pairing. I just can't figure one that would work. Otherwise I'll just leave it be.

** Why not a Ron and Wednesday. Like okay hear me out. I've seen where a Luna/Ron where Luna kind of straightens him out and Ron kind of becomes care free, but with the program. Sword of Griffindoor as an example. I could see Wednesday doing the same. Twisting him to her liking.

As for Sirus it just depends on your taste. I think he is always hard to pair.

*** Ron/Luna is great. I've only read one fic with that, though.

** Oh my goodness! I would /love/ if Morticia was a distant cousin of Sirius's!

Debbie Jellinsky and Sirius could also be a decent match. She could be after his money- which could either bloom into an actual romance or follow similarly down to her eventual canon demise.
