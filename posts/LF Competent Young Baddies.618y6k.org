** Well, there's a little problem with that. If you have "competent young baddies" who are a match for Harry/Hermione/Ron, then who is a match for Voldemort? If the trio is supposed to beat Voldemort, you just elevated others to the same power level to match them. That kind of trivialises the threat of Voldemort. On the other hand, if Voldemort is still the real threat, and Harry and Co. are matched by Draco's gang, then that means the trio deals with teenage bullshit while Voldemort is defeated by the adults - which kind of trivialises Harry's achievements. "I defeated Draco Malfoy!" kind of pales next to "I defeated the worst Dark Lord in Britain's history."

You might be best served with some AUs where Voldemort is not the main threat.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has more competent teenage antagonists, but ultimately, they don't really measure up to Harry and co.

*** Assuming the ages of the characters stay as canon with no sudden ability jumps, Harry was never going to defeat Voldemort in a fair fight. The experience gap between them is just too huge. In canon Harry was just a train huffing along the tracks set by Dumbledore and Snape, he didn't defeat Voldemort due to some great power of his.

Also, competent doesn't necessarily mean powerful or strong, it just means 'can get the job done efficiently and effectively'. So making Draco competent and then setting Harry against him doesn't mean Voldmort ascends to godhood.

**** In canon, Harry won through luck. That didn't have to be the case - they could have won through cleverness and determination, using their special advantage well.

And it doesn't change the fact that if Draco's a minor nuissance, then defeating him is a minor achievement, at best. You really don't worry or care much about handling the school bully in a war.

***** Yes and no. Harry & Co didn't need too much luck, wandlore, sacrificial magic, etc. to defeat bite sized pieces of Voldemort --- the horcruxes --- and they pulled off some pretty amazing things in the course of that; but against Voldemort himself? That was luck.

***** Also, no. Voldemort robbed Gringotts too. He broke into the vault where the stone was kept successfully. If the vault wasn't empty, it would have been a successful heist. So Harry wasn't the first person to break into Gringotts and escape alive.

**** Well, for a certain defintion of "work". You just trivialise Harry's friends that way. (In fact, a number of stories have exactly that happen - evil Draco kidnaps/attempts to rape Damsel!Hermione, who is then saved by Super!Harry before Super!Harry defeats Voldemort while receiving moral support from his friends.)

****** Why would Hermione act like this, if she and Harry (and Ron) together could simply curbstomp Draco in a second or two, and go on together? If Hermione can handle it by herself, the three together can deal with it in a heartbeat. If the three can't curbstomp it, odds are Hermione can't handle it by herself.

******* E.g.

*Draco:* Aha! Scarhead, Mudblood, and Weasel! At last, we've got you outnumbered four to one! Surrender, or prepare to...

*Hermione:* You go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

*Ron:* You sure?

*Hermione:* Yes, I'm sure. For a crowd this size, Fiendfyre is probably the fastest in any case, and it's tedious enough keeping it off myself without having to worry about allies.

*Draco:* ... Um... How about we just lay down our wands, you stun and bind us, and we'll pretend you ambushed us?

Of course, that defeats the original purpose of a capable antagonist their age.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
