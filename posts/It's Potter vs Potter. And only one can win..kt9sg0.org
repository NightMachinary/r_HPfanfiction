Harry Potter was very happy with his life. The war had taken a lot from him, but he could finally say that as the Head of the Auror Office he had all that he wanted. He enjoyed his work and was amazingly good at it. He had reliable friends who had fought side by side him and visited often. He had a lovely wife and the best family in the world. He was not counting on that bloody raid to mess up everything.

When Harry went into that house, he had expected to find dark artefacts, but not that one could hit him by accident, sending him to an entirely different world. A world that was, for most of it, exactly as his, but that he still couldn't recognize. He soon finds out that there's another Harry Potter running the Auror Office, a man who is in all noticeable regards, his exact copy. There was a war in this new world as well, one where his other self defeated Tom Riddle as well. However, the anagram of Tom's name appeared to be "I am Lord Voldemort" in this world instead of "Old Trevor Mad Limo", which Harry was used to.

Some other things were different as well. Painfully different.

Ron still seemed to be his friend, but was somehow married to Hermione Granger now. Last time he checked, his old mate was married to Daphne Greengrass, who had been the Slytherin Chaser and the ever-smiling girl who was the source of the best jokes in Hogwarts. His old mentor Ludo Bagman wasn't the Minister of Magic. Sirius was dead, instead of playing in a band as he was supposed to. Harry couldn't find anything about his Uncle Vernon, whose loving counsel, protein supplements and equipped gym, gave Harry the perfect preparation for his task. Snape, the crazy oddball who could make the best Ice Cream in Diagon Alley in his old black cauldrons, was a war hero in this world... and had somehow killed Dumbledore, instead of just getting drunk with the old hippie every other Friday. Harry knew Dumbledore knew his magic rituals and all that rubbish, but he always thought of him as a free soul instead of a headmaster tied to the norms of a steady job. He did wonder how different he would be as a headmaster compared to old Professor Crouch, who was an arse, but only gave him straight and helpful answers during the war.

The thing that hurt Harry the most though, was to find out the fate of his wife.

Harry wondered what he should do, since what he was supposed to do and what he wanted to do were two different things. His law-abiding self told him to respect this world and his laws and try to find help to return to his own world. On the other hand, Harry wanted to help his wife, even if she was a different version to the one he had fallen in love with.

"She has the potential to be the same person. How can I leave her like that?" Harry asked himself.

So it started. The epic confrontation with his other-self and an action-packed chase. One where Harry tried against all obstacles to free his wife from a dreadful fate as his other self tried to stop him. There was no other option though, for only in that way he could save his tender and squeaky Dolores.

​

Bonus: A scene where AU Harry carries Dolores on his broom as they race away from regular Harry throwing hexes at them.
