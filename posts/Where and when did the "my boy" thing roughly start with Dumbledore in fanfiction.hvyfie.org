Like, was there a particular fic or two that set it off, perhaps?


** It's probably just him saying "dear boy" a few times in the books. 3-4 times to Harry and once to Draco. That Dumbledore is, I think, the adult Harry interacts with the most in fanfiction has caused the phrase to be used way too much.

** Instances of My boy in Harry Potter:

2 in Prisoner of Azkaban

‘That's my boy!' Wood kept yelling. - Oliver Wood Talking about Harry Chapter 13 Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw

‘My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Trelawney talking to Harry in Chapter 16 Professor Trelawney's Prediction

1 in Goblet of Fire “Tha's my boy...you show 'em, Harry, you show 'em. Beat 'em all.” Hagrid talking to Harry in Chapter 24 - RITA SKEETER'S SCOOP

1 in The Half-Blood Prince

Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nosetweaking. ... I really don't know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless ---” Slughorn talking to Harry in Chapter 22 - After the Burial

***** It's a distraction you know? To make Harry trust him. In that way, Harry doesn't pay attention on his vault and Dumbledore can take his money.

****** Of course it must be this! After all we all know that the Potters has infinity money and could at any moment contract every single mercenary in the world to kill Voldemort if they wanted to! The only reason James didn't do so was because he thought pulling himself and his family in danger was a small price to pay to have more chances of pranking the poor death eater and merciless murder Severus. And now the terrible Albus evil-for-no-damn-reason Dumbledore is taking advantage of this to use the money to buy all lemon-drops factories in existence to be consumed only by him (the reason everyone refuses the candy in his office is actually a curse he cast that makes them all feel repulsed by lemon, he only offers at all as a way of bragging)

** I could be wrong, but I think it's their talk at the in-between. At least I think it was the only moment in which he outright called Harry “my boy”, I seem to recall him always being at least somewhat formal when he addressed him in the other talks they had, calling him at first Mr. Potter and then sometimes Harry when they became closer.
