Hi, sorry if this has been asked loads of times, perhaps a thread for each ship might be handy? Alas, I'm looking for some good Dramione. Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

This tumbler is amazing (I never thought I would say those words), especially especially if you look at the separate tag lists.

** I've recently read and enjoyed linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina). It has, like the summary says, darkish Dramione and despite the fact that I normally dislike this pair I thought it rather nice... I just didn't like the ending, but that's a matter of taste I suppose. :)

** It's been a few years since I read these, but I had them in a list of recs/a favorites folder I used to use, so I must have liked them. I don't read much Dramione anymore.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] was definitely my favorite at that time. I should get around to rereading it at some point...

One-shots:

- linkffn(eyes open by days met the night) made me cry, lol

- linkffn(love me twice by bex-chan)

- linkffn(graveyard valentine by bex-chan)

- linkffn(to light a candle by namelessamelie)

Chaptered:

- linkffn(different names for the same place by namelessamelie)

- linkffn(reconstruction by nj coffee queen)

- linkffn(the flatmate by attica)

- linkffn(the bracelet by akashathekitty) idk lol

  Widowed Hermione takes a post at a newly opened wizarding school, expecting eighteen-year-old Scorpius Malfoy will be her most troublesome student.

A dark, erotic tale of romantic drama.

  When Hermione is forced to seek shelter in the last place anyone would look, she finds herself drawn to Draco & becomes the unwitting muse behind a habit Lucius won't admit to having. Complicating the matter, she's forced to question her friendship with Harry. Just when hiding from a serial killer targeting muggle-borns was her biggest concern. MATURE CONTENT.

  After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater responsible for her capture in the first place. COMPLETE.
