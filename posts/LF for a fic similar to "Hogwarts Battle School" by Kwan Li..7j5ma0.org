linkffn(8379655) For those who have not read it, its loosely based on "Ender's Game" Battle school, where instead of teams (like Dragon, Cobra, Tiger, etc) its the 4 houses, however the students are ranked by magical, tactical and leadership prowess. Complete AU BTW, if it wasn't obvious.


** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

It's got teams because the houses are reworked into a caste system.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** I wasn't much of a fan, but Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a popular one, and has a somewhat Ender's Game-esque tournament going on during it, with different teams competing in group duels. While it does have quite a lot of time dedicated to it, it's not the focus of the fic.
