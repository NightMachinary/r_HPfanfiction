All I remember is Harry having to do paperwork, while Death just laughed at him.


** Its probably not the one you were after but this Harry Potter, Avengers crossover has MoD Harry complaining about paperwork if you are after something potentially similar. linkffn(10983547)

  (Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork. [One-Shot]

** I don't know why, but a lot of MOD fics include Harry complaining about paperwork. It was kinda funny the first time, but it's edging itself towards "not funny anymore."

**** Sorry if that came across sharper than intended. I love a good MOD fic as much as anyone, and second the above rec for Deux Ex Machina. I was mostly just wondering what spawned the paperwork trend.
