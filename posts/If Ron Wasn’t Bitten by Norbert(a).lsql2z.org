In year one, Ron gets bitten by Norbert(a) before they can smuggle the dragon to the Astronomy Tower. This ends up with Ron in the hospital wing and Draco knowing what they (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are planning.

What would change if this didn't happen?


** Well since Malfoy. Wouldnt have know when they were moving him he wouldnt have been out that night and gotten caught harry and Co wouldnt have been riding the high of getting the dragon safely away and Malfoy getting detention so they likely wouldnt have forgotten the cloak neville wouldnt have been out trying tonwarn them so he wouldnt have gotten caught. So all in all it might have all gone off without a hitch

*** Yeah, that makes sense. Unless Ron ends up going in place of Hermione or Harry and does something stupid.

** 4 Gryffindors would be punished instead of 3.

*** Gonna have to disagree with you there. Even before Ron is hospitalized it's mentioned that the invisibility cloak is big enough for two of them plus dragon.

**** They forgot the invisibility cloak on the tower, which is how Harry and Hermione were caught by Filch, but even still McGonagall was looking out for them, which is how Neville was caught.

***** Thats not what I meant. I'm saying that it would still be 3 Gryffindors would still be punished, not four, because either Harry, Hermione, or Ron would have to stay behind anyway because they couldn't fit under the cloak.
