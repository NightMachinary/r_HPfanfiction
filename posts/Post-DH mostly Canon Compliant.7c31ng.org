What would you guys most like to see out of a "Book 8" fic that picks up after the battle and stays mostly Canon Compliant. At least canon ships anyway. Looking for what people want to read before I delve full force into writing this fic.


** I've always felt that the story to be told post-DH is about the characters rather than a plot about good vs evil. Too many authors think that a good story needs a Harry versus some new bad guy to be good and interesting. Or that we need some crazy romantic, angsty fic to hold the reader's attention. But obviously that isn't the case.

A good post-battle fic needs to expand the POV to other characters, whose stories suddenly become just as interesting as Harry's. Below are the general plot points for a realistic post-DH book.

- Harry trying to find his place in the world after fulfilling his life goal
- Harry not taking a breather, feeling like he owes it to keep going until every Death Eater is gone, and how that affects his relationships with others
- The politics of reforming the Ministry
- The actual hunt for the remaining Death Eaters (I am not sure, but I think Ron and Neville both quit the Aurors when the last of the Death Eaters were captured, which took at least two years)
- Hermione going back to school without Harry and Ron
- Harry coming to terms with how he tries to protect Ginny and how that's not going to work going forward
- How both main relationships (H/G and R/Hr) deal with the year apart (typical LDR stuff, boys hitting on Ginny and Hermione, girls hitting on Harry and Ron, Ron getting jealous or maybe taking too much pleasure in his newfound fame)
- Ginny trying to deal with the previous year
- Hermione dealing with the previous year, especially at Malfoy Manor
- Ron growing up (or not growing up_
- Harry figuring out how to actually be in a relationship and Ginny proving to be the only one who can actually make it work
- Ginny's quest to make the Harpies
- Harry and Ron training as Aurors
- Harry's relationship with Kingsley, and whether he is more willing to align himself with the Ministry
- Dealing with the Dursleys
- George dealing with Fred's death; the whole Weasley clan dealing with it

The above plot points very likely would happen and are interesting stories to read about. And there are several stories that actually do deal with these plot points. Personally, I think First Days and More Than Words by Little0bird do a good job of painting a mostly-realistic account of how things would've been post-battle. I think the author did an especially good job of capturing Ginny's character and the things she might be dealing with going forward.

*** You make a lot of very valid points and I agree that Little0bird did a wonderful job. These are the things I would want to work on I believe maybe with an emphasis on the catching of the death eaters and their work as Aurors. This is what I've always been most curious about and wanted to read the most and it doesn't see that alot of fic focus on it.

I believe that Harry wouldn't stop to take a breather until someone forced him to. The relationships are what I am the most worried about writing because I've never written anything much like that.

I believe that George should have a large story arc with him and Harry bonding further in this time.

Thank you very much for your thoughtful insight.

**** No problem, always in the mood to read a post-DH fic.

If I were you, I'd sit down and first write out every fact we know about everyone post-battle. We know Kingsley is Minister, when the Potter and Weasley-Granger kids are born, jobs, etc. Make sure whatever story you right stays true to this.

Next I'd really think about what defines each character and write that down. Based on what we know, how would you expect the character to behave after the war?

And then focus on the stories you want to tell and see how these characters would behave in that context.

For example, you seem to want to explore the hunt for death eaters. So what does that mean?

- The hunt would likely pick up right away
- Harry would want to be involved, if only to have something to do
- Kingsley would lead the efforts, but remember he's also Minister. Who does he put in charge? Does he ask Harry to lead the mission? Harry might be up for it but wouldn't Molly, Hermione and others try to get Harry to let someone else fight for a change?
- Which Death Eaters remain? Are there any that would make for a compelling story? What if the Carrows escaped? Harry might seek revenge for what they pulled at school.
- What if Ron wants to go too? What sorta tension does that create with his family and Hermione? What if George wants to join up?
- We know Lucius gives info to avoid jail. How does this dynamic work? What if Lucius and Harry form some sort of weird partnership/?
- If Harry immediately wants to go off again, what does that mean for him and Ginny? She just got him back and figured they could start up again. Now, once again, she is expected to wait? When is it her turn? What if she wants to join him and seek revenge on the Carrows herself?

Right there is a good story. The main plot is the hunt for Death Eaters but the decision by Harry and others to pursue it can affect the relationships they are also trying to re-establish.

***** In all honesty I want to write either my first chapter or a one shot prologue that starts right at the end of DH and involves them rushing to the ministry after Kingsley receives an urgent patronus saying the remaining death eaters are sieging the ministry in a last ditch effort to retain power (or perhaps that is only a ruse and they are actually trying to escape with some valuable item or information).

This would be a highly action packed story and I've toyed with the idea of having Harry accidentally kill an opponent in combat for the first time and have to deal with the fall out of that on his already fragile emotional state.

Then possibly skip to September 1st with the girls getting on the train to Hogwarts and the boys throwing themselves entirely into the hunt again.

** You really need to write the story /you/ want to tell. The story /you/ want to read. If you try and write for other people I think you'll find it difficult to believe in your own story. In any case you can never please everybody and if you try you'll end up with a mess you don't even like yourself and probably won't finish.

*** I completely understand that. I was mostly curious because it seems that a Canon Compliant Post-DH fic is about the least talked about thing on this sub and there seems to be an underwhelming amount of them of fic sites compared to the more "off-the-wall" stuff. I was curious why and if there is something they are doing wrong that I could strive to do right.

**** I doubt if there is a general thing they are doing wrong. It's just not what most people are looking for. Some of them seem to do all right though.

**** I don't think it is something the writers are doing wrong, I think it's the canon itself that is flawed. The main relationships (H/G + Hr/R) aren't functional. The members are just fundamentally different in a way that their desires/needs are mutually exclusive. Ron due to his poor work ethic will always be overshadowed by Hermione who in return will be bored out of her mind and frustrated as hell since Ron can't challenge her intellectually. Harry wants a quiet family life away from the spotlight which he wouldn't be able to have while Ginny pursues a quidditch career. To me both those lead to resentment not happily ever after... BUT booksandpots is right write whatever you want to read and don't care what anyone else says

***** I agree wholeheartedly, I honestly think that JK Rowling decided in book 1 who would end up with who and stuck with that at the end despite developing their personalities into unsuitable matches. Also around book 5 is when Ginny starts to do shit because JK Rowling realised she was running out of books and needed this strong witch can do quidditch and stuff to go with Harry. Ginny is the female version of Colin Creevey lmao.

I don't think Hermione would be a good match for Harry either, he probably wants to relax a bit after the war.
