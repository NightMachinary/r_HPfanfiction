This question literally just popped into my head and now it won't go away, so I'm asking the wisdom of the sub. Do you think Wizards have the concept of take-out restaurants? Can they floo for Pizza delivery, or pick-up Chinese food on the apparition-route home? Would that range local (ie. British Wizards have British Take-out Restaurants) or international ("Let's pop over to Delhi for some curry!") in scope?

EDIT - Based on some responses below - what kind of food do you think wizarding street vendors would sell?


** This is probably because I like ‘historifying' the wizarding world more than is implied but I have a headcanon that Wizards have a roaring ‘street food' trade rather than the equivalent home delivery type takeaway that we know. Kind of like the Thermopolia' (literally; ‘The place where something hot is sold') which my Classics teacher taught me was ‘Roman KFC'. Mostly, those were used by workers living in Roman Tenements and didn't really have the ability or time to cook themselves.

I imagine it a bit like my village farmer's market, that sells street food and raw ingredients simultaneously.

***** Both, like in the books that have both treacle tart and cockroach clusters.

It has to be portable. Traditional British doesn't really do things-on-sticks. Given the Victorian aesthetic, they might well hand out bowls you use and hand back, and there's no saying those get washed.

One old dish from those times was a pot of peas and a suck of ham, with ham on a string that you sucked on and so did everyone else. Another is the 'penny lick', a shallow glass dish of ice cream you licked and handed back. Whelks, cockles and prawns were sold nationwide, drenched in vinegar, from whenever right up until the present day, although they're harder to find.

Another British quick-food staple is the pie. Pastry bottom, pastry lid and there's no real limit on what can be inside at all, but usually it's cheap, stewed meat, sauce or gravy and vegetables. I'd be surprised to not see any pies at all.

[[https://samanthachristinekelly.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/part-1-street-food-revolution-the-history-of-street-food/][This site]] is a decent look both at the Victorian London scene and the predecessors (Given Ollivander dates from 347BC or whenever) and the modern American scene so you can tell what is an anachronism/Americanism.

Nothing stops them serving worm pasties, frog-and-eel pies (eel farms are canonical), jellied eels (a London thing) or mushy peas (grey field peas slow-cooked to a mush and dyed green, witches might not bother) with or without ham, or even mint sauce (garden mint and vinegar).

One thing I don't remember ever being mentioned in the books is chips (fries). Given how much chips are a part of the British food scene, it's just-about-noticeable that the only potatoes shown are mashed (I think mashed potatoes are shown only suddenly I can't remember how and where).

****** That site is a very interesting resource, thank you. I like the idea of 'weird magical spins' on traditional muggle fare, though I dread to think what their version of the ham thing would be. :D

And indeed, the lack of chips is a travesty. I remember them being available constantly in both primary and secondary school (as a side at first, then a full meal), but maybe they're not as common in the public boarding school scene? Hogwarts is modelled on that sort of 'trope universe', after all.

*** Various street food vendors were well-known in the Middle Ages as well; not everyone had access to an oven or a cooking area.

I may add wandering food sellers to my head-canon of Hogsmeade at the very least, but Diagon would work too. Not to mention those who delivered food to the houses and inns.

***** Hmm. I see the British magical society as being behind the times and isolationist and somewhat jingoist? I think that's the word: basically we're the best; everyone should be on our standards; that kind of thing. I imagine the food would reflect that. Pre-imperial, no curries or anything like that.

So street food would be equally un-exotic for the most part. I've just started looking into it for some original writing of my own, so I'm not very detailed yet. But it would include sausages or other meat-on-a-stick, filled hand pies (pasties, bridies), pretzels (I saw an illumination of a medieval baker with a portable oven and pretzels hanging from a post), ices--although maybe not with Fortescue's, other small snack foods. Drink sellers, although they'd probably have a little booth as opposed to wandering the streets. And if there are booths, that also allows for some fried foods and soup sellers. In my original piece, there are also small produce and dairy vendors, but I don't know if they'd fit here.

And these vendors would have the advantages of warming and stasis charms so it stays fresher longer.

****** That's some very interesting answers, thank you. The mental image kind of reminds me of Ankh-Morpork from the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. A very strong Dibbler/Dwarf vibe from that list of foods. :)

(And yep, it's always a little surprising to know how old Pretzels actually are. I'm quite fond of the Italian Priest etiological myth for them - I use variants of it all the time in D&D).

Also, out of curiosity - no pressure to answer if you don't wanna - do you think that Magical Society would reject the post-Imperial food if it was available? Would someone be able to open a curry stand, and would people buy from it if they did?

******* A good question. I'm no economist but let me throw a few ideas out there. Just take them with a grain of salt.

I know there were/are traditions and dishes and dances in the real world that started at the peasant level and worked their way up the social ladder. Specifics escape me at the moment, but a lot of the traditional foods you see mentioned these days were not necessarily the foods of the wealthy. Tamales, for example (I just watched a video about them this month). They went from everyday food of the Aztecs to food for the poor under the Conquistadors to a guilty pleasure of the wealthy by the 18th century and finally what they are now.

So with that thought, I think most post-Imperial dishes as well as other "foreign" foods would start at the bottom of the social ladder and slowly work their way up, being suitably modified along the way. Muggleborn bringing it in with the help of half-bloods, pricing it cheap enough that it's a viable choice when you're a little low on cash. Adventurous and open-minded people trying it would help (my grandfather was like that: he'd try just about anything once. Apparently he once brought tamales [speaking of] home on a whim but didn't ask how they should be prepared. All I know is it didn't go well but I suspect Grandma boiled them and they tried to eat the wrappers). Another boost would be people of note serving/eating it. Hermione becomes Minister in canon, right? She serves a mild curry or similar at a formal dinner and people latch on because "Minister"! Eventually, one way or another, it would become more prevalent, but I think it would be a relatively slow process depending on how reactionary and isolationist Magical Britain stays. And it might never become a dish the average person makes at home (mostly thinking about people like the Weasleys).

I think a curry stand would have a rocky start. But some good advertising among the Muggleborn in particular would help.

My favorite depiction of the mindset I was describing is in Bobmin356's "Power of the Press," in which Ginny (I think) bemoans how hard it was to get a good roast and butterbeer in /Egypt/, and both Molly and Augusta Longbottom scorn the fact Hermione has a boyfriend from the Pacific Rim, instead of a nice English boy.

**** I think it'd be a mixture. By and large, Wizards and muggles eat roughly the same things. That being said I'm sure there would be other delicacies, my brain keeps wanting me to say ‘Dragon Kebabs' despite dragon meat ‘looking poisonous' in canon. It'd be stuff like pies and things. Now that I'm being put on the spot I can't think of more specific examples. However, it is one area where I believe a ‘cultural bleed' from the muggle world exists. Entrepreneurial Muggleborns may make the food they ‘brought' from home, but like the real world it would still/ eventually have a ‘wizarding flair'.

****** You know that's given me a bit of general inspiration in terms of the culinary history of wizards. Think about what ingredients were specifically available to wizards and why they would eat specific foods, because it is those foods that get adapted to street markets. For example, Haggis, although its origins are contentious, was made for Scots engaged in the Cattle Droves down to Edinburgh and Glasgow because it was cheap, sheep were available and it was portable. Highlanders carried a sack of oats which they would also make into porridge with the fresh water from burns. Oats and Barley are staple ingredients because of how hardy the crops are. Cornish Pasties were popular with Miners for similar reasons. It was an easily portable alternative, that brought almost an entire meal. So think about the types of jobs that specifically wizards, might do historically and their needs for such. Assuming of course, that Magic follows a similar trajectory to Science.

In the Fantastic Beasts Library book, we learn of Clan MacFusty, who are the custodians of the Hebridean Blacks. So how would that influence what they eat? For instance farmers, tend to eat food influence by the animals they rear.

Just a bit of food for thought.

Still, I have no doubt there'd be take-out. Apparate to a restaurant and grab it or just floo there and do the same. I'd guess it'd be the same as the muggle world but the geographical range of restaurants is wider because of the ease of magical travel.

It rents a couple of properties in London (+ other metropolitan centers), and just orders muggle food that gets delivered to the property, and then they floo it onwards to the waiting wizarding customers. You have an incredible diversity of Muggle food, get cheap deliverables, and more.

Heck, you could probably cooperate with a couple of restaurants so you get nice, steaming hot food on proper plates and everything.

A multi-use portkey with configurable destination and a simple magic artificial intelligence would be expensive to develop and create, but way faster and lower on maintenance. Especially for a food delivery company that needs lots of fast deliveries it'd be a no-brainer.

*** Depends what you mean by takeaway - if you're talking generally, like the idea of 'go in a place, get food, go home with it', then absolutely yes. 'Takeaways' have been a semi-ironically-traditional part of British Cuisine for over a century now. Alfred Hitchcock was born in 1899 and his childhood home was above a Fish and Chip shop in London, for one example, and the Asian food takeaway scene basically grew throughout the 20th century to feeding the country rather than just the immigrant Asian communities.

I don't know how popular it all was throughout, because the twentieth century really isn't my field, but I do know it existed and developed a lot over that period.

**** In the 20th century, ‘takeaway', well Fish and Chips, was hugely culturally important. The Governments of Asquith & Lloyd George knew of their importance to civilian and military morale, so ensuring an uninterrupted supply chain of the ingredients was a priority. As they were so cheap, they were staples of the working class diet, in the North, Scotland and any traditionally working class areas of Britain. In ‘Road to Wigan Pier', Orwell lists it as a ‘home comfort' and helped to ‘avert revolution'. He implies that it is an opiate of the masses.

When rationing came into effect during the second world war, Fish and Chips were not subject to said rationing due to their importance for morale.

The huge levels of post war migration, such as the windrush generation, and immigration from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, brought with it a new spate of new ethnic foods and restaurants e.g. Curry houses and the like. The way my Mum and Grandad tell it, takeaway wasn't delivered, more it was brought home after work on a Friday, traditionally.

I'm just someone with a dislike of bad fanfiction, a fair amount of anecdotal experience to share, and a dislike of cultural homogeneity (Where's the fun in life if everything is the same?). Cultures are different, it doesn't make them superior but they are different, and sometimes that is a good thing. When it comes to something as big as magic, a society that forms around it and has been isolated for 350 years should be vastly different, though not in an ‘inhuman' way. The changes are both subtle and vast. Taboos, Fashion choice, food, entertainment culture and the like, would all be somewhat different, but Wizards would theoretically speaking, still make ‘dick jokes' and innuendo.

******* Psychologically speaking, human beings love an anecdote. We learn and understand better through narrative than anything else. There's a reason the cliche favourite teachers are the ones that share stories and talk around their subjects. Plus, it's more interesting to read than just regurgitating textbooks. :)

Either way, it's stuff I don't know and have been able to research myself from your comments, so it definitely counts as informative. :)

Completely agree on the cultural homogeneity, though I personally go a little further than dislike. The very idea of everyone being the same is mildly terrifying.

Though I would dispute the isolation comment. After all, we know that Magical Britain (at least) gets a regular influx of Muggleborns each year. Some of them will go native and mostly adopt Magical Culture, but even they will still share some of their own cultural practices and the more 'subtle' beliefs and frameworks both consciously and unconsciously. That'll have an effect on Magical Culture, especially over the last three hundred and thirty-ish years (Statute was 1690-something, IIRC). That's pretty much how a significant portion of English culture came about, anyway. To reference the original topic - neither battered fish nor fried chips were invented by us, despite our love for them (The fish is Iberian Jewish and the chips are Belgian), but they came here and now it's part of our culture. That happens a lot.

******** What you say is true, though I am coming from a perspective where I had it drilled into me that Anecdotal experience, should rarely, if ever, be used in support of a logical or fact based argument. The spectrum of Human experience is so vastly different even amongst individuals within the same culture that, whatever may have been true for one person, will not necessarily have been true for another.

Oh aye, of course, I more than dislike cultural homogeneity, that was, shall we say, a diplomatic way of putting it.

True, Fish and chips did not originate in Britain, it does not make it any less British, as it has its own flair. In Belgium and the Netherlands for example, it is somewhat popular to serve them with mayonnaise, which in my experience, is almost heretical. In other countries the fish will be fried differently; for example , Kibbeling and Lekkerbek in the Netherlands. Salt and Vinegar, and Salt and sauce(East of Scotland) are condiment combinations you would usually find her by comparison. As I say, cultures put unique twists on things.

In another context, I have some Gàidhlig (Scots Gaelic) and I once had someone try to tell me that Scottish Culture didn't exist as it had nothing ‘original', that it was just Irish and English, highly offensive, very reductionist, possibly racist. Bit of a stupid point really, every culture has similarities and common origins, but it doesn't mean that they aren't different, despite that commonality. Cultures develop from specific attitudes that people exhibit as well. The example I like to use is the word for December in Gàidhlig and Gaelige(Irish). In Gàidhlig, December is ‘An Dùbhlachd' or ‘The Blackness', which displays a lot of cultural pessimism, and a reminder that from the time of the Covenanters (17th Century) until the 1950s, Christmas was banned in Scotland. This is why Hogmanay and the 1st and 2nd of January are so culturally important in Scotland, they essentially replaced Christmas.

Meanwhile in Irish, December is ‘Mí na Nollag' which is literally ‘Month of Christmas'.

Fair. I'm more on the Humanities end of things (Psychology Graduate and Mental Health Advocate here), so I was always taught to use anecdotes to humanise and support statistics and facts. "These numbers and patterns show how much of a thing this is, and to give an example of the effects, here's a few stories from some people experiencing the thing."

Not entirely sure if I'm misreading your response (I'm currently running on very little sleep, which means both my inferences and my implications are a little iffy right now), but this was basically the point I was trying to make with my previous comment. People come here, they bring things and ideas and beliefs, then some of those things become part of the local culture (as Muggleborns would for the Magicals).

  highly offensive, very reductionist, possibly racist.

It's also semantically ridiculous. You (general you, not you specifically) might as well say that since you can add the numbers one through nine together to get every other number in existence, none of those other numbers exist. Or that since the Peruvians got there first, the Egyptian pyramids don't exist.

********** Therein lies the rub. I'm a STEM grad (Physics). Realised I made a mistake and want to retrain in Celtic Archaeology. The last experience I had with humanities was Higher Classics, where we were taught to be relatively sceptical of Roman sources, particularly when they discuss the Celtic World. Ironically, the Debating society, encouraged us to essentially destroy political rhetoric ‘with facts and logic'.

I think it is the exact same point, come to think of it.

Heh. I know that feeling. I started out wanting to go into Medicine (though I only made it to A-Level with that want), then refocused on Clinical Psychology instead. Here's to new directions, eh?

Fair. As with everything in the Humanities, schools of thought do differ. Though I would say that those stories might not be true descriptions of the Celts, but they're significant descriptions of the beliefs and perceptions of the Romans. What people think and why they think it is as interesting as whether or not what they think is actually true - in my opinion, anyway. :)

And well, I'm sure that debate-encouraged approach works, but it's a little... antagonistic for our tastes. It's not about proving the politician wrong, but convincing them to get on your side and help you. And since they're often self-interested creatures, the simplest way to do that is give them a narrative they can sell and build their names on. Quid pro quo, amirite?

Great minds think alike, I suppose, even if some things are lost in translation. Apologies, I tend to get rather muddled when I'm tired and I don't explain my points well. :)

*** You could go and get it, but you couldn't get it delivered to your house. Possibly in London you could get pizza.

Naan bread for kebabs wasn't known where I grew up, it was always pita, and kebab shops were few and far between. It was all chippies, Chinese, Indian, other ethnic/national restaurants and sandwich places.

Oh, and large-scale burger chains and KFC.

** I think traditionally they would have street markets and things like that. If hungry, apparate or floo to Diagon or another magical shopping area and look for the next restaurant (if rich) or food cart (if poor).

Owl mail isn't really fast enough to make delivery feasible. Over the floo stores and restaurants might be a thing. But then it'd probably be a regular restaurant with a Floo connection.

If someone invents a magic internet equivalent (guaranteed to happen sometime in the 2000s or 2010s), then someone might come up with a website-equivalent food order service, with delivery by floo or apparition. It could be a thing in next gen fics, but it'd certainly be seen as a weird new thing no respectable traditional family would be caught using.

*** Full street markets, huh? Okay, follow-up question. What kind of food do you think would be available at these Wizarding markets? Would it be similar to the Muggle, or completely different?
