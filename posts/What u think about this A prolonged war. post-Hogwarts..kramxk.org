*Summary:* A prolonged war. When Voldemort goes to the Potters on Halloween he starts to duel a surprisingly skilled James Potter when his opponents features start to change and Albus Dumbledore is revealed. Being caught by surprise, Voldemort knows he doesn't stand a chance so after overcoming Dumbledores magic that keeps him from escaping, flees from the Potters unharmed.

This story would be about an adult Harry Potter just starting to mature into a man when the war that had been prolonged ever since the night Voldemort attacked is suddenly returned full force, with the Death Eaters and Order of Phoenix at full strength. At the beginning of the story anyway.

Voldemort still focuses on Harry Potter, for the prophecy, and in recognition of his /potential/, even though his at a young age for a wizard...

*Rules (Oneshot):*\\
*Pettigrew has a backbone and comes to Dumbledore and Potters with the idea of luring Voldemort to Godric's Hollow to defeat him once and for all.\\
*Voldemort must escape without losing his body.\\
(^Nothing new really, but would be nice to see done well.)

*(Extended):*\\
*Potters must be in the house for the duel, for some reason or the other, to lure Voldemort in, and all three of them witness the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore\\
*Harry, while young, is traumatized and has nightmares of the high level duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore, and seeing what they are capable of, uses this to push himself in magic and knowledge to grow stronger, knowing the potential wizards and witches have.\\
*Dumbledore uses the order to capture the Death Eaters with inside knowledge from Pettigrew (and Snape?) while Voldemort is lured to Godric's Hollow. When Voldemort escapes, all of his Death Eaters are in Azkaban, with Dumbledores new protections in place on the prison, effectively prolonging the war until Voldemort can break them out.\\
*Main story is post-Hogwarts and Harry-centric. Maybe start it at the graduation ceremony?\\
*A while after Harry graduates, in his new profession, (or maybe his traveling and learning magic), Voldemort finally succeeds in breaking all of his Death Eaters out of prison. (Dumbledore stopped Crouch Snr. from executing /any/ Death Eaters.)\\
*Must show Harrys progression as a wizard and in the war.\\
*Harrys growth of skill and involvement in the war leads him to becoming too cocky, he does/attacks something he shouldn't. Because of this James or Lily die for him in a battle. (Harry can't be perfect, must make mistakes.)\\
*Character deaths, no lovey dovey shit.\\
*Romantic pairings can be whatever, must be a minor point in the story. If it can't be done, it can't be done.\\
*Rest is open.

Nothing truly unique even though it mightn't of been done that way specificly before. Its the author the makes a story truly great, and there needs to be more war stories where Harry is an adult.
