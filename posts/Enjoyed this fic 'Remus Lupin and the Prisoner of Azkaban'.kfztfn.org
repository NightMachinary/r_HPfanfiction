This fic called[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6510730/chapters/14898688]["Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban"]]by JannaElizabeth93 is terrific-sad, but not as sad or violent as the tags say it is, or maybe I have a heart of stone. I'm learning that I really enjoy when fics stay close to canon but fill in gaps you didn't even know were there, which is what this fic does. It's not as exciting when an original scene is followed up by a direct copy-paste from the book. We get to see Lupin's teaching, his fears and prejudices, and interesting perspectives of Sirius and James. We also see some Cedric too. This does a good job interspersing Lupin's memories of his friends with his present. The author started another one of book 4 from Sirius's perspective but then, like many authors, stopped it after Rowling aired her views about a certain subject this year. I totally understand why authors would do this it's just too bad that Rowling's views put a halt to some great writing. Check it out.

#+begin_quote
  A rather dark coming-of-age story about Remus Lupin, a misguided family, the death of innocence and the renewal of hope during Voldemort's first war. Part I of The Moon-Cursers. Now updated to be DH-compatible.
