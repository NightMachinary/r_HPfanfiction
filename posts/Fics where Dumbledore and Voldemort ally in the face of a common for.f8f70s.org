I'm unsure if I've ever actually come across fics like that. But I think it would be interesting, so I thought I'd ask about it.


** I was about to recommend Realignment and then remembered that Voldemort isn't even in it, Riddle is.

It's still good tho.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** There was this apocalyptic fic that had Dumbledore and Voldemort allied. It was a muggle tech wasteland I think, where muggles had more advanced technology and destroyed the habitat of Earth

You think there are no muggles left and there is this faction whom some wizards have took into caring some muggle scientists, since there was no chance of survival without magic. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort had a faction of purebloods while this faction was mixed and had integrated muggle tech with magic. Hermione was born into this faction, she gets told purebloods hates them but later joins Dumbledore

It was probably never finished
