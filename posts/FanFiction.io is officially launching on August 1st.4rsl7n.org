Hi Everyone,

I'm back to introduce the public beta v1.01 for [[http://beta.fanfiction.io][FanFiction.io]], which will be launched August 1st, 2016.

[[http://beta.fanfiction.io][FanFiction.io]] aims to be an ad-free, censorship-free, and beautiful fanfiction platform that focuses on giving the reader and writer a thoroughly enjoyable experience. To do that, we have to go through many rounds of improvements.

And for that, I need your help! Until August 1st, *everyone who register and publish at least one story before August 1st will receive a free, hardcover, commemorative [[http://beta.fanfiction.io][FanFiction.io]] notebook.*

When you're using the website, keep in mind that we are still in a 'minimum viable product' (MVP) stage of launch, meaning that only the bare essential features for a fanfiction website is available to the public. Our plan is to let users decide what kind of features they want, so if you have a feature you NEED, or one that you can't stand, please email [[mailto:contact@fanfiction.io][contact@fanfiction.io]].

If you have any suggestions, see any bugs, or have any other comments, also email [[mailto:contact@fanfiction.io][contact@fanfiction.io]].

Go claim your username before someone else does!

Happy Writing, FanFiction.io Team

Edit - the auto capitalization on the title is way cool - any mods want to tell me what's the code for that? :)


** I am curious regarding the financing (especially if you send notebooks). Would the website work on donations, subscription fees, or sponsorship?

*** Financing will (hopefully) come from VC's and Kickstarter, but the first step is the proof of concept. I can promise, however, that FanFiction.io will forever be ad-free, no subscription fees either. Cheers!

**** So, how're you going to make a profit without ads? VC isn't going to give money if you have no potential for making a profit. And Kickstarter is likelier to fail than succeed.

***** We're testing a reddit-gold based system on a separate, closed-to-public version right now. I truly believe that monetization can be accomplished without sacrificing user experience, and maybe some VCs are going to see it that way too!

****** I think that can work well if your product is quality enough to take users from ffnet.

edit: I know its beta but I just went to check it out for a minute and I don't see any easy way to enable a dark mode. There is no chance I'm going to read on a white background.

** Oh! A new fanfiction site!

Some questions:

1) Would the rating system be more detailed compared than fanfiction.net's one?

2) Can this site be browsed through Android?

3) Would it be more... um, (don't know how to write it- controlled perhaps, or filtered?), than AO3?

4) How defined are the search function or when entering in a section? (Show only fanfics with this "rating letter", "time period", "book or movie universe", and more criteria)

5) how are the rules or guidelines about the fanfics' themes? (In a scale from fanfiction.net (restrictive) to AO3 (freer? I think))

Sorry if the questions feels awkward after reading it, English isn't my first language.

** A few things I noticed:

- There's no word count when scrolling through stories
- There's no chapter count when scrolling through stories
- No information on main character when scrolling through stories
- When I went to add my fic, there was multiple "Harry Potter" options. They all seemed to default to the same group but it seems to be a bug.
- when copying my chapters into the doc manager, if I don't hit spacebar or enter, it pastes my chapter in reverse, with my last paragraph first and my title at the bottom.

*** On the main page, click new. When the window shows up select new chapter, it defaults to new story. Then below that select which story the new chapter belongs to.

I just posted my story and three chapters on top, they system is rather elegant once you know what to do.

**** You must provide a title image. This is enough work that it will probably cut down on low-effort stories...except for the authors who realize they can just post fifty stories all with the same image.

** I just signed up and published a story. A few things:\\
* it's weird you don't have any ways to classify your story, how will readers find a story they feel like reading if they can't filter?\\
* I don't like the way the description of the story sits really close to the real story, it almost seems like it's a part of my text. * Also, to be really honest, ads don's usually bother me that much whilst reading. The people that are bothered by them will have installed an ad blocker anyway, so why go through so much trouble to go adfree?\\
Apart from this, I like the site, it looks pretty nice.

*** You probably did they originally posted about launching last October. Then November. Then again in April though at least it opened in beta that time. Also I've sent several emails to these guys with questions that were simply ignored. I don't have huge hopes of them being great on customer service or responsiveness.
