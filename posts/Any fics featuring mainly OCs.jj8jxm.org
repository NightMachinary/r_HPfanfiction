So, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for fics that are mainly OCs/only OCs? And maybe fanfics that are not centered around being at school, but about older wixen and their lives after?

I really enjoy reading folks worldbuilding surrounding HP, and after 7 (well, 6) books on the trio at school, I feel like I know what goes on at Hogwarts already, and I would like to read about what happens after, or in other parts of the wizarding world. (My example is the Alexandra Quick-series which, yes, takes place at a school, but at least it's a /different/ school than Hogwarts).

Also, just to make clear, I'm not looking for OC/Canon character fics, where that is the main storyline.

Any recommendations are highly appreciated!


** I'm gonna recommend two, one is my favourite fic at the moment and the other one is actually mine and it actually adheres to your criteria better!

My own fic contains two OCs, it's an AU and you could say they are co-protagonist with Harry, Sirius and Remus. There also no romance between OC and Canon characters.\\
linkao3(A Time for Wolves by Eirene29)

And the other one is a personal favourite, although the OC is technically an existing character, Amy Benson, it explores the years in which Tom went to school. It's very well made and it has the worldbuilding you might like!\\

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

** I really like linkffn(The Divide by Beedle), which centers on twin OC girls that are Hugo Weasley's age. Though it is set during their first few years at Hogwarts, there's not much focus on the actual schooling. It does feature several canon characters, but it's really about the OCs, and there's a bunch of fun worldbuilding and traveling to a few interesting places.

  When only one Hogwarts letter arrives for identical twin sisters, Juliet and Jennifer Belstone find themselves separated for the first time in their lives. Desperate to be reunited, they ask...could a Squib ever become a witch? And so their quest begins: a difficult and dangerous search for a source of magical power. Can they ever bridge the divide?

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
