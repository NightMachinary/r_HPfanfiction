Was reading a time travel fanfic that had the everyone dies during the hogwarts battle but harry goes back in time to fix it. I thought what if he just continued living and becomes the next head master of hogwarts for muggleborns.


** The Battle of Hogwarts only involves the defenders and attacking force, even if the fanon death of Voldermort kills anyone with Dark Mark, that still left the majority of Wizarding Britain since the Muggle-hating families don't all go donning the mark. Most of them should be more capable and interested in maintaining Hogwarts than Harry.

If you're talking about an extreme catastrophic event killing any magical human in British Isles for some reason, then the returning refugees and European schools would take over. Harry insisting on taking over Hogwarts would be literally one wizard against the entire Wizarding Europe.
