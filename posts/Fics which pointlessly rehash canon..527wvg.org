Wondering if there are fics out there that just rehash canon, adding nothing. I assume a lot, but most people try to put some spin on the story. I'm asking for something that is duplicitous. I want to see fics that have zero imagination.

** This is probably too innovative for what you're looking for, but I've been reading linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]) and I'm surprised at the amount of rehashing it contains. To the point where I'm skipping ahead pages at a time because some chapters contain almost identically what happened in canon.

** Linkffn(The Rebel and The Chosen; Behind Blue Eyes)

Canon, with minor differences. The pairings and how the pairings came together do not alter the rest of canon. Sure, Harry's pre HBP Summer is different, and he doesn't end up with Ginny. That's literally it.

I forgot how to do spoilers on mobile so until I figure it out, I won't go into details.

*** I actually like both of these fics. Like you said, TRaTC was a summer story and I think it does HP/NT pretty well. And BBE is my favorite HP/OC story, while it does rehash the main points in canon, it adds so much to the story and, IMO, has the best OC of any fic. If you're reading BBE it's not for a totally new HP plot, it's because you wanted an in-depth HP/OC relationship and that fics gives it to you.

  When Tonks & Harry meet, they quickly become friends. When tragedy brings them together again, it develops into more. Age, school, & war are only some of the obstacles in their way. Mix of canon & A/U. Rating mostly for language.

** What is nothing? If it's copied text only, then it literally adds nothing, but there are no fanfictions like that. Do you mean plot-wise? Personally, I don't like to read AU's about Harry and the Dursleys that tell the canon story, but with an addition of an OC or something. Strictly seen it adds something to the plot, but that doesn't make it good, in my opinion. However, they have a lot more reviews than mine. My story follows the plot from canon, and contains some repeated elements.

** Ah, crap, I can't remember the name. I think it's something like.. A second Chance? Or A New Opportunity? Something like that?

Basically, the Dursleys are good people. They treat Harry like a son. And everything else plays almost exactly the same. Word for word. The diference is that every now and then we see How worried the Dursleys are about their Harry. Oh, and Krum falls in love with Parvati for whatever fucking reason. And Fifth year gets eliminated and the events of sixth start taking place there. I have no idea what happens after because I gave up on it there.

Sad thing, the idea had potential. I'd love to see what would happen if the Dursleys were to accept Harry. But these people weren't the Dursleys in any way.
