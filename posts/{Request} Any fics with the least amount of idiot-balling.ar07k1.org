It shows what happens if Harry couldn't save Ron from being poisoned in 6th year.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

**** okay, I think I remember that one. Harry Potter and the Girl in Red. Rose was an artificer or something like that. Couldn't get into it, either.

****** Yeah, I know what you mean. Too much tell, not enough show. Of the DnD/HP crossovers, Harry Potter and the Natural 20 was my favorite (it was really funny and the OC from the DnD universe could only use DnD abilities) but even in that one, some 40ish chapters in, the main character does stuff that's both stupid AND out of character so I had to quit.
