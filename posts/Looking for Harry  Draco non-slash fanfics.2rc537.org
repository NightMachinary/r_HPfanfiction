  If Harry Potter sat by Draco Malfoy on the Hogwarts Express in 1991 and got Sorted into Slytherin House. Series-length story, going from 1991-1998. Who you share your Chocolate Frogs with makes a world of a difference. Hogwarts era.

This is not post-4th year, but it's still a great platonic Harry-Draco fic.

  Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought... Harry and Draco go back to the Marauder era and become totally platonic BFFs.

** The most famous one I can think of is Aspeninthesunlight's [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] which features a Harry and Draco brotherly relationship. Complete, epic length (760K words with 2 sequels), rated PG.

Summary: It all started with a letter from home and family. Except, Harry doesn't really have either, does he? He's about to get them. A Snape-adopts-Harry story providing an alternate 6th year. Winner: Multifaceted Best Genfic, Best Draco Fic.

**** Ahhh, skyhawke is a little tricky to navigate. The link should take you the the "Story Notes" page with the Summary, History, etc. From there, you can either use the drop-down menu on the right-hand side to select the next chapter (it will currently be populated with Story Notes) or use the directional arrows that sit above the drop-down menu to go to the next chapter. Use the >> choice.

Hope that helps!
