It doesn't have to be only Umbridge either. It can be any other Defence Professor, against Snape, etc. Whoever.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Am fine with het/slash/femslash, Asexual/Bisexual, etc.


** Linkao3(The Meaning Of Mistletoe) Communist!Draco starts a revolution against Umbridge in Book 5 of the series. Honestly, its pretty funny to see it in action.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
