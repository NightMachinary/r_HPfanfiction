Summary: Bellatrix Lestrange? "His best lieutenant" she was called. "You-Know-Who's right hand." "Psychopath." "Sadist." "Foul." "Wicked." "Evil." Like mother like daughter? Or is there more to the story?

*** Thank you so much! I'm quite proud of my Haphne work. Yes, there will be romance, but it won't be the primary focus.
