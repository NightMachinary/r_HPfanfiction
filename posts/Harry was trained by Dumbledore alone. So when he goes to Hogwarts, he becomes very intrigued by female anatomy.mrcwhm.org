** Why would he be intrigued by females? Is this meant to imply that Dumbledore would keep him from seeing any female at all would bewilder him? ... wow, that sounds like the making of a new Jack the Ripper type serial killer somehow in my head to do his own dissections and diagrams and such.

*** Yeah, that's just ehhhhhh.

I feel a more promising variation of this setup would be a Harry that's fascinated by what people his age do, and his bumbling attempts to fit in.

**** Could just be me and my headspace, writing a story on assassins so I guess my brain jumped dark right off the bat I guess by the vagueness of the prompt compared to others posted lately.

***** Oh, don't get it wrong - I'm agreeing with you. As is, OP's prompt reads on the creepy side and your dark interpretation of the repercussions does strike me as a very plausible one.

I was just giving an alternative to that original prompt that I think would be actually promising

****** Yours could work too as no doubt Dumbledore would keep him pretty isolated from those his own age for his ‘higher goal' in life.

** OK, this prompt feel rather disgusting and/or pure lemon. Can I offer two slightly more tasteful ones?

- “Hail Odysseus” by Brennus linkffn(10645463)
- “What We're Fighting For” by James Spookie linkffn(9766604)

*** Hail Odysseus - that's the one that came to mind when reading this! I was forgetting the precise name of it.

I guess /slightly/ more tasteful is the correct wording for that one, judging from the bit I'd read before bailing out.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
