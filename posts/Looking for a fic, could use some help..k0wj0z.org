:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So remembering this fic is murky at best. So it goes something along the lines of him learning either dancing or etiquette from some governess like lady, at her studio, and she accepts, and he sees this girl there. She's a ballerina I believe, and from a Eastern European family I wanna say. And Harry asks her out, either for the Yule ball or something similar. She ends up manipulating him some how and he starts to like another girl too (can't remember who) and they kind of fight over him I believe. By the way the girl is an OC. I also believe her family is like either into underground crime OR just have a lot of powerful fighters and getting there cooperation would be a boon.

Anyways this fic is burning a hole in my brain and I really wanna re read it. If anyone remembers I'll give you a virtual hug. Haha.

Thanks

Ps happy preturkey day.


** Sounds like /Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament/. Although I stopped reading, so I don't know how things turned out with the OC after the Yule Ball.
