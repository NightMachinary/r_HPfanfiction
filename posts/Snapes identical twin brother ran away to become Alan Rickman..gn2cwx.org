I think this would be an awesome premise. It could have alan be Hermiones childhood crush could create a scenario where Hermione thinks snape IS alan rickman but doesn't tell anyone but Harry and Ron so they think he is a spy under the persona severus snape and that all his acting was practice being someone else. It would have to alter the timeline so alan rickman is dead when they go to hogwarts to preserve the illusion they have talked themselves into but it could be funny. Snape could think they think he is the bad guys like they did in Canon and they can say "I know your secret" and he can figure out which one they're talking about. It would all eventually blow up in everyone's face.


** Not exactly that, but I love not-yet-bishop Alan Rickman in linkffn(Diary of Time by joemjackson).
