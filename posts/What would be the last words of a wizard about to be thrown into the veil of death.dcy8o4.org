** "Any last words?"

Looking at the fluttering veil in front of him, the silent whispers assaulting his mind, Christopher gave a tired smile and a nod. "My only regret..." he said, loud enough to be heard by the few witches and wizards in the room of death, "is that I didn't hate Hufflepuff /more."/

** "You have been placed here because of your crimes against wizard kind. Any last words."

Barry stared at the Veil. He remembered the war, the effort he put in, to help Voldermort win, but it all was doomed after his death. The Final push at Hogwarts so successful, until their lord had fallen. It had all fell apart as Voldemort fell and the dismay became of the Death Eater's army. Staring ahead at the Veil, he simply uttered,

"Long live Voldemort."
