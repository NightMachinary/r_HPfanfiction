There was a video titled "we need to talk about The King in Yellow" on youtube, where the Maker procceds to examine the book titled The king in yellow by Robert Chambers. I cannot seem to find it anymore. Does anyone know where I can or did someome happen to download it?


** I'm not sure this is appropriate for the subreddit, but since I'm a Cthulhu Nerd as well I gave it a check and I think the video and/or channel has been deleted.

Googling - "talk about the king in yellow" site:youtube.com - and checking the popular playlist results all pointed me towards a channel called Get Lit/Get Lit Book Reviews that had a video with the exact title you wanted, but searching the channel didn't give any results. So, the channel is most likely gone.
