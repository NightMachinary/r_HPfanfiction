‚ÄúRobe me!‚Äù

Wormtail rushed to hand Voldemort his robe. As the servant tried to slip it on his skin, the dark lord screamed.

‚ÄúThis is the single. Worst. Robe. EVER!‚Äù he shrieked, as he threw off the tattered black cloth.

‚ÄúIt's not silk so it's not fit for my sensitive skin Wormtail! I could have broken out in hives but did you care? No, you're always so selfish.‚Äù

Voldemort burst into tears

‚ÄúThere, there,‚Äù said Harry as he glared daggers at the rat. ‚ÄúIt's alright, we'll just go to Twillfit and Tattings and get a lovely blood-red silk robe, okay?‚Äù

The dark lord sniffled and looked at harry.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said, and Harry handed him his own jacket for the time being.

‚ÄúAnd that is a true gentleman, Wormtail, why couldn't you have been more like him?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut- my lord!‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh- let's go girl,‚Äù said Harry, ‚Äúyou deserve so much better than him. I promise we'll get a manicure too if we can get to Diagon by 5‚Äù

‚ÄúThe prophecy was right, you really are my equal!‚Äù

*** it turns out that when you get hit by the killing curse a material that reflects you will blow in the wind above the body in question. It comes as no surprise for harry when he is covered in glitter. Cedric was always one for sparkles.
