okay hear me out. The Fidelius Charm is meant to protect a location known only to only person, or Secret Keeper. Only they can divulge the location to others or if they die anyone who knew the Secret becomes a Secret Keeper.

​

We know Pettigrew was the Keeper at Godrics hollow. James, Lily, Sirius, Dumbledore, Hagrid and Bagshot are known to have been let into the Secret. We infer that Remus is in the know too (with how close he is to James). When Pettigrew told Voldemort (im inferring that only he knew since he alone went). So there's at least 7 people (8 including baby harry) who are aware of the Potters location.

​

How did Hermoine see Godrics Hollow in the Deathly Hollows? how could the spell degrade with the Secret Keeper being still alive. Is it just a Plot hole or what?

​

​

I had this thought when i was hella high the other night at a friends and its been bugging me all day


** Maybe because james and lily are dead. So the charm was meant to hide “james and lily live at god rica hollow. They no longer live there, they're dead so the Fidelis doesn't hide anymore.

** A lot of fics make the Fidelius charm based on conditional information. So, if the information that's being hidden is no longer true, them the fidelius breaks. So, if the fidelius phrase was "The Potter family is hiding in Godric's Hollow", the one could argue that the fidelius would collapse as soon as Lily died, as there was no longer a "family" hiding there.

**** !linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) uses the fidelius charm quite heavily, and there's one part at the end of year one where Harry's group has issues with an enchanted object, and they can't remove it from its room to study elsewhere, since the object is part of the room's fidelius.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** I don't think Rowling explained "how" it happened but the Fidelius broke the night of the attack. This is why both Snape and Hagrid were able to enter the house, and why the house later became a kind of shrine for the loss during the War.

** As I understand it, the Secret was that Lily and James and Harry were hiding in their safe-house (Godric's Hollow is the name of the village, not the house). I'm vaguely recalling a line that Voldemort could be stood outside the very house, nose pressed against the window, and still wouldn't be able to see them because of the Secret.

Once they had died and Harry had been removed, the Secret became irrelevant and the Fidelius was lifted. Snape, Hagrid, and Sirius all entered the house after they had died - Sirius certainly /didn't/ know their location beforehand because the whole point of making Peter the Secret-Keeper was that Sirius was too obvious a choice. And for the Fidelius to work, the Secret has to be kept within the soul of a /single/ Secret-Keeper. Not even Dumbledore knew where the Potters were when the Fidelius was active.

In the years after their deaths, many witches and wizards travelled to the Potters' safe-house and wrote notes of support to Harry on the gate. Hermione knows that Godric's Hollow was where the Potters die because it's common knowledge in the wizarding world.

*** Not really the point but I don't necessarily agree that Sirius (and/or Dumbledore) didn't know the Potter's location. The point of the spell-from my understanding- is that only the Secret Keeper can /tell/ the secret. Not that other people don't /know/ the secret. Sirius was too obvious a choice as far as making him the Keeper goes but that doesn't mean that Peter didn't tell him the location after the spell had been cast.

**** i could see that but there is a statue outside the potter family home of them, it was mentioned in the paper the night james and lily died, and i believe rita skeeter mentioned it in the book she wrote about dumbledore. that's why i always made the assumption the spell just broke completely

** I remember reading that if the spell caster died his spells are broken, Ex when dumbledore's death causes the body bind curse on harry to automatically break. If either lily or james casted the fidelius charm, then the same theory would hold true
