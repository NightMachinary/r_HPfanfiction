I really need some new fanfics to read and am looking for some new recommendations. Anything old or new, maybe even some published before series completion. Any genre as long a its quality work, and a longer story.

** I liked the [[http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oNLhUKOmeWnitaWgOSh8Ds2LzgzUG06XAbg87KzTJmraG3Ax40N_fZ5R9wNXBiNqK_OCVdLEEVmeRcO2-V0eXQkxVQkCEaoFzqOHrmrs4DJuNQ/PSfics.html][Psychic Serpent Trilogy]], by Barb.

I read it a long time ago, but it was one of the first professional-grade works I read.

Story starts in year 5. The first story is good, turns out snakes can tell the future in a minor way, so Harry has a little pet garden snake that gives him 5-seconds into the future prophecies from time to time.

Second story is great- Harry makes a deal with Voldemort to go back in time and save his parents, but also Voldemort doesn't fall, leading to a whole alternate universe and a fix-the-timeline plot.

Third story uses themes from both preceding books, and has a prophecy involving Harry and Malfoy.

The relationships change, so it's not just, say, a Harry/Hermione book or whatever. I don't think there's any slash, and I'm pretty sure there aren't any major Original Characters.

Edit- Link works for me, but for anyone else, you can use Sproc's links to access the stories (although I would actually suggest clicking to the author's profile page and going to her homepage- I believe she's made a few edits but was unable to post them on Facebook for whatever reason)

**** Hah cool, I didn't know there was a prequel either.

You might want to check out the stories on the author's own web site, though- I seem to recall she said that she had made some edits, but couldn't put them on Facebook (whether due to content, or due to odd FF.net structure, I don't know)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power][Searching for The Power]] by GinnyMyLove (me) - 570k words - Complete

Harry/Multi - heavy lemons - I couldn't decide whether it was porn with plot, or plot with porn...and there is a character death that hit me just as hard as my readers...I didn't even know what I was writing until I got there and I was like....."no....shit no...I can't!...but my muse wont let me write anything else...."

Hermione finds out the "Power He Knows Not" might be Love, and vows to help him find it...in any way she can. Harem plot ensues, surprisingly a lot of depth outside the lemons though. But I'm biased as the author.

**** Unfortunately.....I couldn't decide whether it was Porn with Plot, or Plot with Porn. My half baked plot ended up taking over, and then some shit went down....and I almost couldn't keep writing after what I'd done...

But where its heading? You think too highly of my abilities, endings are freaking HARD!

** This was one of the first stories I've ever read, it's OLD...Started in 2001 and ended in 2003, so it's GoF canon. It's over 600k words and written by the people from The Sugar Quill.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End]]

It started my 10 year journey of Harry Potter Fanfiction. I dont recall all the specifics now, but it's canon ships (at least, H/G R/H), ad is fairly intense at times and it does go into mature content but nothing lemon-y.

I'd recommend it, even though It's now AU because of the others, it's incredibly well written.
