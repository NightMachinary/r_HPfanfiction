  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect. The only selfish, power-crazed person that ever existed was defeated, all the deaths the whole affair brought about quickly forgotten and the happy, naturally developed couples were eager to get started on making babies and giving them awful names. And of course it all worked out exactly like that, duh! What an epilogue!
