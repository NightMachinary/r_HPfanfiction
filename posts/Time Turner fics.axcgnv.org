Are there any fics that make frequent use of time turners where it makes sense?

In canon it's just the one occasion, and I want to read a bit more about everyday time travel.

Not "somehow ending up in 1943 and falling in love with Tom Riddle Jr." time travel but "gotta go back two hours to Arithmancy" time travel. Or "gotta go back a few hours to prepare the prank that just happened" time travel. What about "gotta go back to Divination and scare Trelawney by predicting what just happened" time travel.


** I went through my bookmark list, I found three fics that (partially) fall into this category:

You might have heard of who_la_hoop's 'Tea and No Sympathy' which is a really popular (and rightly so!) time-travel fic involving a broken time-turner. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082]]

firethesounds' 'At the Crossroads There We'll Meet' is one of my personal favorites that follows a similar premise, definitely recommend. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2039154]]

This last one stretchs what you're looking for a bit, but is still a great read. In it, Remus and Sirus time travel to the future where they meet an adult Teddy and James having relationship problems, it's not too long, and also worth the read! nerakrose, 'Here Now, Gone Yesterday (or Back to the Future)' [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/534478]]

** Linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) features some pretty heavy Time Turner abuse by Harriett.

Warning: It likely won't make sense if you haven't read the prequels and they're pretty long

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.
