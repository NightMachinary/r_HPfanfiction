*** Possibly. Definitely not Harry/Magie though, she remained childlike even as Harry grew up.

**** Hmm. I was thinking Aluria's Gift by Lucifael. He contacted magic but magic was more adult about it. I DO remember a fic with a childlike Maggie though.. I can't remember the title. I'll search myself.

***** I'm sure it was Magie with one G. Towards the end he had unlocked all kinds of hidden features of Hogwarts including a magical-oath-binding Round Table and he was uniting the houses using it?

** Yeah, I've read that one. IIRC Harry hallucinated himself an imaginary friend due to abuse by Dursleys (?) and she turned out to be a representation of his magic. I don't remember the name of the story, unfortunately.

*** Damn. Yeah, I remember he met her as she brought him food after he'd been locked in the cupboard for days

**** Here, I used my Google-fu with the phrase "Magie perched" since that was the bit I remembered, oddly enough.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

Has Harry create an avatar for magic in the last chapter. Not named magie though.
