I always wondered why harry never received additional tutelage for his magical skills as he was the on destined to one day defeat voldemort. Are there any good fanfiction out there that have Harry being trained by someone to reach his potential?


** My question to you is this: what would endless training of Harry have done? Harry doesn't have Dumbledore and Voldemort's instinctive command of magic and he will never have the experience and knowledge Voldemort has. There's no way Harry could ever have matched Voldemort without special circumstances, like sacrificial magic, a soul fragment in a scar, and mastery of his enemy's wand.

** Well that lack of training is one of the rationales/justifications for the manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore trope. Eg Dumbledore didn't want Harry better trained because once Voldemort killed Harry Dumbledore would then swoop in and finish off Voldemort. Once that happens Dumbledore would become the greatest "light" lord having defeated two powerful Dark lords. So the yearly encounters Harry had with Voldemort were all intentional on Dumbledore's part.

** Wow it seems there are quite a few people don't like reading how the manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore and bad Weasley tropes could possibly be justified/rationalized by their canon actions. I would much rather have read why they disagreed with what I wrote instead of anonymous down votes. Kind of hard to have a discussion if only one side talks.

And in the area of training/or lack thereof, it's the lack of detail in canon about why Harry doesn't receive any specialized training that fuels all the fanon alternatives and gives life to the various tropes. Or at least provides another reason/justification for why the trope exists.

*** But that's where the different aspects of the fanon manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore tropes get their power.

For instance, Harry's study habits wouldn't have been so poor if Dumbledore wouldn't have interfered and placed Harry with his abusive relatives where Harry was punished for getting better marks then Dudley (who's basically a talking ape). Years of being punished for doing better than Dudley in his school work would definitely get a child to no longer try.

Of course, where should Dumbledore have placed Harry is denoted in the Potter Will (which Dumbledore either hid, or using his government powers had sealed so Dumbledore could control Harry). Now from canon we do know that wills exist in the wizarding world due to Sirius' however there is no hint in canon that the Potter's had a will. Now fanon sees (and I agree) that it would be very logical for a young married couple with a child who are fighting in a war to have a Will to handle their assets but most importantly to identify who should raise their child if they don't make it.

So fanon argues that if you don't place Harry with his abusive relatives he would be very smart and close to the top in his studies. And there is some support in canon for this as Harry read through all of his school books the month before school. The problem is it has been ingrained in him not to get good marks as good marks are bad.

The above also feeds into the bad Weasley tropes as Ron always pushes Harry to play chess or talk Quidditch rather than studying (basically stating that harry meeting Ron was a "setup" because Dumbledore knew Ron was lazy, not that bright etc which would keep harry from learning too much. And as Harry's first ever friend he has a hell of a lot of influence over Harry.

Based on the few canon lines of how much Harry likes to read suggests if Harry would have met Hermione first instead of Ron his study habits/school work would be greatly improved. And quite a few fics explore that idea

As far as additional training how about for a start just more supervised practice sessions to help improve the speed, accuracy, and strength of his spells. Maybe assistance getting past his learned behavior of not getting good marks because he'll be punished.

It's the absence of details or their contradictions in canon that give rise to many of the fanon tropes. The lack of anything resembling assistance in training when it is supposedly Harry's destiny to confront Voldemort (remember it only says they will fight each other not who wins) is what led to the various Dumbledore tropes.

**** Do we know for sure that he was punished for getting better grades than Dudley, or is that fanon?

I kind of see your point about Hermione, but Harry also found her annoying and bossy from pretty early on.

***** I would have to reread canon to make sure, but I really believe it is in canon. Now if it's not explicitly stated it's definitely implied. Remember from PS the number one rule is "Don't Ask Questions". In the main house there is no sign that Harry lives there. He sleeps in a storage space under the stairs instead of in one of the 2 open bedrooms. Harry is assigned lots of chores where Dudley rarely has any. He is punished for supposed wrong doing by being thrown into the cupboard and no meals. At this point he's never had a hug or had a birthday party or received a single gift or "new" item, whereas Dudley gets tons of store bought new things if I recall something like close to 40 gifts for his birthday in PS.

So it's easy to believe that if harry did better than Dudley in anything that it wouldn't go well for him with Vernon and Petunia. Now my gut is saying that somewhere in canon is a statement about Harry's grades compared to Dudley. Problem is I don't know if it's in PS or one of the other stories where Harry lets slip about his home life.

In terms of Hermione you're right she does have her issues. But remember that Harry tolerates a lot for his first ever friend. So I still think if he met her first he would latch onto her. I also think that Hermione having her first real friend earlier would help to smooth out some of her issues as her bossiness is more of a defense mechanism to weed out those who would take advantage of her for grades. Plus it's also her way of trying to push Harry to do better. So if Harry is already being more studious eg keeping pace with her she might not be as bossy with him.

** Because, for Dumbledore's plan, Harry being magically skilled is not required. Harry, only needed to be self sacrificial in order to get rid of the Horcrux. Still, in order to hunt down the remaining Horcruxes, Harry needed to have been skilled. But, Dumbledore, for whatever reason, did not want Harry to be trained. It was only because of luck that Harry managed to destroy the Horcruxes.

** Now for a fic that provides one possible reason for the Statute of Secrecy (to protect the magicals from the Muggles) the Story Wizard's Suck by Ares.Granger has Harry being rescued by Hermione and with several others being trained by the British Government in mundane weapons and tactics to take on the deatheaters. So basically training a "Dirty Harry" with no mercy for deatheaters.

Of course, this usually raises the argument about whether magicals really need to fear the mundanes. Or that the no-mags are way outclassed by the magicals.
