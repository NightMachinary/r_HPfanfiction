There's this fic that I forgot the title but I really wanted to finish it. I'm sure in that fic that the Dursleys were really abusive. I mean REALLY FUCKING ABUSIVE. He's beaten up and I remember a particular scene where Snape discovers that he's only given a bucket to pee on and unload you-know-what. And I also remember Harry having to deal with traumatic tendencies that made him mute. Please help me find it T.T
