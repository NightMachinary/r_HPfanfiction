:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so it's not so much a single fic as it is a fanon type of idea that I've seen in a couple of fics.

At its core, quidditch is a hybrid of soccer and hockey played in the air. Because of quidditch's similarity to ice hockey, I've seen a fic or two where there is the figure skating equivalent on brooms called â€˜Figure Flying', which is all about finesse and the graceful movements of flight.

I think I read about the idea in a Hansy or Haphne fic, but I could be mistaken. Has anyone else seen the fanon concept of figure flying? Please link.
