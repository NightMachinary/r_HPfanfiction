what are the best crossovers that take place before the deathly hallows meaning none of that harry gets bored of what he was so fond of he committed suicide for it and left bullshit because that makes zero sense none nadda zip zilch.


** Linkao3(940292) Linkao3(1037568)

Both are Merlin crossover that are Deathly Hallows AU- as in they deal with the events of that novel in a different manner.

Edit:: tried to link to series and it didn't like that. ffnbot!refresh

  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

  Merlin Emrys has been waiting thirteen hundred years for this moment to arrive. Can he fulfill the destiny that is required of him? Will Harry learn to trust this mysterious stranger? The fate of the Old Religion and the entire wizarding world depends entirely on them. AU for the last part of Deathly Hallows. Set after Series 4 but written before Series 5.An edited and updated version of my story on FF.

** *Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942): Starwars Crossover after Year 5. It's a typical Darth Marrs fic with tons of graphical sex and violence, but I find this one highly entertaining.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
