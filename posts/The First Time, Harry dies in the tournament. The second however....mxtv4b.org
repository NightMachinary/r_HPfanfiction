Harry could only watch the bright flames coming closer. He'd really done it this time, this is where it'd finally end. All those murder attempts were leading up to this.

The Hungarian Horntail was gonna burn him alive.

Suddenly however, there was a loud noise, and he was tackled to the ground.

"HANDLE THE HORNTAIL!" It took him a moment to register what was going on, but looked up to the person who had just saved his life.

"Ron? Wha-"

"Listen, we don't got time." Not-Ron, helped him back up, where a witch had the horntail pinned.

"Kid, we just stopped Emperor Voldemort from taking over. From now on, we're your body guards."

Harry had a feeling this was where things get more complicated.


** future-ron from a dystopian future that turned into a hardened war-veteran, who goes back in time to protect his best friend from dying, out of sheer loyalty?

Fuck it, I'm 100 % sold. We need more awesome-Ron fanfics in this fandom.

*** i've been thinking of this all day, and I decided to write some more:

future ron meeting himself: Ron nervously approached him. The man who looked so much like him, but acted so different. He'd saved Harry's life about two hours ago, and now Harry was being fussed over by Madame Pomfrey. It had all been really sudden, Ron had felt so helpless, standing up in his seat. He was about to watch one of his only friends die, and he didn't even get to say sorry for being a prat, or a simple goodbye. And then...His attention went back to the task at hand.

"Uh...You're the one who saved Harry right?"

The gruff man looked down at him, having been about to light a cig. "What of it?" He seemed to have a lot of scars. Covering his arms, a few on his face. In fact his was missing an eye.

"I wanted to say thanks, Harry's...Harry and Hermione are the only friends I've got. I dunno why they like me but they do. And if Harry died I...I wouldn't know what to do with myself." The words started and didn't stop slipping from his lips.

His older self started to reach out to him but pulled his hand back as if he'd been burned. He sighed, and lit his cig, taking a long slow drag.

"I know kid. I know exactly what you mean." He thought of things that could have been, if someone had done the same courtesy of saving his own friends life.

The champions unionize: Cedric paced, head in his hands.

"If that guy hadn't come out of the way and pushed him, he would've died!"

"Ve know." Fleur was sitting in an arm chair, curled in on her self.

"We've been such idiots! He's just a kid! What if he had died?"

"Ve know." Victor was nursing an unlabeled flask, taking a sip every once in a while.

"What are we doing! We can't let something like this happen again! We're adults, and he's just a kid, if anything, we should have come to save him!"

Fleur and Victor looked at eachother, each having family members Harry's age, having been imagining they were in his place. They felt so guilty, watching him shake on the bench of the tent when he thought no one was looking.

"We should help that guy and that witch too! If anything, it'll help all of our chances of living too."

Cedric was just rambling but little did he know he had motivated Fleur and Victor.

"Cedric, ve vill be forming an alliance. Hogvarts es not safe for younger children. 've heard stories from older years. Ve vill protect them." Victor put his flask away, standing and adjusting his robes.

"Oui, I vill not tolerate ze british adults dismissal. Children should be loved, not thrown into something such as this!" Fleur stood after Victor, meeting eyes with Cedric.

Said man looked at his fellow champions. Noting their changed dispositions.

"Get all the adults with you, I'll see what I can do with the Hufflepuffs. From now on, instead of the teachers, we'll protect those kids."

With this, a silent agreement was formed. With their new mission, the three champions left the abandoned classroom.

The train back home: Harry and Ron's fourth year had been something. Well, something was an understate ment.

As of current, Ron's older self, or Bilius, as he liked to be called to avoid confusion, was sitting in the car with them, while the blonde haired witch he came with stood outside the door on guard. Her name was Luna if he remembered right. She had said she was going to her own house, and was only stand guard for right now.

Bilius was intimidating, but that didn't stop conversation between him, Ron and Hermione. Although remembering how protective he was of Harry made things a little awkward. After the tournament, and Voldemort's resurrection, any minor threat to Harry's well being, was either destroyed, or Harry was picked up by his armpits and moved to safe place. Bilius was kinda paranoid.

"I miss Mum's cooking so much! I love Hogwarts food but I want her pasta so bad." Ron complained.

"Agreed, Mrs.Weasley is a really good cook, I'm just glad to not be at the Dursley's, but I have Bilius to thank for that." When Dumbledore had said he needed to return, Bilius had appeared from nowhere and stared the elder warlock down until he retracted his statement.

Hermione was very quietly reading, something about potions, and wasn't paying much attention, or so they thought. In reality she was watching Bilius with a suspicious eye. She didn't trust him yet. Something about this to her screamed 'too on time'.

"I miss her cooking too. You think you can live on gruel and water for a few years and then your first taste of real food will leave you in tears." Bilius spoke up, from his seat near the door.

Harry nodded in understanding.

Sure, things weren't perfect but they had eachother so who cared?
