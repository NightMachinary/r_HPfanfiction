  But mostly, I can't get the image of bookworm Hermione out of my head. I just don't see her as a good element for romance.
#+end_quote

Dude! Bookworms /are/ gross, aren't they?

#+begin_quote
  Now half the community hates me.
#+end_quote

Just the nerds who like bookworms, you idiot. So, more like *80%*.

#+begin_quote
  Whatever ticks you off about romance fics, preferences, and anything you'd like to discuss.
#+end_quote

Brobag, DLP-fellating writers who try to turn everything into ultra-dark S&M kink fics. They could all explode and nothing of value would be lost.

Oh! And fics by people who think love stories need to belittle smart characters. Those stories have paper-thin love interests who drift without internal motivations or goals, until captured by the /irresistible attraction/ of the shallow main character. I absolutely /loathe/ those fics.

*** It's not that I hate bookworms. But when I picture Hermione, I don't see her as a 'partner' for Harry, because in my mind, I'll always see her as the sister to Harry, and his bookworm friend. It's hard to explain

**** u/flupo42:

  I can only say I enjoy Harry/Hermione when they are Dark wizards.
#+end_quote

you find it easier to see Hermione and Harry turning to murder and torture then to see them shift from canon friend/sister relationship into romance?

***** I have no problem with their brother/sister like relationship. Whenever I seem to read fics, she seems intolerable in certain parts where she tries to stop him or reason with him.

** One thing that comes to mind as far what ticks me off is when people use cap-locks for online equivalent of screaming/shouting - especially if it is in the middle of a seemingly neutral speech. It gives an impression that the writer has some form of tourette syndrome causing them escalate their speech at random points of the conversation.

** In view of how the discussion in this thread went rather quickly down the drain, I can only recommend that OP make his request a bit briefer next time. It's also not a good idea to try and disparage other ships when requesting fics. On-topic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][HP and the Summer of Change]] for HP/NT is pretty well-known, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Marriage_Contracts][HP & the Marriage Contracts]] is a nice HP/DG fanfic.
