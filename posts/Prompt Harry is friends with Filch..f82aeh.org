Harry making buddies with Filch somehow, helping him clean and petting Mrs Norris, chattering with Filch until he softens his grouchy heart. Idk I just think it could be a cute little dynamic


** I think after the dursleys it would make sense that harry always cleans up after himself and never tracks mud into the castle

** Eider Down's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] is great and has a really good 'squib bonding' side plot, though if you read AverageFish's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20383987][To Skin a Cat]] you probably know it already.

** It's late in the fic, but Harry ends up convincing Filch to teach a class on magical painting in Benefits of Old Laws. The conceit there is that he'd have to be close to an expert to properly maintain all the various portraits in Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib]] Harry's magic is so weak that he's practically a squib, which Filch sympathizes with.
