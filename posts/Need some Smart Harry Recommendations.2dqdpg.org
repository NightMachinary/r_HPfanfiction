I am looking for fics where Harry is smart and preferably not incredibly powerful. 'Poison Pen' is one of my favorite fics. I also liked the one where Harry calls himself 'Harry Wizard'. HPMOR has also been great so far. 'HP: Junior Inquisitor' looked very promising but somehow the author lost his/her way. Are there any similar well written fics? I don't mind character bashings or any ships.


** I almost hate to recommend it because it's probably abandoned and only 40k words long but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door][An Unfound Door]] is a nice one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived]] is another great one although Harry is kind of powerful in this one. It's definitely not super!Harry or anything and is certainly worth a read.

** Hogwarts battle school is very good. Looking for other fics in the same area too :)

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][The Gift of Memories]] was good but the sequel introduced some plot elements that put off some people, but not nearly as much as the ending did. The author may be abandoning the series due to the reactions to said plot element.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824728/1/Harry-Potter-Jedi][Harry Potter Jedi]] (wip) is also good, and the author stops by this sub occasionally too, so we know it's not dead yet.

I consider [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5299663/1/A-Smarter-Hunt][A Smarter Hunt]] by kb0 to have a Smart!Harry but YMMV.

*** That's the first time I've seen anyone else recommend my story. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

I admit, my Harry is a little overpowered, but there's a reasonable explanation for that.

**** [[http://i.imgur.com/0kCTb84.png][/Sees story called "Harry Potter Jedi", reads it./]]

But seriously, reading it now. I'm always up for something new.

Is it that Jedi are awesomely OP? Because that'll feed my suspension of disbelief for a good long while.

In any case, thanks for writing 200,000 or so words that I can read for free while I eat a sandwich. Well, multiple day's worth of sandwiches. That's all I really need to be happy.

***** Heh, sounds fun. But the hint is that Harry gets a little 'practice' before attending Hogwarts.

And I should warn anyone that the Jedi stuff is mostly beneath the surface of the story, only peeking up now and then. Thought about naming it something else since it confuses a some people... but I just can't find the right replacement.

Yeah, caught that. It clearly underpins his approach to everything. I'm still reading, but I assume he's less "scared little orphan" like in canon and more "focused, collected little orphan" going forward. Less reluctant hero, and more purposeful agent of good.

******* Ehh... Still the reluctant /hero/, but definitely more purposeful. I would call him a 'Grey Jedi' but so many people wouldn't understand the reference.

Makes sense. I'd imagine it is hard to be absolutely top-shelf Lawful Good in a straight, realistic HP 'verse. Shit is dark.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] is great. Smart Slytherin Harry. Starts in third year. Give it a shot and you won't regret it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] - somewhat older fic, but still updating. Very good. Harry and co get smart and get smart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] Harry is a girl and a potions prodigy. Very good. Will grow on you as you read. Might seem strange at first but continually gets better.

** One of my favourite fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]] (and its sequel) has a pretty smart Harry. I have to warn you that its very much AU though the world-building is fantastic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669783/1/Logic][This]] is a one-shot but if you are looking for smart harry this is a good profile. (If you don't mind a bit of Harry/Hermione) This one does not include harry/hermione I believe. It is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669783/1/Logic][Logic]] and is by sprinter1988
