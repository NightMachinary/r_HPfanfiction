I'm looking for a copy of fic called A Choriambic Progression by Mairead Triste and Aristide. I've seen it recommended a lot of times, but the all the links lead to the archive that was recently taken down. Does anyone know where else I can find this fic or has epub/mobi copy lying around?


** Wayback machine, first place I look when searching for a lost fic
