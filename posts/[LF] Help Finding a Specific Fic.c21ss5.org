I believe the beginning of the story has to do with Hermione dieing after being cursed. Harry comes back home and saves her, but the result is they can read each other's minds. Turns out he's an unspeakable (I think he was called something the Hunter...Arcturus, Acrius, something with an A). Hermione becomes an unspeakable researcher after finding out what Harry does by seeing his memories in her dreams.

I also remember someone in the DMLE being obsessed with solving her case...Dawlish maybe. In the end, Malfoy was behind the attempt at killing Hermione.


** Such an interesting fic but you had to spoil the ending

** Found it. Obviously enough, it was linkffn(12315670). And his name was Artorius. So close.

#+begin_quote
  After Hermione is cursed the only way to cure her is with a risky ritual that ends up having some unexpected consequences. Now Harry and Hermione have to learn to deal with those consequences while they try to find her attacker before he can strike again.
