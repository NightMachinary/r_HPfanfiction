** As petty as it may seem, grammar and formatting are huge for me. When I see a wall of bold I immediately back out- it's just hard to read and to focus on the story.

I'm not a fan of character bashing either. I like seeing canon characters, you know... be canon. If you hate a character then just don't write them or have them involved very little in the story. Now, if they are OOC it needs to have a reason for me. There needs to be an event or a loss/gain that explains the change in behavior. If this doesn't happen in the first few chapters and say Harry has decided he's a badass pimp that doesn't give a shit about anything but getting laid because he decides he can get away with it- sorry, I'm out.

I prefer seeing detail and thought put into the writing. I'm not a huge fan of the “he said x, she said y, they go to dinner, they go home. She doesn't like him, he cries himself to sleep, the end.” Believe it or not, I've seen stories like this. One line per paragraph, just saying straight up what happened with no details or further insight then that.

I also read a comedy fic that was, again, pretty much 100% comedy---then there's a scene where Harry and Hermione are arguing about slavery, with Harry saying ‘they like being slaves, and if you free them they'll probably die!'

Ron walks in and tells Hermione to lay off on the whole House Elf issue, then Harry and Hermione get all smug and go “well actually we were acting out arguments regarding the slavery of black people.”

It just /really/ didn't fit the tone of the story.

actually it kinda did, the whole point of that story was to call fanfic stories and writers out for stupid tropes. The argument about slavery was to show how fanfics often use the same arguments for house-elf slavery that were used for real life slavery.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Bashing that goes beyond mild puts me off pretty quickly. A better alternative is to have the character either hoisted by their own petard or learn from their mistake.

Being very OOC is probably my biggest "nope, screw this noise". Dumbledore is a manipulator so I'm fine if he has to learn a lesson /in a believable way/, but making him a greedy thief or straight up evil is stupid. Ron can be pretty mean and flaky at times, but making him a knuckle-dragging doof or a rapist is just... please no, he has some redeeming qualities. Hermione isn't the most fun person to be around, but the idea that she's so deferential to authority that she'd rat out her friends ignores like every book where she broke every rule the trio needed to break. Etc.

If the spelling in grammar aren't decent in general, I drop quickly.

#+end_quote

This isn't from a fanfic, but I remember once someone saying one of Hermione's greatest flaws is trusting books too much and not questioning their content. Except this person must have forgotten Hermione discovering Lockhart's books were all scams, her disgust at /Hogwarts A History/ for failing to say anything about house-elves, not to mention her defiantly standing up to Umbridge because the assigned DADA book that year was shit. One of Hermione's defining growths is her increasing critical view of books, but for some readers, they take in only a character's role in the first book and don't remember any of their evolution in the subsequent six.

***** I, too, only read the first few chapters of Chamber of Secrets.

But, seriously, the point wasn't that she immediately knew they were fake. It was the discovery that they were stolen and poorly adapted from the real stories that shook her, later in the book. It was character development, which is exactly what OP was referring to.

Or, perhaps, your issue is with the word "discovering", as if Hermione made some unique epiphany. In that case, sure, you're right. Perhaps "accepting" may have been a better phrasing.

As long as he didn't consider them a threat to himself. Such that he would sacrifice them for his own safeguard, if it came to it, but he /would/ be deeply hurt by their deaths.

****** I don't think Voldemort is inherently incapable of romantic attachment, at least not before his resurrection. It seems to be relatively canonical that during the first war he was more ruthless leader than insane murderer. I'd argue he could be portrayed as a more machiavellian type character than a sociopath, especially if you give credit to the whole 'horcruxes drove him mad' theory. Not that I think it's ever in character to have him be romantic, and a romance with his character must always be somewhat twisted and involve power plays, but I don't think he's incapable of love.

I'm not so sure the Horcruxes drove him mad, really --- if anything, his thirteen years of constant unsleeping agony in Albania as a shredded ghost-thing are a better contender. But to me, he was just always that raving maniac within, but with enough intelligence to hide it under a cool façade throughout his teenage years. (Bottling up his emotions and serving up a blank, ever-polite façade /does/ seem to be how a mentally unbalanced, but extremely intelligent, child could turn out from a childhood in a grim, strict London orphanage.) And the moment he'd proclaimed himself Dark Lord and was powerful enough to not care what people thought of him any longer, he finally, /finally/ let loose and started being his real mood-swingy, petty, carelessly cruel self.

I'm not talking they are.

But an average Ravenclaw is more intelligent and knowledgable than average non-Ravenclaw, the same with Hufflepuff.

If magical power depends on these two traits, then in average Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs are more magically powerful than others. Yes, there're exceptions, but they /are/ exceptions.

I don't think there's any sense in discussion the traits of the canon heroes. In the books the Houses are used for the sole purpose of dividing students on good, bad and others.

************* But even discussing from a real person's perspective, most people are not defined by one single trait even if that may be a dominant one. If you look at magic since that's the topic, all four houses' predominant traits would be useful in a way or another to do proper magic. First of all, you would need knowledge - true - then you would need hard work but what good are they if you are not practical enough to put all that magic into application in real life situations.

You may have a different perspective but I always interpreted that the female founded houses had a more abstract and spiritual trait while the male founded houses had a more brutish but worldly trait. For example you can be hard working but if you have no clearly defined goal, what are you working for? Same with knowledge as one can be very well educated in certain matters and completely ignorant in others.

Whereas the bravery and cunningness are just as they sound. You either are ambitious enough to work towards a goal or not. You either are brave enough in a certain situation or you aren't.

It's not strange if the magical power has little to do with intelligence and hard work. In the book there're a lot of people who is intelligent and hard working (Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs).

But the books shows that both Dumbledore and Riddle are way above any of them. They are born magically powerful and very little who can rich them despite any learning, practicing and hard work.

In real world each person has a chance to become someone significant with studying, hard work and awareness (in order to not miss it). In the magical word if you didn't born with magical power, you have no chance to became powerful.

Every time I see this, its very obvious that the author either a) has some plot point they want to happen (planned or unplanned) or b) need some way to make the plot move forward or include unneccessary conflict.

Most often, I see these in stories where Harry (also Hermione) is rather talented/smart/powerful/clever/OP, but suddenly not, so conflict can happen.

** - Romantic relationships as the only major plot point in anything longer than 10 pages.
- Smut that's too wish-fulfilly. Smut can be good, but it needs to be set up well and the characters really need to be believable.
- OP Protagonist. Just don't. I can't enjoy conflict if there is no risk and no stakes. Watching the protagonist casually decimating the opposition while being snarky is really unsatisfying.
- Marriage contracts/soulbond stuff. To me this invalidates the entire relationship because there isn't any agency involved anymore.
- Pointless villainy. I have this gripe with canon too. Voldemort is just evil. That breaks my immersion.
- Focus on fashion. Description makes sense, but when there are entire paragraphs about people wearing certain brands the author considers 'hip', I'm out.
- M/M pairings. Nothing against homosexuals, but since this type of relationship has no appeal to me, I can't enjoy it unless it's /really/ well written and powerful on a human level.
- Harem.
- Bad English.
- Anime/Manga crossovers. In fact, crossovers in general. The isolated and self contained nature of the magical world is a big part of the atmosphere HP creates. That and merging multiple internally inconsistent magic systems is painful.
- Inconsistent magic. Canon suffers from this, but it doesn't go too in depth, using magic as a set piece rather than a subject most of the time, so it's fine.
- Mary Sue type protagonists.

Hm. If I may discuss... the uniqueness of the Wizarding World was why we all fell in love with the canon books and pictures, yes. But by now for most of us, it's lost that enticing bizarreness. We know the ins and outs of the Harry Potter universe; it is as familiar to us as the real world; sometimes more so in certain ways.

And the melding of inconsistent systems only needs to be suffered through if it's a crossover with another fantasy series (no issue at all in linkffn(Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard), for instance). Another easy way to avoid this problem is not to pretend like the two series always existed in the same universe, and instead make it dimension-travel, like in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20).

** I can't stand it when Hermione is called 'Mione' because 1. that's not her name, 2. that's not her nickname, and 3. Hermione is a Mary Sue nine times out of ten in the fic, and 4. I feel like people who use it in their stories haven't read the canon books in a long time and therefore they're more likely to have other over-used cringeworthy fan fiction tropes in their fics like Ron bashing or Draco in leather pants. I've also noticed some people will give Ginny the nickname 'Gin'....like are you serious? Ginny IS her nickname short for Ginevra. She doesn't need another fucking nickname.

I always nope out of harem and marriage contract stories for obvious reasons. I also can't read H/Hr because it is terribly written 98% of the time. I don't like the ship itself, but I'll read anything if it's well-written but it seems the H/Hr writers are shockingly bad compared to the other ships. Perhaps because it's a popular pairing in fan fiction it has more terrible stories because of the higher volume of fics it has in general? idk.

I also despise so-called '8th year' fanfics because they usually all follow the same ridiculous OOC formula. In 8th year there are conveniently no more Hogwarts houses, something which authors usually use as an excuse for Harry or Hermione to share quarters with and get close to 'poor little tortured victim' Draco and excuse all his past behavior all of a sudden. /eyeroll/

You can either assume that the universe is off-kilter and doesn't quite resolve consistently because it's a fun book universe---and then make your own additions to it equally off-kilter---or be relentlessly self-serious about it and have everyone grovel at the terrifying power of your hero's Logic.

** I nope out real quick at extremely smart Harry. He is not a nerd, he does not work hard at school, and he has a lot of shit going on in his life, so I don't buy that he suddenly becomes supersmart just because he killed Voldemort. I generally dislike it when characters (apart from Hermione) are good at every subject, because people have strengths/weaknesses and different areas of interests. I've seen a lot of "Draco is good at EVERYTHING except DADA" (essentially: Draco is Hermione) and "Luna is super-smart, and most of her outlandish beliefs are true", and I really dislike those. Harry has areas of expertise, but he's not good in potions, even after having Snape's book. Draco is probably good in Potions, possibly above average even in many subjects, but he is not a genius (his "wit" alone should be proof of this). Luna is inquisitive and wonderful, but there is no such thing as a crumple-horned snorkack.

And not supported in canon. And just no. Teddy's life is probably hard enough as is.). I particularly loathe any and all veela-fics, and most animagus-fics.

Also; A/B/O is problematic, and I avoid it when it's tagged. More problematic is the presence of similar (if not the exact same) dynamics, disguised as romance. It's one thing if an author is aware of using these conventions, as a kink-fic, but it worries me that so many people seem to have such a skewed view on romance/sexuality as to think that these dynamics are 'romantic' in a conventional sense.

** -Trying to hit the sympathy for the protagonist button right out the gates. I've lost count of how many sixth-year AUs made me quit in disgust five paragraphs in. Oh no, Sirius is dead, how sad. No need to break out the black eyeliner and razor blades son. Seriously, if he comes across as a bigger pussy than a lion animagus, you're doing it very, very wrong.

-The betrayal storyline. Seriously, never done right, never given proper thought, often shoe-horned into otherwise perfectly serviceable stories with an okay premise and decent plot ideas. Conspiracies take work people. It's not a conspiracy if it's just one guy/gal doing the conspiring.

Which ties neatly in with: -Bashing. Fuck. That. It wasn't fun to read in 2007. Eleven years hasn't changed that. Bash is basically 'okay, see you later' territory for me. It's just never really believable in context and the writer trying to establish scenes where the bashed characters do something to make pissing all over them believable invariably comes across as an 'am trapped up my own asshole. Send help' moment for the author. Bashing means I quit reading it. It also means that you probably should re-write it before it's too late and you do something like:

-Make the main ship a selling point. It isn't a selling point. Shipping is supposed to be secondary to the plot. That goes double for romance fics, given that a proper story does more to drive a relationship than sex as told from the perspective of somebody who transcribes Ikea manuals for a living. 'He inserted tab A into slot B and she gasped. That wasn't supposed to go there! What about the standard torque strength required to properly insert the tab? He would ruin her rifling for sure like this!'

I think the world shipping has turned out to be a tad too descriptive in retrospect. The characters are basically loaded onto a boat named HMS Harmony/Serenity/I have no plot and I must scream and told they're together now. No buildup, drama, anything, just 'suck it up, you're together now'.

It misses the point that relationships are also partnerships where the two work together and do things together that doesn't have an obvious and immediate relation to sex. It's the whole 'would they make a good parent' thing we look for in partners. Even if we are gay.

And on the subject -I don't mind characters being in a homosexual relationship. I do mind the shoe-horned HMS gay complete with Ikea sex manual thing. Now, every time I see the word Slash in a description, I slash it from my list. One too many buggering puns, thanks. The gems aren't worth the lurid descriptions about what moustashes feel like.

-Start from the beginning for no damn reason. Listen, the Harry Potter series is Long. Seven books, eight movies plus two ascended pieces of fanfiction (unless the Fantastic Beasts series gets really good, that is) is a lot of ground to cover and can easily swallow a decade's worth of work for a dedicated writer.

So when you start on day one of year one of series one, I am sorry but you're going to lose me unless you do something really really good. Which means:

-No more canon rehashes please. I can recite the stations of canon in my head . Which is annoying because I can't get then to rhyme very well. Do something different.

-Don't make your fuckups obvious. Tying up a last minute plot hole with a line of dialogue sounds tempting, but take a few mintues to look at what you're actually doing to your story before posting. Sometimes, that hole you just tied up was the main plot/premise of your fic. Be ready for many, many 'am I the only one that noticed X? Okay.' Comments afterwards.

-Try to beat a dead horse. When in doubt, rewrite. Like what I am going to have to do to all my fanfiction after five years. I could just continue on, but the holes are glaring at me and I need a better premise for all of them. Besides, I have so many ideas for making them better...

Trying to continue a story you started ages ago is something you can do. It's doing it well that's an issue. If, say, taking a totally random and not at all relevant to personal experience example, your external HD died three years ago, taking the backup notes with it, then it's best to just rebuild it better and smarter than ever.

Reading an old half-finished story that had pizazz, but just updated for the first time in years only to find the new stuff to be about as substantial as a Ubisoft sand-box game is pretty much a 'see you later' moment.

And on that note, I have writing to do. See you later.

Stuff that'll make me never want to read a fic includes:

- Mpreg. It's not biologically possible without either magic or changing canon so that one of the partners is Trans, and I never see the latter option employed. Reasons against using magic to enable mpreg are ably outlined in the Harry Potter/Sailor Moon/Ranma 1/2 fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]]. ^{Hint:} ^{If} ^{it} ^{were} ^{possible} ^{it} ^{would} ^{always} ^{have} ^{been} ^{possible,} ^{and} ^{if} ^{that} ^{were} ^{the} ^{case} ^{then} ^{wizards} ^{would} ^{have} ^{built} ^{an} ^{exclusively} ^{male} ^{society} ^{around} ^{it} ^{because} ^{mysogeny.}

- Certain straight pairings (usually Hermione with Draco, Snape or Voldemort). When a pairing is only possible because one or more of the characters are either written completely OOC or magically forced into things I lose interest immediately. (I firmly believe that canon Hermione would rather vomit all over Draco than kiss him, and you will never convince me otherwise).

- Almost any kind of M/M pairing. I don't mind Sirius/Remus, or Harry happening to be bi and finding a nice boyfriend, but you gotta earn that with good writing. Pairing Harry with either Draco or Snape because they're "bad boys" . . . from my persprctive, to make that work Harry basically has to be an entirely different character that just happens to have the same name as the original protagonist of the books.

- A fic centering on slavery or mind control, magically enforced or otherwise.

Stuff that'll get me to stop reading immediately includes:

- Discovering anything of the above list, if it wasn't included in the description.

- Bad grammar, punctuation and spelling will get me to leave a fic that I thought had a good/intriguing description.

- Stating that your fic is canon up until a certain divergance point, and including stuff from that point which you've pulled out your arse but portray as always having been there. I'm thinking particularly of a fic I tried to read recently which featured Harry suddenly /always having had/ in his trunk a high-security lockbox containing a terrarium and pet snake.

- A fic that features very young characters engaging in sexual situations. You bet your pederast ass that an 11 and 12 year old don't jump into intense romantic relationships like they're respectively 31 and 32.

- A fic that immediately derails and transforms into an exhaustive exploration of one very niche subject, for example a fic I once came across which was more an accountancy-style overview of Hogwarts' fungible assets and properties than it was a story.

I've seen other people here mention bashing certain characters, but I actually don't mind that so much. I'm not fond of Dumbledore nor the Weasleys, so when a fic is hard on them I go with it and put it down to being somewhat AU. I also don't mind soul bond fics, so long as the bond is forged by naturally formed feelings rather than having been because of destiny/because it was always going to happen. I'm an enormous fan of crossover fics, to the extent that I'm planning one of my own and reading several current ones, so an interesting crossover concept is pretty much garunteed to get me to start reading.

**** I wasn't talking about the books, but about the propensity for human cultures around the world to - as they develop - get stacked against women. I believe that if, from the start of humans being able to use magic, it were possible for men to propagate themselves without the involvement of women, they wouldn't have.

** Non-magical AU. I get there's a shitton of this out there, but I got into Harry Potter for the magic and stayed for everything else. I need some element of magic in my fic.

I also rarely give first person narratives a chance. I find that it is very hard for a lot of writers to capture canon personalities in first persons without just sounding like self inserts.

Lol lots on this sub sure loves to downvote when they don't agree with something 🙄
