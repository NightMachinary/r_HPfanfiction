Preferably fluff, but I'll take anything. I'm going through some tough times and I'm having a hard time focusing on books right now. I figured some romantic fics with my favorite pairing might at least distract me from my stress for a couple hours.


** I'm really picky about the Lucissa I like, but I read all kinds. These recs are definitely Lucissa based, but they may be a background/established rather than romance based.

linkffn(Frozen Hearts Melting) is Lucissa based and generally happy. Lucius has to renew his relationship with his wife.

I love the Lucissa in linkffn(Narcissa Militant). Narcissa is extremely overprotective of Lucius here and will defend him at all costs.

linkao3(6551137) is an interesting read, I like the dynamic between the two here.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.

  Lucius visits Death and is sent back to right some wrongs and fix his family and the Potter boy. Narcissa and he learn to trust not only one another but the outside world and find freedom in their choices. Lucius guides Harry but this isn't an adoption story, as he moves towards his destiny regarding not only Voldemort but Hermione. Rated T for now but it will be rising to M

  AU. Narcissa is actually the source of the Malfoy family's wealth---and not because she inherited the Black fortune, either. She's an in-demand spy and assassin. But now she's retired, and intent on using all her skills to make sure her baby boy gets what he wants. If that's Harry Potter, then Harry Potter he shall have.

*** Thanks, awesaum. I'm a bit picky about the Lucissa I like too. I read Narcissa Militant for quite a while, but I didn't enjoy their relationship after the first few books. There's just too much of a power difference between them, and I don't like that Narcissa can kill anybody, and she sometimes threatens his life. She comes off as abusive in the later books to me.

I'll check out the other ones! Really looking forward to it!

**** Yeah the imbalance between the two is weird but the inequality is eventually addressed so that their relationship becomes a lot more equal.

I tend to like Lucissa fics in which both have a real personality. A common trope is an abusive/unfaithful marriage between the two, or Narcissa being forced to marry Lucius in order to uphold the Black family honor. I think these scenarios are very unrealistic given what we see in their relationship in canon. I hate when Narcissa is completely meek and submissive in the entire story and Lucius basically controls everything. I come across this a lot but don't really enjoy it. I do like coming of age Lucissa stories.

There was a fic that I wanted to recommend but I can't seem to find it on FF.net anymore. The premise was that Lucissa just grew apart after Halloween 1981 and after ten years, when Draco heads off to Hogwarts, Lucius decides enough is enough and starts reconciling with Narcissa. A lot happens; they resolve a lot of misunderstandings and miscommunications and fall in love with each other again. The ending is really sweet, so it's a shame I can't locate it.

It's hard for me to find Lucissa I like, but I often enjoy its portrayal in other stories where it's not the main focus. One of my favorites is in [[https://www.deviantart.com/ls269/art/All-is-Full-of-Love-85632095][Sympathetic Magic]]. This link is to the first chapter. It's a Snevans fic but Lucissa is the second most focused pairing. It's really long and complicated!

Do you write any Lucissa?

***** Well, maybe I'll finish reading it then. That was the one thing that made me go sour on that fic (well, that and how overpowered Narcissa is compared to everyone else).

I cannot stand the abusive/unfaithful marriage trope. I really don't think that's the kind of marriage those two had either. I also hate it when Lucius and Snape do everything, and Narcissa is just window dressing. That tends to be pretty common, sadly, on fics where Harry gets adopted by the Malfoys. Narcissa is mummy, and does things like comfort the children, and Lucius just does everything else. So annoying.

That sounds like such an interesting fic! I hate when I can't find a fic I had enjoyed. There is one where Snape sends Lucius a letter about finding Draco and Pansy making out, and Lucius and Narcissa are reading the letter and sharing a carefree moment talking about their kid, then things get smutty. It was so lovely. I don't know why I didn't bookmark it.

I'll check out Sympathetic Magic. And thanks for recommending A New Beginning. It's so good! I love the small details, like Lucius's mother watching Draco from his mural and Narcissa being the wardmaster. Her characterization is spot on in my opinion.

If you haven't read it, try checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11496242/1/The-Walpurgis-School-for-Superior-Children][The Walpurgis School For Superior Children]]. It's not that long, but it's entertaining. I just love fics with toddler Draco and wish there were more of them. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3864413/1/The-Beginnings-of-a-Death-Eater][The Beginnings of a Death Eater]] is an interesting coming of age one, and it has two fairly long sequels, but while the sequels are good Snape stories, I do feel like it falls in the Narcissa does nothing while Lucius and Severus go on adventures category.

I wrote a Lucissa fic a long time ago. I believe about 10 years ago. It was in Portuguese though and I never got around to finishing it. I do have some ideas that I'm toying with these days, but nothing concrete yet, and things at work have been rough and stressful, so I haven't been writing lately. Do you?

****** Yeah with that fic it's kinda crack-y at times. I don't take it too seriously and I don't think the author does either. I appreciate Narcissa being ridiculously overpowered because I don't see enough of it.

I really wish there was more of A New Beginning. It was a great fresh take on a lot of tropes and the author did the story justice.

I'll definitely check out those recs!

I've never written fanfic before, but I have plenty of plot bunnies in my head!
