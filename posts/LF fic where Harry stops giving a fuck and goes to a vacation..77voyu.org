I have seen something similar to this with Sirius' last letter kind of thing and I'm looking for more. A fic where Harry stops giving a shit about the wizarding world and promptly leaves without telling anybody.

Of course getting rid of anything that could be used to track him. Maybe writing a letter for Voldie that Britain is yours, I stopped giving a fuck about them, do whatever you want. And I prefer if his vacation stays that way, without either Dumble and his cronies and voldie and his death munchers either able to find him.

I repeat, No finding Harry. He just enjoys his vacation without ever returning to Britain.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** linkffn(2889350). Bungle in the Jungle by jBern sort of fits this. Harry notices some wonky shit before the start of 5^{th} or 6^{th} year and nopes out of there. He leaves Britain, not to go on vacation exactly, but leaves behind almost every character from canon for a long while.
