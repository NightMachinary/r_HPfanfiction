  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** HPMOR doesn't seek to explain away magic with known physics, whoever told you this was misinformed. In fact, HPMOR explicitly states that magic /utterly and completely breaks/ physics as we know it. The explanation of what potions are, for example, is very compelling.

#+begin_quote
  Conservation laws. They'd been the critical insight in more Muggle discoveries than Harry could easily count. In Muggle technology you couldn't raise a feather one meter off the ground without the power coming from somewhere. If you looked at molten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the heat came from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals in the center of the Earth's molten core. If you asked where the energy to power the radioactivity came from, the physicist would point to an era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial supernova in the early days of the galaxy which had baked atomic nuclei heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressing protons and neutrons into a tight unstable package that yielded back some of the supernova's energy when it split. A light bulb was fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant, fueled by a supernova... You could play the game all the way back to the Big Bang.

  *Magic did not appear to work like this, to put it mildly. Magic's attitude toward laws like Conservation of Energy was somewhere between a giant extended middle finger, and a shrug of total indifference.* Aguamenti created water out of nothingness, so far as anyone knew; there was no known lake whose water level went down each time. That was a simple fifth-year spell, not considered impressive by wizards, because creating a mere glass of water didn't seem amazing to them. They didn't have the wacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that creating a gram of mass was somehow equivalent to creating 90,000,000,000,000 joules of energy. There was an upper-year spell Harry had run across whose literal incantation was 'Arresto Momentum!' and when Harry had asked if the momentum went anywhere else he'd just gotten a puzzled look. Harry had kept an increasingly desperate eye out for some kind of conservation principle in magic, anywhere whatsoever...

  ...and the whole time it had been right in front of him in every Potions class. Potions-Making didn't create magic, it preserved magic, that was why every potion needed at least one magical ingredient. And by following instructions like 'stir four times counterclockwise and once clockwise' - Harry had hypothesized - you were doing something like casting a small spell that reshaped the magic in the ingredients. (And unbound the physical form so that ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved smoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected that a Muggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothing but a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really was, the art of transforming existing magical essences. So you were a little tired after Potions class, but not much, because you weren't empowering the potions yourself, you were just reshaping magic that was already there. And that was why a second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at least get close.

  Harry had kept scanning through Moste Potente Potions, looking for something that might disprove his shiny new theory. After five minutes he'd flipped the older boy another Sickle (over his protests) and kept going.

  The potion of giant strength required a Re'em to trample the mashed Dugbogs you stirred into the potion. It was odd, Harry had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs weren't strong themselves, they were just... very, very crushed after the Re'em got through with them.

  Another recipe said to 'touch with forged bronze', i.e., grasp a Knut in pliers so you could skim the potion's surface; and if you dropped the Knut all the way in, the book warned, the potion would instantly superheat and boil over the cauldron.

  Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a second and stranger hypothesis. Of course it wouldn't be as simple as Potions-Making using magical potentials imbued in the ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the combustion potential of gasoline. Magic would never be as sensible as that...

  And then Harry had gone to Professor Flitwick - since he didn't want to approach Professor Snape outside of class - and Harry had told Professor Flitwick that he wanted to invent a new potion, and he knew what the ingredients ought to be and what the potion should do, but he didn't know how to deduce the required stirring pattern -

  After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and running in little circles, and Professor McGonagall had been called into the ensuing fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this case it was both acceptable and important for him to reveal his underlying theory, it had developed that Harry had not made an original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient that nobody knew who had first formulated it:

  A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients.

  The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the Re'em's strength that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire that had spawned the Ashwinder: all these potencies could be recalled, unlocked, and restructured by the spell-like process of stirring the ingredients in exact patterns.

  *(From a Muggle standpoint it was just odd, a deranged version of thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life ought to be fair. From a Muggle standpoint, the heat expended in forging the Knut hadn't gone into the bronze, the heat had left and dissipated into the environment, becoming permanently less available. Energy was conserved, could be neither created nor destroyed; entropy always increased.* But wizards didn't think that way: from their perspective, if you'd put some amount of work into making a Knut, it stood to reason that you could get exactly the same work back out. Harry had tried to explain why this sounded a bit odd if you'd been raised by Muggles, and Professor McGonagall had asked bemusedly why the Muggle perspective was any better than the wizarding one.)

*** Also, HPMOR doesn't get into the meat of this until maybe the last third or even quarter. So you'll have to suffer through 70 or more chapters of arrogance, wrong physics and a little boy lecturing scholars on why their subject shouldn't work as a thinly veiled excuse of the author to show off his own knowledge. You'll get scenes like:

/McGonnagal shifts into a cat/

"What the fuck! That's impossible! I hate it! This seperates conservation of energy, and the laws of Thermodynamics as well as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pascal's Wager!"

/McGonnagal is speechless, thoroughly lectured on why the magic she has been studying for decades is truly wrong and she has been wasting her life. She then goes to kill herself because Harry is the best ever at everything./

And that's one of like a thousand scenes like this.

MOR has its moments, like the early scenes with Quirell, but these are only tiny specks of gold in a massive ocean of garbage.

**** There are places that have a certain amount of what I'd call 'cringe' to them, yes, including the McGonagall cat scene. She doesn't go speechless and kill herself, though. She's just kind of amused and laughs at Harry for being so shocked, because to her it's normal. If you can't handle the main character being insufferable, that's totally fine. He's a child with, to put it in D&D terms, high INT and absolutely no WIS at all. That results in him brushing off more experienced people who know what they're talking about and actively sabotaging his own goals, which is brought up and acknowledged at points, especially during the end of the book, but you do indeed have to get through all the pages where it's played straight.

*** Eh, it depends on where your bar is. You don't consider MOR to incorporate Muggle physics into magic because many parts of that physics you take for granted as obviously a correct description of the universe - the idea that matter is composed of molecules made up of atoms, for example. So when you see molecules being relevant to transfiguration you don't see this as merging physics with magic.

For someone who thinks that the magical description of matter will likely accord more with alchemical descriptions of matter, or the ideas of Ancient Greek philosophy, then introducing molecules into transfiguration is very much an example of trying to explain HP magic with Muggle science.

***** She also described magic as a "dominant" gene when that is literally impossible.

When JKR uses scientific terms she does not mean them literally and I think her statements have to be read through the lens of scientific illiteracy if you want to understand her intended meaning. Basically, she uses scientific terms in a colloquial way rather than in a technical sense.

So, for example, when she says that magic is a dominant gene she means something like "magic is a strongly heritable trait which rarely fails to be passed on from a wizard to their child". She doesn't mean "there is a single magic gene for which there is a dominant magic allele and a recessive Muggle allele".

Even though she literally uses the word "dominant gene", I think it would be quite a stretch to interpret her as meaning the latter - that's just not the way JKR thinks.

So when JKR says transfiguration changes the molecules, I think you have to take a similar approach. What she is getting at is that magic changes the fundamental /stuff/ - what a thing actually is. She is saying it is a real change, not some kind of tactile illusion, and she is using real world "Muggle" terminology to explain the concept to "Muggles" in a way they will follow. But I very much doubt she is intending to say that McGonagall is teaching kids about molecules in transfiguration class, or that wizards understand transfiguration as occurring on that basis.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I'm not sure what you'll think of this rec, since it is an HPMOR sequel fic, but I wrote a story that fits what you're looking for:

--Harry figuring out how magic works, using his background in science, but not integrating the two disciplines

--No bashing

--Romance stuff

--Voldie takes a backseat in this one, but figuring out how to stop the villain requires study of magic

Anyways, here's the link if you wanna check it out.

I wish study of magic fics were more common, I enjoy reading them. Hope you find something you like. :)
