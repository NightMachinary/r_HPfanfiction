I just want to share this fic as I feel it deserves more exposure beneath all these corny and cliche stories with mindboggling hits and reviews, there is also a one-shot that serves as an epilogue to this, but I just started reading the longer one and its so good.

Be warned, there is sex and infidelity involved and can get pretty dark, but very worth the read, enjoy!

here is the link to the one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10588052/1/Coping-Mechanisms]]


** I really enjoyed these. H/Hr is a favourite of mine.

*** Whats that one about? I can't read it, its restricted to only members

and I've found another fantastic H/Hr fic, its called New Beginnings by MADharmony, that too is incomplete, but still the best.

**** After Voldemort's fall, Harry retires from Britain. A decade later, he is invited back, asked to save them against the new Dark Lady --- Hermione: after Harry left, things looked to be going back to business as usual, with Death Eaters and those involved in persecuting Muggleborns escaping justice /again/ and beginning to regain their political influence, so she ended up leading a violent resistance... Strongly recommended, despite being unfinished.
