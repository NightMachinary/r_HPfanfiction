Guys, I have written the first chapter of my very first fanfic. It's an Harry potter Pokémon Crossover. I have just published the first chapter. Rather than have Harry go to the pokemon world, I will attempt to mold the HP world to pokemon. Obviously there will be no magic, but the pokemon world is full of magic like abilities such as aura and psychic which I will attempt to integrate into my fic. It is a work in progress. I would be really grateful if you guys could read it and offer some suggestions. The link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13707669]]
