Looking for a metamorphamagus Harry that can turn into his mother perfectly. It's a 3rd year fic and Harry gets his own time turner or something. I've been looking for it a couple years now.


** It's chapter 18 of “The random craziness file” by Darklooshkin (linkffn(8222091)).

  Here's where I put all the great ideas I get. I hope you like them. Monologuing is such a cool thing to do sometimes.

** Hmm... I remember one where Harry lives in New York and has Tonks teach him how to control his metamorphism. Its eventually Harry/Tonks. Maybe someone knows what I'm talking about?

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

***** It isn't bad exactly, but the romance is rushed and meh, and Voldemort is a pathetic villain to the point of being a nonissue. If you like the pairing you'll probably read it just because it is complete, but it doesn't do anything particularly new and interesting.
