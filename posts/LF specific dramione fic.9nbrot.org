So I vaguely remember reading this dramione fic a few years back, it was a long fic with a lot of chapters, essentially hermione and draco fall in love at hogwarts and at the end of the fic, he ends up obliviating her. There was also a sequel to this where they both wound up as teachers at hogwarts when they were adults, I believe it was originally hosted on AO3? I'm not sure but I'd appreciate any help at all to find these fics, I really want to read them again!

  Nine years after Voldemort's defeat, Hermione decides to take a holiday from her life to work out who she is and what she wants to do with herself. She soon gets the feeling that Draco Malfoy might be the key to her salvation, but Draco seems to be consumed by a need to keep secrets that are destroying him and does not want her interfering. Armed with a determination to save someone who doesn't want to be saved, she sets out to see how he might fit into the oddly shaped puzzle that is her life. Sequel to Silencio. Betas: Dollfaced, MazVN and namelessamelie. Britpick: filigree1
