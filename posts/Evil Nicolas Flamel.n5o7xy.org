Is there any fic out there in which Nicolas Flamel is the ultimate bad guy?? Like he manipulated all major characters like Albus, Grindelwald and Voldemort. You know because he is bored, he is 600+ guys, what would he be doing.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards]] takes a while for him to appear buts he's freaking evil.

** He's pretty morally grey in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30478755][Sultan and Scheherazade are one]]. But he's trying to help his friend. Basically makes sure that Albus doesn't go down with Gellert by forcing some decisions to make Gellert leave Albus.

** Takes a bit to get there, as they have to unravel an entire conspiracy, but he is the big bad in [[https://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/darkly-loyal/][Darkly Loyal]]

Feels weird giving the mystery away like this lol but you asked, so <3 warnings for human sacrifice, lots of murder, mmf relationship and serious bashing (but there is a conspiracy, so it's not actually the usual tropes of bashing)
