FF.net has been my go-to for a while, but I've also read off of Portkey and fictionalley. Recently I've found a lot of really good one-shots from livejournal, and the writers on LJ have a really distinctive style. Where do you find fanfic to read?

*** I just checked it out and there's a lot more smut than ff.net (obviously with the restriction on MA fic) and even portkey, but the good thing is that there's few repeats from other sites. Thanks!

** I've always been pretty fond of [[http://www.patronuscharm.net/][Patronus Charm]], but their archive is absolutely tiny. It's mostly DLP stuff, though, so it tends to be decent. Other than that I just trawl FFnet, to be honest, because of the mess that is most other sites' search feature.

**** Ironically, just after I posted that I decided to go look at any new stuff that had been published...but I keep getting an error message when I go to the archive. Which is a shame... It's never done that before.

******* It was a problem with the DLP server which crashed, the first downtime in over 1400 days. Sounds like they're getting new hardware to fix it.

*** Hmm... I don't really mind reading in browser. I've been pretty happy with ff.net's sorting; it's much better than either portkey's or livejournal's. Are there any C3s on ff.net that have good complete fics?

**** No idea what you mean by C3s, sorry =/

The sorting is definitely better than the other sites, but I like being able to sort by word count, not just when it was updated or published. It's nice and all that I can pick a minimum word count, but even then it's not organized. I don't read in my browser if I have a choice because of battery life. I have one of the older e-ink kindles, so I can go a few weeks without charging it if I keep wifi off, and I'm not tempted to go off and do something else like Facebook or tumblr.

** For me, I go to the site that features a particular pairing such as:

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]] - for Snape/Hermione

[[http://dramione.org/][Hawthorn and Vine]] - for Draco/Hermione

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/index.php][The Hex Files]] - for Drarry

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/][Potions and Snitches]] - for Severitus (Snape is Harry's father or guardian/mentor only fics)

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]] - for Harry/Hermione

I go to fanfiction.net for general fics because I like their filter/sorting more than other sites and they seem to have the most number of fics. I don't go to AO3 much because I really don't care for their sorting. I also don't care for LJ's format either but a lot of great fics are found on both of those sites.

** harrypotterfanfiction.com

It's the oldest archive site on the net and has some amazing authors. You won't find any smut there, however.

Hawthorn & Vine I'll go to once in a while.

I need some new places, though! It's been hard to find really well-written stuff that's actually believable lately.

** I mainly use Archiveofourown.org (AO3) since I can't stand the search functions on ff.net.

If I'm recommended a story on ff.net I'll read it there, but if I have to find something new for myself I'll always go to AO3.

*** Yeah I've seen quite a few praises of AO3, but one thing about ff.net is that they have a LOT... many fics I've seen first on LJ, portkey, or fictionalley are also on FF... AO3 does sound like a promising site though.

**** There is stuff on there that's not on FF.net, but most authors do crosspost. You'll sometimes find alternate, mature versions of fics on AO3 that wouldn't be allowed by FF.net's policy on explicit material, but then again, that's not everyone's cup of tea.

Another one that I don't think has been mentioned is The Petulant Poetess, which is also pretty good.
