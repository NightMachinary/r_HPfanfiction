** Hmmm...honestly what it sounds like you want is a Harry who is overpowered, but has a tragic background, sympathetic I guess.

/'Oh my goodness, that sweet boy has had so much tragedy in his life! But he's so mature and grown up. Just listen to him acting all superior to Dumbledore like a fourteen-year old who thinks he knows how the world works.'/ (You know like every teenager does until they wreck their parents car).

But more seriously, here are some contenders:

linkffn(Core Threads): God-like Harry

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): pimp Harry is masterminding the time-stream.

I /think/ this works linkffn(Worth of Magic), but its been a while. Definitely OP though.

linkffn(Learning to Breathe): takes the Harry training to beat Voldemort trope (rarely done well as it is) and stretches that to its limit.
