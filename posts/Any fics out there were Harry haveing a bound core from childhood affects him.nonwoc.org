In most of the fics I've read when someone learns that Harry's core was bound they are immediately shocked and appalled but harry always turns out fine and magically powerful

So any fics were it's the opposite were it actually affects his life some how even if his core got unblocked it would be like a new extra limb appearing amd you got no idea how to use it


** A good way to fix the unbound core = over powered problem is to actually make it a problem. By which I mean, Harry having his core unbound makes him dangerously overpowered to the point that his magic is nearly uncontrollable. The story could then be about what he does to mitigate that problem, and eventually learning how to use his power to have that big epic final showdown or whatever with the chosen antagonist.

For example, I could imagine him needing to using magic suppressing items to limit his power output. You could then have scenes where he could literally remove his limiters, and then show the cost of doing so.

This would let the writers have the OP!Harry they want, but make it so that this Harry still has to work to earn that.

*** See this is a good idea harry getting magic unbound and immediately understanding how to use it is my biggest pet peeve he would have to go through something like physical therapy but for magic
