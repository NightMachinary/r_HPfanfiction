I'm just interested in Harry having different friends. I get tired of Hermione and Ron.

I'd prefer them to be LONG fics, any rating (no PWP pls), and stray from canon. I'd like if they went in an interesting direction too.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived) and Linkao3(Train To Nowhere) are both set in Durmstrang with OC's as Harry's friends.

Just about any Slytherin!Harry fic would also fit your request.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

Pretty much hangs out with the three girls. Well, 2+1 anyway. It's a Harry/multi though, which doesn't float everyone's boat. And it is WIP, though active.

Yeah, had to look up PWP. lol

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

** Linkffn(10758358)

Gryffindor Harry but he's one year older so he's friends with Cho and Cedric. I remember unexpectedly liking this story so much I set off to find other fics where Harry's friends with Cedric and Cho. Besides the different trio, it's a really good AU that I don't want to say more about at the risk of spoiling anything

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
