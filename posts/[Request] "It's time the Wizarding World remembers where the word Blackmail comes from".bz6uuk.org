From "Black Vengeance" linkffn(7254667)

Looking for any fics (as usual, ideally completed) where the trope of "The black family was used to being the power behind the throne" trope is used/abused by Sirius. Intimidation, threats and even blackmail are fair game, as long as it's to defeat Voldemort.

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!

*** Black sky was decent at the beginning, if a slight drag.... but oh my god I can't with pretty much everything after chapter 50 (maybe? Or maybe earlier).

It drags. So. Bad.

I wasn't really considering it, since it's unfinished, but now, well...

***** Oh, it's still being updated pretty regularly. But it's also on chapter 327. I think it's also no longer set within the world of HP.

It's also (spoiler) one of those stories where the main character is pregnant at fifteen and it just gets weirder from there

**** Curious, but is this a Harry gains a lot of power(magical, and/or political), and proceeds to stomp the setting, or even just stomp He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I ask, because the summary gives off that type of vibe. I'm not against it, but i'd like to know what i'm jumping into with a story with more words than minutes in a year.

***** Not even gains, it's more always had---it diverges from the very minute he (she) was born, and never goes back on track. Harry-as-Dorea is raised as part of a very powerful Black family as a proper pure blood young lady (take that as you will) with decently powerful magic. I don't remember how Voldemort was defeated or anything that happened with that. It wasn't really part of the story.

It spends a lot of time in its crossover world.

****** Speak not his name. Speak not his name. In all seriousness, if Voldemort is an after thought, she's probably OP.

******* As I recall she wasn't OP, or at the very least incredibly ridiculous with it---it was more political, and by chapter 50 or so (or less since I don't know where I dropped off) it was became a fanfiction about the crossover series. Voldemort wasn't necessarily an after thought because he was easy to defeat (again, take that with a grain of salt, since I don't fully remember), but because the story was more accurately a Kateyko Hitman or whatever it was fanfiction.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
