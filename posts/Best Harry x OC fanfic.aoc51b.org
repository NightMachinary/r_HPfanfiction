  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** I rather doubt that. The idea of some girl who goes to durmstrang and uses dark magic, sure. But there's not a chance in hell whoever wrote that story could pull off ANY character to the level Calypso is.

***** Taking a character from another story and (arguably) writing a better version of her doesn't mean she wasn't taken from another story.

****** Agreed. Arguably, most stories in general are iterations of old stories. Think of Pride and Prejudice (ugly but smart girl gets the desirable guy) and Romeo and Juliet (two people who want to be together but can't because circumstances).
