  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Apparently, Percy Weasley marries some girl named Audrey. It's a reasonably popular idea to make her a muggle girl. Here's a couple with that idea. Linkffn(7586229) Largely takes place during the seventh book. Linkffn(12373273) Companion piece to another story but I read it without reading the original story fine.

** Most of my stories revolve to some extent around Sirius's relationship with a Muggle. They don't get married though. Sirius doesn't strike me as the marrying sort.
