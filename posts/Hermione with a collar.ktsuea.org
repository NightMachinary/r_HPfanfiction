*** That's probably not the kind of collar they want to read about - it's like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_collar][Livery Collar]]. Not a slave collar.

**** I actually did read your story it was quite good! I am actually looking for any kind of collar story I never knew about Livery Collars tbh. In a way I am also looking for an old fic that I had read... All I remember of it is Hermione was stuck as a cat girl and Draco had written a letter to his father about her being a creature and Lucius came to the school to take her away Harry being forewarned had claimed her as a pet but didn't know about having to collar her...

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery%20collar][Livery collar]]*

A livery collar or chain of office is a collar or heavy chain, usually of gold, worn as insignia of office or a mark of fealty or other association in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. One of the oldest and best-known livery collars is the Collar of Esses, which has been in continuous use in England since the 14th century.

  Second Year AU. After Hermione is disowned by her magic-hating parents, the combination of a Life Debt and Harry's promise to always care for her leads to our favourite couple finding themselves in an unusual relationship and making the very best of it with the help of their friends and two sympathetic professors. Yes, Hermione wears a collar, but this is in every way a safe, sane, consensual, and age-appropriate relationship between decent people who love each other, with absolutely no humiliation, coercion, or violence and no activities more sexual than kissing and snuggling. Still, if that particular kink bothers you, you might want to go and read "On a Bright Summer Morning," "Hufflepuffs and Harmony," or "Summer of the Bundling Charm" instead.
