I have several in-progress stories that I want to stay committed to, but it's hard not to get distracted and go chasing after shiny new ideas. Any tips or tricks to keep oneself on track?


** Gather a small group of enthusiastic HP fans around you who share your outlook on the world, characters, etc. Discuss your story with them. Not only do these discussions result in ideas you may have never considered on your own, they also help (re)invigorate your interest in your own story.

The sub's Discord could be one place to start.

** Write your "shiny" ideas down. Usually you'll realize that you don't have much before you run into an obstacle and ditch the story. I have around 40 of these plot bunnies on my GDrive and maybe 5 will go somewhere, the others exist as a proof that the idea behind them didn't go anywhere.

** I don't struggle so much with the writing, but I'm really finding it difficult to keep on posting a fic which has no reviews at all. I want to see it finished even though it's demoralising but, yeah, it's hard.

*** I've found so many great fics where the authors abandoned them because they didn't get enough reviews/follows/whatever - don't give up just because no one's found it yet. Also I'm sure lots of people would search for complete fics who wouldn't care about an in-progress for that very reason, that so many do end up abandoned and they don't want to start something with no end.

Hang in there! We can do this.

** Instead of throwing an idea into something new, incorporate it into an existing work. If it really needs it's own story, sit on it until you've finished a different one and if you still want to go after it then do so.

** I tend to work on one main story at a time. I keep a document full of story ideas so I don't forget anything, and I usually allow myself to have one or two procrastination projects, which are fics I'll work on when I hit writer's block on my main one.

** Sometimes, when you're stuck, it's better to distance yourself from it just for a while. Don't force yourself through the lack of motivation, cause you'll only burn out from that. Give it a rest for a while, and get back to it later with a fresh mind and new inspiration.
