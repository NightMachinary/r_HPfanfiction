I'm beginning to tear my hair out even more than I already have been trying to find for a couple of days now, and my google-fu is failing me in a major way.

It was a Harry/Draco slashfic, I think a couple years old now. Draco focused, but written in the third person. I remember the general plot -- Draco was in... Egypt, I want to say -- selling artifacts and dating some married Arab man. He eventually left there after the Arab man was proposing to leave his wife, and acting stupid in public, and went to -- Greece, I think? He hooked up with some younger guy, then eventually made his way to Britain, where Harry was in St. Mungo's. I think there was something wrong with Harry's magic?

Anyway, Draco faked being a reporter, and he kept being selected as the one reporter that Harry would allow to interview him for that day over and over again.

The rest is fuzzy. I can't remember the names of any of the side characters, or my searching would probably work better.

Please help, if you can.


** If no one here can help you, you can try posting this over at [[http://accio-hd-fics.livejournal.com/][Accio Harry/Draco Fics]] on LiveJournal (need a LJ account to post, I believe). Good luck!

If you remember any specific phrases, that will help quite a bit. Be aware that there's a risk that the fic isn't up anymore.
