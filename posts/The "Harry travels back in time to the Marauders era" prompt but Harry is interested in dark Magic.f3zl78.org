I really like these fics when Harry travels back to the marauders era and befriends James and Sirius and Remus but what if for once Harry travels back and impresses the Death Eater brigade by being interested/well versed in dark Magic and with his parseltongue abilities.

It could be (post-war) Harry meddling with some ritual he found in the Black library maybe because he wants to save Sirius from Death and therefor turned to the dark Arts and became interested in it during his research. Or Harry wants to be able to fight like the Death Eaters to have a better chance in dueling. Maybe he is simply interested in it or wants to research his curse scar.

I don't care if Harry befriends the marauders or not but I simply wanna see a little bit darker Harry who has the potential to impress Lucius Malfoy (and Snape and Regulus?) with his abilities. Be it dark Arts or maybe even a cunning Slytherin side.

If somone wants to write it please have a go with this prompt and link the fic you are writing (I'd be thrilled to read it) and if you know of a similar fic that already exists please link it too. Thank you :D


** linkffn(time to spare by emysabath) is just what you want. Great and well-written fic.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** I've only read one of these, where he makes a wand with some dark spell and reanimates a rooster, but I can't remember the title. I'll poke around, see if I can find it.
