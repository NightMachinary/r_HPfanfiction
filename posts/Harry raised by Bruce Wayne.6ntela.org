  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!

  After facing an ancient enemy too powerful for even their mighty corp, the Green Lanterns are no more. In a desperate gambit to ensure the survival of the power of will, the last guardian entrusts his power to one boy. A boy burdened with a destiny that will shake the very foundation of magic. Inspired by "Harry Potter and the Power of Oa"
