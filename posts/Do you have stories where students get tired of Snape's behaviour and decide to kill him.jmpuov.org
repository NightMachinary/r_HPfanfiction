** Even without murder, it would be satisfying to read about how students decide to gang up on him.

"One day, the Hufflepuffs had decided: enough was enough. Joined by Neville and the Weasley twins..." etc. There's a fun prompt.

*** lol Neville's potions accidents aren't accidents, one of these days Snape will be caught in the crossfire and get exploded messed up potion all over him with who knows what effects?

And no one would say anything because it's normal Neville in potions.

  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I imagine this as sort of a cross between Heathers and John Tucker Must Die. Even so, there are two interesting ways to take that idea. Are they devout students wanting to kill him to get a better teacher? Or are they fangirls crushing madly on what they see as a broody, byronic man who ignores and belittles them at every turn?

I can see both being fun. And I really love the idea of Snape having a bunch of students sighing in his wake. :D

Ravenclaws - "He didn't even mark me down for misspelling cauldron! Does he not care? Can he not spell?"

Lovers - "Condolences about Lily? Who the hell is Lily?!?!"

**** Even the most terrible or dislikeable people find love too. :)

And to be fair, I imagine Snape would feel much the same about having students coo obsessively and adoringly over him. Whatever version of him people ascribe to, none of them strike me as particularly desirous of that sort of attention. :D
