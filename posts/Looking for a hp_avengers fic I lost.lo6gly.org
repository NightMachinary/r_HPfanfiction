:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a fic and forgot to favorite it and I lost it. I remember it was Harry in the Avengers universe. He had white hair for some reason, worked for shield before joining the avengers. Went by the name Grim. It was pretty long(60+ chapters) and still updating. Harry was in a relationship with Natasha and Sif. Had a super dog named Padfoot. It was on ffn. I hope that is enough to find it. It was a pretty good story and I would like to see how it ends up. Thanks ahead of time for any and all help.
