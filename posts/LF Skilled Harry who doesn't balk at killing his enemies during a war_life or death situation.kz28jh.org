Hi all. Looking for stories where harry isn't tossing only stunners around. I get tired of reading stories where harry beats a group of death eaters and some of them show up again after miraculously escaping custody.

I prefer it to be less hogwarts focused and more harry being out there training and fighting in the war.

No slash/harem

Thanks in advance!

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** It's not Harry that's doing so, but I do have a fic written that does something like that, mostly Megan Jones one of the unused original 40 getting involved in some of the year 5 issues. I've only put the first chapter on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] right now as Winds of Phoenix Fire and Snake Ash Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13796783/1/Winds-of-Phoenix-Fire-and-Snake-Ash][13796783]]), full thing on Google Docs at: [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1435qbl3vg6c4IkmqFzOXSmTKMwrfgLJk/view?usp=sharing]]. Chapter 6 and 7 result in a number of DEs eating death in the form of supersonic lead slugs among other things.

  Harry Potter AU. Entering her fifth year at Hogwarts, Megan Jones found a teacher unwilling to teach, a student intent on ignoring the law for her own 'study group' and a returned terrorist. Funny, she had thought she had done enough against terrorists for a while, especially with exams, bullies and the side effects of government stupidity to deal with, at least she has experience.

**** Oh, right! Well i dont usually go for slash either but its pretty mild, so if op is fine with that id still recommend it. There arent any sex scenes (i think they might be included on the ao3 version) and the relationship is really not central to the story.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
