The trelawney prophecy /one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches../ never did name the Dark Lord and only the chosen one can stop the other.


** He considered the implication of that prophecy in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), and decided not to mark his followers. Neville was fully supporting him though and acting as his public face.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** That's kind of what he did when he said "Kill the snake". He's effectively transferring the destruction of the Horcruxes, a task that he considered his most important duty, over to Neville. He also acknowledged that Neville was the leader of the DA. That plus all the cheering up that Harry does towards him (saying he's worth more than Malfoy, considering him as a friend, etc) can easily be seen as Harry marking "him as his equal".

EDIT : However, as pointed by [[/u/will1707][u/will1707]] I'm not sure how Neville's parent may have defied Harry... Did they thrice refuse to hand him sweets or his favorite toy when he was a child ?

**** I could see it working as a sort-of new prophecy, but the original one could not really work.

***** Maybe it could be something stupid, and insignificant. Like, not giving him toys when he was still a baby. Kind of crackish though

****** "Wait... the prophecy said that my parents had to defy you three times... how does that work?" Neville asked, confusion written on his face as he gripped his wand, aiming it at the Dark Lord and Wizarding Traitor, Harry Potter.

As the Final Battle of Hogmeade was going on around them, Harry considered this question, frowning as he did so. Neville waited with a breath, before Harry took a step forward, and answered:

"Your parents knew me... and probably visited my parents. They probably didn't give me toys or candy three times in a row or something silly like that."

Neville's confusion went, as he thought of that answer... it seemed logical, "Oh... wow."

*** Harry was hugely influential on Neville, that isn't the part that's difficult to reconcile.
