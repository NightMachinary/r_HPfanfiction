I had read some stories of Harry living in the woods and being just him who survive in the woods and that Dumbledore finds him. And I wanted more stories where Harry lives in the forest for awhile then go to Hogwarts wild (doesn't have to be exactly like this just q plain idea on what I mean)

** I believe you're looking for linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them). It has a sequel, but I can't remember if it was ever finished. Their was also the story where Harry stole the sorting hat and went to live in a forest. I believe its Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone, but my memory is pretty shaky.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
