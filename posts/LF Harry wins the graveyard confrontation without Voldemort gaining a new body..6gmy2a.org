Ok, so I find the following very grating:

1) Harry mind controls the dragon

2) Harry parts the lake like moses to get his hostage

3) The hedges of the maze jump out of his way in fear

4) God!Harry loses a deul to Peter Pettigrew and ends up tied to a gravestone.

So far the only fic that's different is Blindness


** Yeah, this is a plot point where divergences are ignored and things are forced back onto canon rails.

Even if Harry was just a little less injured and fatigued at the end of the third task he could put up a decent fight against Pettigrew.
