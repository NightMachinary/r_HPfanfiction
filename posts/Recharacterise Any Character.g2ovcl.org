*/If you could recharacterise any character, who would it be? And how would they now act? And what changes would you see in the story?/*

I like the idea of Harry being this uber polite child, maybe a bit reserved, who tries to do his best yet not draw too much attention to himself.

A byproduct of the Dursley's constant belittling of him turning him into a perfectionist who is legitimately terrified of messing up (a bit like Hermione, except stemming from actual abuse and trauma).

It would obviously change how he approached class, but I like to think it would lead to a more interesting phenomenon with teachers that don't like him, as well as in subjects he's not very good at. Particularly Snape and Umbridge.

I'd love Harry to be this aloof, socially awkward honours student who gets dragged into situations where he is out of his depth and still expected to perform. Really requiring Ron, Hermione etc. to almost put him back together as he focusses on his failures in the aftermath (would make Cedric and Sirius's death all the more painful)

I understand there's a bit of a stigma towards OOC characters, but I think if they are appropriately explored they're inherently interesting. Especially if they are, in a way, feasible.


** Ron is the 6th son. After Bill the genius curse breaker, Charlie the dragon tamer, Percy with perfect grades and a promising future in politics and the twins who are extremely well liked and smart enough to invent multiple magical (prank) items, it's his time to shine. Instead of an Ron that doesn't try because all has been done before, we get a Ron that desperately tries to find something he can excel at. We could have an Ron that seems to switch from interest to interest every couple of months till he finds an magical field that clicks with him. Or an jack of all trades that never really clicks with any field. It would make Ron/Hermione a little more interesting. Hermione could recommend random magical fields she read about, just so that he can give the field a go. Or Ron could show some random obscure magical skill only for Hermione to obsess over it because she never heard of it.

I also like impossibly humble Harry. The Dursleys ingrained the want to be normal into Harry. So much so that he didn't notice himself teleporting on a roof, or didn't think it was strange that he could talk to snakes. Or only found his hair regrowing in a single day a little weird. This Harry assumes that the weird and random shit that happens to him happen to everyone. He's just Harry after all. So he'll casually talk about killing a basilisk, because hey, what 12 year old hasn't? I'd like this if this was the case with a powerful Harry who often uses advanced magic without noticing that it is advanced.

** I like OOC characters /if/ we're told why. Helpful adults pre-Hogwarts are a common plot device and can be done well - what if a teacher/neighbor/etc. showed Harry something that made him think differently. Esama's Business is a good example linkao3(business by esama). What if a librarian gave him a copy of Sherlock Holmes at just the right (wrong) moment? How does that change him? The Arithmancer is another good example linkao3(the arithmancer by white squirrel). What if Hermione was a math nerd instead of a book nerd? How does that change the story?

If I were going to re characterize someone... I'd make Harry a nerd. Because the world is fascinating, but the canon glosses over everything with its jock Gryffindor's POV. I wanna know /why/ potions work - is it chemical reactions, symbolism, intent...? Do the students study Ancient Runes because it's a written form of magic or because it's the language Merlin wrote in? What are they learning in astronomy that it's mandatory for five whole years and yet canon!Harry never uses it?

It'd be pretty easy to make nerd Harry fit into canon. The library is a safe space where Harry sits in plain view and Dudley gets kicked out for being loud. Instead of making him another Hermione, I'd have him take a special interest in something - maybe he reads a Nat Geo on the Egyptian pyramids and goes from there into reading about archaeology or architecture or ancient religions. Or snakes is a good one! He gets interested in a talking garden snake, looks up info on them, and from there gets interested in zoology or ecology or serpent mythology.

By the time the Hogwarts letter came, he'd do better in most classes (because the library isn't a chore) and he'd be excited about the magical version of whatever his special interest is. I'd also do a compare/contrast with Hermione, who writes six drafts of her essays until she gets it ðŸ’¯ perfect, versus Harry, who maybe does an outline before his only draft (which is barely over minimum length) and then studies the fun class for the rest of his time. Again, I'd do this as a means to keep from just writing Harry as a male Hermione.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

** Tom Riddle Jr. Agoraphobic. Can't go to school if you have to leave the safety of your... orphanage?

I think I just beat the system or something.

ANYWHO~

Adult Dursleys > alcoholics. They get into a car accident coming home from dinner while drunk, and only Petunia survives, but is a quadriplegic. Dudley goes to Marge. Dumbledore sticks Mrs. Figg there to take care of Harry and Petunia. And a shitload of cats. This leads to Harry not being such a pushover. Or so meek. Or abused. That, and I want to see dementors get mauled by a herd of kneazles.

This is the best. Petunia suffers, Harry gets a somewhat decent childhood, and the blood wards. EVERYBODY WINS (except Petunia).
