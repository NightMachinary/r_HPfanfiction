So I reme,ber it was Bellatrix who had a kid and it turned out to be Neville. The light had stolen kids from the dark and put them with light families. Bellatrix had attacked the longbottoms because she found out they had her son..she went crazy cause her son was stolen. Idk the pairi g or anything g else about it, just that there were other kids who had been taken as well.


** This sounds like many of the story's where harry hermione (or luna) and Neville are all stolen I would honestly just look up "Neville is bellatrix Lestrange son fanfiction" see what you get
