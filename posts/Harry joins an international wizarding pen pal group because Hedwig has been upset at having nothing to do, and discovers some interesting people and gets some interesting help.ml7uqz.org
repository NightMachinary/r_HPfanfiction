Hedwig is a post owl. And not just any post owl, but the best post owl! And while she dearly loves her ~owlet~ owner and appreciates the as-of-yet uncompleted challenge of getting his hair to lie flat she had a proud heritage to uphold!

And so, while returning from delivering one of the rare letters between her owner and his friend with the somehow even more unruly hair she stops by some of the usual resting places to seek advice from some of the older owls who've been at this for decades and have accrued a wealth of wisdom. Luckily old man Gahoole had seen that the Orthagon Alley owlery had a signup sheet for an international pen pal exchange. All Hedwig had to do was take a small detour, which was acceptable as she had no return mail, snatch one or two of the sheets, and pester her owner until he complied with her wishes.

** Somehow, Harry ends up in touch with Gellert Grindelwald as his pen pal. Everything is going well, until Hermione reads who the letters Harry has been getting are from. Due to Harry not paying attention during Binn's History of Magic, he had no idea that he was corresponding with a war criminal.

******* Still longest time he spent without having to deal with it, so he begins doing the ritual with the same frequency as sane people cut their hair... on an unrelated note Voldemort now is starting to look more like a pushover the older Harry gets, why, just in their last death-match Harry managed to kill him with a minor banishing charm, he wasn't even /aiming/ it at Voldemort, the idiot just apparated in the path of the butterbeer he was trying to send Neville.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** "Professor Dumbledore! Harry's been writing to Grindelwald!" exclaimed Hermione, rushing over to the headmaster's table.

Instead of anger or surprise, Dumbledore only smiled. "Has he now? How is he, Harry? How's prison life treating him? I do hope he isn't getting too bored over there."

Harry beamed and replied, "Oh, he's doing great, Professor! He's just told me about how you two almost ran over someone named Bathilda Bagshot when you were young!"

Dumbledore leaned back in his seat, a wistful look on his face. "Ah, those were the days..."

Scandalized, Hermione exclaimed, "Professor!"
