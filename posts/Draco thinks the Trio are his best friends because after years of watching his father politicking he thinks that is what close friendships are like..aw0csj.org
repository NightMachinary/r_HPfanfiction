** +"So how's your relationship with Potter and friends?" asked the forgettable guidance counselor Madam Madeup Onthespot.+

+"I think it's going well. They set my favorite teacher on fire, I send their favourite member of staff to azkaban. I threaten their lives, they kidnap my goons. They take a house-elf I take a hippogriff. It's been great fun."+

+"What about your relationship with Parkinson?"+

+"I dont think its going well, I threaten her family all the time but not once has she implied that my father is a Death Eater."+

Edit: a revision

"Do you know why you were called here Mr Malfoy?" asked the forgettable guidance counselor Madam Madeup Onthespot.

Draco thought for a moment before he replied "It's my relationship with Parkinson isn't it?"

Madam Onthespot shook her head "If you want to talk about that later we can. No, the reason I called you here is your relationship with Misters Potter, Weasley, and Miss Granger."

Draco looked confused "why are we talking about my best friends?"

"Your best friends? Elaborate for me please."

Draco's face broke out in a rare expression for him, not a smirk but a full blown smile. "Oh they truly are my best friends. I have tones of fun with the game we play. I imply their of poor breeding and Granger takes it as a challenge. What do I get in the mail a week later? A ten foot report on how inbred my mums line is. Potter tricks my father into releasing a house-elf? I trick my father into arranging a sham trial for a hippogriff. But the most fun we had was around the chamber of secrets. I imply slytherins monster is coming for them, what do they do? Not only do they kidnap my goons and impersonate them, they track the monster down and kill it just to show my threats were meaningless to them."

Madam Onthespot didn't like what she was hearing. 'I quit my job as a criminal psychologist at the D.M.L.E. to get away from cases like this!' To give her some time to think she redirected the conversation "let's get back to your relationship with MIss Parkinson."

Draco's smile vanished "I dont think its going well, I threaten her family all the time but not once has she implied that my father is a Death Eater."

*** Madam Onthespot scribbled a note down on her clipboard. "Would you like it if Miss Parkinson started insinuating that your father was a Death Eater?"

Draco nodded. "We'd get on better if she would, I think. Father has his fellows from the Board of Governors over for dinner all the time, and they always say 'Oh, yes, I agree' and 'Excellent idea, as usual' to whatever he says. It's a bore; frankly, I don't know how he stands it. Mr. Weasley on the other hand..."

"Yes?"

"Well, Father's always going on about the ginger weasels, how he's collected enough votes in the Wizengamot to put Weasley on his toes, how he can't wait to see Mr. Weasley at work in the morning to tell him about it. /That/ sounds much more interesting. Father never acts like that around anyone else but Dumbledore."

Madam Onthespot frowned. "You don't think it's a bit... antagonistic, do you?"

"Of course not," Draco declared confidently. "Mother says the most important part about building strong relationships is to get the other side to respect you."

** In response to both the prompt by [[/u/bonsly24][u/bonsly24]] and the comment from [[/u/midasgoldentouch][u/midasgoldentouch]]:

“Potter, I need a word.”

Harry jerked out of the trance he was in. Writing reports late at night in the DMLE did that to him. He'd zone out of the world around him, only focused on reliving what had happened that day and putting it into words succinctly enough that he wouldn't be forced to rewrite it the next day. He turned around to see the least likely person standing next to his cubicle.

“Malfoy, I didn't know you worked back this late,” he said, adjusting his collar as he lent back in his chair. He checked the clock out of the corner of his eye. Almost a quarter past eleven. He really needed to get home earlier himself.

“I don't but I know that you do and so I thought this would be the best time to chat.”

“Chat? Is there something in particular you wanted to talk about? I'm kind of trying to get my reports done so I can catch a few hours of sleep tonight.”

“Of course, of course,” Draco said. He made his way into the cubicle and sat down on Harry's desk right next to where Harry's chair was leaning. Harry's eyebrows shot up and he adjusted his chair to face Draco. “You see, we just never get any chances to talk anymore like we did in school. I miss it, you know. Hopefully, with what I want to talk about today, we'll get more chances to chat again.”

“I see.” Harry really didn't. “And what is it exactly that you want to talk about?”

“Oh yes,” said Draco. “I'm not sure if you're aware as, as previously stated, we don't talk much anymore, but I'm engaged.”

“Congratulations,” said Harry. He hadn't been aware. “Who's the vict-, the lucky witch?”

“Astoria Greengrass. Not sure if you remember as you only really hung out with me from Slytherin, but her sister was in our year too. You know, the blonde girl who sat with Pansy. Daphne's her name. Astoria was a couple years younger and I don't think you ever really spoke at all.”

Harry nodded slowly, scrambling his brain. “I don't recall Astoria though I know who Daphne is.”

“Of course,” said Draco, looking as though he was trying to reassure Harry. “As I said, you only ever really hung out with me so I don't expect you to remember at all. I'd have been quite offended if you'd forgotten about me though, Potter.”

Harry chuckled along with Draco, keeping a fake smile plastered on his face. Seriously, what was going on?

“Anyway, as I was saying, I'm now engaged to Astoria and the wedding is set for next May. I know it's a fair way in advance but I have no idea of your schedule and wanted to make sure you could make it.”

“Make it to the wedding?”

“Yes.”

“I, well, I see no reason I couldn't. I can't say I was expecting it but I can come.”

“Of course I would want you there. There's nobody else I've had such a good friendship with. I want you there beside me on this most important day.”

“Beside you?”

“Well, that's where the best man normally stands, Potter. Don't play daft.”

“You're having me on, aren't you?” Harry had had quite enough of these mind games that Draco was playing now. He glared at Draco. “Whatever you're playing at, you'd better bloody knock it off.”

“Well, that's some way to acknowledge someone asking you to be their best man,” said Draco. “Seriously though, who was as close as friends as us? I'd say we're as close as Father and Mr Weasley, though I have personally been comparing that friendship with mine and Ron Weasley's friendship so I can feel like I've got a Weasley of my own like Father did. I normally compare us to Father and Dumbledore. Always at each other's throat, ready to punish any tiny error and forcing the other to be a more perfect version of their self. The continual banter and sharing of ideas with good discussions about pros and cons.”

“Sharing of ideas?” The conversation had taken another twist for the crazier and Harry didn't know what to think.

“Yes, an essential part in any healthy friendship. All through school, when I felt like I wanted to get some feedback, I'd bounce my ideas off you three. Like when I wasn't sure whether Hagrid was worth keeping as a gamekeeper or whether to get him fired after the incident with the hippogriff. You guys shot down the idea quickly and pointed out his worth. Though I do wish Granger would learn to use her words rather than her fists.”

“That's what you're calling sharing ideas?”

“Well it's how Father and Dumbledore have always kept each other sharp. Father would push for something to happen and Dumbledore would shut him down. Vice versa when Dumbledore has the idea. Father was always going on about how Dumbledore was the only person he respected, aside from Mr Weasley, of course, and I thought we had a similar relationship. I mean, you were the one to force me to up my game when following those stupid orders from Voldemort. I really had to work hard because of your efforts and I appreciate you making sure I was on top of everything.”

Now Harry was questioning every interaction he'd ever had with the blonde boy. Had Draco been trying to be friends in his own twisted way. No. Surely not. But Draco seemed so convinced that it was the case.

“And this is why you think that I am the best candidate for your best man?” asked Harry finally. “Because I'm the only one who ever challenged you?”

“Exactly, ever since we met at Madam Malkin's, you were there for me. I do appreciate it and that's why I want you as my best man. Though, you don't have to put on this nice act for it all. I know you're being very polite because I've just got engaged but it feels unnatural, you know. You can go back to your normal self, challenging, threatening and insulting me. It's far more normal when you do that and I don't want to lose that friendship. I need to know I can count on you telling me when I'm stupid like I tell you when you're behaving without class. Keep helping each other, you know.”

“Unnatural,” Harry repeated slowly. “Yes, I guess you could call it that. So, you'd rather I pushed your buttons and called you out for being a bigot? Even on your wedding day?”

“Oh, probably not on the wedding day, I think we'd need to call a temporary ceasefire for the day so that nobody around us who can't appreciate true friendship is insulted. I think even Astoria would ask us to switch to our suck up modes for the day, as dreadfully boring as it is. At least she can actually speak bluntly with me like you can, the darling lady. Told me I was a bigoted idiot the day I first spoke to her. Couldn't have asked for a finer woman. It took a while but she finally understands how to appreciate having those people in your life that insist on doing everything different to you to make you really think about what you're doing. You'll get along famously, I'm sure, as she comes up with similar arguments to what you do. Don't call people mudbloods. Stop slaughtering muggles, they have feelings too. All those kind of things. Sometimes they make sense too.”

“Sounds charming,” said Harry. Was it weird or was Malfoy actually making some kind of weird sense? Either way, this was going to be a hell of a story to tell Ron and Hermione. “When do I get to meet her?”

“So you'll do it? You'll be my best man?”

“Well, sounds like I'm the perfect candidate for it, doesn't it? I mean, who else were you going to ask? Goyle?”

“Hahaha! Good one, Potter. Him and all his ‘You're so clever, Draco' and ‘I wish I was as clever as you' comments. Seriously, can you believe he never once insulted me or challenged me in my entire time at Hogwarts? I mean, I pushed him and Crabbe every day but they couldn't be bothered to do the same for me. Almost as bad as Pansy. Cheap friendships, I say. Good for filling out parties but not for drinking whiskey with, you know?”

It was now scary how much sense Draco was making, Harry realised as he nodded along to Draco's chatter. He'd take George's teasing over Percy's dry suck up attitude any day. In a way, that seemed to be what Draco was saying and Harry couldn't help agree.

“Well, suppose I can be polite and treat you differently, in a cheap friend kind of way, for the wedding day,” said Harry, really getting carried away with the role now. “But don't expect me to put up with any blood superiority nonesense!”

“Of course not,” said Draco. “I'll be saying things I don't mean all day, being polite to everybody, but I'll save the good arguments for another time when we can insult each other as much as we please without offending the weak minded populace around us.”

“Good,” said Harry. “Now, I really should finish this report and you've waffled on far too long for this kind of hour. You've got to learn your timing, Draco.”

“Ah, then you've got to learn how to schedule time for friends so they don't need to force their way into your life,” countered Draco. He suddenly beamed at Harry. “See? I missed this!”

*** “Yes, yes, no need to get all emotional, you blonde ponce,” grinned Harry. He really was going to take this too far, he could already tell.

“Of course, ever the wise one, Potter,” said Draco, getting up from the desk. “Now, how does Saturday at seven P.M. sound good to go over the best man duties and have a catch up? We can meet at the Wobbly Unicorn. Bring Weasley, Granger too, if you feel like they are still good company. I have no idea what they're like these days as I see them less than you and you know what our friendship has fallen into. Are you seeing anyone?”

“Ginny Weasley.”

“Perfect! Another Weasley. We'll have some fine discussions, I'm sure. My Father will be quite jealous with how many quality people I can call my friends. Bring her too and I'll bring Astoria so we can all get to know each other before the wedding.”

“Sounds like a plan. Now get lost,” said Harry. Draco hopped off the desk, shook Harry's hand firmly before string out of the cubicle. He popped back in a moment later, a big grin on his face.

“I'm so glad you agreed, Potter,” he said. “It'll be like old times. Cheerio!”

With that, Draco was gone again, leaving Harry to finish his report. Harry just sat at his desk for several minutes, trying to process Draco's strange behaviour. “I'm going to need to get a pensieve,” he muttered. “No way that they're going to believe it. No freaking way.”

They'd still never get together, because Draco puts tradition second to family, and we all know that in both those scenarios Draco would still get a wife. Harry on the other hand would probably rather be with Neville, or the twins, if he was gay that's who I honestly believe he'd have an interest in. So stop it with the f****** Drarry shit, it'd never hapoen even if they were both gay.

******* I understand what fanfiction is, but I also understand what believable story telling is, and unless you change Draco's, Harry's, and their families past in general in a major way, it just cannot happen in a believable way. If you decide to change their core personalities, you need a bloody reason instead of "just because..." They are both very different people with very different backgrounds, and they also have personalities that just do not click for a relationship. If they were both gay I could understand a one-night stand between them, because their personalities would be geared towards that fine. Have you ever had someone you hate greatly, but could see yourself f****** them because of all that pent up frustration, but you could never start a meaningful relationship with such a person. That's Harry, and Draco. That's why I also hate almost all Drarry pairings, apart from the part where their EXACTLY THE SAME BEFORE HOGWARTS, their just too different for it to work. You get what I mean.

***** A subgenre of Hurt/Comfort fics where the central character(s) is emotionally or physically tortured beyond canon limits. The ultimate goal is to make them into sad, vulnerable kicked puppies who need to be nursed back into health by another character.

******* It is weird, but then it's an extreme so that's sort of the point. The talent goes in making it seem plausible and/or palatable to the reader, who may well be enjoying a catharsis from their own problems, and taking comfort in the fact that the whump is worse - or possibly horribly relatable, it's a cruel world out there - and that someone /does/ care and it /does/ get better. Or those bored with 'normal' fics might seek out the more extreme emotional stimulation of a whump fic.

It's about being able to empathise with extremes, seeking redemption for the world and/or various characters and having a new range of potential story that more canon-compliant fics can't venture into. They can be gratuitously grim and violent, or mawkishly sweet, or anywhere in between.

They aren't an everyday flavour, that's for sure.

********* Sorry, no. It's been a while since I was in the mood and I don't bookmark them. Severitus usually isn't slash, but it often is mawkish. You can exclude M/M and various parings from AO3 now and I bet whump is actually a tag, but sorting the wheat from the chaff is an undertaking. Perhaps a request post here?

** "I offered to help him navigate the wizarding word when we first met. He didn't accept my handshake. Now I realize what a faux-pas that was - I shouldn't have approached a national celebrity with a deal when I clearly had nothing to offer. Of course he knows everything there is. He's Harry Potter."

"So you didn't take his refusal to heart?"

"Refusal? Oh, no, no. He was just testing me for a better deal, the sly fox Harry is. Playing hard to please."
