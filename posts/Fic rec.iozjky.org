[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/][You'll be the death of me]]

Summary: AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

Flangst, secret relationship and plant analogies! 100+ chapters, 705k+ words, and WIP. HBP au, wartime au!


** Tip: if you're putting a link, don't leave a space between the closing bracket and the starting parenthesis. You can also use the fanfic bot by putting linkffn() and then the title or URL or story ID (best to use the latter two because the bot will sometimes mess up if you use the title) between the parentheses.

** OP, could you elaborate a little bit more on why you're recommending this fic? Like what about this fic gets to you? What's great about this fic?

*** Honestly, it might be the way they fall together, like it's not clean, it wasn't planned, but it's perfect.

It might have something to do with the fact Neville will fight for her and Graces is more reluctant.

It might be because although Neville knows that he's not in love yet, he's falling fast, and that Graces doesn't go the same way, she's in denial for more than half the fic!

All in all, the fic is just so amazing and you should definitely give it a read!

(Sorry for the rubbish post - not even a summary! - but I've edited it now) :)

*** It's a WIP. I'm the writer :) obviously I'm a bit long winded... but I update at the very least once a month. And it's coming close to the end. I do plan on there being 2 more fics after this one.
