Is there any semi-serious at least story with such a pairing? Ideal story: Harry, at Hogwarts, battling Voldemort, attending classes, and banging, or at least in a gradually escalating relationship, with his teacher on the side.

Note: not Tonks or Fleur. Seen/read plenty of those.

Ps. We reveal so much about ourselves with these super-specifics story requests, no?


** I've read one of two, all so bad i don't want to refind them. The most egregious was harry used as a fucktoy and toilet from single digit age by petunia, narcissa, and andromeda.

  In a world where Voldemort won, Hermione Granger is used at Hogwarts as a human toilet and a free whore. Listen to a shocking interview with her taken by Rita Skeeter.

** There are definitely some out there. Id have to go digging so likely I would be searching just like you.

Most seem to pair Harry with an OC, or with Aurora Sinistra (Astronomy). Shes supposedly in her late 20's early 30's and the youngest teacher. Harry and Septima Vector (Arithmancy) or Charity Burbage ( Muggle Studies), are 2 others I have seen.

Septima's age varies it seems from late 30's on many info sites, to nearly 60 due to some barely there info implying she attended Hogwarts briefly at the same time as Tom Riddle. Charity Burbage is usually implied to be in her mid to late 30's (going by what little info is out there), but she is at times made much older (like the movie/s), or even younger (closer in age to Aurora Sinistra).

And then of course there are the occasional stories where Harry is paired up with "new teachers" like the black sisters, tonks, Fleur, (or an OC).

Sadly I do not have any saved because most I have come across have been pure smut which.. while fun at times, is not my style. I too prefer actual plot (and if possible a solid story) with smut just woven in to keep the story both more mature and fun. Ill look around, but no promises.

If you have any to recommend, I would welcome suggestions. Ive posted very similar requests such as this in the past with little response sadly.

*** For Love of Magic. Harry has a dom/sub relationship with Septima. Unfortunately, it's harem (albeit decently done) and Harry is super duper awesome, so dynamics of the relationship don't resemble a teacher student one at all. That said, the sex is decently kinky - it's actually the best smut in the book, aside from some initial bits with Tonks.
