E.g.

He stared at her for a couple of minutes before replying.

That reads to me as someone staring for, like, 100-200 seconds! Which would be very awkward.

Is this an international thing? An American thing? It comes up not infrequently.

I'm always put off when people describe something that takes heartbeats/ seconds/ moments as taking much longer, it confuses me and makes the flow odd.

For example in a scene where somebody goes back to their book for a few minutes vs a few moments the whole energy of that interaction is very different.


** From what I understand, it's common when the author has enough of a grasp on English to get themselves in trouble - understanding that "minute" is used as "unspecified but short period of time", as in "wait a minute", but not understanding that that's only 'correct' in a very specific context.

It doesn't help that it's a homograph - minute with emphasis on the 'u' just means "tiny" (on a tangent, that's the etymology of the Minute Waltz, which takes /well/ longer than a minute to play at original speed - but the inspiration was a puppy chasing its tail, which qualifies as "something tiny") so it's easy to conflate that and think "a tiny amount of time" would be the 'main' meaning.

** Might be because “minute” is getting a figurative sense of “small period of time,” like “just wait a minute and I'll be with you,” and maybe they mean thirty seconds or five (actual) minutes.

I hate it lol.

** u/tsudonimh:
#+begin_quote
  a few minutes vs a few moments
#+end_quote

Fun fact, a "moment" used to be defined as a specific period of time - 1/40 of an hour. So "a few minutes" is (or at least, pedantically, was) shorter than 'a few moments".

**** u/tsudonimh:

#+end_quote

Personally, I try and stay away from specific time frames. I let the reader infer it from the context. Different people communicate differently, so by letting the reader decide the length of time, it makes it more natural for them.

In the example given in the original post

#+begin_quote
  He stared at her for a couple of minutes before replying.
#+end_quote

I'd change it something like

- He stared at her momentarily before replying
- He paused, staring at her, before replying
- He stared at her in silence, before finally replying

That way, the reader can imagine the scene as they'd see it, rather than trying to work out why someone was silent for minutes at a time.

****** Oh, I see.

In modern usage, there's no real specific definition. Personally, if I read "a moment", I'm thinking anything from a couple of seconds to half a minute. Less than that could be more accurately described with terms like an instant, a flash, a blink, etc. Longer, and you're starting into time frames that can be described with minutes, lengthy pauses, a period, a spell, etc.

** Because in the English language the meaning of words is determined by their common use and it has been in common use for many years that "minute" can be used to mean "A short but unspecified time period".

It's literally in every dictionary:

[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/minute]]

*** While I do agree, I've only heard it used in that way contexts as "Give me a minute" or "Just a minute"

And when somebody sayd "a couple of minutes," I've always experienced that being longer than 60 seconds

*** Context though. In the places I've lived people would use minute for “a short but unspecified time period” outside of asking or telling people to wait a minute, and would definitely not use it in the plural form for “a short but unspecified time period.”

Maybe it is used differently in other regions, but dictionary definitions don't provide the full context of when a word is and isn't used.

*** Right, but I think in everyday use there is a difference, I guess colloquially for me at least?

If I say 'give me a minute to work this out' I'd expect my colleague to answer a text in the meantime. If I said 'just a sec', then I'd expect to hold their attention while I found the right spreadsheet.

I appreciate I may not be in the majority, and that's what makes language have meaning- but I don't think those definitions actually work for describing time passing, which is what I'm talking about. They're more future-looking colloquially, whereas third person I genuinely find it jarring, and am just curious as to whether others do too!

** i would think it's an American thing we use 'minute' as a substitute for 'a few moments'

example

Mom: its time for dinner come down stairs.

me: ok give me a minute

which could mean a couple of seconds or 5 minutes. we Americans are just to lazy so we come up with one thing to substitute a multitude of others.

*** Thing is, people almost always use /minute/, singular. If someone's like "I need a few minutes," they definitely need more than a couple seconds. There's a big difference between "Oh wow I zoned out for a minute there" and "she stared into space for several minutes."

The example OP gave sounds more like someone either not fully understanding the words they're using or not thinking about the context they're using them in. It has nothing to do with their nationality.

*** Yeah, but that's a very context sensitive use of the word. I don't think the context of the OP it's ever appropriate to use "minute" unless you mean "on the order of 60 seconds".

It's one of my issues with dictionaries in that you rarely see the nuance of the word. Though it's understandable as the nuance of when you would use one word vs another superficially similar word can take up paragraphs. I encounter this fairly commonly when looking up translations for words between the two languages I speak.

** I think it's the same problem authors have with writing how long a conversation is taking hold, or how long a person is coming up the astronomy tower. I mean, yeah, there is a possibility of a conversation lasting a while, but do authors really think a conversation, that took up three paragraphs, is long enough to be described as "after half an hour, they came to agreement"...really? I especially dislike it when that happens in combat situation, as that just ruins immersion. It's the same with the "minute" thing, where author doesn't really stop to think, that some descriptions of his/her scenes are too unrealistic and illogical.

** when i first understood the concept of time after reading so many of these "thought for a minute" sentences, i was dumbfounded because why does one take up an entire minute to think of the reason why they didnt take the short route home?

like i remember younger me sat down in front of the clock and waited for one minute to pass so i would know how long it actually is

english is seriously really weird. its my third language and for my 2nd language, chinese, we just say “请等一下” which literally means "please wait" and it already implies for a waiting period of between a few seconds to a few minutes

*** That's so interesting! And I guess covers it.

I think that's my issue, I keep wondering why guys don't get slapped for staring at girls' necklines for so long etc.

And I guess I'm thinking about tempo.. to me a minute is a situation where my attention can wander, whereas something shorter means I keep attention on topic. So if someone thinks for a moment you watch them think and smile when they get it. But if they think for a minute then you've probably started reading your book again. Changes the dynamics of a scene!

** The example you gave is probably someone who doesn't use English as their first language and just used the world incorrectly within the context of their sentence.

But it's also an American thing. Minute means either a short amount of time, a long amount of time, or a minute depending on the context of its use.

Examples: Gimme a minute, I haven't seen you in a minute, the bomb will explode in one minute.

*** I will second the American thing. I don't know if it's a specific region or generalized but there are definitely people that say things along the lines of “I haven't seen you in a minute” or “I haven't been there in a minute” (it drives me crazy lol)

** They're used to using colloquial language. In our daily life we use minute interchangeably with second sometimes, and it flows over into their fanfics. Fanfiction writers are not writing professionally, and many of them don't adhere to the rule of not using informal language. (Which doesn't necessarily ruin the fic, but it does, personally, spoil the fun a bit.)

** To me, it's just an expresion. "Wait a minute" doesn't literally mean wait for 60 seconds exactly. If used in dialogue, it could just be a character quirk. Ditto if writing in first person. If writing in third person, it's probably not accurate but I don't think I would even notice if someone used 'minute' instead of 'moment' in a third person fic, much less be bothered by it.
