I recently finished rereading the (incomplete) fic and am now looking for something similar. It doesn't necessarily have to be Quidditch related. What I liked most about it was having a Harry that wants to have fun with a group of friends. He was going out, having a good time, picking up girls, etc.. Basically living the life that a famous twenty something guy would. I also /loved/ the flirty banter between him and Daphne.

Hopefully someone here has something. I feel like the fandom is missing these kind of light hearted fun fics.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
