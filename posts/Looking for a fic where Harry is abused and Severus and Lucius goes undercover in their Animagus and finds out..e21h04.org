:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So there's this fanfic I've read a while back on Ao3 about how there are things animal sees but can never tell.

So harry is abused, and Voldemort sends Severus and Lucius in their Animagus form to spy on Harry. Harry finds both of them, and somehow name them Severus and Lucius.

Harry takes them home and hides them somehow. And they sees all the abuse he went through.

I can't remember the rest anymore but i know that the author spoke about the abuse in details and the reaction of SS and LM. Also i think they also somehow have to report to Voldemort once a week/month or something like that?

Does anyone know what Fanfic this is? Pleaseeee help me.

*** Clearly not the story the OP was asking for, but this is on my list of "series I wish weren't abandoned." (This story is marked complete but the sequel isn't.)
