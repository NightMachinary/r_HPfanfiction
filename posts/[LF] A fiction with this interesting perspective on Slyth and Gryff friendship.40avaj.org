Somewhere in the fic is a line saying "A Gryffindor would die for his friend. A Slytherin would kill for his."

  Severus Snape died protecting Lily's son---or so he thought. He wakes up eleven again, confusing what was with what could be. Through his memories, which may or may not come to pass, he must work to change Fate before history as he remembers unfolds again. Pairing undecided. Please review, if you would.

**** you're looking for a specific fic, but provided absolutely zero other details than a throwaway line that's appeared in hundreds if not thousands of fics. Do you remember anything else about the fic?

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
