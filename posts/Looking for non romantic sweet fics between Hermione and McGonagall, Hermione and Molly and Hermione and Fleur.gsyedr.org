Title pretty much says it but I want: A) Almost mother daughterish fics between Hermione and McGonagall

B) Almost mother daughterish fics between Hermione and Molly

C) Non romantic familyish Hermione and Fleur fics, especially if its from Shell Cottage


** Just to add, if you know any, I'd prefer more canonish ones and definitely not Hermione and Snape/Draco fics with the requested moments

*** When I saw the title of yours I was like could it be? Could the title have come from a Florence and the Machine song? I opened it just to see if I was right, but I'm reading the rest asap

**** I'm uncreative when it comes to titles, so a whole lot of my fics are named using Florence + the Machine lyrics. Thanks!

  Minerva McGonagall can see a lot of herself in Hermione Granger, and so, when she catches her skipping a Charms class, she decides not to punish her. That decision is the beginning of a friendship that will carry them through triumph and disaster, as Hermione grows up in one of the most turbulent times the Wizarding World has ever known.

  Minerva McGonagall takes her pastoral duties very seriously. She visits each and every Muggleborn student and their family personally, to inform them of their place at Hogwarts. But some young Muggleborns capture her interest more than others.

  Just how did a new translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard by Hermione Granger make it into Muggle bookstores? Minerva McGonagall explains.

  “What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.

  “We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.” (HBP, Chapter 5)
