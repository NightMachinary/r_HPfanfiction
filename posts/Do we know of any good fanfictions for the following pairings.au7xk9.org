Harry/Luna

Harry/Tonks

Harry/Hermione

Harry/Bellatrix

​

I would prefer that the stories be complete, but long incomplete stories are alright too.


** Harry/Bellatrix:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with her.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Harry thrown back to 1970, busted a Death Eater raid, and thoroughly impressed her.

--------------

Harry/Hermione:

There are lots of fics about that pairing, you might want to visit [[/r/hpharmony][r/hpharmony]] too. I have some latest ones here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929), is a decent new ‘Wizards in Space' fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/][Harry Potter And the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), casts the postwar Trio as treasure hunting curse breakers. While look for Atlantis, they stumbled on something incredibly dangerous and got mired in major international conspiracies. You might want to read its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petuna Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802), to get a better idea of this AU.

Harry is blind in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), and never went to Hogwarts. But he develops super power later on and is joined by an injured (and slightly crippled) Hermione.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
