Is it just me or does any B/H or B/Hr story either has her as devout Death Eater trying to turn her lover or has her fed up but staying to do some shady, rather nonsensical undercover/spy work like in "Murder Most Horrid". Does anyone perchance know a decent story where she either never had any ties to them or at one point cut all ties and never looked back?

Please no m/m, unholy amounts of angst, Death Eater revisionism or Malfoy/Snape/the Marauders in prominent roles.


** Have you read “a black comedy”? It's pretty off the wall, but she does leave the death eaters, and it's a pretty darn entertaining story.

*** Already read it and it sucked. Don't get me wrong, the first half was amazing, but that only made the second one a bigger disappointment. I also read the most recommended ones (Wind Sheer, Stepping back, Passageways). But in general, I don't mind time travel.

**** Real shame about the second half of Delenda Est, wasn't it? My view is, there just wasn't /conflict/, no credible threats to the protagonists. And yet, there were many plot hooks that could have been used to provide that. Eg if Voldemort gained control of their money during the decades they missed. That would have made things much more interesting. There were several other potential sources of trouble, too. Would have made it an outstanding story. As it is...well, I favorited it because of the first half.

***** I hate return time travel for the same reason relationships that do not work out aren't great in fiction. It gets you invested in something only for it to do not matter in the end, especially if it isn't foreshadowed in any way before.

****** Well...I wouldn't make a blanket statement of "failed relationships are bad fiction." It would be entirely possible to write a story where the failure mattered very much, and where it was indeed foreshadowed. Consider the Snape Chronicles, Snape x Lily doesn't work out.

******* I guess it depends on what you want to read and your expectations. I am not one for romance for the sake of romance (outside of oneshots). It is fine as a side plot, and casual dating or similar is perfectly fine there, but if a side plot spends significant amount of "time" on something, getting me invested in a ship only to say "lol nope", it usually is a bad story (obviously there are exceptions).

Because in 9/10 cases, this "twist" either is there to point out that character X (usually Ginny, sometimes Ron) is a cheating slut or devalues the first relationship to "practice" for the final ship so that the protagonist can be the perfect parter/lover there. Alternatively (mostly in postwar stories), it creates additional drama because of the kids and then Harry is reluctant to go for the final relationship because he doesn't want to break up his family (but we all know that he will eventually).

Perhaps such a blanket statement is uncalled for, but it serves as a good heuristic for filtering out bad stories because most of them suck. Canon pairings are the same for me. On principle, I do not mind them, but 99% of the time I will not enjoy the fic because it will have certain themes (Big Weasley Family, the arguments prove their love) I despise.

** Well, ain't that hard /sarcasm/. Try linkffn(11709899). Don't read the sequel. Don't read the sequel, it's not finished. It can end on that fanfic alone. While it's not centered on any Death Eater revisionism, it has angst, probably not as an unholy amount as other [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2829232/N-Blackman][N.Blackman]] stuff, but it's still there. I don't think you can even get rid of angst when it comes to a Bellamione pairing, but if you do find one, please share with the class.
