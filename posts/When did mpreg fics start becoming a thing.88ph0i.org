I'm not judging it or anyone who digs that kind of thing - to each their own and all that. But like who started it? Did it start with like one fic and then snowball into a whole genre or smt like that?

I find it fascinating to learn about how all the fanfic tropes started


** The earliest fanworks listed on Fanlore with the trope were from 1983: [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mpreg]]

It didn't originate in fannish culture, however. As someone else mentioned, male pregnancy has appeared in some form in mythology, i.e. Loki, in different cultures, and there is canonical male pregnancy in some science fiction, fantasy, and comedy media.

*** While there are earlier examples I'd bet it was the movie Junior that planted the idea that this could be a thing in many a young author's mind.

**** It would not surprise me at all. Junior came out in 1994 and Fanlore mentions that mpreg became more popular in fanworks in the mid to late 90s.

** Maybe with the Sims 2? Alien abductions and pregnant men, anyone?

Or EA was very quick to catch on and cater.

** Ah, no. It's been a thing for a few millenia now. There are examples in history, usually mythology figures.

** As all the other commentators have said, mpreg has been a thing for time innumerable. But for hpff specifically, the simplest reason always made the most sense to me.

A ff writer likes to ship two characters together, who happen to be male. The writer wants to the characters to have/raise a child. The writer wants the child to be a direct genetic descendant of both characters (to better have parents coo over how much baby looks like the other parent, how it has parent A's eyes and parent B's nose, and who baby will resemble more as it grows up, and have relatives comment on how much baby looks like both parents.) The writer wants all the important stuff that happens in a real life pregnancy, such as weird food cravings, massages, feeling the baby kick, talking to baby, pregnancy sex, baby's first ultrasound, the finding out you're pregnant and telling the partner, delivery of the baby (plus noncarrier parent waxing poetry over how beautiful/angelic/strong/powerful the pregnant parent looks during such delivery) to happen directly to the couple, sans middle woman. The writer is writing fanfic for a world where a force exists that is very poorly researched and has many untold boundaries so the concept of a male getting pregnant is honestly not that wild (this is a world where you can literally voluntarily gain the ability to biologically restructure your entire body in a seemingly impossible process to turn into an animal at will, do nay sayers really have a leg to stand on about magically changing a few organs around to achieve magical mpreg not being realistic?).

Easiest solution to attain all these wants, while still having both characters have dicks (because let's be honest, while slash can be and often is character focused and not just about the sex [see: all non explicit slash fic], dicks are often an important part of the sexy fanfic)?

Magical mpreg.

*** I mean, in general, people tend to view Mpreg as discordant with nature or at least alien. It's okay for gods and other mythical beings to do it, because they're not human, but when humans do it, it doesn't quite seem right. So while gay and transgender people may or may not be more accepted, Mpreg takes it a step further, and in general a society is going to be very negative towards it. While a writer may be able to change the setting to make it work in context, most of the time, it's a single case (or a micropopulation) without historical precedent. So while magically it may be possible, most writers have neither the foresight nor the skill to justify it.

**** It's true that most writers can't effectively pull off more, but the claim that a society will be very negative towards mpreg on the basis that it's not quite natural, or human, doesn't hold up. In Harry Potter, there are real, common knowledge abilities and conditions that are pulled from folklore or gods and legends, that would be discordant with nature or alien, and no one tends to have issues with them being used in ff unless it's done poorly. . A full body change of every single organ in your body, and your entire skeletal structure, to turn into another goddamned species, feels like something that would be significantly more alien, and by your logic likely to be viewed negatively by society, but in Harry Potter seems to be as well known and accepted an ability as the ability to make a love potion. Yes, it's exceedingly difficult, but AFAIK no magical character sees animagi as alien, or inhuman, or even really think of their existence negatively. And unless it's done poorly, there isn't any negative meaning assigned to it by the hpff community. And yet, to the large majority of that same community, the hypothetical ability to change ~10 organs and a few brain chemicals, is somehow the most alien and unnatural trope in fiction, and is ridiculous to even believe could possibly exist in the same fictional universe that has werewolves and animagi and vampires and veela and mermaids and basilisks and phoenix and house elves and talking spiders and people with the ability to change their outward appearance into whatever they want and potions that can give you the body of any human on earth with a little bit of hair, or even give you characteristics of other species with some fur.

*** mpreg fics are a big nopeeee to me too but I mean like it's not THAT bad.. compared to those necrophiliac fics hiding around in AO3 for example

It seems to me like these kind of â€˜niche' genres are dying out though, like there's less fics being posted now but also of much higher quality?
