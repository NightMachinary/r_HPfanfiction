I remember really enjoying the fic, a muggle detective keeps poking her nose and trying to tail Harry. If I remember correctly, she stakes out a dinner out with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. I only got a few chapters in... Help!!


** Was it one of Northumbrian's MIT fics? I'm pretty sure there was one were something similar happened.
