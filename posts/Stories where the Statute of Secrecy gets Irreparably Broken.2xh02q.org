** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/32/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] is an offshoot fic of the famous / infamous Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, though you could probably enjoy it with only a little bit of knowledge about what happened before the offshoot. I thought it dealt with the social consequences and conflict from the breaking of the Statute and what came after really well, with that conflict forming half or more of the fic's (completed) duration.

Though it's not quite what you asked for, the Dumbledore's Army books [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4384697/1/Sluagh][2]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4914208/1/A-Peccatis][3]] play quite a bit with the Statute. The second book was weird, but before it got weird, the implications of magic being involved in both sides in the Troubles was fun to read about, though the Statute only bends, never breaks, with the third book talking a little about breaking it entirely but suddenly never being updated again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] is being regularly updated and currently has a Muggle policewoman investigating the wizarding population, but there's a thousand other things going on in that fic.

That's all I can think of that would qualify. Most other stuff I've seen I can't recommend, either because it fulfills the premise so poorly or it's got other strange stuff going on.
