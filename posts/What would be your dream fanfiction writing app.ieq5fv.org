I've been working on a fanfiction site to address the issues fanfiction readers & writers face. One of the main features for writers is Drafts, which is designed so that you can write all your fanfiction easily & in one place. It has auto saving, collaboration, and alot of other stuff. You can check it out for yourself [[https://fanfiction.online/drafts/new][here]]. One feature, for example, is that you can easily export all your drafts to FFN & AO3 without losing any formatting.

To further improve it, I want to ask, what features would make it your dream fanfiction writing app?

**** You don't lose any formatting by copy pasting from GDocs, at least as far as I noticed. the only thing GDocs can't do is horizontal lines, but you can simply use a # instead and then manually replace them while prood reading for the last time. Not sure about GDocs to Ao3, but that doesn't really matter since you can simply copy paste your FFN doc thing, which then already has the horizontal lines.

AO3 can't copy aligned paragraphs, even from FFN.

As for why you would use this over Google Docs, you can actually keep all your drafts (and only your fanfiction drafts, not get them mixed up with personal ones) in one spot, instead of jumping from app to app to post, edit and collaborate, you can do all that in one place.

Another thing is that you don't have to share your personal email with someone you don't know (like a beta-reader). You can chat, share and collaborate on your drafts, all from your Fanfiction Online inbox.

I think these would be good enough reasons for a lot of people to switch over from Google Docs. But if you prefer GDocs, that's great. Hope you still support Fanfiction Online with your ideas for improvements though.

** I hate to say it but for easy to use collaborative writing, it's hard to beat google docs or its lookalikes (or maybe it is a lookalike of something earlier). Or the markup-based alternative is a wiki engine like Wikipedia.

I'd rather not have to figure out yet another app. I'd rather use some standard markup/markdown than yet another whatever (although I'm used to wikipedia markup by now). If your thing can import markdown files and maintain file histories, that's better than making me deal with yet another editing gui. I'd rather edit offline most of the time anyway.

I confess that I've never uploaded anything to AO3 or FF. I see in AO3's FAQ that it uses HTML for markup. I didn't check FF. Overall I like AO3's culture better than FF's, but FF has been around longer and has more users. Is it important to export drafts rather than finished stories?

Anyway I'm already comfortable using low tech tools (pen and paper for outline, manual markup for formatting) so I think I'll keep using them, but you're doing impressive work, that you can probably apply to places other than fanfic. I'm sure you've figured that out already ;).

Drafts is the process of writing on Fanfiction Online. What I meant was that authors usually cross-post on multiple site, and they often have the issue of porting their formatting properly. I've proposed a solution to that. You can write on Fanfiction Online's Drafts. Easily use that single draft to post in Fanfiction Online, FFN & AO3 without worrying about formatting.

There isn't an API. In spite of that, I've managed to achieve as much integration as I can with both of them. For most people using external editors (like GDocs), the issue when they copy-paste their documents is that they lose their formatting. I've managed to solve that issue for both of these sites.

For FFN, a neat file is generated so that you can easily upload it to FFN. And while AO3 doesn't support uploading, it does allow you to use HTML. Fanfiction Online generates AO3-accepted HTML (AO3 doesn't support all HTML) which you can easily copy-paste to AO3's HTML section.

For example, in =vim=, =d= is the delete key.

=d= is actually a function that deletes on a range (that is, it takes argument(s)). So if you press =dw= then it will delete a word. If you press =dd= then it will delete the entire line. If you press =d3w= then it will delete three words. If you press =dap= it will Delete a Paragraph. Stuff like that, and you have these functions for every simple text editing action you can think of. Select, cut, copy, paste, find, etc.

Vim has a separate mode for these (there's a separate mode to enter text). Emacs is different, and uses combinations of modifier keys instead of a dedicated command mode (called =normal mode= in vim). This allows the user to enter text and execute commands seamlessly.

**** Per Neal Stephenson, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_Command_Line_][In the Beginning... Was the Command Line]]/:

#+begin_quote
  In the GNU/Linux world there are two major text editing programs: the minimalist vi (known in some implementations as elvis) and the maximalist emacs. I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor. It was created by Richard Stallman; enough said. It is written in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer--i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed--emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.

*** Oh I think you'll love Fanfiction Online's then. For me, AO3's tagging is near perfect, which is why I've implemented everything AO3 does and more to make it perfect.

It has all of AO3's tags, with a much more friendly interface for tagging than AO3. One issue I do have with AO3 is that they have duplicate tags. Fanfiction Online has an automated process which intelligently removes and merges duplicate tags. That will help when the app scales.

It has even better filtering for readers as well, which make your stories much more easier to find and read. You can check that out at [[https://fanfiction.online/read][fanfiction.online/read]]. Even though there aren't any published books yet, the filtering is working so you can check it out.

I assume you mean ffn. And the answer is yes.

One thing that's new is the reading preferences. Sure, in AO3 you can change skins, but that's a lengthy and difficult process even if you want to do something as simple as make the font larger. And even more difficult on your phone. In Fanfiction Online, It's extremely simple to change the font size, background, font, paragraph spacing and much more.

It does, Fanfiction Online just calls them collections. You can add books to your collections easily. Users can create any number of Unlisted, Private or Public collections. Two default collections exist, Hidden & Favorites.

Hidden is a special collection that allows you to hide any books you want from your search. This is a Private collection.

Favorites is a Public collection. All books you favorite will show up in [[https://fanfiction.online/@your-profile/favorites][fanfiction.online/@your-username/favorites]]

I wish there were published books so I could fully demonstrate how many features this site has. If you have any more suggestions, please mention so I can implement them. And if you're a writer, please start writing. Thanks alot!

***** Thanks alot! It *is* finished. Every feature I mentioned above has already been added. You can start writing from [[https://fanfiction.online/drafts/new][fanfiction.online/drafts/new]]. If you're not a writer, you'll have to wait until some authors start publishing their books. Meanwhile, feel free to go through the site and offer me ideas for new features you have in mind. Thanks again for your comment!

** The one of my dreams would be, One that comes with a A.I and uses a Brain-computer interface. So the brain-computer interface would add stuff as quick as I think it and the A.I. would help put it together and learn As i work with it. But we probably wont see something like that for at least another 30 years.
