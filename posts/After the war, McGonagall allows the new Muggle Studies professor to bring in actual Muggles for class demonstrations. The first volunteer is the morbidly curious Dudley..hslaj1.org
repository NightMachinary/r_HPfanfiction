Edit: What the fuck have I created

I meant like having him answer questions...


** "/Depulso!/" cried the professor. "As you can see from Mr. Dudley's grey matter that now delightfully paints our classroom's walls, you can see that muggles do not possess the physical resiliency we wizards possess."

Edit: My god, I thought my comment was pushing the limits of acceptability.

** "Now, some of you, specially those coming form long lines of purebloods might wonder if the Muggles are any different to us. Physically."

A few hands were raised.

"Before you say anything, let me stop you there. They are not. They are exactly as us. And to make a point, I'm going to make Mr. Dursley here strip naked for you all. To prove just that."

"Ewwwww." Ginny whined on the back.

"Mr. Goyle, since you are repeating your school year... come here and get naked as well. Too compare. You are the closest to Mr. Dursley we have here."

And so they went, a full hour looking a Goyle's and Dudley'ss naked bodies.

*** That wasn't what I expected a response to this prompt to be but its good and funny..

I would have had experiments being tested on him (course Dudley'll be willing) and having some rather unique and hilarious results. Like flying a broom and the broom suddenly deciding to throw Dudley off or smth.

**** "Next, the slug curse. I'm going to show you how muggles react just the same to this curse as a normal wizard would."

Dudley's eyes show fear.

"No need for that Mr. Dursley. We are just starting, there are way more spells to test."
