Hey guys,

that topic about the light side's casualties (the number of them, despite them having the fortifications of Hogwarts) inspired me to ask about fictions that involve wizards fighting smart (not just lobbing spells at each other and hoping something connects, but stuff like small unit tactics, fortifying a positions etc.)

Bonus points if Harry comes up with some of his own tactics (muggle inspired if need be)

Ok, stage is yours - but please:

- No Harry/Ginny (unless it's really really really good and long)
- No main character slash (no Harry/Draco, Lucius, Voldemort etc. etc.)
- No canon-rehash :(

So, there you go and thank you for helping out here :)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** I just finished reading it, and I must say I'm very disappointed.

And it's incomplete and abandoned.

It mentioned extreme violence, but was actually nothing compared to "Dividend and Entwined".

Basically, it's just another post Year 5 indy!Harry fic with poorly described battle scenes and lousy military strategies.

What also irked me was this fanon notion that the Order was bent on non-lethal tactics. In DH, Lupin specifically berated Harry for using a non-lethal spell against Stan Shunpike during the Flight of 7 Potters.
