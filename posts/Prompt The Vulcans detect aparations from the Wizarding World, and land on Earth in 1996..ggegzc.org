The Vulcan's interpret Wizards Aparating for warp drive. They make first contant with Earth in 1996, during the Second Wizarding War. What happens?


** Well, the problem is that they have no reason to land in England specifically. They would probably still land in the USA or Russia, but what it would do is to force the magical community to sort out its problems because having terrorists running round trying to take over governments is frankly embarrasing when you have an entirely new advanced sentient race trying to make contact.

â€‹

As far as Magical England is concerned, the appearance of the Vulcancs has suddenly made it the ICWs problem, rather than just ignoring it and waiting for it to sort itself out. That probably translates to a full on enforced takeover by the combined forces of the ICW along with basically imprisoning both sides of the conflict so that they can figure out who is in the right and who did what so that they can restore order and stop screwing around with the battered fragments of the statute of secrecy.

** I'd always figured a HP/Trek crossover would work best by just having the war against Voldemort spiral out into what later generations would know as the Eugenics Wars.

*** Darth marrs did a TNG / HP cross over that mentioned the eugenics wars. From memory, it was the second story of a trilogy that was smutty and the third had quite the ending.

** Well, the first thing would of course be that the Vulcan ship doesn't land in areas that are entirely magical. While perhaps the repelling spells don't work entirely on them, they would still choose an area with the highest concentration of humans - India, perhaps. Maybe Mexico City.

They would then come into contact with the muggle governments, and ask them - "hey guys, we noticed that you're experimenting with FTL technology! We detected some signatures from your planet." and then the governments would say "wtf, no we haven't?" and then embedded agents from the magical world would report back and the research departments would go "uh oh", and there'd be a choice to make.

The Vulcans can obviously detect magic, or perhaps only apparition. You can't turn that off, and you can't stop people from apparating across the planet, and the Vulcans and Humans would be very perplexed and suspicious of teleportation signatures on their planet. The various in the know government heads would probably have an inkling, but they have no incentive to protect the magical world.

So the Vulcans investigate using their ships - they land in an area with many apparition signals, one of the magical shopping centres, perhaps. They are of course instantly threatened by the wizards, held at wandpoint - until they can demonstrate their own unique abilites as psychics. I like melding worlds, so I posit that Vulcans just have their own form of magic, like other magical races.

I believe the Vulcans would advocate taking down the Statute, and would provide assisitance with preventing panic or a war by acting as neutral mediators.

With their help, I believe the humans would be able to overcome their xenophobia and the magical world would reveal itself.

From there, it could go anywhere. The revelation could be a clusterfuck or go off smoothly.

However, I believe that the Vulcans would have more respect for the humans if the magical world is known to them. In ENT it is revealed that they didn't trust the humans all that much with advanced technology, but the wizards in particular are much further advanced than them. They might even trade mundane tech like the warp drive for wizarding knowledge like Wandlore, or the various mind magics.

** Wizards have been apparating for hundreds (thousands?) of years, why would the Vulcans wait until 1996?

*** In the canon Star Trek first contact between Vulcan and Earth, the /T'PLana-Hath/ (2063) was coincidentally passing through the edge of the Sol system at the same time as Cochrane's warp test. They were on a survey mission.

Another Vulcan ship had crashed on Earth in 1957 (ENT: "Carbon Creek"). It was there to investigate the launch of /Sputnik/ and the crew was rescued in 1958. If the Vulcans had noticed /Sputnik/ then they likely had Earth under surveillance, either active (ships or probes coming regularly to check specifically on humans) or passively (all ships that happen to be in that area on other business should run a sensor sweep of Earth).

But why wait until 1996? Maybe updates to sensor technology made the "warp microbursts" visible to them for the first time around then.
