Are there any stories where Harry manages to expose Draco, be it through a long investigation or by simply ripping Draco's robe in the Great Hall during dinner?

Obviously, as a marked Death Eater, Draco ought to face severe consequences (for attempted murder, use of unforgivables, treason and so on). Please, no slash and no Ron/Hermione or Hermione/any Slytherin.


** Could you please edit the request to remove the 'ship restriction? This is rare enough of a premise that it would be interesting to know if there are /any/ fics like that, for any 'ship?

** Respectfully,

The ‚Äúmurder and unforgivables‚Äù idea regarding death eaters (at least, that they are required for admission/marking) is purely fanon. There is no canon requirement for either to obtain a mark.

Also, given the fact that the wizards are governed by the ministry of magic, an argument can be (and frequently is) made that they aren't beholden to the Crown in any way. The Statute of Secrecy effectively had all wizards declare independence from muggle authority, so treason, as defined as rebellion against the Crown, doesn't apply.

If you make magicals be British/French/etc citizens, that opens up a whole new realm of issues. Why would pureblood discrimination be legal? House elf slavery? Hell, the obliviate spell, a spell that makes it impossible to prove crimes against magicals? Much easier to assume the separation was legal as well as total. I can't see any elected government allowing half of that behavior.

**** Except it isn't.

Draco never used the Imperius on Katie. He allegedly used it on Madam Rosmerta, who did use it on Katie. It is eminently possible Rosmerta was simply blackmailed by Draco, or that the Imperius was laid by (insert DE mook here) with the instruction that she obey Draco. Only Harry's and Dumbledore's allegation of imperius is given, it is never proven. A caster is never identified in text. Draco confirms that Rosmerta is under control - but never canonically admits to casting the spell, or even that she is under Imperius. Dumbledore says she is, and Draco states ‚ÄúGot there at last, have you?‚Äù That is not an admission of culpability or guilt.

Also, at no point did Draco ever actually attempt to murder Dumbledore, unless you count the mead (which wound up with Slughorn). For that matter, it is eminently possible Rosmerta did that on her own. There was conspiracy to commit murder, allegedly, and under duress (Voldemort would retaliate against Draco's family), so that is something even a paralegal could defend in a courtroom.

If you push it, there was a simple assault (assuming, again, British common law, which as I stated before we can't assume) when he disarmed Dumbledore of the Elder Wand, but Draco never even flicked his ear, let alone ‚Äútried to kill him.‚Äù

Yes, we know the intent behind things. However, consider it legally. Malfoy, given his money, would have a barrister who is far better than marginally competent. He would walk on all charges given his canon behavior and what was proven in the books. IANAL but I could introduce reasonable doubt on of every one of these charges myself.

This is one of the biggest issues in HPFF. We take interpretation, inference, and conflate it into truth, when the third person limited narrative only shows us Harry's point of view. A lawyer/barrister could fly a helicopter through the holes in the canonically proven observations/allegations. Draco would walk.

Actually..that might be a fun fic. Draco is accused, wins his court case, then comes back to Hogwarts near/at the end of the year and lords it over everyone. Dumbles could survive the summer, since the cabinet plot is never completed, and the camping trip would never happen. The ‚Äútrio‚Äù return to Hogwarts in the fall and are forced to raise the students in rebellion against the Ministry when Dumbledore eventually dies and Voldemort makes his move, making it more of a Red Dawn style student led guerilla war Book 7.

I wonder how long it'll be before someone calls me a Draco fanboy like I have been called a Hermione one, now, when all I have done is use logic and a basic knowledge of the legal system.üòÄ

***** And all that gold wouldn't matter under a Minister who behaves like McCarthy and chucks any suspect into Azkaban, guilty or not. He wants to get on Harry's good side, so Veritasserum would be used, legal or not. The Exclusionary rule is a thing in the US, not in magical Britain.

And whether he cast the imperius on Katie or Rosmerta is irrelevant, it means life in Azkaban. It also doesn't change the multiple counts of attempted murder.

****** Even if certain elements of the case were to be proven, Draco still remains a minor that was coerced into action by a man that threatened to murder his family.

His punishment, at most, should be community service and some sort of repentance for his crimes, not a prison guarded by soul-sucking monsters that leech any happiness they get a whiff off.

******* He had other choices (fleeing the country, going to Dumbledore) but chose a murder plot with a huge potential for collateral damage instead. He demanded racial purges at 12 and the Buckbeak/Hagrid incident as well as the aftermath shows clear sadistic tendencies (he enjoys inflicting pain and misery). He supported the Death Eaters ideologically his entire life. Even the brainwashed argument doesn't work since Hermione's mere existence proves his ideology as wrong and he spent more than half of a decade around that girl.

While Draco might have realised that being a Death Eater is crap after joining, it is clear that he supported Voldemort even before joining him. Community service for terrorism and attempted murder? For using unforgivables? Life with Dementors might be harsh, but life in prison? Definitely justified.

******** Children can be cruel and mean-spirited. You may want to live in a society that punishes such behavior with prison, but I do not.

Ideologically, also, children will parrot the views of their parents. They are children -- they haven't had the time nor the abilities to develop their own positions on various subjects. Once again, throwing them into prison for that is both inhumane and unjust.

And, finally, I think you missed the whole "a homicidal megalomaniac will brutally torture and murder your parents if you don't do exactly as he says" part of my argument. It's easy to say "Oh, well, duhh, he should have just gone to Dumbledore, then it would have all been alright", when it's not your family -- or the people you love -- at risk. And Draco, whatever his faults, did certainly love his parents.

********** I'm sorry, Draco Malfoy take a cab? Should he just, um, call one from his cell phone? Also, board a plane? Does he even know what planes are? Ron didn't even know how to use a telephone in second year, and he's a Weasley with a father that loooves muggle things!

Sarcasm aside, I doubt the Malfoys, notorious muggle haters, would let Draco wander around muggle London and teach him the basics. I imagine that your solution would never even enter his mind, and that's not taking into the fact that he was, frankly, scared, no, terrified, and people tend to get myopic in those situations.

Look, you can call Draco a bully, and I'll agree. You can call him a spoiled prat, a git, a cruel and petty child, and I'll say yes to all those things. But murderer and terrorist he was not, and that's why we actually see him in the epilogue of HP, instead of him being locked up in Azkaban.

*********** We see him in the epilogue because Rowling wrote a very distorted view on redemption. I mean, Dumbledore says that he knew Harry was getting abused for a decade and a month later they are the best of friends. Snape fucked over an entire generation with his high NEWT requirements, was an overall arse, abused his power, carried a petty grudge and had a creepy obsession with Lily Evans... And yet somehow, in the end, he is a good guy in Harry's eyes.

The Death Eaters are an SA-ripoff and the SA was a politically and racially motivated, later state-supported terrorist group. And Draco was a supporter of said terrorist group, carrying out murder/treason attempts on their behalf, nearly killing two other students. If you'd argue with "but Voldemort would kill his family otherwise" then most of the Death Eaters would get off Scots free.

Even if you'd only punish him for the injuries he caused, that would mean 5 years by the rather mild German Youth Penal Law. If you were to try him as a British adult (which according to British Law he would end up with), that is life in prison.

Considering Moody said that any 14-year old using an unforgivable gets life in Azkaban, Malfoy definitely should end up there. Even considering all circumstances, he did not have to use those. Argue as much as you want, the penalty for unforgivables should not avoidable for Malfoy.

************ Any competent lawyer would point out two things:

A) Draco Malfoy was a minor at that time. No, odds are he would not be tried as an adult under British law, as the cut off age is 18. He was 16.

B) His actions were committed under duress. He had the equivalent of a gun pointed at him and his family. If he had not complied, he would have died, and his family would have died. All rather painfully.

Also, you can't compare him to the other Death Eaters. They joined as /adults/ and willingly. Their crimes were committed without coercion. They wanted to break the law. Draco Malfoy broke it only because he had to, or he would die. There's a difference. And, in the end, he wasn't even able to do that. Even with his family's and his own life at stake, he put his wand down instead of casting an Avada.

With these mitigating factors, there isn't an unbiased jury in the world that would sentence Draco Malfoy to prison. So, I don't see why you're calling that a distorted view on redemption. It's justice, and it's humane.

************* A) According to a quick google search, Britain tried to crack down on youth crime by using adult law for all 17-year-olds and quite a few 16-year-old offenders in the 90s.

B) In a Civil War, everyone is under duress. If that was a valid excuse, everyone on Voldemort's side would get off.

C) You do not know whether Draco joined under duress or joined voluntarily and only later regretted that. And the late regret does not get you off completely.

And you still did not refute the "Unforgivable" argument. Moody says to his class of 14 and 15-year-old students that using any of them means life in Azkaban. And Malfoy used Unforgivables completely on his own. Even if you use the "under duress" excuse, that does not excuse the Unforgivables because there are plenty other options how to attempt murder without them, from cursed daggers over poison and up to cursing a common item the target uses (goblet, fork, quill, chair and so on).

*************** It depends. The one on the goblin doesn't count since it was on a goblin and they do not fall under the normal magical law and the one on Bellatrix was not cast properly. If you count that, then Draco is due for his attempt as well. And Harry's side is the one dishing out justice after the war and we all know that the victor gets away with stuff the defeated side does not. Not the best juricatory argument, but otherwise most of the Allied High command would be war criminals as well.

Also, don't forget about that thing called truth potion. That's all the evidence you'd need.

************** A) Children are tried as adults only in the most egregious cases. In this instance, since he didn't actually murder anyone, I'd say it wouldn't apply, but I'll admit it's a possibility.

B) I have to disagree, completely. Why would everyone be under duress? That makes no sense. There were plenty of Death Eaters who were more than glad to perpetrate atrocities, to torture and murder, pillage and plunder, but Draco is not among them. You do not see him casting crucios and avadas left and right; on the contrary, the only moment he has to murder someone -- Dumbledore on the top of the tower -- he lowers his wand.

C) Joining a group isn't cause for imprisonment. It's the actions against others that matter. And Draco's actions were focused on killing Dumbledore, because, once again, he was told that if he wouldn't then he and his family would die. That is duress, plain and simple.

D) I didn't reply to the Moody section, because I don't even see it as an argument. First of all, that wasn't even Moody, it was Crouch Jr., and I'm not gonna take his words as textbook British Magical Law. Why should be trust him, at all?

Secondly, are you really quibbling over how Draco should have attempted the murder of the most powerful wizard of his time? He was not in a right state of mind; his family's life was in direct danger, and, had he failed, he would have died too. That makes him a sixteen year old kid in an impossible situation, just trying to save his family. You can't judge him for that.

And, lastly, you keep saying he uses unforgivables, like he's some mad dark wizard, casting them everywhere, and there's really no evidence to support that. He was a bully, yes. A racist. A spoiled brat. A child. But a murderer? No. A torturer? Also, no. So I'm having a lot of trouble understanding why you seem so intent on making him the root of all evil.

*************** Oh, he is far from the root of all evil, but seeing him free ruined the epilogue for me (well, and the marriages after three lines of romance). He is far from the worst Death Eater, don't get me wrong, but he should face consequences regardless. Argue as much as you want, for the stuff he did he ought to be punished. And saying something along the lines of "but the year under Voldemort was punishment enough" is an insult to the real victims of the Death Eaters.

**************** I agree that he shouldn't get off scot-free, it's just that prison is an unjust punishment, in his case, as I see it. Which is why I advocated community service, something to teach him humility, to change his views. I imagine working with muggleborns and orphans would do the trick.

As for the relationships, I can't agree more. Even reading HP the first time as a kid, I didn't think Ron/Hermione made any sense. It just seemed...off. I always thought she'd end up with Harry. But, ah, what can you do...

***** You make an interesting case, but it has a limitation: it only makes use of the evidence available to us via Harry. Yes, Harry's testimony alone could not convict Draco. However, if it came to an arrest, there would also be an investigation. His possessions would be searched. Witnesses would be questioned. Crabbe and Goyle would be implicated, and they would probably give away information. The Protean-Charmed Galleons would be found in his and Rosmerta's possession. Other clues would be found as well, which we can't even know about, since Harry didn't know about them.

Dumbledore and Snape had to keep their efforts to figure out what's going on on the down-low, for obvious reasons. Aurors wouldn't have to.
