Trolls are supposed to have magically resistant skin, but would Avada Kedavra kill it if it hit or would it still be living?


** I imagine so. Otherwise, people would just wear troll skin in duels. Or dragon skin, which, I imagine, is better.

*** Skin of something living does not necessarily have the same properties when dead, especially with magic.

For example in my mind a dead basilisk's eyes are completely undangerous, and taste great when fried with butter.

  It was the unicorn all right, *and it was dead.* Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.

  Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, *and began to drink its blood.*

That's probably why. When it's mentioned more than once, versus saying something is dead once, in regards to the same thing. The more mentioned one is likely to be remembered more. Unless the mentioned once thing is massively a shock.

****** Tough to say- it's a question of magical power and intent to destroy. Plus, /some/ magical creatures like Lethifolds and Dementors are already all but confirmed to be immune to the Killing Curse, surely, so perhaps more "ethereal" dangerous creatures are immune, while "physical" creatures like giants, trolls, spiders, etc aren't.
