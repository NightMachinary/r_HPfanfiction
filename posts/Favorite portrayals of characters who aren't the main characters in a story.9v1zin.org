So, for example, I love the portrayal of Ginny in linkffn(Rogue's Bet) even though she's not technically a main character. She's totally cool and laid back and funny, and I wish she was actually part of the main pairing, but I still enjoyed reading her parts of the story.

Or Luna in linkffn(Potter, No Angst) who is totally OOC but in such a hilarious and fun way. Also not technically a main character but her parts are my favorite of the story.


** Almost everyone in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]])

But especially Percy Weasley. Although he's not in the first instalment (linked). It's got four parts you see.

Everyone thinks he's a dick head. But he's not. Can't say much more because spoilers.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Linkffn(harry potter and the natural 20) Fiona the cop. She's hopefully turning into a main character, but she didn't appear until fairly recently in the story. But she's actually one of my favourite OCs.

** Luna in /Dodging Prison And Stealing Witches/. She's so out there Harry never seems to know how to react to her, except to just go with it. She's the Ace, wise adviser, ruthless dueller . And her Animagus form is a T-Rex.

** This fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14462256]]) while clichè and not particularly amazing, had the most multifaceted Lily and James that I've come across, as well as the most multifaceted WGWL. They actually have motivations and more to their personalities than “evil parents” and “spoiled famous brat”.

** I quite liked the portrayal of Daphne Green grass in "worthy of magic" specifically early on. A very different take on her character and one that actually lives up to the concept of slytherin.
