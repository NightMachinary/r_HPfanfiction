Mine is in a fic I can't remember, a slytherin girl tells Harry that mud blood means a muggle born who acts like a know it all, and Harry is like “ wow i guess hermione is a mud blood.


** Think I read that one, doesn't Daphne go on to say that since Harry's mother embrace Wizarding culture wholeheartedly she wasn't a mudblood? Don't recall what fic it was though, I read it way back in my earlier forays into Harry Potter fanfiction

In addition it does seem to me that rising in the ranks largely depends on mastery of magic, which anyone in theory can do. Otherwise why did Dumbledore get all those positions and regularly get offered the job of Minister for Magic?

**** /Nightmare/, which is an infamous Tomione fanfiction by Provocative Envy on Fanfiction.net.

I'm a Tomione reader who often reads darkfic, and even this squicked me out. It involves Hermione going back in time, having a sexual relationship with Tom Riddle, and Riddle deliberately manipulating the situation to trick Hermione into getting pregnant with his child via rape by deception. Hermione reacts as well as you'd expect; which is to say, badly.

Rape by deception resulting in a pregnancy seems to be an alarmingly common trope - or theme - in Tomione/Volmione fanfictions. It's why I always read the AO3 tags first.

*** /Bound To Him/ is probably the only story I've actually seen do this well and in a compelling manner, and trust me, I used to read /a lot/ of this trope. Forced bonding is too often used as an excuse to force intimacy in place of actual romantic tension / plot. Most stories that use rape as a plot device never bother to delve into the trauma and suffering of the situation, and those that do usually don't do it well or coherently.

  Hey, Dad, look at me

  Think back, and talk to me

  Did I grow up according to plan?

  And do you think I'm wasting my time

  Doing things I wanna do?

  But it hurts when you disapproved all along

  And now I try hard to make it

  I just want to make you proud

  I'm never gonna be good enough for you

  Can't pretend that I'm alright

  And you can't change me

  'Cause we lost it all

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  Now it's just too late

  And we can't go back

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  I try not to think

  About the pain I feel inside

  Did you know you used to be my hero?

  All the days you spent with me

  Now seem so far away

  And it feels like you don't care any more

  And now I try hard to make it

  I just wanna make you proud

  I'm never gonna be good enough for you

  I can't stand another fight

  And nothing's all right

  'Cause we lost it all

  And nothin' lasts forever

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  Now it's just too late

  And we can't go back

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  Nothing's gonna change the things that you said

  And nothing's gonna make this right again

  Please don't turn your back

  I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you

  But you don't understand

  'Cause we lost it all

  And nothin' lasts forever

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  Now it's just too late

  And we can't go back

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  'Cause we lost it all (perfect)

  Nothin' lasts forever

  I'm sorry I can't be perfect

  Now it's just too late

  And we can't go back (perfect)

** Literally every time a fanfic has a good premise, good writing and a well thought out plot and than suddenly they start with character-bashing.

Like, some weeks ago I read a time-travel fic about 12 or 13 year old Bellatrix who went to the future before she went crazy and joined Voldemort. It was a nice fic, it was well written... and then they met the Weasleys. And I don't have a problems with Slytherins bashing the Weasleys, that's kind of what they do in canon too. But suddenly Hermione started out of no-where to treat Ron like shit and Harry and Neville thought it was fine and joined her. And then followed a whole chapter of Ron Bashing. I stopped there to read. It really ruined the fic for me because everyone suddenly and without any explanation acted totally out of character. It hadn't even plotrelevance as far as I can judge.

*** That's one of my biggest pet peeves and has stopped me from reading a bunch of stories.

Especially when the author unironically claims there's actually no bashing because how can you "bash" someone(s) that's obviously so awful. Usually referring to Ron and Molly, Dumbledore being the next most common but at least he'll get the "master manipulator" treatment so there might be /something/ interesting going on with him.

**** I don't really get why authors do that. Personally, I don't hate many characters in most of the fandoms I'm a part of. There's literally one where I hate more than two characters but that's mainly because the author sucked at writing characters and just let a lot of problematic things slide.

Whenever I write fics, I rarely include bashing. If I do, the character (if they're popular, well-liked, or have a complicated personality with potential for a redemption arc) almost always gets a redemption arc. It just seems so cringy. Like, I get not liking a character but if you have to alter their entire personality to make them more unlikeable than that says more about yourself than it does about the character.

I prefer to keep as many readers as possible and I feel the best way to do this is to just not bash characters. If I don't like them, I'll just give them a smaller role to play. It seems a lot simpler IMO.

No I completely understand lol.

I tried to read a back in time story recently where Harry accidently merges with Lockhart instead of his past self. Crazy situation and lots of potential for fun scenarios. I didn't very far into it.

Harry/Lockhart, both grown men, just viciously tear into a 12 year old Ron at every opportunity because of things he /accidently/ set in motion by being loud and angry in a bar. Like, just guide him like older Harry was doing to the other young characters. Make him a better person.

I wrote up a whole long rant on the topic before deciding it was an old story and not worth it. And who knows, maybe they wrote it as a teen, are much better now and look back on it and cringe.

It's a common theme I think however, that young or inexperienced authors sometimes write to vent their frustrations so in the moment it's much more fun to them. And when writing is fun you can get more done, so sometimes otherwise good authors indulge a bit too much at the expense of their plot and characterization, imo.

***** A lot of people in the harry potter fandom and fanfic writers in general perceive Harry as weak and lacking independence. Some blame ron/the weasleys in general and feel removing him is an easy way to get harry to do something without having Hermione do all his thinking for him. Hermione is also a target of this and sometimes by the same people. It's not good writing and there are much better/more interesting ways to do it but there it is.\\
It's pretty common for better writers to have them grow apart as Harry grows up and Ron decides not to but that at least feels more natural.

Any hp fic that explores the perspectives of other characters to canon events is going to have a hell of a time reconciling some things. I get that a lot of that is necessary for the plot. Wouldn't be a very interesting story if the adults actually acted like adults.

I'd understand if Ron screws up and Hermione gets angry and calls him out and they have a huge fight, but the narration makes it pretty clear that it isn't the case. When Ron does the same to her, they always make it obvious that it is supposed to be unfair and he's being an arsehole.

****** I think it's very interesting that it's the Weasleys who are treated so bad: they are lower middleclass and depicted as "poor".

Hermione on the other hand comes from a wealthy family (their parents are dentists), as does Harry.

The only Weasleys who mostly escape the bashing-treatment are the twins who found a successful shop (and are a little bit "american dream" like).

On the other hand we have Draco Malfoy (who is unreasonable wealthy) - and he gets apologized so often.

Than we have Snape, who comes from a typical blue-collar family, but when he get's apologized he often becomes "a Scion from House Prince" and has suddenly a manor - when we know he lived in a rundown house in a working-class area.

I think there is a pattern here.

That's right. I only once read a fanfic doing that. They struggled to afford Lilys school supplies and had to cut on Petunias education for Lily to attend Hogwarts. That was a really interesting take on Petunias jealousy - because her hate there was much more justified and not so petty (still not right - it wasn't Lilys fault at all, but more justified).

That's true. But Lily was a child in the 70ies. The 70ies in Great Britain were shit for the working-class. There was one of the biggest unemployment-crisis going on, wages reaching new lows etc. And the Evans lived in a working-class area, that's canon. So her family having troubles in buying school supplies is much more realistic than making her a wealthy middle-class girl.

They must be exterminated in order to make Germany stronger(obviously not my opinion im just comparing the narritve). What we did to the jews was a horrendous genocide that should never be repeated in any way or form. And the german people as a whole have a responsability to never let the world forget what fascism leads to.

All the way down to the whole point about this being allowed to happen because of people choosing their self interests over what they know to be morally right.

In regards to the comparison to the n word I would generally agree that the direct comparison is slightly shaky and potentially ignores the historical context behind the origin and use of the n word. All that said though I totally understand why people make the comparison, in general most people don't actually have that much knowledge about discriminatory language. For example most people even if they know about other slurs probably don't have the instinctual understanding of there offensiveness that americans posses with regard to the n word. So when they want to talk about mudblood as a slur they reach for the one they do know and at least on some level understand, as opposed to the more applicable examples that they are less knowledgeable about.

This ends up meaning they don't see any of the parallels between the events in the books and real life and the ideologies of Voldemort and the Nazis. The second, and honestly worse explanation in my opinion, is normally some sort of word salad that when boiled down amounts to "I don't like the media I consume to have political implications and therefore ignore said implications even when they are obvious".

Edit: I have a bad habit of writing sentences that are to long and was fixing that.

That's really sad. And not even true. The americans helped and without them it wouldn't be possible. But they didn't do it alone - and the red army did most of the hard lifting. For example: my country (as many others in europe) was freed by the UDSSR. The americans were just better at propaganda.

*************** Yeah a lot of it is that post ww2 america and the west had a vested interest in downplaying the contributions of the USSR. Though lots of people online overcorrect and pretend that the USSR could have done it all on their own, which ignores all the equipment sent to Russia by the US under the lend lease act. Like the actual story of ww2 is much closer to what allied propaganda was saying about it during the war. Namely that it was a joint effort of nearly the entire world with each country doing what they could to help.

*********** That's fair, I don't think its wrong to compare mudblood to the n word. As I said for most people the n word is probably the only slur they have enough knowledge of to make a meaningful comparison. For that reason I think its totally understandable for people to make that comparison. All that said though, just because something is a reasonable comparison doesn't mean its the best one to make. Any potential discussion of the term mudblood, its use in the wizarding world, its effects on Muggle Borns, etc... is going to be better served if its operating off of the most comparable irl example that exists. Given what we see in the text I don't think the n word is that best comparable example. To be clear it absolutely is a comparable example just not the best one in my opinion. Its generally pretty well understood that the subtext of HP is an allegory for the rise of Nazism and to a lesser extant world war two. Once you consider that fact and observe the specifics of the pure blood ideology that underpins the mudblood slur I think its rather obvious that the best comparison would be to the language used by thw Nazis to describe jews. In total fairness most people probably don't have a deep enough familiarity with this example to properly use it in such a discussion, so using the n word instead is understandable, though not ideal in my opinion.

I mean, when I read Harry Potter the first time, it was right in the middle of my schooling, and at the time we studied Nazi Germany. So yeah the allegory was obvious to me.

That being said, I'm French. My everyday, general conversation English is very good. My "how to insults a whole group of people" english? Not so much. Which I usually do not regret.

So ethnics slurs in English that come to mind when talking about this? There's really only the n-word that fit.

Now, googling it up, I think the best comparison would be the word Kyke. But I seriously never thought of trying to be that accurate in my comparisons.

************* Sorry, I generally operate in spaces where hyper specificity and accuracy are expected and so end up assuming that all serious discussions should be conducted in that way.

So, I had factored in the average english speakers relative ignorance about the nature of slurs and discriminatory language. For example in america at least many if not most people are fine with using the term Gypsy even though the groups who that term refers to consider it to be a slur and are greatly offended by its use.

I had not considered though that non english speakers would also be ignorant of other discriminatory terms, for good reasons though in this case. Thank you for bringing it up since I likely would not have considered this fact otherwise.

******** Okay, I get where you're coming from.

But on the other hand, do you also feel that way about people comparing other real-world racial slurs to the n word? Even if those other slurs don't have the same history, it seems rather tasteless and rude to tell someone "the slurs used against you aren't as bad as the slurs used against another group."

And sure, "mudblood" is just fictional, so it is literally not as bad as real other slur. But within the confines of the fictional world of Harry Potter, I think it is. And so when people are making comparisons within that world, I think it makes sense.

For example, if someone tried to call me out for casually using the word "mudblood" in these comments and compared it to using other slurs, that would be ridiculous and probably cringe-worthy. But if someone equated Malfoy's use of the word "mudblood" to a real person using the n word, I think that would be reasonable.

And for what it's worth, "mudblood" may not have a history of slavery, but it does at the very least have a recent history of attempted genocide. And I think we can all agree that those are both very bad things.

If we are attempting to find the best real world comparison for mudblood, which I think we should if were really going to understand it in context, then that comparison in my opinion is the language employed by the Nazis against the jews.

Though I totally understand that in a lot of cases people are just reaching for the example that they are most familiar with that fits, and in the situation using the n word as a comparison makes total sense.

I would not be surprised if they put more attention on their other child to a degree. They are thinking he is marked to kill Voldemort and possibly die in the process. They want him to at least have a good childhood, and to get all the training possible. - And while they love Harry they worry less about him, so Harry gets just this bit less attention. - it's not malicious, just two young people, barely adults, trying to do their best to raise two children while worrying all the time about the future of one of them.

And that could be enough to create friction and drama without ever demonising anybody, too.

That wbwl is still treated like the Golden Child and rarely disciplined and he doesn't have a painful/embarrassing condition to stem the ego. Harry would still suffer some neglect. Children even when they grow up are slow to forgive slights especially when they're frequent.

You be surprised how parents of sick children don't realize the healthy kid may be proud of them and understanding but it's countered with equal resentment (even if doesn't show at the time). Their world gets consumed with the sick child and don't relegate needed attention and resources to others as well.

No there doesn't. The "reason" for those fics existing could be with the premise of those characters being different.

There /never/ has to be a logical reason for any change in fanfiction though-- people can create whatever worlds they want.

****** Normally Harry is in the same room as the WBWL and when people show up after it all goes down they declare the other twin/kid the Boy Who Lived due to some scar from falling roof or the curse backlash or something. There could also be time or dimension travel things involved like a Harry travelling to a world where Neville was attacked.

Normally it is pretty much just a bashing fic as Harry's parents treat him like crap because the 'real' boy who lived needs special attention. I have seen it done decently a couple of times though, so I guess it is just like any other trope and it just needs a good enough author.

While they could both be the "Boys Who Lived" to the media, this is talking about the prophecy or Horcrux scar usually and the scars or scene can make Dumbledore declare one or the other as the defeater of Voldemort.

There is a good one shot out there about Dumbledore showing up and declaring one twin the boy who lived and saying Harry will have to be raised by the Dursley's only for Lily to flip out on him for being a dumbass. The separating them for their own good or because one is good/evil because he can feel the Horcrux scar is always cringy as hell to me. But you know those Manipulative Dumbledores need the twin to be declared the Boy Who Lived so the real boy who lived can be beaten down into a nice, easily manipulated minion for the Greater Good.

I poked around a few HP/LV stories a few years back because I had no idea how people would try to make that work (spoiler: most of them did not work), and came across a story called Abandon, where Harry is left in England by Petunia, and encounters Voldemort, de-snaked and hot now. Over the summer, they become romantically entangled, and plan to take out Bastard Dumbledore together. Harry swings a bunch of his friends (including Hermione!) around to the blood purist side, etc. At some point, it drops that Harry was raped by Vernon and Dudley as a kid, and has associated trauma.

At Christmas, Harry is at Malfoy Manor, and he brought Hermione along with his new Slytherin friends. He and Voldemort have taken Dudley from a mostly compliant Petunia (Vernon having already died) so he can be tortured, with Ginny Weasley insisting she get a turn too. Hermione is horrified, but Ginny is all for it, saying he's the kind of scum that deserves to be tortured, he's a threat to society, and Theo (dating Ginny) agrees with with her, joking that he's not just agreeing because she's his girlfriend, and then room erupts into canned laughter - including Hermione - who immediately forgets about being upset, and is just okay with it after?!?

Like, I was aware that I was going to see some STUFF when I chose to read the story, but I genuinely started to disassociate upon the canned laughter, because the moment was just... so much. Everyone laughing about torture, and the domesticity of Theo being cute and loving to his girlfriend, and all of the bad writing choices earlier in the story just washed over me all at once, and it was exhausting.

**** So, there were some more approachable ones where they revived the diary horcrux and had teen Tom Riddle and Harry fall in love while planning to kill the main Voldemort. They usually take a grey approach, with Riddle softening his plans significantly. There's still conflict with Dumbledore, but there's more space for him as an obstacle rather than a full out villain. You also get to avoid the part where Harry is suddenly okay hanging out with Death Eaters on the regular.

** I have two. Keep in mind: I USUALLY only have a problem with this when there aren't any warnings. Sometimes, I'll try the fic anyway then instantly regret it once I get to the parts that I'm talking about.

One is when a story has a good writing and an interesting plot but they're bashing a character or multiple characters, making them ridiculously OOC and hard to read about. It's kind of painful to see honestly.

One example is with James. They've got like, two or three genuinely decent reasons to hate him. They're not good but they're not necessarily bad either. Most of his haters just completely ignore the fact that James has so many good traits, instead focusing on the bad. It's irritating.

Another is with Ron. People love focusing on the ways he screwed up and shoving that into his face. I hate reading stories with Ron bashing. They're so cringy.

A third is with Cho. I hate how people portray her as some bully when there is no evidence that she is.

And my least favorite: Dumbledore. They'll make him manipulative but not very good at it. They'll make him manipulative, not very good at it, and downright evil. They'll make him into this monster despite the fact that, like Snape, he's a complex character that doesn't deserve the treatment he gets!

And come on, if you're gonna bash someone, at least make it consistent!

The other is when characters are insanely nice despite their canon personalities. If there's a warning in the tags or smth than yeah, I guess I can understand it but sometimes it's just ridiculous.

One example is with Bellatrix. I've seen fics where they make her unbearably nice and totally ruin her character. Bellatrix is a terrible person but she's loyal to the bitter end when it comes to her Lord.

Another is with Snape. He made mistakes, he wasn't a good person. The guy was literally the Wizarding version of a Nazi. Eventually, he moved to the Light side and it would've been interesting to see him slowly admit that maybe Harry isn't as bad as he thought but people just write him as misunderstood and well meaning when he usually isn't. It's hard to read sometimes.

The two things are almost always what make me turn away from a fic.

  Independent Harry without any semblance of intelligence and all the world's concentrated angst in his malnutrition affected body.

  Hermione can do no wrong: She being smarter than everybody in the history of ever, she is never wrong and we should simp for her greatness makes me sick. I would actually prefer some Hermione Bashing where she isn't brighter than Dumbledore, more beautiful than a Veela, and would like her just to be an uncreative hack who can only memorise her books.

  Ron Bashing: Thieving Bastard? Unloyal Prick? Secretly hates Muggleborn and Mudbloods?

  Percy Bashing: Ministry Stooge who can never be redeemed?

  Molly Bashing: Love Potion and Thieving Bitch? I want to essentially assist Ginny in her forced seduction and line theft of Harry Potter. I also hate the screeching harpy characteristic and would like her to be what she actually is, a mother who loves Harry as her own son.

  Ginny Bashing: Ginny can be written much better but she is basically always written as a gold digger and cheater.

  Dumbledore Bashing: I like Dumbledore who is actually manipulative and doesn't fold like a lawn chair due to Harry's Dollar Store Lesson in Politics.

  Voldemort is a Chump: He is the greatest dark lord in the history, and FFs treating him like a joke makes my blood boil. Also hate that Death Eaters are also a Joke.

  An Attempt at Politically Savvy Children which by their dialogue disproves the very premise.

  Phoenix Animagus: Also Basilisk Animagus Friendly Goblins who somehow have access to Horcrux Banishing Rituals, Healer Goblins, Inheritance Tests, Investing Goblins, Abandoned Vaults with Towers of Gold, Books and Artefacts. The concept of a Goblin friend amused me for a very short while and became intensely irritating after reading it a bunch of times.

  Harrison or Hadrian Potter: He is English, he is probably a Harold.

  Muggle Wank and Science Wank: Bullets are superior to spells when there are protective enchantments which can repel fucking projectiles. You think Muggleborn wouldn't instantly just have illegal enchanted firearms to battle Death Eaters? Also Science being Superior to Magic due to it following logic makes me puke.

  AKs, Cruicios and Imperios: Fanfictions treating them like Lumos, Alohamora or a bloody stunner. Makes me shed salty tears.

  Magical Community Bashing: Of course they won't be logical, they have magic as a constant which breaks the universal laws of reality with a flick of the wrist.

  Trunks with 12 compartments, a library, potion laboratory, ritual room, apartment, strip club?, Quidditch pitch whatever, etc. with a bazillion wards makes me mad.

  The extremely common and unoriginal take on the shopping trip in diagon alley. I actually like the shopping trip but almost all of them are super bad.

  A Harem with every single female character ever written in the series. If you run out, just gender swap male characters and create OCs.

  Hogwarts being a joke of a school: It's very rare that Hogwarts is actually written as the premiere school of magic.

  Room of Requirement Hax where it gives you any object you desire and create rooms to do whatever like Rituals and shit.

  Chamber of Secrets Hax where it has books written in Parselscript, the Basilisk is friendly and is abused by Tom Riddle. I always assumed personally assumed that it functioned as a hideaway and a ritual room for Salazar Slytherin.

  Occulumency is capable of creating a library, a castle and dragons, machine guns and rocket launchers seems like so much bullshit and making it so overpowered. Legilimency is used to read the mind like a book, especially after Snape explains that it doesn't work that way.

#+end_quote

It sounds like Daphne Greengrass, I'm pretty sure I have read fics where she has that kind of speech once or twice.

In my case, I don't think I have a particular fic in mind, though there are some "Scenes" that I hate in every fics they appear (and some of them appear way too much to my tastes). It's the usual things like the "Gringott's inheritance test" scene (usually followed by 5 000 to 10 000 words worth of "shopping trip in Diagon Alley"), or the rape/ near rape scene that is a common occurence with some pairing.

But if I had to choose the moment I hate the most, it would probably be the "justification scene" in the WBWL story. The scene where James, Lily, or both of them explain to Harry why they left him with the Dursley. Not only is this scene pretty much an insult to their character (they were ready to die for him but now they are famous they will just abandon him), but it's always so . . . stupid. It's always something along the lines of "/Yes we left you with your estranged Aunt even though we know she is not really a good person, but we didn't though it would have been that bad. Also you have to understand that we didn't have the time to take care of you because we had to raise your twin who is totally the favoured son. Unlike you he is famous so I'm sure you'll totally forgive us, especially now that you are also famous/".

As a result the Ministry decided that Harry's brother had to be bwl because a squib couldn't have been bwl. Harry actually has to leave because he has been attacked multiple times in the street. He also didn't get sent to the Dursleys but to an apartment in Japan thanks to one of Lily's friends. Remus also went with him and even ran his own bookshop. It was a crossover with Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. They actuslly are really sad to be seperated and wish that they could live together safely.

I also really hate Hadrian as a name,

Another thing that annoys me is when the author follows cannon religiously, this is a fanfiction and your copy pasting paragraphs from the books and movie scripts except your having your shitty thinly veiled author proxy oc saying all the things you thought were cool.

One last thing is when the author says “runes are exist like coding” and then their mc just bullshits their way through everything with the power of runes and 3 years of c++. I mean, they're not wrong when they say that runes is like coding and I'm fine with that, the part that pisses me off is when the mc does everything in one go or makes a mistake and nothing happens. Coding is fucking hard! You can't just slap some stuff together out of nowhere and expect it to work, in fact, the program could crash. Lunas mom blew herself up studying runes and your telling me that your mc can just do anything he wants because he “knows how to code” shut the fuck up your mc is gonna blow himself up.

I hate this, because Sirius did not know that. The first thing he says when he asks Harry if he'd want to move in with him is that he'd understood if Harry would rather stay with his aunt, his family.

Sirius knew he was with the Dursleys since he visited in his dog forms that summer between 2nd year and 3rd year. But he still thought that Harry would rather stay with them. He likely had no idea at the time that Harry was abused by the Dursley. He had no idea.

So no, Sirius would not be mad at Dumbledore for choosing the Dursleys. Maybe for not checking on Harry, or not moving Harry once they knew about the abuse, but not for placing Harry there to begin with.

Kinda like the will openings where Harry was set to live with <x> if Lily and James died, but explicitly *not* the Dursleys under any circumstance!

It usually comes along with Harry being savagely beaten and starved for days rather than the much milder abuse and neglect he received in canon.

I hate when people minimize the abuse harry suffered in canon, just because it could be "worse".

And beating and stuff may be worse to you but i grew up in foster care and have been beaten up by a family i was with and tbh i dont even jave nightmares about that shit anymore. You know what still gets me? I had a family that would put me into the crawl space as punishment (they called it timeout) and leave me there for hours. I still wake up in the middle of the night feeling like im back there. Harry spent his childhood eating scraps and living in a cupboard. You shouldnt categorize abuse as mild or greater its all evil and the people that do it deserve nothing but pain and suffering.

This was probably waay too personal but i see that line of thought a lot here and i really hate it

** If I had to pick just one, it would be there point where, in a severitus fic that was (nominally) canon compliant outside of the obvious For Want of a Nail elements, it became impossible to ignore the fact that the author was 100% on Snape's side when he demanded that Harry renounce James as his father and accept him purely because he's the bio dad. This fic took place in sixth year and didn't bother to tone down Snape's abuse of Harry, so it was /really/ apparent that the author was just expressing their genuine belief that a person's biological parents have an inherent and inalienable claim over them.

Don't get me wrong, it was /not/ a good fic prior to that (it was a drarry fic in which Harry apologising to Malfoy for calling him out when he outright stated that he doesn't care if his actions hurt innocent people was framed as a heartwarming milestone in their relationship), but the prose was solid, I was /very/ bored, and it was recommended on this sub as being good enough that even people who hate drarry and severitus can get into it.

A few more minor ones include everything to do with Bellatrix in Ghost of Privet Drive, (I have two rules for what I think makes her compelling in fanfic and this story breaks the more important one /hard/), Ashes of Chaos digressing to dryly exposit an irrelevant backstory to a character who had never before appeared in person, who will never appear again /since it's his death scene,/ and whose sole impact on the story is his death being used to blackmail a tertiary character for a subplot (which I wouldn't mind if it weren't a complete waste of time: his backstory has no impact on anyone or anything, and it doesn't teach the audience anything new about the world or any of its characters save for a literal John Doe), and Regulus' death scene in the defunct timeline of Prince of Slytherin, which stops itself to explain its own mechanics to the audience which hadn't been set up /at all/ (despite multiple opportunities), which immediately drained all the weight and tension from what should have been a tragic scene.

**** I wanna emphasise that these are rules for what I personally find compelling, and not some universal laws, but basically, she needs to be both lucid and in control of her own actions, and /not/ be movie!Bellatrix.

Absolutely any hint that she was tricked, coerced, brainwashed, or otherwise forced into joining the Death Eaters will immediately kill my interest in the character, if not the entire fic, especially so when the fic isn't clearly set up as being an AU, which is why it rankled me so much in Ghost of Privet Drive. As for the second point, portraying her as a cackling maniac just plain bores me. In the books, she acts like one when first interacting with Harry in order to goad him, but that's all it is: an act. She drops the facade the moment she decides to start taking him seriously. In the movies, though, there's no facade to drop: the act isn't an act, it's who she is. For whatever reason, the latter characterisation stuck.

Also, the spoiler code is >!!<, with the spoilers going between the exclamation points, fyi, and Regulus' "death" scene is about halfway through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/124/][chapter 124]].

Canon Snape was so pigheaded in his hate for both Harry and James, that even when Dumbledore pointed out he's much more like his mother he completely ignored these words as if he did not want to know it. Him actually looking at Harry and getting to know him well enough that he does a 180 is so out of character that if you believe he's capable of that you just don't get his character - he did the right thing for the wrong reasons, and that's what makes him complex.

** One thing I don't care for is Harry is the sole voice of sense and good ideas and the adults are turning to him to solve it or OK their plans, especially if he's only 11 or 12.

It mostly happens in time travel fics and isn't usually enough to make me nope out, but it is annoying.

Sure, time travel means a more mature mind, but Amelia, Minerva, Sirius, et al, don't know that. And just because the kid's got a good idea worth implementing, doesn't mean he should be final arbiter for all change.

Related: they aren't small adults! I get that it's hard writing young ages and I know I probably don't have it completely right in my WiPs either. Children generally don't have the knowledge or interest in topics like politics or finance that adults do/might have. Broad strokes and the practicum (a Weasley knowing a clothes mending spell for example, or learning how to haggle) maybe, but not the details. They generally express themselves in a simpler fashion even if they use £50 words. And some of the purebloods will have advanced interest in politics or social maneuvering because they were raised that way (if Draco didn't plunge so much, he would probably be quite good at this). But still, I think they are mostly the exception and not the rule.

Stories with both omniscient (?) Harry and too many precocious children generally leave a sour taste in my mouth.

Bashing just so done with the bashing. Flawed characters are what I want, not bashed to high heavens, and heck! They're often not even bashed for the things they did in canon, they're bashed for things that the fanfic authors make them do.

Using orbs or similar terms as eyes, just no.

I understand that this takes away a lot of stories for me to potentially read, but I'm okay with that.

In this one, Draco finds some pervy book with tricks (spells, potions, pick-up lines, etc.) to get his sexual fantasies fulfilled.

** So I was reading a fic where Snape died and got to relive his life. Not a great fic, but not terrible IMO.. well, so far at least. If you've read one "Snape gets to relive his life as young", fic, you know how it will go, but for me it was my 2nd fic with the premise (my first being The Peace Not Promised, one of my favorite fics overall), so it was still somewhat original to me. Around Year 2 or 3, James starts harassing Snape and Lily, mildly at first, then escalating over time. It gets pretty bad, and I've never liked James-bashing (or any bashing for that matter) which this devolved into. However, eventually it turns out that James was mostly innocent (past the first mild harassments, he intended to stop), but had been Imperiused by a Slytherin. Okay, interesting idea, will we see James and Snape bury the hatchet over it and become friendlier with each other? Anyway, the fic goes on, not much is happening beyond regular school stuff, and eventually we get to their final year.

That was the point when James decides to assault Lily.

...What? Why? What did this come from? Seriously? I lost all my goodwill for the fic at this point.

Then Draco said "but by the definition of the word, she is a mublood, isn't she?" and Fred agreed. So I suppose the excuse is that because this is how the word is used, the definition applies to her.

I'm not sure I should quote or reveal what fic this is because it's negative stuff, but that's pretty much how the conversation went down. Fred got mad at him because he disagrees, but by definition the word "mudblood" doesn't apply to Muggle-borns, so he shouldn't be able to say it does anyway.

**** I don't have a problem if an author wants to throw in a scene from the movies, what bothers me is if they don't actually depict it but only reference it after the fact as if it's canon. It's just my personal opinion that the movies aren't canon and obviously not everyone agrees with me, but it's a huge pet peeve of mine. I react similarly when an author twists past canon events to suit their narrative. I fully support changing canon events because I have zero interest in reading a canon rehash, but when changes are not depicted and only referenced, it's just lazy writing.

The issue I find is that a lot of writers land themselves in a no man's land between AU and canon divergence. If they've build up an AU where all the rules are different to begin with, great. Or they might go with a For Want of a Nail scenario where the world and rules are the same but one change has a ripple effect on canon events (that's my preferred type of fanfic). The problems start when they don't actually commit to an AU but just start randomly changing things to suit the story without any sort of justification.

** I think there's a general issue in all of fanfiction in general but /especially/ in this fandom of ignoring the canon, established written /authority/ of the original source material for what you “know” from fanon.

And I get that, I actively re-read the original seven at least every year or so, and even still I just either miss stuff or JKR has since ret-conned it in an effort to “No, no guys, I swear I'm woke I swear, keep buying my book and I'll fly the at-the-moment-politically-relevant flag over the Astronomy Tower I promise and Hermione was definitely black the whole time I swear and so on”, so the source material is at best dicey.

A fact in these situations is that people who read fanfiction but don't write it are almost always non-readers of the source novels and just watched the movies. And if you don't read the novels and just watched the movies, or worse Binge Watched the movies without time in between to process and understand the different nuances then it would be really easy to bash certain characters.

I had a year or so between the second movie and the third where not only did my sister introduce me to the books so I devoured those but I also grew as a person and started looking out for other people so I understood the maternal instincts showcased by Molly when she's screaming at Fred and George in the second film.

But if you don't have that growth, and that /long/ span of time between films and the next you see of her it's only been three real-life hours and all of a sudden she's telling Harry to calm down as he rants at the beginning of OOTP, she comes off as a one-dimensional screeching banshee with no nuance and is subsequently really easy to bash. And don't even get me started on how the films punched the one-dimensional shaft into Ron like they did.

TL:DR Fanon ignores canon (either nonsensically or even just with non-malicious ignorance), A bunch of Canon has been fucked and mangled anyway, and movies (due to limited time) make characters lack nuance and subsequently make them easier to bash.

I understand suspension of disbelief in a world of magic, but at least make them somethjng appropriately weird, not just a man with a womb and hormonal reactions of a normal pregnancy. how the hell would that even work? if you give them female-hormone related mood imbalances and all that jazz, shouldn't they also go through, I don't know, a process similar to a transgender person? and how messy would that be to go through for just 9 months?? no way a person can come out of that experience without some issues. People that go throuh hormonal therapy generally take time, and are followed by doctors, and do it to overcome serious issues. all those creepy male pregnancy fanfics seem to think - hey whatever the man will get pregnant, cry around like a strange overly emotional girl and do girly things and then be a wonderful mum with no psychological help needed and no gender issues beforehand or afterwards. suuuure. It's the height of biological ignorance and of disregard for actual real life issues. Fanfiction, especially hp, has been a great place for people to express and work through real life issues, and where diversity is welcomed and can be celebrated. apparently, not all diversity. it's sad. (and maddening. People, two spermatozoa cannot make a viable zygote. please. there needs to be an egg involved. HAS TO. otherwise you'll have a bunch of DNA in a lipid membrane with nothing to make an individual out of it. PLEASE.)

** My all time worst one is a huge /yikes/ moment when the author decided to give Harry the ability to tell when women had their period. And demonstrated that with pedo shit.

Yeah, I noped out of that one hard ASAP.

For a fic that I actually somewhat enjoyed on the whole, the closest I can think of is an author deciding to suddenly bash Ron to the extreme in the middle of the fic - when there wasn't even a reason to (it was a weird setup of an alternate Potter family arriving into the timeline after Harry beat Voldemort, and the alternate Harry was a celebrity/used to having fun. Just having Ron (and Ginny) be more into that than a brooding, PTSD Harry from the original timeline would have been sufficient, but... well, the author went /way/ overboard to set up Harry/Hermione when /it wasn't needed/ to get to that point)

** God, I was reading a Draco/Hermione fic where, instead of Draco growing out of his prejudice, he kept "explaining the pure blood side" except, while the author seemed to believe they were making reasonable arguments through Draco, they were actually just justifying eugenics. It was a long story and I finally failed out after listening to about 15 hours of it (using text to speech) because they just /kept casually talking about how great eugenics are/. The rest of what was going on was good, but the subject just kept coming up.

** I remember a fanfiction where Harry had a sister one year younger than him, names Darcy or something I dont remember.

In the end she joins Death eathers on Dumbledore's orders and also has powers that can heal people, everyone starts to hate her blah blah blah.

In the Narcissa decides she has had enough and takes Darcy and pulls out Lily, James, Sirius and Remus out if the veil, and they make some kind of potion or something.

Then after the battle she revives Fred, and only him not the other people who died. Lol.

In the end she marries Malfoy, which had no development.

Did I mention in her 3rd year and Malfoy's 4th her forced her to drink love potion, he punched her and he literally forced it down her throat, while she tried to fight him.

** Mine is definitely when dealing with discussions of matriarchal traits. Like Molly telling Ginny that they'll have similar traits/abilities, but saying “like a Weasley” or even “like a Prewett.” Unless the author explains that the naming or inheritance conventions are different from normal, such as being magically brought into the family and obtaining that family's gifts or what have you, that's just not how last names work. Molly wasn't a Weasley until she got married, so if Ginny gets something from being a Weasley then Molly wouldn't have it.

*** Guilty of that, it's my favourite ship. But it's only good if it's extremely AU and Hermione doesn't know Tom is Voldemort beforehand. I dislike time travel stories because, how? At best it's a very toxic relationship that should not be an example to young readers and should have a very bad ending. At worst, it's just plain nonsense.

But yeah, Colubrina's Pygmalion (it's very, very dark) where Tom is shifted in time during his seventh year and lands in 1996 Hogwarts where there was no Voldemort whatsoever and Dumbledore is viewed as a Grindelwald-slaying-hero and overall the background is consistent and believable; it's very good. Fortunately it's the first Tomione fanfic I ever read, which set high standards. Hermione is basically frustrated because people rely on her for homework and don't view her as magically capable otherwise; Tom sees her as she is, and decides upon seeing her that he has to let go of blood prejudice because it would not work in that timeline and she proved him wrong, being gifted and powerful.

I do understand why people would dislike the pairing, though.

**** I liked how Pygmalion had Tom let go of the blood prejudice. It always seemed to me that he got into it as a rallying thing for the Death Eaters because of the situation he found himself in at Hogwarts. It makes sense that he would drop it and go for something else in a different situation.

Doesn't mean he's not horrible, obviously.

When authors make characters have characteristics there's no basis for in the source, it tends to take me out of it. I then have to wonder, what's your axe to grind? It's hard to separate the story itself from the author.

That said, maybe it's just not my bag personally because I don't relate. Romance fiction is a strange category that way.

Specific fanfic: 1. A Marauders era fanfic in which Remus was kidnapped by Bellatrix and Greyback at some point and they tortured him with silver and he got bad burns on the points where the silver touched.

1. A Wolfstar+Jily fanfic on wattpad. The first 45 chapters where cute and fluffy. But then Sirius wanted to have a baby and so they go to St. Mungos so they give Sirius smth what makes him pregnant. Mpreg is not something I usually read or like, but ok, I continued because I hoped for more fluff. But nope. It ended. With a sad ending. Sirius had a miscarriage and Remus left him.

** Potter's Last will and testament mentioning to not leave harry with Dursleys ever. It's such a cliché, they were in middle of a Bloody civil war, harry would be safer with muggles at the time they would've created a will, Child abuse is never assosiated with a person of family until unthinkable happens.

--------------

Harry being secretly super intelligent or suddenly realising everything at once. Well it is plausible that harry hid his intelligence and intellect from Dursleys but he won't do that in Hogwarts. He wanted to remain at Hogwarts, he loved Hogwarts and he would try damn hard to ace his exams and return to Hogwarts.

He was just a average student not some super intelligent being hiding everything like many fanfics claim.

--------------

Everyone helping harry out of goodness of their hearts. I've read multiple shopping trips, gringotts trips etc where shop workers or friendly people help harry via breaking laws and selling him secret Auror grade contraband. Like you're selling a teen with unprotected mind and literary little political Power the stuff which would see you in jail if caught.

--------------

Magical folk looking more mature than they're during their teens and pre teens or Magical maturity relating to some sort of physical maturity where harry becomes a stud and Hogwarts become a naughty academy with teachers having affairs with students at every corner.

Teenagers are horny, it is a fact but I don't believe when I read about abnormal physical growth just because magic.
