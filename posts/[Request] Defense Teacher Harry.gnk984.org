- Could be while Harry is in Hogwarts as a student, or afterwards


** Post Hogwarts, Harry retires from the aurors and takes the defence post at Hogwarts. It's canon pairings, and 98k words, though its not finished yet.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly. Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Waking up in 1975, Harry is 23 and while waiting to find a way to get back to his timeline he takes up a position as the Defence Against the Dark Art's Professor. Having already been disillusioned to his father's bullying ways back in his fifth year Harry isn't going to stand by and watch as his father and his friends bully a man who Harry knew as a hero back in his time.

  It makes sense that when Harry has no idea what career path he should follow, that he would ask advice from the person whose job it was to advise him of his possible career options in the first place. Professor McGonagall is willing to help if Harry only tells her the truth.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
