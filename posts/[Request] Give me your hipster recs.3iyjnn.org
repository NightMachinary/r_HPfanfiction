It feels like I've read just about every decent popular fic out there, and I see them recommended over and over and it kind of makes my eyes bleed. To that effect, I have a massive hankering for less well-known, less-reviewed, less-recommended, but equally good fics. So, if you have any, send me any fic recommendations that aren't commonly read or commonly recommended on this sub, despite their quality. I'm fine with both dramas and comedies. Preferably no shipping, but if it's there and it's not an out-and-out romance, I'll take it. No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing or I'll hate the fic on principle alone. Should be at least 40k with less than 300 reviews. Thanks!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]: /Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress./

With only 79 reviews, this is easily one of the best stories with the least number of favs/reviews.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Für Das Größere Wohl]]:/Dieter Heydrich is a model German boy with perfect Aryan complexion, exemplary conduct in the Hitler Youth, and fanatical loyalty to his beloved Führer. But on his eleventh birthday, he discovers a hidden magical world led by Gellert Grindelwald.../

Another relative unknown. Completely unique setting, which alone makes it worth a read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/1/Lost-Time][Lost Time]]: /After his last battle with Voldemort, eighteen year old Harry wakes up in the future. He's older, next to a wife he never married and working as the Ministry of Magic's finest expert in solving murders. They tell him that he won, but Harry knows better.../

An excellently written mystery story that is always overlooked, probably because it was abandoned early. What is there is well worth reading though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]]: /The Dark Lord has conquered death, but Dumbledore's plan may yet gain a bloodless victory. Joined by a pair of unlikely bodyguards, an aging Auror and a brash Duomancer, Harry must leave behind everything--his friends, his school, even the girl he loves--to find the one thing that may defeat Voldemort. But can even the Boy Who Lived succeed if the journey should take him to the darkest part of his heart?/

My favorite story ever (one of the two, anyway) and still a virtual unknown. Epic scope, wonderfully woven lore and a beautifully written tragedy. This story is in a class of its own.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3675315][The Black Library]] is slightly under 40k, post-canon and canon-compliant, and a fun stand-alone read.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/153546][The Mistake]] and its (abandoned) sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/267155][The Hidden War]] is an interesting deviation from canon around the time of the First War with Voldemort that I wish would continue.

** I know the feeling, man. Looking forward to the replies myself. These are all the ones on my favorites list that are close to what you're looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless]]

Basically, Harry is a mostly emotionless psycho, but not a bad guy. Complete. 189 reviews, only 25k words though, sorry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5723954/1/Order-of-the-Phoenix-by-TIJK]]

Harry gets expelled at the trial before 5th year. Lives with and learns magic from Sirius. A little bit of Harry/Tonks. Abandoned. 49 reviews, 40k words

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared]]

Set before Book 7, Harry magically inherits all of Dumbledore's memories from the time he was a kid up to the time he defeated Grindlewald. Abandoned, I think. 286 reviews, 42k words

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3594614/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-the-Past]]

#+begin_quote
  This is a complete AU Harry Potter is a 21 year old wizard, who's on top of the world. He's rich, in love, and loved by all, but his life is turned upside down as a spiral of events leads to the ultimate battle between good and evil.

I'm still in the middle of reading it. Seems good so far. 332 reviews, 298k words.

Starnlicht By: Marquis Carabas

In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

I remember reading this and thinking it was a breath of fresh air.
