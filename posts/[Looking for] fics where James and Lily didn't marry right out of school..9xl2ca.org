A really loooooooong time ago, I imagined that though James was in love with Lily while they were in Hogwarts, it was only after they graduated that the two got to know each other and fell in love. It sort of sits better with me if they died while they were in their late 20's-early 30's rather than what canon said. Anyway, this is why there's fanfiction; maybe someone has written something with this idea already?
