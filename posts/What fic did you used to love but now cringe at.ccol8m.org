Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness was my all time favourite fic for a long time. Definitely doesn't hold up now.


** Came here to say the same fic as you OP.

At the time it was just so refreshing to see 1) a complete Hogwarts Neville's 7th year fic under the Death Eaters and 2) a properly dark look at an essentially Fascist group coming to absolute power over a group of young people helpless to stop them, and exactly what kinds of legally-sanctioned behavior would take place in that kind of environment.

Of course, looking back I clearly on first read managed to overlook some of the parts that went full circle from dark into camp, characters are sometimes less well drawn than I noticed at first, and then of course the author themself being a cult leader puts it all into a whole different light.

Having said that I don't think it's /as bad/ as some other fics. At least there's not (as far as I remember) gratuitous rape, sexism, complete gender stratification, odd humour that is very niche and misses the mark a lot etc. - like there is in many, many fics out there that are often actually more highly praised.

*** I have read this one a few times and I still enjoy it as it is the closest I have read that stays true to the story. Each time I read it though I see more that doesn't make sense. Like in DH we learn snape wasn't 100% (I will never love snape or think of him as a good guy) but he shouldn't have been that evil in year of the darkness. I do still enjoy it though and try to forget the whole cult leader bit.

Harry crow was another one I used to enjoy until I recently read "a different halloween" and realised that this robst guy has serious issues with Dumbledore and Ron and a sick fascination with making young children fall in love ðŸ¤®

*** I'll still defend DAYD. It's imperfect, some characters go a bit too far OOC, and it definitely tries a bit too hard to be grimdark and edgy, but it's overall a solid fic with some good ideas that have found their way into my headcanon, and makes the DA a credible resistance group. Plus I'm a sucker for badass Neville.

However, its sequel "Sluagh" was insane. Goes full bore on the gratuitous violence, rape and edgy tone.

A Peccatis, the third, seemed to be lining up for a decent mystery plot but then got abandoned.

****** That and the extremely drawn-out Azkaban arc are the biggest reasons why I can't ever see myself revisiting the fic.

The smaller reason is the introduction of the HPJEV character. I skimmed over Chapter 1 and I can't get over the fact that the premise exists because Lily gave Petunia a potion to pretty her up (or make her "fill out" in the right places), and this somehow gives Petunia a personality transplant, allowing her to marry a kind and intelligent professor instead of Vernon Dursley.

The more I think about it, the less I like it.

******* Funny - the Azkaban arc was the only thing I really liked about it. It's been a long time since I read it, but my memory is that it had this great, tense, Raiders of the Lost Ark or whatever feel to it and ended with the rocket-broom that was hilarious and stupid and whimsical in a way that actually felt like what the whole fic wanted to be - Harry Potter adventures with a heavy nerdy feel.

Almost the whole rest of the fic ranged from mediocre to painful to read and the only reason I kept pushing through was because it got SO much adulation online.

** Obligatory mention for Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

The idea of a Peggy Sue, competent and powerful Harry coming back to re-live a better version of his life sounds like an appealing premise. But watching the story unfold over several years, with the author's hiatus allowing me to gain some distance from the characters and plot, the whole thing turned into Harry's journey of grooming a harem of pre-pubescent child wives.

The story and worldbuilding had some interesting ideas, but more and more of it became consumed with "collecting" one of each type of personality. Ice queen, bookworm, sporty spice, and of course the classic fanon Luna, the naive nympho chick.

I dropped out when Indy!Harry had the cheesy courtroom scene with Manipulative!Dumbledore.

Whether it'a Harry raised by goblins, Harry kisses Hermione and all the Horcruxes and Death Eaters are destroyed in two chapters, Harry visits Hermione and kills the Malfoy's but Hermione's dad dies, etc.

Then after about six chapters every single one of them is the same old shit happening again and again. Bash Dumbledore and the Weasleys, change the wizarding world with no resistance, inherit a fortune, teach wizards about muggles.

Frat boy humor is a good name for what it is. It's like one of those early 2000's Rob Schneider and friends comedy movies which have casual "-phobic" jokes about dropping the soap or whatever, which passed at the time, but are now kind of awkward to re-watch in the present era.

********* It's definitely true that stories should be judged in context, but these people tend to take it too far. For example, it's totally fair to say "Cursed Child may be a bad book, but it is a good play." Sure. They're two different forms of experiencing it. But saying, "The play is good, so your opinion that the book is bad is WRONG" is wrong.

** I used to like Severitus, or "Snape the Mentor" fics where Snape warms up and chills out around Harry and takes a more active reasonable authority figure role in his life, instead of being purely antagonistic. I found them cathartic after canon, where I was disappointed that Snape's "Always" defined his adult life and yet he was still a massive dickhead about it. Severitus was my gateway into HP fanfic, though some of the ones written or started before Deathly Hallows have some weird and out-there plot resolutions, like linkffn(1390933).

I don't want to read another Severitus fic because Cursed Child has made Severitus canon, and part of my enjoyment in the genre was because I knew it was 100% wishful thinking, fanfic AU.

**** Severitus became a thing because of the "Severitus Challenge", a mostly Livejournal community effort to crowdsource and create Mentor Snape content. When I was deep into reading Mentor Snape, I stayed in the community archives and never had to look at the Snarry stuff.

If you're still interested in Severitus, [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]] is an existing archive community, but the interface is clunky and very dated. At least it's there... it's sad how many niche HP sub-communities have died out over the years.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness for me too. When I read it the first time, shortly after finishing DH, I really liked it. Ever since that chapter in DH where Neville explains what the DA have been up to while Harry and company were out Horcrux hunting,. I'd wanted a story about Dumbledore's Army. And DAYD was the first fic of its kind I'd read, so I think some of my like stemmed from it delivering the kind of scenario I wanted right then.

Then, some time later I decided to read the fic again... but this time it came across as a sexist, overly-angsty, self-indulgent angst-fest which turned Neville (one of my fave characters in canon) into an intolerable douche, and had so many "WHAT THE FUCK!" moments that I couldn't believe that I'd ever read this drivel and thought it was good.

** Linkffn(Legends of Potter)

This was the first HP fanfic I ever read. It introduced me to all the tropes, and having Harry inherit a fortune and become SuperHarry was a very fun ride for me the first time.

I went back to it a few years later and while I can still get through it, it really isn't very well written. I'm still glad it was the first one I read, but I'm more glad to see how my standards have evolved and exponentially increased.

Same with linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban). I think I read those to back to back with Harry Crow, HPMOR following shortly afterward. I can't get through any of these fics anymore.
