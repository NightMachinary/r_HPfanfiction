Quills are one of the most common targets that I see people criticize when talking about how stagnant the wizarding world is, and it's very understandable. But I'm looking for the opposite. Maybe even the cheap ones come with standard charms that make them impossibly comfortable, prevent hand/wrist strain, leave instantly dry ink, write ridiculously smoothly, etc.

Are there any fics where quills are far superior writing instruments?


** There was this fic that came up with a pretty good explanation imo. The headcanon there was that aside from the fact that it is tradition, using a quill instead of a pen or a pencil was crucial in drawing some runes and stuff. Now you could say that not many wizards or witches study runes so it doesn't make sense for all of them to be taught with a quill, but the explanation there was that it was just easier to teach everyone how to use a quill instead of trying to teach people who want to learn runes later. And I actually experienced a very similar thing in my elementary school, where they taught everyone how to write in cursive, even though most of us would never have to use it in our lives. The reason was the same.

*** I think it us highly enchantable. The monster book of monster comes into mind. Paper and pens are highly modular(not sure if my English is right) anyway, they are made up of pieces so they break down in presence of magic due to the ambient energy.

I remember where Harry has to charm a muggle pocket book to transfer content to a parchment book since the hardcover and paperback deteriorate just like plastics in the presence of high magic concentration. Parchment and quills are one cohesive organic piece.

Another I remember is when Riddle explains that quills are feathers for the same reason wand cores are feathers, it's magic conductive. If you write, you imbue your magic in it. It's why the torn name of Harry is enough to be accepted by the goblet as him putting his name in by proxyand was asks to latch on to his magic and not the one who put it in. Or why Ritas quill only write what she wish since it's her magic that's linked with the quill and writes what she wants not what is actually said.

Edit: Ps. I just realized I might be thinking of a different fic.

**** I have a similar head canon in that first, the quills are form a slightly magical bird that produce durable feathers, second, the "alive and magical" nature of them makes them much more suitable for enchanting them.

It's the same for robes and the like, if magic can take things beyond muggle limits then it's not really "behind the times".

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Just a comment on parchment. It is absolutely crazy, because there may be said something for quills, there is absolutely no reason anybody in year 1700 (or wherever the International Statue of Secrecy was enacted) used parchments any more, it was all paper. I think the only reason why JKR used parchment, was this picture [[https://images.app.goo.gl/DuFRSSmhnwXEEJCt6]] Also, it must be some kind of magical construct not a real parchment, because for each sheet of parchment you need (more or less) one sheep. Can you imagine? And all kids are acting towards that parchment like with paper. You don't make parchment balls from unsuccessful drafts of your writing.

** The thing is, if quills don't break then their writing feel on vellum (parchment) would probably be superior to that of any kind of ordinary pen. It's possible that people like Hagrid would want something more grippable, but he and people like him would be the only ones who'd complain.

A self-inking quill and you're done. You probably can even erase things cleanly by scraping the ink off the parchment.

** In my story, there are several reasons why everyone uses quills and inkwells.

All the special charmed inks (color-changing, etc) cause muggle writing utensils to explode if the ink is inside them. Also, graphite does not write well on the parchment used at Hogwarts so pencils are not a good option. Plus many of the ink-regulating charms placed on quills (to reduce quills from dripping so easily) only work on organic material, not plastics.

*** This is true. Quill ink was generally iron gall or a derivative thereof, which was /extremely/ acidic. The pH of such inks generally ranges from something like 5 to as low as 2. A modern fountain pen's nib would corrode into a useless lump of flaky trash quite rapidly, and a dip pen with steel nibs wouldn't do all that much better, although the nibs on those are easier to replace at least. Iron gall is however more or less completely permanent. It simply /does not/ wash out or rub off of paper or parchment.

Ballpoints use different kinds of ink (a thick gel that is generally oil based, as compared to the water-based iron gall and modern fountain pen inks) so the ink at Hogwarts would not work. Rollerball pens use water-based liquid ink, but they fall prey to the same fault that nibbed pens do in that the acidic nature of iron gall will corrode it to uselessness very quickly.

Another issue with modern pens using such ink is the pigmented nature of iron gall as compared to the dyed inks used today. A pigmented ink contains a lot of particulate (which gives it its color) but that same particulate will very quickly clog the nib and feed on a fountain pen. The ink is too thick and will also dry too quickly, compounding the issue. A dip pen would have no such issues as there is no feed and as mentioned previously the nib is easily replaced when it gets clogged or corroded.

As a side rant, quills (and dip pens, and fountain pens, for that matter) actually cause your hand to cramp /less/ than a ballpoint because you don't have to push the pen into the paper to get it to write. You can write on soft surfaces without sticking holes in your paper /and/ you can hold the pen at a more natural angle (ever tried to angle a ballpoint? It won't write at an angle lower than about 65 or 70 degrees, and the natural angle will generally be about 55 degrees or so) which puts less strain on your wrist so that, at the end of that lecture by Binns, your wrist doesn't want to fall off.

Quite literally the only real advantages a ballpoint has over a fountain pen or a nibbed pen (which technically, a quill is) is that it doesn't leak as easily and you don't have to carry ink around to refill it when it runs out since it lasts a good bit of time. In terms of long-term usability the nibbed pen will win nearly every time (ever seen a 70 year old ballpoint still being used?). I should also note that quills actually write for quite a good period as the hollow shaft of the feather acts as an ink reservoir. Also, quills can be sharpened with a knife to a new point if the old gets broken.

It's worth pointing out that dip pens only drip on pages when you hold them tip-down over said page. Hold it tip-up and you won't have any issues. :)

So now every time Rowling mentions Harry's hand cramping at the end of a lecture you have an excuse to roll your eyes and snicker.

*TL;DR* I know /entirely/ too much about pens and stationary and now you know why a fountain pen wouldn't work at Hogwarts (it would require modern inks that cannot be purchased in the wizarding world and dip pens would require replacement nibs for when they rusted or wore out). Ballpoints don't write well on parchment so a quill, which holds a fair bit of ink and is easily reusable simply by cutting a new point with a sharp knife, is the best solution.

Huh, this got pretty long didn't it?
