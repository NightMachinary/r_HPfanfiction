So I've always been a bit too much of a Dickens fan, and far too interested with things based around Christmas. A few years back I wrote a Christmas themed epilogue for each of my completed works as part of a December challenge to myself to keep writing on a month where I'm typically busy. This year I decided to up the ante.

After sending [[/u/Rpeh]] about fifty thousands words of Ithaca to deal with I was sitting around on December First and thought: You know what, why don't you just write an entire story for Christmas! So I wrote the first chapter and send it off to Rpeh who immediately responded that it was terrible, compared Harry rather unfavorably to a fic he hates, and called him a robot. He then did the annoying thing where he said I was better than it.

Now this was a problem because, ugh, expectations. It's supposed to just be Christmas fun and he has to go and ruin it like the silly little Brit he is with his obsession with extra U's and pointing out that I can't spell the word arctic. So I went back to the drawing board and redid a chunk of chapter one and wrote the rest of the damn thing.

And; honestly, I'm pretty proud of it. It's certainly better than Letters at any rate.

So Now, I present to you, linkffn(13459233) Twelve Days. Follow Harry Potter through the lows...and highs..of growing into adult hood and twelve days that shape his life and his future in a sappy six chapter (he wouldn't let me call them Staves because apparently only I would get that reference) romance featuring Harry Potter and a slightly aged up Gabrielle Delacour. Also the twins are alive because I forgot one died and didn't feel like editing chapter one to reflect that. So yay, it's a Christmas Miracle! We can ignore the fact that they're referenced like twice in the story at all.

All-in-all I hope you enjoy it. I'm really rather proud of it. I particularly like chapter four and five. But I hope it brightens your day and helps spread a little bit of Holiday Cheer. It's a little hard to believe my first fic was published nine years ago this month. I never really thought anyone would bother reading it. Or that I'd still be doing this over a million words later. Thanks for reading and reviewing, I appreciate it.

Expect more updates to Ithaca in the coming days. I did end up having to write about 50,000 words of the ending before I could do the middle because I needed certain parts to make more sense in my head. That just means once it gets toward the end, updates will come fast!

PS: If it gets over 150 reviews I lose a bet to Rpeh so if you want to make me owe him something....

And one again, a Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays to all. Thanks again for providing a platform with which I can embarrass myself in public.


** Well I mean the original Harry dialogue was one step short of:

"Engage greeting protocol", buzzed PotterBot. Gyros whirred and a hand extended itself. "Your presence charges my positronic matrix, Weasley (Bill)".

Bill shook PotterBot's hand, receiving a mild shock in the process. "Wow, Harry! I always get a charge out of seeing you", he laughed.

"Charge. Shock. Referencing thesaurus. Thrill. Excitement. Humor recognition protocol suggests attempt at a joke. Ha. Ha. Ha."

And we all know that [[/u/Te7]] can do much better. And he did. He's exaggerating though. The rest of chapter one was great. As is the rest of the story. Except chapter four should be called Danse Macabre. Once you've all read it you can come back here and tell him he's wrong.

The final result is a heart-warming story that I've thoroughly enjoyed reading.

Being the beta reader was an honour. I was happy to do the favour and it added colour to my December. It's cold in Scotland, being so close to the Arctic.

Next it's back to the interesting job of trying to beta a story where you have the first couple of chapters and then the (end-4)th chapter but none of the middle. Just as well I like his writing...

** Read the entire thing in one go yesterday and have to say I loved it. Always nice to see a story with actual problems adults face, and Harry being a Quidditch player is always a plus in my eyes.

Merry Christmas!
