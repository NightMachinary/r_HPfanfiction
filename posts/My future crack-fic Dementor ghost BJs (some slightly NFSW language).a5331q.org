So a bunch of us were just talking in the #fanfiction channel in the [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] Discord and someone joked that they wondered if there's a Would You Rather game in the HP universe wherein kids would have "stick your dick in a dementor's mouth" as an option.

‚Äã

So now I'm gonna write a crack-fic where Dementors figure out they can get nourishment from sperm and then start swopping down and handing out great BJs to random people.

‚Äã

This is my tentative summary (be kind. I whipped it up in, like, under a minute): [[https://imgur.com/a/wJxwSrk][Cursed Text]]

‚Äã

So, what do you guys think? Good idea? Bad idea? Brilliant idea? Hot idea? You're already touching yourself? Would you read it?

** I think that if you are going to make an entire story just treating widespread sexual assault of random people as a big joke, and not only that but to endorse and condone it because "they're GREAT rapes, not BAD rapes!", then I am never going to read it, and I will actively denounce and deride it for even existing as a concept in your mind.

*** Okay. I'm just going to comment on this because you've set me up for a great differentiation.

No, perpetuating rape culture is not a good thing. Widespread sexual assault is obviously a bad thing.

The difference here is that, the last time I checked, no one was being raped by ghosts. Or dementors, if you want to be specific. There is literally no one who could relate to having their cock sucked by an invisible person. No one.

So who, exactly, is the potential real-life victim that this post would be ‚Äúparodying‚Äù? Who is the person who could read this and say, ‚ÄúAs a victim of sexual assault via ghost lips, I don't find this very entertaining!‚Äù

I'll give you a hint: they don't exist.

*** So this forum again shows itself to have a real issue with perpetuating rape culture - among other things. What a surprise. Or, no, wait, is this just my usual set of downvotes that I get on every post? How to tell, how to tell?
