Authors who have a diverse collection of fanfics, where they tackle different genres, tropes, ships, etc.


** I think Lomonaeren is definetly out there with different tropes and a lot of finished fics

** I absolutely love Tsume Yuki. They always have super interesting plotlines and the writing is amazing. A lot of their stories are complete. There are a few stories however that have really interesting plots but are discontinued - but very few stories fall under this.

** ShayaLonnie has to be up there. She makes every ship she writes for 100% believable.

** Delphi writes a ton of ships and everything she writes is great. Some are totally offbeat like Silvanus Kettleburn/Severus Snape or Aberforth Dumbledore/Irma Pince. FemmeQuixotic has a lot of amazing Snape-centric fics both slash and het. Each fic has a totally different style. Eldritcher is incredibly versatile when it comes to characterizations and world building. Again pretty offbeat like Tom Riddle/Viktor Krum or Minerva McGonagall/Lucius Malfoy.

Rare pairs authors have a lot of versatility in my reading experience.

** Jeconais, who has pretty much stopped writing, has a wide range: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]] (sorted by pairings). I particularly enjoyed Motivations, Enslavement, Perfect Situations, and This Means War.

** Megamatt09 for sure. Who else manages to write 1 million words with 300+ ships across fandoms and still not have one properly fleshed out character?

** Starfox5 has a lot of common themes going through all the fics, especially with the characters, but the setting is usually completely unique. Lots of very creative concepts like good Grindelwald or a literal Voldemort ship.
