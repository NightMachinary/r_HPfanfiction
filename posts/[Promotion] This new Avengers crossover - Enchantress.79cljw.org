Anna is a fun character. Small, unimpressive at first glance, but feisty and dangerous.

Edit: Not my story. Dunno if I used the tag correctly.

**** You did, sometimes it's just hard to tell whether people are promoting for themselves or others.

I do like this fic, but then, I like all avengers crossovers, haha. Definitely a bit spastic of a character. Will be interesting to see if this translates into combat. I also wonder if this legitimate wizardly eccentricity a la Dumbledore, or if this is just how the author writes her, if that makes any sense.

Now I want to write a Harry that's spastic AF due to the overwhelming magical stimuli that comes with higher magical learning.

***** I'd love to read a fic where most wizards are that way, or at least the powerful ones.

**** Aren´t you a fan of the literary masterpiece known as twilight or the award winning Vampire diaries, it got the award for the best TV twist in 2010 by IGN or are you just not a fan of the fic itself? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) (Am I using that Lenny face right?)
