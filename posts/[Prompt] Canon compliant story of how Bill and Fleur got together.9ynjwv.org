As title - there's a lot of stories of "Harry x girl" but not a lot of stuff about things he's not there for. Understandable, considering he's the narrator, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to read a well written romance about canon Bill and Fleur.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This maybe something that you are definitely looking for plus more than you can ever hope for. It's not exactly about how Bill and Fleur got together, but how the war has affected their relationship after their marriage.

This fic takes place during the Deathly Hallows book from the perspective of Bill and Fleur plus Percy and Audrey as the other main pairing. The story boils down to how they viewed the war and how they had gone through it all. The character interactions feels real as well as how well develop each relationship has grown.

I also love how closely cannon the story is and how beautifully weaved it is. I cannot express how much I recommend this fic.
