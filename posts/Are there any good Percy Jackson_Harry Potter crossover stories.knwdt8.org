I've just finished reading Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d, and I'm wondering if there are any good stories that are like it. Preferably no character bashing, and well-written. Most that I have found have very poor quality. Thanks in advance!


** Still out here waiting for a Percy/Luna fic. Getting more and more convinced I am going to have to write it.

**** I certainly will. The pairing was from someone else's misunderstanding on Reddit (Percy Weasley vs Percy Jackson), but it has been stuck in my head like peanut butter since I saw it and I really want to read it!

***** I read a Percy Jackson fic when Ron got confused at the name Percy asking if it was his brother. Don't remember much from the fic but that part was funny. Percy called every Weasley by their name and then called Percy Weasley though it wasn't a big part in the fic maybe a page of it.

**** So I started it. The idea turned from a one shot about just them to a rather long story about multiple characters, but I'm excited for it - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28535484/chapters/69926889][AO3]]|[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13786382/1/A-Sorcerer-s-Stone-A-Demigod-s-Sword][FFN]] if you want to read it.

** linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is probably my favorite Percy Jackson fic, though it is still just getting started. What really sold me on it was Persephone being a main character and the actions she's getting up to.

  The last thing Harry wanted to do was cause trouble in a world where gods and fate existed. If only it was that simple. MOD!Harry, Phoenix!Harry, gen.

  The Sea has many moods, many faces. This is mirrored by its children greatly. The icy seas shift and tide against the shore of a difficult path. Watch as a small ripple becomes a mighty typhoon in the world of monsters, gods, and demigods. Fem!Harry. Years One-Three, complete! Thanks for the support guys and gals! Book 1.
