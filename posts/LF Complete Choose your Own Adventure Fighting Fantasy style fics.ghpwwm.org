Ideally with Harry as the Protagonist and not Generic boring OC, but a Choose your Own adventure Harry Potter Fanfic, ideally down to having stats and having to roll dice to get past everything. I was playing Warlock of Firetop Mountain on Steam and i felt nostalgic for the original book version, and thought why not a fanfic.
