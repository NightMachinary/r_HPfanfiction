:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
[FOUND] (Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy) I read a HP fanfic a few years ago that I want to revisit. In the fanfic, Harry learns about wandless magic early, and then goes to a fourth school for prodigies. I think the headmaster of the fourth school undermines Dumbledore by getting Harry first. Harry goes to school with a fire elemental, and it covers until the Triwizard tournament. Going into the great hall, the students sing a song that includes, "Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead." I remember a lot about it, but I can't remember the important ones. Any help finding this would be appreciated.
