im getting tired of reading certain things, as much as i enjoy reading in general its boring that most of the fics i read still have to have plot points from canon: the stone, basilisk, etc etc... so can anyone rec me either some good post dh fics or fics that are so AU the previous problems wont happen. (i would like if theres no slash and i enjoy different pairings but its not a must)


** check out linkfnn(Circular Reasoning), extreme AU with an semicrrazy PTSD suffering 28 year old harry in a postapoltic London who ends up being sent back in time to when he's 13, this story is so grimdark it makes game of thrones look like the telly tubbies, contains lots of graphic torture, murder also avoids many common plot points, and their is covert/spec ops for the minsitry who are competent assassins/torturers, unlike other similar stories (nightmares of futures past and wastelands of time) harry actually does "evil things" to "innocents"

** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity)

American AU that might as well be canon of its own. Early predictions suggest the upcoming Fantastic Beasts movies will pale in comparison.

linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas)

Set in the same world but occurring in 1590, it's a murder mystery with a witch in the Private Eye/Troubleshooter role.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

A collection of stories about Jasmine Potter (fem!Harry) being trapped in the distant past and trying to stay out of the way of history.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is so content and there are stirrings of unrest. A new adventure starts with the theft of a mysterious artefact from the Ministry of Magic . . .

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
