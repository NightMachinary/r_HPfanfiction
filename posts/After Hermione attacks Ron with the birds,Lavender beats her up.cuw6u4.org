** Harry uses magic to defend Hermione, Ron defends Lavender from Harry.

The sound of spellfire attract the Gryffindor common room. Soon the Gryffindors have picked their sides. The battle escalates until the whole school is in a civil war.

Ravenclaw threw their weight behind The Queen of the Nerds and her King; The-Man-Who-Won-The-The-Battle-Of-The-Library. Hufflepuff directed their loyalty to the Queen of Gossip and Weasley-Is-our-King. Most of the Weasleys are Behind Ron, but rumor has it that The Twins provide better weaponry to team H&H. No one really knows who the slytherins are behind, with some being accused of playing both sides.

The bonds forged in the heart of a school war are not soon forgotten, Harry proposed the day after the final battle.

*** I'm not entirely sure Harry would +defend+ back Hermione in this case, but rather try to break up the fight, while shielding everyone from anything harmful.

The rest is pretty funny.

**** He'd break up the fight, and defend hermione. Doesn't mean he'd attack lavender. I doubt she'd use a curse that would get through his shield charm

***** I agree with this. I really meant back, but word choice is a funny thing.

** "Not my boyfriend you /bitch/!" Lavender launched herself at Hermione, attacking her with all the jinxes and curses she knew.

Hermione, unaccustomed to any manner of retaliation, was taken off guard. Her teeth were lengthened again, her hair turned to snakes and biting her.

Harry quickly took action and undid all the transfigurations in the room. A look at Ron passed all the information on what he was about to do. Harry looked at Lavender, nodding his headz showing her understood why she did it.

Harry picked up Hermione and started taking her to hospital wing. He leaned in to say, "Hermione, just because Ron did something you didn't like doesn't give you the right to attack him. I won't report this to McGonagall, but look at how you're behaving this year and think to how many friends you'll have if you continue like that."

*** Uhhh... that is not what would happen. Harry would be nowhere near as calm towards lavender. Hermione isn't in the right here, but Harry just looks and sounds like an idiot in your answer
