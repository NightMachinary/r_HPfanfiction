I just went back and reread the books and I was very confused when the Goblins didn't help Harry get the Potter family head of house ring.

I was also frustrated that Harry didn't speak like an adult and have intimate knowledge of the political structure of wizarding society in Britain.

**** First time I saw it in a fanfic I was like "Wait, what?" and went back to check, because there is absolutely NOT A CAT'S CHANCE IN HELL that the kind of person who owns a manor house (and may actually be lord of the appurtenant manor, although that isn't said in canon and most fanfic authors don't know about manor dignities either) asks the kind of person who grew up in what is strongly implied to be a council house to stand as godfather to his son. I'll believe in feckin' magical cores before I accept that english country gentry of the likes of Lucius Bloody Malfoy would do something like that, still less that a snotty cow like Narcissa would give him a moment's peace over so much as the mere suggestion.

**** A halfblood having familial relationship with a pureblood?

iirc in canon there's next to zero suggestion of /any/ closeness between Lucius and Severus at all. The only interactions between Malfoys and Snape are between Draco and Snape and (once) Narcissa and Snape, in desperation, reaching out to the head of her son's school House and a known ally of her husband's faction.

Some Tumblr Snape fan said her friend told her that Tom Felton told her friend that JKR told Tom Felton this during the shooting of one of the movies (GoF IIRC).

(However, I could've sworn I heard Tom Felton confirm this at a con panel, but can't seem to dig it up -- though to be fair I didn't try all that hard. Pretty sure I heard it on an early episode of Pottercast, so feel free to search if anyone really wants to put this to bed.)

"friend" is putting it very loosely, here. We never see Snape interact with any Malfoy who isn't Draco until Narcissa gets desperate enough to go to Cokeworth in book 6. On the canon evidence we can only say "happen to be members of the same organised crime gang" and that doesn't even imply that they like each other, never mind friendship.

If you consider this with how Snape favoured Draco is pretty obvious that they are friends.

******* Rowling does call her popular and 'quite a catch', compares her to Ginny once. So she's definitely nowhere near Hermione personality-wise aside from the obvious: clever, justice-driven, and brave. Besides, she's sitting and laughing near the lake with her feet dangling in it in SWM with a gaggle of girls, Hermione would never do that.

I find that weird as well since Hagrid refers to Sirius as 'young Sirius Black'. If all the members of the Order were that young he wouldn't need that particular adjective. However, we know Sturgis Podmore attended Hogwarts in the same era (I think 3 years older), but he was a bit older so yeah, recruiting youngsters wasn't all that unusual actually.

**** It's my understanding that the Privet Dr protection is not really associated with the property itself, just that Harry lives with Lily's blood and "calls it home". Harry is protected at all times and all places until he is of age because of this, which directly explains why Quirrell died touching him in first year and possibly implies the rest of his lucky escapes were influenced by the protection as well.

***** Those are actually two distinct protections, one was the protection of his mother's sacrifice, the other was a charm placed on him by Dumbledore based on his mothers sacrifice.

The former stopped Voldemort from touching and Harming him in general, while the later only protects him while he lived in the same place as somebody who shares blood with his mother, but seems to include Voldemort's followers as well.

When Voldemort uses Harry's blood to recreate his body he manages to get around the magic of Lily's sacrifice(kinda, he can now harm and touch Harry, but not actually kill him permanently), but Voldemort never managed to get past the charm Dumbledore placed on him.

He never tried. It was an unfired Chekov's Gun. Hell, for all we know, it could be like the "protections" on the Goblet of Fire. It gets talked up, and it turned out to be an age line.

There's all sorts of various ways they could have gotten to Harry IF they really wanted to. It's just that nobody really bothered.

It obviously wouldn't have been hard to have an "attack" happen in the summer between year 5/6. Voldemort gets rebuffed and injured, and things quiet down a bit, but some Death Eater attacks happen anyway. It would have been the sensible thing anyway, as it would show to Harry that all of his suffering at the Dursleys wasn't for nothing. And it essentially was. Nothing was shown to be gained from it.

No, they knew the plan for what was going to happen. What is easier: attacking a house the defenders could use as a position of strength, or ambushing a group of people on broomsticks with a large group of people? Throw in some dramatics that JKR I mean Voldemort usually goes for and you have what happened.

If Voldemort really wanted Harry dead, he could have paid the Dursleys to give Harry to them. Or spelled the house from a distance. Or sent in a giant.

No, they used guerrilla tactics, fear, and overwhelming numbers. That has been present throughout ALL of the books. When it came to open battle, it was either win or escape. Later, they used the guise of the government to do it.

Hell, the battle of seven potters? They showed up with overwhelming numbers AND imperiused fighters. That says a lot right there. If they can't bulldoze their way in, they don't do it. Moody could have seen them appear, they set up defenses and fight until aurors arrive. And then you have a big open battle in muggle territory. Eventually the cops would show up.

Not only that, but Rowling treats these things with so little care. It doesn't bother me as a reader, but I definitely see why people don't like that. I think that's where the divide between some fans comes from. The Dursleys absolutely abused Harry even looking just at what is in the books, but it's really glossed over like a fairy tale. Same thing goes for all of these charms, potions, etc. If you did something like that in our world, it would be terrible, but in Rowling's world, it's laughed off most of the time.

**** The only spell aside from the Fidelius that is overtly mentioned is /Repello Muggletum/ which makes muggles approaching the /Charmed/ location believe they are needed elsewhere. Even then, Hogwarts is charmed to look like a ruined castle as a back up.

Something else is likely going on with The Leaky Cauldron as the narration implies even Harry wouldn't have noticed it of Hagrid hadn't pointed it out:

#+begin_quote
  /It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside./
#+end_quote

The entrance to St. Mungo's is concealed behind an abandoned red-brick London department store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. on a Muggle street. Unlike the Leaky, St. Mungo's /is/ visible to passing Muggles, who merely believe the sign on the front that the store is "Closed for Refurbishment."

To me it seems like canon leans towards illusions rather then mind alteration as a basis for protection.

Personally I'm tempted to accept all of the "Extended Canon", but since it include sthings like "/Before the instalation of plumbing during the XVIIth century, witches and wizards defecated anywhere on the floor and then vanished the mess/", I kinda cherry pick informations from there.

Anyways in the case of Daphne, informations are as follow:

- Book Canon: Daphne is a girl in Harry's year (since she is taking her OWL at the same time).
- Extended Canon: She is also in Slytherin, part of Pansy's gang and her family are indeed blood purists. Also her little sister marry Draco.

#+end_quote

I hate the "Sealed Will" trop so much.

First of all, while it may depend of the "Inheritance laws" in magical Brittain, it is pretty likely that a will, in the case of James and Lily Potter would have been useless. In most case, everything goes to the next of a kin, if you want to will everything to your son (who is next of a kin), you don't need a will to do it. It is different to Sirius case who wanted to ignore his next of a kin (probably Bellatrix I guess) and give everything to his godson, Harry.

Also, people often say that since they took part in the war, they must have thought about making a will. 17 years old people rarely have this kind of maturity, at least in the muggle world. And by the time they became target and a will would have been reeeealy usefull, they were in hiding and did not really have the possibility to do a will.

And even if they did make a will, they went into hiding while Lily was pregnant, and spent all their time in the same house as him after his birth. So either they had a will from before Harry's pregnancy and Harry is not mentioned (sorry kid, your parent accidentaly disinherited you by not updating their will, all of their belongings went to one Sirius Black, he is in Azkaban now) or was updated after his birth, when the death of James and Lily meant he would also die to (unless he somehow managed to survive a Killing Curse, vanquishing the Dark Lord in the process but not sure they thought about this possibility).

​

But even if the existence of this will is unlikely, the reason why I hate it so much is that 9/10, having this trope means you will go right to "Manipulative Dumbledore" territory. Every times Harry manage to "unseal" his will, one or several of the following will happen :

- /The legal representant of Gringotts (sealed will are always at Gringott) will read the will wrote by James and Lily where they make a lot of jokes and say how much they love Harry./\\
  Rarely funny and I'm pretty sure you can't do that with your will (writing jokes and things like "I hope you will be popular with girls, woops Lily hit me on the head") but why not, probably the least annoying thing of all (though I don't understand why authors never make a "serious will" with all the legal lingo, and a sealed letter to give to Harry where they can mess around as much as they want).
- /The Potters explained in their will that Sirius was not the Secret Keeper, so he is innocent and the true traitor is Peter Pettigrew./\\
  Because while being in the middle of a civil war, where mind reading, truth serum and mental control exist, and after lying to everyone, including your friends and mentor, you put the one information that could put your security at risk in writing, knowing it would end up either in a bank (managed by a race knowing for not liking any human, and ready to betray if paid enough), or in the ministry (a place full of supporter of the bad guy and mind controled guys).
- /The Potters left a list of potential guardians for Harry, and made it very clear that he should not, under any circunstances, goes to Lily's sister./\\
  Ignoring the fact that, if they died, it was pretty much assured that he would die with them, said list includes people like Marlene McKinnon, the Longbottoms, or any OC characters that would appear when Harry is 13/14 to raise him far of the Dursley (and usually in a rich house but whatever). Well usually, most of the people of the Will list are dead or as if by the time Harry read this so cool , Dumbledore was right. Would love to read a fic where Harry really goes to someone like the Longbottoms, shortest story ever, killed in 3 days because Bellatrix attacked them for another reason.

So yeah, dislike this trope.

James Potter was basically Draco so you get the impression he is from money. The Potters could be sacred 28 however for no known reason they are not.

Then Sirus left him everything so not only does he have the Potter fortune he also has the Black money.

Finally what about other houses like an actually Potter home or Manor and a Black manor? You can sort of see why Dumbledore might have kept the knowledge to himself and why he did nothing about the order headquarters.

Interesting idea for a fan fiction, War over and Harry finds out he is richer than Draco.

He got into an argument about it with Godric when he tried to convince the other Founders to take only pure-bloods and eventually left the school.

Salazar didn't take over Britain, launch a purge of all Muggleborns and make Hogwarts teach Dark Arts to students. As far as we know Salazar Slytherin wasn't a Dark Wizard of any kind.

In the book, the worst Vernon does is to rough him up and push him (which is still bad). He never hit Harry. (Thought it's not from like of trying sometimes).

I think I read somewhere it was JKR intentions at first to have the Dursley physically abusive, but she toned it down to neglect and emotional abuse - and bullying from Dudley - because it was too dark for children, or something like that. Someone can confirm this ?

I kinda of like it when it's done well, canon Wizarding world is very shallow in most parts, JKR worlbuilded just as much as she needed too, or when people asked her about stuff(I believe some of those things she just thought up on the spot), people expect her to be like Tolkien or Martin when she's /not/(and there's nothing wrong with that).

So when people AU things a bit to spice it up, I like it, much better than constrain the story to a very limited canon

Her editors asked her to tone it down, they did it with a few other things(Horcrux ritual would be described but it was too dark)

I still think it's fair to assume, Harry implies it a few times and we see Vernor try to strangle him and Petunia try to hit him with /frying pan./

It's on the Black Family tapestry, and is the title of a chapter in Book 5, and that's /it/.

Wizengamot members are selected (with implications that the Minister has final say), positions are not hereditary in canon.\\
The Potter family made its fortune with good investments and inventions, they most /definitely/ weren't titled.

Another fun one: The will of James and Lily Potter wasn't sealed by anyone. If it were, Harry probably wouldn't have a vault at all.

There is no Canon reason why the Potters are not sacred 28 so his wealth never really makes sense however he is also Sirus' heir so he has the Potter and Black fortunes so his wealth is what ever that adds up to.

**** And why does "dark" automatically mean evil? It does not. Parseltongue, the deathly hallows, blood wards and magic, etc. are all seen as dark, but they're not evil. It depends on who uses them.

Think of a pen. Is the pen itself evil, or the way it's used?

It's why I don't think dark magic is inherently evil. After all, you can kill people with light magic, too. (Think of levitation, floating, summoning, banishing, and many other charms)

JK Rowling is just a prejudiced fuck of a Gryffindor. She doesn't see the possibilities of dark magic. Just because it's dark doesn't mean it has to hurt everyone. And just because magic is light doesn't mean it always helps. What could light magic do to help Dumbledore's hand? I'd bet you that dark potions and spells heal dark curses, so the potion Snape used could very well have been dark.

****** So, let me get this straight, there is bad magic and there is also normal magic? Fuck no. Good and bad are always equal. If there is light, there is also dark. But that doesn't mean either can't be bad or good.

Who exactly said that dark magic always inflicts pain and suffering? Dumbledore and his lackies? They're all so light the sun might as well shine out of their arses. Dumbledore is light, but he's pretty manipulative and I hate the bastard. And the only sort of dark magic that Harry saw and knew was dark was only the kind that hurt people. Dumbledore would have made sure that Harry thought that the light was the best option, so he didn't tell Harry that the blood wards were considered dark by the ministry. And he didn't tell Harry that Lily likely used a blood ritual that included carving a rune into Harry's forehead (before you ask, sowilo is not the wand movement of the AK). So, really dark magic is NOT inherently bad It's just more.... heavy... Than light magic. It's the sort of magic that normally includes sacrifices (emotions, magic, life, etc.).

So, really light magic is the more "giving" magic, while dark magic is more "taking".

******** Did I not give evidence? Fine then.

Plenty of mothers have sacrificed themselves for their child, but their deaths have never created a blood protection. Lily must have done something. I believe it was a ritual. Sowilo is the rune of success, so Lily carved it to make sure the power of the ritual went to Harry. Now, Lily was already going to sacrifice her life for Harry, but she still sacrificed herself willingly, even though Voldemort gave her a few chances to step aside. That would have been ideal.

Also, don't you think it a bit fishy that Lily let herself die while knowing that Harry had no other protection, and that Voldemort wouldn't spare him? Lily must have known something would protect him. That's why I think she must have used a ritual. The blood wards had to come from somewhere, too. Dumbledore must have utilized the power from Lily's ritual to make the wards.

And, while I suppose that Light magic was not mentioned in the books, the type of magic that they use IS light. Even if you don't believe me.

Also, don't talk about something that YOU have no idea of. You don't even have evidence to back up your claims.

***** The problem is (and this is exaggerated in fanon) that dark magic is used in two different ways. On one hand, all magic that is intended to harm is considered the "dark arts," even simple jinxes.

On the other hand, you have forbidden and/or illegal dark magic. These seem to be things that have some clearly evil aspect to them, such as corrupting the user (Unforgivable Curses--you have to /mean/ them), violating a taboo (e.g. Horcruxes), or being more than conventionally destructive (e.g. Sectumsempra, Fiendfyre)--this last category being being forbidden for the same reason we ban chemical weapons.

But literally every KHR fic I've ever read has a bunch of details about flame magic added that's the same in every fic but I'm very sure wasn't in the manga. Like people with sky flames being able to form some sort of spiritual guardian bond with other flame types. Maybe it's from some supplementary material, but I doubt it. I'm assuming at one point a fic did it, and then everyone copied it and now no one remembers that it's fanon. I don't even dislike it, it's fairly interesting world building, it's just odd that it's so ubiquitous, even beyond the common stuff in HP, like Snape being Draco's godfather.
