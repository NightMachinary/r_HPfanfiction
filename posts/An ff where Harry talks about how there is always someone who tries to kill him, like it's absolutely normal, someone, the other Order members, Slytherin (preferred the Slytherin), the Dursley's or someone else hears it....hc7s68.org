and ask what he means and he tells about what exactly happened in all those years, and they are like:

"What. The. Fuck!? How are you still alive? How are you not insane or completely traumatized by all this? Have you never seen a mind healer or something? How can Dumbledore let all that happen to you and acts like he doesn't care about your state of mind? Does he care about that? I mean, you just killed someone, who tried to kill you, to mess it up even more with eleven years and he does not ask how you feel about it or how you can deal with it or gives you professional help? Why have the other professors never done anything? Especially in your second and fourth year! (Can also be before his fourth year) How incompetent are they?!"

And they then point out everything that went wrong with how he was treated and the negligences the professors and the headmaster committed against him and any other student.

  With the DADA professor for 1996-97 being unknown, Dumbledore assigns all returning students a summer essay, “What I have learned in DADA while at Hogwarts”. You wouldn't believe the approach Harry took, as some people are finding out, much to their shock
