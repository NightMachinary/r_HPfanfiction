Okay so it was Tom Riddle jr. x hermione, she time travels, the founders books are involved, (I'm not sure if this is related because I have read a lot of of tomione but I think he's working on a potion and he's trying to get one of the founders books off her/ I'm pretty sure she knows occulmency) I think there's some smut in the mix- I'm trying to pick my brain for more but it's been a little while. If you don't know it but have tomione recommendations chuck them in the mix too hahah thankyou!

EDIT: oh and also they are still at Hogwarts when this happens

** I think you are thinking of Masters of Manipulation by Nerys. There are 4 founders books involved; Tom and Hermione each have one... and are racing to be the master of all.

Side note. I love this fic, and there is a 2nd part that is unfinished. I have heard from the author and it isn't abandoned just on hiatus. So there's hope!

** I wonder if it's Tied for Last by Speechwriter (on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]) It's set at a Hogwarts that's kind-of suspended in time. Some of the founders are there (nothing about founders books, though) and Tom does make a potion and steal a book from Hermione. She arrives knowing occlumency and loathing Riddle, much to his confusion, and it's a slow romance but I can't remember whether there's actually smut.
