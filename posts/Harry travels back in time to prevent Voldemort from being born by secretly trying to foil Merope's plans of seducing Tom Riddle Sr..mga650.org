He is successful at first but takes pity of Merope when Marvolo Gaunt returns angry that he was sent to Azkaban because of her so Harry offers her protection. He sets her up with a decent apartment in the Diagon Alley and helps her get a job at a newly open cosmetic potions store. All this in hopes that she'll eventually integrate in the Wizarding society and eventually forget about Tom Riddle Sr.

However when he comes back to his time he learns that nothing really has changed except that the world is under threat from an even darker wizard than Voldemort, called Fleamont Marvolo Potter.


** So she spiked Grandpa Potter with a love potion instead of Tom Senior?

** I misread your post title as “trying to foil Merope's plan /by/ seducing Tom Riddle Sr.”

And tbh that could be a hilarious crackfic.

** If you want Harry x Merope there's always the classic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6715591/1/][Boy Who Lived]]

It's not exactly what you're looking for but hey, it's something

*** I didn't really write that with a ship in mind (other than the obvious hint that Harry got her a job at Fleamont's store). I was thinking that Harry would try to do as little damage as possible while keeping Merope away from Tom Riddle Sr. But I'll give it a shot.

** There's a fic that's very similar, in which Harry marries Merope, and raises Tom, but it doesn't really go that well. It's called The-Boy-Who-Lived.
