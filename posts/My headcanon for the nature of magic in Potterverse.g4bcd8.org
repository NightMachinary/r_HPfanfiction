So, I had been doing the worldbuilding for my fic, and trying to find something that does not involve magical cores(they are too cliche, if you'd believe me) I happened upon what I think is a great idea.

There exist two types of fundamental forces in the universe - Physical and Metaphysical. Physical forces are, you know, Gravity, EM force, Strong Nuclear and Weak nuclear force. The metaphysical aspect of the universe can be explained by a simple word - *Magic*.

A magic user, as opposed to a no-maj(I like the term more than the 'Muggle') has a presence in the metaphysical aspect in form of a *Body*(I don't know to show it better, if you have a better word for it please mention). The aforementioned *Body* seven chakra points(For more info search Chakra Meditation), which are basically hotspots of magical activity.

A Magic user's tuning with the magic they have can be shown by these chakras. For an average wizard, only three of the chakras are open - that is - only Root, Sacral, and Solar Plexus Chakra are open.

For a good wizard(let's say the Marauders, the Longbottoms, Bellatrix etc. which can come in their power level) , their Heart Chakra is open along with the other three. The next three chakras can be opened, but they either need great training, or the true realization of one's self(I'm still trying to work out how one would do it, any help will be appreciated).

The first three chakras open during the phase of schooling of a wizard, and as they do, their magical reserves grow, and they grow some more if more chakras are opened. The person also feels more in tune with their magic the more chakras they have open, and they thus have less dependency on their wands. e.g., A person with Four Chakras open can do very low level magic wandlessly(i.e., lighting a candle, lifting some light things, etc.), while someone with their throat chakra open can maybe do the summoning spell wandlessly.

For an example of a wizard who has opened their throat chakra, I can mention Alastor Moody, Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick(Because he is THE DUELING CHAMPION), Pomona Sprout(Yes, I Believe that she does) and Lily Potter at the time of her death(No, Seriously. She sacrificed herself for Harry. She should get some merit for that).

The only people who have reached to the Third Eye Chakra(i.e the penultimate chakra) are Nicholas Flamel and Albus Dumbledore. Legend says that the Founders of Hogwarts had their Third Eye Chakra open, but there are no historical details to support this.

No one in the whole magical history has been able to awaken their Crown Chakra, and no one knows what happens if someone does.

So, How do you feel?


** I mean, it's an interesting system and I think it could be fun if you do it right, but it does seem a little bit anime in the same "My power level is over 9000!"-esque vein as Magical Cores. I'd maybe try and take a more label than level approach to it - make it be used colloquially and more loosely defined, and don't use it as a measure of quantifying power. If you use it to measure magical power, that's just magical cores by another name, really. "You can use wandless magic at 3000 magic-core-units" is pretty much no different to "You can use wandless magic at throat-chakra level".

Maybe use it like 'apprentice, journeyman, and master' as a measure of skill and accomplishment. Let someone in society (maybe an actual examinations group of people with more Chakras or maybe some kind of Scholarly class?) give the students tests to see what skills they have and what accomplishments they can make in order to see if they're ready to progress to the next Chakra. That way power and skill and belief and all the other fandom influences on magic help determine what Chakra you're deemed to be at, because they add together to say how good you are at/able you are to do various things.

If you wanted to have some actual 'magical block'-like function to the Chakras, you could maybe add some rituals to it too, to actually make the progression from Chakra One to Five. So they pass the tests I mentioned in the last paragraph, then they're deemed to be ready for the rituals (Maybe they'll be hurt/killed/squibbed if they do the ritual too early) and undergo them, then they unlock the next Chakra through that.

You'd probably need to have those rituals as 'rites of passage' in magical society - "Oh, I remember just yesterday your first chakra opened, lets go do your Rite of Whatever to open your third!". Magic is important to magicals, culturally and perceptually, so they'd end up integrating into their cultural practices and they'd have celebrations or events concerning them reaching new Chakras. Look into the Journeyman system and Mystery Cults in ancient Greece for ideas on how you might want the progression to go.

Make Chakra Six something esoteric or difficult, maybe requiring the magical version of a Magnum Opus, befitting Dumbledore and Flamel both being experimental, intellectual figures.

I think your 'knowing yourself' thing could actually fit really well as a way for Harry to open the Seventh Chakra - it's basically power linked to character development and big personal realisations, so that'd fit the themes of the original books. He develops throughout the story, has a big moment where he realises something about himself (ie. who he really is as a person) and then he can unlock that last Chakra.

Worldbuilding wise, in terms of the terminology, you'd have to find a way to explain why a seemingly insular, xenophobic society like Magical Britain would use an ancient Hindu method to describe their power progression as well. If they'll mock Fleur for being French, they'll likely not adopt a mystical pseudo-science from India without a good reason (maybe an influential figure in the past found it, liked it, and adopted it or something).

EDIT - I just realised some of my phrasing sounds like I'm trying to reinvent your ideas. Just suggestions and stuff to consider, I'm just really tired these days and I struggle to sound diplomatic when I'm tired. :D

** I like the idea of having a binary universe rather than a unitary one (i.e. a universe governed by 2 sets of rules, one natural and one magical, rather than a single set of rules). It's essentially type 3 of the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fc9asg/the_three_types_of_magic_system/][3 types of magic systems]].

The chakra stuff... not so sure about that. There's a few problems with it, I think:

- The Eastern origin of the mythology behind chakras rather conflicts with the tone of the established HP magic system, which is pretty heavily based on Western mythology. As a result, I think the idea comes off as a bit "anime crossover" rather than an extension of the HP magic system which feels natural.

- It seems to end up as functionally identical to magical cores, just with a different name: people have a set level of power available to them, and that power is exhausted (until they run out of "reserves") by casting magic.

- It feels extremely simple. If you have two sets of rules governing your universe, one being the natural law, and the other being magical law, it seems extremely odd for magical law to be so much more simple to understand than natural law.

*** It's not the 'Naruto chakra'.

The chakra methodology that is mentioned here is a part of the Hatha Yoga.

You can read it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakras][here]].

I wanted a bit of eastern flair in my fic and I also wanted to emphasize the point that the Wizarding world is actually that - a World. In my fic, it may seem backward as compared to the non - magical one, it is in some ways more advanced. The wizards have an International community which is more powerful than United Nations, and almost every country that has magical people is a part of it. This has been there since the Eighteenth Century. Even before that, wizards have been exchanging knowledge and resources.

I don't know how to explain the 'reserves' part better, because a person is using magical energy to cast spells, and I want the characters to have a set limit on how much magic they can use. At first, I simply thought that their 'reserves' would get larger as the characters age, and also, the training for opening the chakras is what one would call as the 'Apprentice-Journeyman-Master' scale. For opening the chakras, one must also be skilled in magic to that level

About the simplicity of the rules governing the magical aspect of the universe, well, it's work in progress.

**** Love the Idea!, and you could argue that the CHAKRA concept is Indian, therefore it's been known for a while in England, it's much developed there in India than in Europe, but they use a diferent magic system. Each chakra point should have a source emotion or idea governing it to give it's opening more importance.

** I agree with the other comments about this description, as written, coming across as magical cores with extra steps. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. The question to ask, is how this explanation of the nature of magic fits in with the world of Harry Potter. Magical people exist worldwide, yet the concept of Chakra's is distinctly Eastern. There are a couple of ways this could go.

1. People all over the world have tried to figure out the nature of magic. The Hindi happened to be the ones that figured it out, and everyone adopted their understanding once the truth was known.
2. Magic exists within a person, growing as they learn and develop. People all over the world have their own explanations for visualizing and describing that, these different descriptions all describe the same magic and are simply cultural differences.
3. Magic exists within a person, growing as they learn and develop according to their understanding of magic. People all over the world have their own explanations for the nature of magic and their own ways of accessing it. They are all subtly different.

Number one overwrites much of HP history but explains how Hogwarts would be teaching about Chakras. The use of chakras in growing magical power is open for expanding on through ideas like ones provided by the other comments. The effects of a foreign magical system being exported throughout the world can be explored.

Number two is basically growing magical cores. Each person has pools of magical energy in their body that they gain access to as they grow. There might be steps needed to be taken to gain access to further pools of magic but there is fundamentally no difference between opening up a new chakra and having your magical core grow. Learning about the growth of magical strength from a different perspective might help someone to understand, but doesn't change anything about how magic works. A British wizard might describe Dumbledore as having a level 6 magical core, while a wizard from India would describe him as having opened all but his crown chakra. They are both right.

Number three implies a difference in how magic is approached by different cultures, with differing effects and differing results. The methods might be synergistic or incompatible. A British wizard learns spells to cast with a wand to affect the world around them, they gain more power through learning more and practicing. A wizard from India learns mantras and rituals to access their personal power through self realization and actualization, they gain power through meditation and opening of chakras. A British wizard could learn about chakras and how to open them and discover a great capacity to cast spells in their own magical system. This can be used a couple of ways, either most wizards follow only their own cultural methods and opening chakras is a way for important characters to gain power over others, or the benefits of multicultural magic use are well known and chakra magic has become commonplace in Britain since the 1600s.

​

An important question that ties in with how chakras fit in with British magical culture is how chakras are opened. Is it a naturally occurring process that happens as the wizard learns and practices? Are there specific rituals that can guarantee the opening of a chakra that increase in difficulty as more are opened, resulting in the uniqueness of wizards like Dumbledore? Are chakras opened through meditation and self realization as in the traditional understanding?

Each has implications on the world. If it requires meditation similar to the traditional application of chakras, how is the power of Voldemort explained? Could someone gain power through a process that emphasizes things like emotional understanding and control and end up as an evil dark lord?

** I think having any sort of expanded magical system can work - and, at the core of it, it should be satisfying to you. Whether that's using magical cores or not, non-western ways or not, etc, that's what's important. So, if anything I say below is something you /don't/ like, ignore it. Just want to put it upfront, because this is just my opinion!

What I would say is that, to someone not all that acquainted with chakra, it does tend to get associated with anime. The downside of that, in your case, is that most people reading will be from a western setting, and won't have the more real world connections to it. It also doesn't exactly fit in with how the Harry Potter characters we see talk about things.

A suggestion I would have to make it, perhaps, fit a bit better into the more western focused british magical community, I would try to rephrase it in terms of western fantasy ideas/myths. At least to me, it'd fit in a lot more fluidly than using eastern terms... And opens up an interesting opportunity to have different schools of thoughts across magic users, where, say, indian or chinese schools of magic would focus a lot more on chakra and those sort of meditations/techniques.

It does sound like it would fit in fine with a magical core type of idea, as well - where opening a specific chakra could be similar to connecting one's magical core to that specific area (eg, like the way that some stories see a wand as acting as a conduit by connecting to a magical core, and that's what allows it to form/utilize magic).

For my personal opinion, I think it's a little bit /too/ strict - at least in the ideas that basically say "oh, if ___ chakra is open, then you can do ____". It's an interesting base, for sure - but I would probably take a step back and remove the labels. Where the idea is that your magic is within you, and as you get more attuned/in control of yourself and your connection to magic, it lets you open it up a bit more. Then, you take a step closer and put the labels and ideas in place for the different magical blocks that can get unlocked. In an eastern setting, maybe you connect it to the chakra points. In a western setting, maybe you connect those to rituals or a magical core type of explanation, or a rather barebones explanation, or tying it to the mythical elements. In other cultures, you could likely find other ways of explaining that deeper control and understanding of self/magic that would let one progress further. What I like with that is that it makes it feel more natural - like, a bunch of different cultures and magical schools of thoughts seeing the same sort of things, but approaching it from different viewpoints.

One that I definitely do not like is the crown chakra idea - it seems far too setup for one special person to get it and justify being special, you know? I also like the idea of any of those being more limited/gradual - that is, instead of a chakra point being 'on/off', it's gradual in nature. That makes the idea of a sudden power up (which is kinda -eh, IMO) fit less well - and instead, makes it just another way of learning magic.
