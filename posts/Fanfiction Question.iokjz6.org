** I've read blood adoption two ways. Either you add a parent so that the child essentially has 3 or even 4 parents. Or you completely rewrite their previous parentage.

** Blood adoptions are not canon, but going by internal consistency by being nlood adopted into another family you forfeit your rights of inheritance to the original family.

** Neither blood adoptions nor lordships are canon, so it doesn't matter as long as it's consistent within your fic.

*** Ignoring bloodness of the blood adoption, how does real noble families deal with the similar situation in adoptions? Isn't this the source of hyphenated names (e.g., House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, or House of Finch-Fletchley; yes, we don't have canonical confirmation that Justin was from noble family)?

**** In Western Europe (the only place where I have at least some knowledge), adoption was not really a thing during Middle Age. It was not that unusual for a child to be "fostered" by another family (usually of higher rank), either as a student, or as a ward (in the case where the child is orphaned), but said children, while being treated as family members, were not legally considered the same as natural-born children, and didn't have the same inheritance rights. If "blood adoption" was possible, a lot of family would probably have taken this option rather than dying out.

Concerning the hyphenated names, it is important to note that Noble names usually represented the "seat of the family", the place of their original fiefdom. As an example, the House of Bourbon (who later gaves some French kings) originate from the village of Bourbon. When the original male lane died out, the heiress of the family married the heir of the Dampierre family (from the village of Dampierre), creating the Bourbon-Dampierre house.

Hyphenated names cames from the fusion of several Houses by marriage, and you could usually consider that each names represented a different Title controled by the family.

PS: Credit where it's due, this post will explain how Nobles house got their name way better than I, and it's where I got the example of Bourbon-Dampierre.\\

** Blood adoptions aren't canon, so there's no real answer.

However, I'd say it depends on the intent of the adoption.

For example, take a WBWL fic where James and Lily dump Harry with the Dursleys and Sirius rescues him and blood adopts him. The intent there is Harry is no longer a Potter and becomes Sirius's son. So we get Harry Black.

Or take a canonish scenario where Sirius is freed and adopts Harry. The intent here is not to replace the Potters but to follow through on their wishes. Here Harry becomes Harry Potter-Black and is a member of both families. How you want to divide Lordships is up to you. Personally I'm a big fan of Sirius reinstating Andromeda and making Tonks Black heir with Harry remaining Lord Potter.

** Adoption legally makes you someone's child. That generally means you are treated as if you were born into that family. So you would lose your original family.
