Looking for any/all good non-slash year 6 and/or 7 fics. Can be new or old, AU or alternate horcrux hunts. I feel like I've read most of the good ones and looking for more.


** Does it have to be trio-centred? If not, sorry to self-promote, but you might be interested in my DH from Ginny's POV fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]. It's quite long and will probably be completed in about a month.

*** Harry/trio-centric preferred but I appreciate any and all suggestions. Thanks!

** Not trio centric, but very well written, my favourite take on year 7, it's from the viewpoint of the DA, still at Hogwarts. Canon compliant linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness)
