Here's an example of one of the worst tropes in fanfiction:

(This is Harry before his first year in Diagon Alley)

/Harry turned to the shop selling magical trunks and entered the shop./

/"Hello sir. What kind of trunk are you looking for?" a fat man asked./

/"I'm looking for a seven compartment trunk complete with room size compartments please" he replied./

/The owner had a look of shock on his face. Those trunks were very expensive and he couldn't ever remember a first year wanting one. But he looked to be dressed in expensive clothes, so he decided to oblige./

/"This is the best trunk we have. Seven compartments as you asked for, all room size to be customized to your preference, it comes with a shrinking charm as well as feather light charm. There are several wards to prevent theft as well as password protected. The price is 1648 galleons."/

/Harry inspected the trunk closely. He was a very private person and he didn't want people looking through his stuff. Once satisfied, he said, "I'll take it."/

In chapter 3 of linkffn(12246163).


** Why? Newt Scamander's suitcase was FAR MORE impressive.

Super trunks are Canon now.

It would be stupid for smart!grey!Harry not to buy one.

But I really start hating the Harry/Daphne pairing. Why don't they get a bit more creative and pair him with Astoria?

Not sure the vow could be designed to capture all circumstances, and because everyone thinks a vow is in place, they will be less diligent in looking for it.

As for comparing it to the Muggle world, we have death/life imprisonment punishments for treason, but trials are allowed (or are supposed to be allowed) which could explain circumstances such as blackmail or coercion. A bit different than dropping dead on the spot.

Ginny behaved like that because of her upbringing, her development and her innate character traits. Without that why bother reading about her?

A Ginny-In-Name-Only is far worse than Daphne. At least with Daphne (or any other names mentioned in canon without developing them) you can be original. With Ginny it will feel like molding a red headed wishful girlfriend for your fav character.

They regulate magic but they can't figure out if Voldemort's wand was used or not? There seems to be now law in Wizarding world. I don't see any law against slander in press? Or regulation on owl post? Or proper rules about accidental magic (They didn't do anything when Harry grew his hairs back or teleported to roof of school but were too fast to act when that lady flew away after burst of accidental magic from Harry).

Or elf laws? How come that elf could invade Hogwarts or Harry's home? It's rather stupid if elf's can do that and you still don't do something like asking your elf to go to someone's house and murder him or her ("I know a way you can help me Dobby. Your bad master tried to harm children. We should stop him or else he will continue to do so. How about you go to his room and throttle him in his sleep?").

Because there are laws preventing this. Consumer crime laws will put his arse in ringer for that. What's stopping shopkeepers from selling trunks to kids?

Harry and Draco shopped for their cloths alone in that lady's shop. Hagrid was out to buy owl and Draco's parents were away for something else. Harry and Draco paid for their robes on their own. If they can buy their cloths alone and that lady didn't bat an eye why do you think a shopkeeper will deny an opportunity to profit from a trunk?

It's technically a trunk with expansion charms (like their tents). Fancy? Yes. Illegal? By no means (no proof or reason for it to be so). What's so special about these trunks anyway. Fundamentally it's just a normal trunk with extra space to keep things.

******** I think we have to agree to disagree :P Even though you know the kid is going to a boarding school, if most kids are picking the $40 version, and this kid comes in alone wanting the $240, I think you'd be careful selling it. As far as you know, the very next day the kids parents might be standing in your shop giving you hell. I know in the muggle world at least shop owners have some form of responsibility in cases like this.

But however reasonable I think this comparison is, in truth I believe in the magical world shop owners wouldn't give a damn. Sirius managed to buy a Firebolt with the help of a bloody cat. So there isn't that much of buyer/seller security.

Like you said though we'll have to agree to disagree now what I really want is a one-shot of sirius buying the firebolt from the cats perspective with appropriate cat to english translation obviously.

I'm not arguing over the fact that wands are dangerous, i'm arguing over that cliche statement that selling wands to 11 year olds is like selling guns to children. A 11 year old canon wizard isn't going to be able to seriously harm anyone with a wand, he'd actually be more likely to harm them with accidental magic.

** I don't hate Magical Trunks per se, the problem with them is that they are just there, for no reason. It's just another pointless magical gimmick that is acquired by the protagonist (while also learning how to become an animagus or finding his very own Phoenix). And no, using it at some arbitrary point as a McGuffin doesn't count. "But, but, but the trunk is suuuper important to the plot, because Harry uses it in Chapter 14 to hide from the dementors!" - No! Just have him hide from them in some other more interesting way and forget about the stupid trunk if that's the only reason to include it, especially because I suspect you wrote the whole Dementor scene just so that there's a point to the stupid trunk.

"Dodging Prison..." is actually a good counter-example for a fic how magical trunks can be done right, by actually having your protagonist make use of their awesome potential.
