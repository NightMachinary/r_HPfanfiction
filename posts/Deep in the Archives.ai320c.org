- Harry, Hermione, Padma and Parvati (or anyone really) are in the same kindergarten/Elementary School class or meet during some interschool-cooperation event (local school football cup or whatever)

- While playing with each other, they decide to play "wedding". Harry is the chosen groom and says the "vows" to each of the girls.

- The next day, they all forget about the whole thing (although maybe some parent remembers)

- Fast-forward ten/fifteen years and in the aftermath of the first war, and what remains of the Order is going through the Ministry archives to process the atrocities committed and bring the offenders to justice

- One Order member finds a file labelled "Harry Potter" and looks inside. There, in between all kinds of boring paperwork, are three marriage certificates dated 198X. Since magical marriages cannot be divorced, Harry is now stuck in three marriages at the same time.

- (Optional: No one wants to be the one to bear the bad news. They draw straws, hold an impromptu duelling tournament, play a drinking game)

- Harry and the three women are informed of their marriages

- (Optional: Fleur is the only one who is euphoric, promising to name her next child after him because he fulfilled some kind of Veela myth)

Preferably no drama with existing relationships (so no Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron at that point)


** wow

I would love to see Moody, Severus, Sirius, Tonks and Remus play Gobstones or something to decide who has to go tell Harry. Lol

*** At that point, it would be Shaklebolt, Hestia Jones and a few Weasleys. And it would probably end with Fleur walking in, calling everyone a bunch of pussies and skipping away because she would be having so much fun with the news.
