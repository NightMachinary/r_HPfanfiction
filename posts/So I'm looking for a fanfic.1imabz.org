** Tough call, as Miranda's stories are in a class by themselves. If you don't mind going old school, and by old, I mean more than a decade, then Ruskbyte's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/The-Order-of-the-Phoenix][The Order of the Phoenix]] (and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1020773/1/The-Well-of-Shadows][sequel]]) may be your cup of cake.

  /Completed/ Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

It's notable that his fanfiction story was published a year before JKR put out a book by the same name.

** Oh my god, you are asking for the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]], except that it does have romance (Harry/Draco) and Evil!Dumbledore. But it is LONG (3 million words) and definitely has dragons, blood magic, necromancy, and tons of other obscure magics, and Harry is craaazy powerful.

I just finished reading it and while I can't recommend reading it unreservedly, because omg long and could have definitely used an editor in parts, plus I just don't get Harry/Draco, it was definitely a net positive reading experience. The worldbuild makes the world of canon seem thin and insubstantial by comparison.

If nothing else, it will keep you busy for a very long time.

**** Ron and Hermione are pretty minor characters, since Harry is in Slytherin he doesn't interact much with them.

I definitely contemplated giving up on it many times - I mean, it's the length of like 30 average-length novels. You could cut a whole bunch of subplots without losing much. But it definitely has a lot of really fun stuff in it too.
