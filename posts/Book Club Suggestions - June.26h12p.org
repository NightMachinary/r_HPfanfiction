In June let us turn away from the sea of angsty romances and the clamouring horde of powerful!+Goku+Harry fics and find a nice *mystery* fic. Let's hear some recommendations.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

It's a bit short, but a good read regardless.

*** It's too short, imo. The story is good as a one-shot try\experiment, but there isn't enough discussion material in it for a monthly reading candidate.

** I'm going to have to throw out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] by enembee.

#+begin_quote
  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
#+end_quote

It's AU, and Harry is kind of powerful (but not nearly as powerful as those who are obviously his "betters"). It's extremely atmospheric, has a tiny bit of romance, and a shit ton of mystery. It'll keep you guessing until the end, it sure as hell did for me.

***** Ah, authors really need to mark stuff complete if it is. Some people will just skip a story if it looks abandoned.

****** Mhmm. Maybe enembee has some expectation of continuing it, or maybe he just forgot to tag it. I mean, it could be expanded upon quite easily, but it's basically self contained.

******* Self contained is something only maybe 5% of the incomplete stories out there could claim. Thanks for telling me, now I have a story to devour :).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5853767/1/Hunted][Hunted]] by Bex-chan is my recommendation. It's a Dramione story set Post-Hogwarts. The plot and writing were both excellent.

*Description:* Forced to work together when their old schoolmates start dying, Hermione & Draco must overcome their differences to solve the mysterious deaths. The tension in the office is getting rather...heated. Mature themes. 4years PostHogwarts/War. EWE. DMHG. Rated M, 191k words.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]]? I haven't actually read it since mystery isn't really my thing but this would give me a good excuse.

Also I guess I have to throw [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] into the ring. I ended up really enjoying it but that didn't really start until I was about 200k words in or so which makes me wary of recommending it for the book club.

*** u/Servalpur:
#+begin_quote
  Renegade Cause
#+end_quote

Definitely a great mystery, though it is fairly romance heavy. I enjoyed the hell out of it (but then again, I'm a huge Harry/Tonks fan). Honestly, Renegade Cause could be a novel or series of novels all its own, with very little issue.

That said, it's 500k words. Maybe a bit long for the book club?

** Hope I'm not too late to suggest something. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] is a great mystery, it's recently been completed and there is no romance. One of my favorite stories.
