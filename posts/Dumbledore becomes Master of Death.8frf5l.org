He had access to the Cloak for 11 Years. He had the Wand. Let's say he finds the Stone early, and manages to disable the curse before he puts on the ring. Bonus points if his is really a greater good manipulative bastard that doesn't get beaten by a jumped up child and instead uses the child like the pawn he is supposed to be.


** "Pfffffft!"

The distinct someone of someone spitting out their coffee was heard behind Albus Dumbledore's back.

The old wizard whirled around, to see a skull-faced figure dressed in black robes, limply holding a scythe.

Quickly, Dumbledore thrust his hand forward, attempting to bind the Death Eater with a rope-conjuring charm, only for the conjured fibres to pass harmlessly through its body-

"Not a Death Eater. Just Death. No Eater." the figure said, the jaw of its skull moving as it spoke.

Dumbledore blinked, "...Did taking the last of the Deathly Hallows cause my death, Mr. Death?"

The grim reaper snorted, "I wish! No, you got all three and now you're some sort of Master of Death, which is me, and apparently includes immortal /life/ and the magical equivalent of super-strength."

Dumbledore smiled a little, "I guess that Fawkes will be happy that I'm not going to leave him any time soon."

"Hah hah, it is to laugh," Death said sarcastically, "/You're/ not supposed to be the Master of Me, though! That kid with the scar is supposed to become Master in a decade or so, not..."

Dumbledore helpfully hiked up his robes to show the map of the London Underground on his knee.

"WRONG SCAR!!" Death shrieked, "It's some little kid with a scar on his head from a killing curse that didn't!"

Dumbledore blinked, "Harry Potter?"

"YES!!!"

"...Huh."

Dumbledore watched the grim reaper pace around and grumble, occasionally kicking at and passing through various pebbles on the ground, "Stupid, stupid, dumb, I bet Fate's on a bender again, now stupid destiny's all over the place and..."

"So, I'm immortal now, and have ultra powerful magic, have you as my personal minion who apparently knows the whole world inside out, and this is in addition to my being Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock and all my other titles?" Dumbledore interrupted.

"AAAARGH!!!" Death screamed, which apparently translated to 'yes'.

Dumbledore started to grin. Very widely.

** Ah, but Dumbledore was a master of death long before the series even started, otherwise he'd never be able to accept his death as easily as he did.

*** He never accepted his sister's death though. That was the middle brother's problem, and what led to his downfall. Same thing happened to Dumbledore, incidentally.

** Would it matter if he didn't disable the curse? Surely as an immortal with Mastery over Death it would be a non-issue.

Anyway, I hypothesize that merely having possession of the Cloak wouldn't be enough. The Wand has to be won, so I doubt the Cloak would change ownership to whoever picked it up. Either he'd have to purpose to keep it intentionally, thus being aware that he is stealing it from Harry, or James would have to have gifted, not loaned it.
