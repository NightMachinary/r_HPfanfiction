There are Dresden files HP crossovers, but a lot of them are Dresden teaching at Hogwarts or something, but I think the magic systems in the two series are different enough to make that really a stretch. Instead, I'm looking for a Harry dropped into Dresden's world and having to survive there some how. Thanks all!


** One of my guilty pleasures is Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain by nuhuh. It involves a crazy Harry getting summoned to the Dresden universe.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

** I'm a pretty avid Dresden Files fan (4 re-reads) currently on a big crossover fanfic binge, so I'm sorry to say I haven't found much, at least in the word counts I consider for reading.

I did have a lot of fun with a piece from 2013 callen /magician/ linkffn(6989216)

It has a Harry in Chicago kicking ass, becoming a mob enforcer, trading snark with Dresden, trying not to be a /total/ asshole along the way. I remember the story stopped updating just after it explained the future overarching story. sort of a shame, but it's fun right up until the big vision thing with the Gatekeeper.

** Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005)

- People in Dresden-verse think that old man Harry is some sort of powerful Outsider. An Eldritch Abomination from Beyond the Outer Gates. While the first part is /technically/ true, obviously they're also very wrong. It's a pretty funny misunderstanding.

Linkffn(Magician by WiseTomato)

- Pretty straight-forward, just as the summary says.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** Ice Age by Ryuugi has Harry stranded in Dresden-verse during the formation of the Nevernever. It's short, abandoned, but really interesting. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ice-age-dresden-files-harry-potter-ryuugi.351540/]]

 

There's also When He Finds Out By Uncle Stojil where Harry ends up possessing Dresden's body. linkffn(6618861)

 

Another Harry is stranded in Dresden-verse is Beyond Grave Peril by Random Shinobi. linkffn(4149894)

  Because of something happening when they were babies, Harry Potter and Harry Dresden's lives are inevitably linked together. The results become evident only a few years later and they are unexpected, problematic and quite a little entertaining for both.
