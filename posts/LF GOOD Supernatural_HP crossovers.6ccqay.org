  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

*** Is this slash? Nearly all HP crossovers with supernatural are slash.

**** Surprisingly, no, it's not slash. Otherwise I wouldn't have read it :P

As far as I can remember, there is no romance. Ties in with Harry's story.

Do you know of any other HP/Supernatural crossovers that aren't slash?

** Demented'verse, starting with linkao3(401208) The series is WIP and hasn't been updated in a couple of years, but all the posted stories (12, totalling 360k words) are complete and don't end with any cliffhangers or mid-plot so you can read it without facing huge disappointment.

  Harry saves the Winchesters from a Dementor attack, but the Winchesters aren't the only ones that need saving.
