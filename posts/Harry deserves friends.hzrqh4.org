Anyone have some good recommendations for stories where Harry becomes friends with the other triwizard champions? Also interested in some wholesome Harry & Luna friendships.

Thanks in advance?


** Like... More than canon? He kind of developed a friendship with Cedric in canon and the foundations for one with Fleur. Relationship with Krum was only respectful though

*** Yeah idk. I want to see something where they hang out or after 4th year he still talks to Krum and Fleur regularly (same with Cedric if they're in an AU where he lives). We get hints of what could have been in cannon, but I crave something more.

Also happy b-day :)

  International Pen-Pals. The summer assignment spells disaster for both the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Hate-His-Fame and Quidditch Superstar Viktor Krum. Relieved when they are granted the opportunity to write anonymously, neither is prepared for the quick, easy friendship that blossoms through their letters, or the unexpected wish to reveal who they really are...
