I'm looking for a vic where Harry has relationships with both boys & girls, hopefully at the same time. It seems like every polyamorous Harry ends up being all girls & every bi/pansexual Harry has the relationships happen at different times. I would like a fic with both, I'm open to multiple pairing but Snape with Harry does creep me out. (I've also seen many Golden Trio fics but they seem to be the only ones...?)

I saw a post about poly!Harry but it wasn't open to comments & contained one Golden Trio suggestion with the rest being Harry/multiple females.


** Harry/Cho/Cedric is a poly ship I've seen. There aren't many fics of it however.

An Excessive Amount of Politeness is good but incomplete. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17159819]]

These two are also the same ship however I have not read them so I can't speak of their quality. These are the only non oneshot fics I have found of the pairing.
