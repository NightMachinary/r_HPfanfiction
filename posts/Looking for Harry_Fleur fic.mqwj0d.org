Looking for a specific Harry/Fleur fanfiction. They both send back in time for Harry 4th year at Hogwarts but they sorta tiptoeing around each other because they not sure if the other is from the future or not. The majority of the fic is from Harry pov, but few last chapters are from Fleur pov.

I cannot get this fic out of my head and I don't know where else I can look for it. Please help!


** I believe this was called Across The Time or something similar and unfortunately it was removed from FFN

**** I found the premise very interesting, but I just couldn't get into it. The person who wrote it had extremely poor grasp of the English language, and as a result their grammar was atrocious.

If I remember correctly, that was one of the reasons why the author decided to remove it. I believe they wanted to try and rewrite it. I really hope they do, because it really was an interesting idea.

Super late, but you can download an archived version from here

[[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Across+The+Time&sort=title]]

however, only the 2017 version is there and only has the first 41 chapters. IDK if there's more but that's a start.

  She had fallen through the veil of death, unaware of the path she was doomed to walk. It all seemed like fun and games at the start - another chance. She'd never been so wrong. OOC. fem!Harry. Lovecraftian Horror. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, extreme violence, and mature topics.
