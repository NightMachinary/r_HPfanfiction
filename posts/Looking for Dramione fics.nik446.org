The problem is that, most of the Dramione fics that I have found yet have been for female readers. And I'm a male. I want a Slow burn one in which most of the story is from draco's perspective(though I hope it's 3rd person pov) please rec me a novel length (meaning 150k+ words) thanks! Oh and if there's smut, make sure there's actual plot in it instead of full blown porn...

** Hello so, I never finished linkffn(Like Brothers by Colubrina) but I liked what I read. It's 150k+ and I believe slow burn and there are definitely parts from Draco's POV but I'm not sure if it's mostly in his POV.

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.
