Witches and wizards praying to the Boy-Who-Lived, a temple in Hogsmeade with very aesthetically pleasing storm charms, goblins ritually disembowelling effigies of Voldemort/Death Eaters, house-elves in feather headdresses offering sacrificial chocolate frogs...I don't know why I want to read this, I just do.\\
Edit: Can't forget the veela priestesses.


** It started as a joke in the pub on November 2nd 1981. Larry McCallum had knocked over his pint and it landed bottom down on the floor. Picking it up with nary a drop spilled he jokingly called out.

"Praise Harry Potter, killing and keeping my pint from spilling. To Harry Potter!"

That brought about a round of cheers and calls of Harry's name throughout the pub.

Over the next few weeks all the chaps from the pub had started taking the piss about it outside the pub as well.

When Micheal Durmont missed being eviscerated by a Griffin due to a strange turn of events he reflexively hollered.

"Praise Ya Harry Potter, thanks be to you."

The mates at work had wondered about that and with a perfectly straight face he decided to take the piss a bit further.

"Me and some mate's at the pub noticed it you see. Anyone who prays to Harry Potter are luckier than usual. Not liquid luck or anything just little, or sometimes big, things."

He pointed to the barrels of maple syrup that had been accidentally ordered and had fallen out of the loft. Who knew Griffins were sluts for Maple Syrup? The whole herd was licking the stuff up and passing out afterwards.

The news that Griffins were totally bananas over maple syrup had made the rounds in the ministry. Attached to it was the seemingly impossible, and growing more so with each telling, reason behind it. Of particular import was how it was all being credited to Harry Potter.

Arthur Weasley was not one to go with all that silliness but he enjoyed a good laugh now and then. He had jokingly called on Harry Potter to protect him on a raid.

The raid on Malfoy manor was about as expected when Arthur sneezed and accidentally blasted a hole in the floor. A hole that lead to a room filled with dark artifacts.

Chuckling to himself he joked, slightly serious now (I mean what were the odds?), and thanked Harry Potter.

"Praise Harry, he's still helping us fight the good fight!"

That had made the ministry circles faster than a bolt of lightning. Harry Potter had shown Arthur Weasley Malfoy's hidden room of dark artifacts.

Rosemerta was a half-blood that had studied some business and was doing well. She knew a good thing when she saw one and found a way to have fun as well.

The war had been hard and everyone needed something to find happiness in. So when the Praise Harry had come along she had an idea.

Grabbing up and news clippings she could get, not many, about the boy she made a little shrine to him outside the pub doors.

She put a donation box on it and labeled it.

'All donations go to the annual Praise Harry Potter Festival on July 31st, Harry Potters birthday.'

That had gotten a few laughs until a drunk Kevin Hartford tossed in a galleon. The next day he had won the annual Ministry 1,000 galleon sweepstakes.

Kevin had decided to put half that into upgrading the shrine into something more fitting.

Rosemerta was more than happy to expand out her pub and take over keeping it clean.

Between them, a few other, and a few bottles of Solar Spirits Gin 'Sunshine in a Bottle', they built the Grand Temple of Harry Potter.

It was nearly two hundred meters high made of white marble with silver veins. The center of the temple had a statue of Lily Potter holding baby Harry.

Once they woke up, they realized what they had done hopped up on Gin and Sunshine. Shrugging their shoulders Rosemerta moved the donation box over to the temple entrance.

The first annual Harry Potter Festival was a rounding success. With several hundred galleons collected over the year they had more than enough for massive amounts of food and booze.

When Aunt Petunia had struck 4 year old Harry across the face for daring to ask for a lollipop at the store it drew attention.

When she had then went on a rant about useless Potters it had drawn the attention of a muggleborn witch.

She had half jokingly prayed for the little Potter boy. Assuming it was just another random child, as Potter was a common last name.

That the boy had glowed ever so slightly and was healed stunned the woman right there. Looking around she pulled out her wand and sent off an oblivators signal.

They had arrived quick enough and she explained what had happened. The oblivators had cleaned up the incident and layered a few compulsion charms on her to treat the child better.

That incident mad the Daily Prophet's front page that next morning, minus the compulsion charms bit.

"Witch prays to Potter for Healing a Child, it worked! Our Saviour Still Looking Over Us!"

By 1984 Harry Potter was recognized by the Wizengamot as a Saviour of Magic. That same year 4 year old Harry Potter was classified as a high level genius and placed into Her Majesties accelerated learning program.

In 1985 the first Miracle of Potter was confirmed by the unspeakables after public demand.

That same year Harry Potter somehow found himself a Royal Ward of Her Majesty after the tragic death of Petunia and Vernon. Dudley had been pawned off to his aunt Marge.

In 1987 his third miracle was confirmed, it had happened in Peru as a tourist family visiting the dragon preserve was present when a flight of dragons broke free.

Harry Potter was now international in scope.

1990 the ICW declared him a living Magic Source. That same year Albus Dumbledore passed from his increasingly failing health finally catching up to him.

That was also the year Harry Potter graduated from Oxford with Honors holding a shiny new degree in engineering. Marking him the youngest by 2 months to achieve a bachelor's degree from them.

When Harry Potter was visited by a Headmistress McGonagall and Minister of Magic Weasley he was surprised. Agreeing to come along he loved the brightly colored and bustling stalls of Diagon Alley.

They had explained his role in their society and he had took it with a grain of salt. It certainly explained much.

It took nearly a week, with Auror escort even, to finish shopping. They just couldn't get far without being followed by crowds.

He had agreed to tell the story of his life at the Grand Temple of Harry Potter, Living Magic Source.

He kept his problems with his now dead family quiet and focused on the positives. The large international crowd of spectators had cheered as he finished his story.

Oxford Engineering Degree at age 10!

Royal Ward of Her Majesty the Queen!

Harry Potter did not disappoint the public that loved him so.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

A/N based on the idea that the more a magical believes in something the more it comes true. So the more that believe he is a magic jesus the more he becomes a magic jesus.

** Nonjon's "Where in the world is harry potter" has Snape changing "By Merlin" for By Potter and eventually everyone catches on. Not a cult but its an element in the story. Its actually in the sequel but i dont remember the name.

** I get you. Cults are fascinating to an outsider and most likely horror to an insider.

It constantly fascinates me how so many people's mind works in a way that makes them susceptible to cults.

Realistic stories about cults are pretty boring though since they're all about routines and minimum divergence.
