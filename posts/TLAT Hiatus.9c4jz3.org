I'm new to fanfic in general and the first one i read was The Life and Times by Jewels5. It was honestly one of the most incredible things I've ever read (and I'm a dude lol). I was content with the ending until I found out it had been cut short. It literally makes me feel sick to my stomach because it was so damn GOOD. Does anyone know anything about it ever coming back? Not that its ending is terrible, no, but I just want more of the same author.


** I'm not saying it's dead, but it's residing in a coffin. Inside a vault. That is buried underground.

*** Sigh. It's unfortunate really. Every time I think of the damn title itself I get sick to my stomach. Well, maybe one day

** Sadly, it is dead. Someone asked Jules on Tumblr a while back asking if she was still writing TLAT, and she replied that she wasn't.
