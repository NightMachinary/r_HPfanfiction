Rather than bashing, I want something new. A fic where they deal with each other as adults.


** (I thought the flair said prompt... well if it is all ready typed up... let me know if you want this deleted.)

Arthur dies in the DOM, in comforting Molly's grief Sirius start to feel a connection. They get closer and closer until Harry is wondering if his adoptive father, adoptive mother, and adoptive brother are in the same family as his girlfriend, that maybe he has an incest fetish.

****** Yes it was. Unfortunately I don't know of any like that, (most of the time that is brought up in the fics I read, the feud escalates,) so I can't point you to anything.
