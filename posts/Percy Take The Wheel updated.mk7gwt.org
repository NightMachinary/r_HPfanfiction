Since i've seen it recommended here a few times, I thought some of you may be happy that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613][Percy Take the Wheel]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/KittySmith/pseuds/KittySmith][KittySmith]] updated after an 11 months break!

If you haven't heard of it, it's a great fit with excellent world-building, exciting and twisty plot, and convincing Weasley family dynamics - check it out!


** Oh my goodness! Thank you so much I love this fic and was starting to lose hope that it would be updated

** The pacing is all over the place in this chapter, it feels very scatterbrained and just so much filler bogging it down. Maybe I'm just someone who likes my plot to move (same with books not just FF). It did have some interesting bits that move the story on
