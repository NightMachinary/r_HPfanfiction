** Against. The biggest reason being that we have no evidence what-so-ever that these objects are actually as powerful as they are said to be.

The resurrection stone, as shown, doesn't seem to bring anyone back to life but instead seems to create a temporary ghost that may or may not just be a projection of the user's mind. A similar action happened when Harry and Voldemort were fighting at the end of GoF yet neither of them were using a Deathly Hallow at all.

The Elder Wand also never seemed to show that it was somehow more powerful than any other wand. We did see it preform powerful magic of course, but always in the hand of a powerful wizard making the logical interpretation to be that the wand is irrelevant.

And just to reference the cloak; based on what the characters have said and we've seen there's no reason to think there's anything special about it compared to a normal invisibility cloak except that the charms on it don't wear off. That makes it extremely valuable, but doesn't make it hide the wearer from Death himself.

And that's sort of the whole point of my argument, everything that says these objects are extremely dangerous and powerful comes from a fairy tale. The wizards that seem to believe that are either power-hungry and insane (Voldemort), extremely sentimental and whimsical (Dumbledore), or just kind of off (Lovegood). My theory is that the Deathly Hallows *used* to be powerful and unique objects...a thousand years or so ago...but artificing technology advanced to the point that they were made obsolete. It's like a muggle Damascus steel sword; they're amazing pieces of technology that we can't replicate to this day but at the same time if someone tries to use one on us we can just pull a gun.

TLDR; The stone and wand aren't really that powerful and everyone in the books was overreacting.

** *I am in favor* of Harry's decision to destroy the Elder Wand and losing the resurrection stone - it was a mature and responsible decision, which was for the greater good of all wizardkind.

This is why I support Harry's decision:

a) He owned the wand, and the resurrection stone. They were his to keep, and his to destroy. He was the rightful owner.

b) Imagine a scenario where Harry kept both the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone: Not only would he be driven mad with grief after unsuccessful attempts to bring back the wizards and witches who nobly died fighting for Harry and against Voldemort, but Harry would be hunted down by evil forces that seek to claim the Elder Wands, as a struggle for power. Harry would have lived a stress-filled life, always in danger. Remember, the Elder Wand doesn't make you a god - the first brother from the Deathly Hallows died shortly after receiving the wand.

c) The Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone, from the second they were fashioned by Death, were there to create problems, and were both overall a trap to lure more power-hungry witches and wizards into Deaths grasp. The Deathly Hallows are, as the name suggests, a death-trap.

d) The most obvious one: No one should have such power. Imagine if Voldemort did not screw up, and actually was the rightful owner of the Elder Wand. He would have annihilated Harry in the Battle of Hogwarts, and both the Muggle and Wizarding World would be in great danger, most likely under his control. We don't know when the next Voldemort will pop up, seeking to claim the Elder Wand.

Harry did the right thing. The Wizard World is better off now - The Deathly Hallows did more good than bad, and they would have continued to do so if Harry had not done his part and destroyed them.

** FOR: I believe that, based on the bloody history surrounding the Deathly Hallows from the beginning, that the elimination of the Deathly Hallows exempting the Cloak was justified in that:

1. The history of the Deathly Hallows proves that, even if Harry used them responsibly, others would not, and it would lead to more trouble than it was worth. Look at the example of the brother with the wand, who got killed by a greedy person who desired it for himself. Look at the example of the brother with the Stone, who used it to seek out a dead lover and ended up committing suicide to be with her again due to his depression. The lover, too, was but a ghost of herself and was in pain the entire time she was summoned.
2. The Deathly Hallows are simply too 'overpowered'; that is, the owner of one of them would be able to do things that no normal human would be able to do; just look at the Elder Wand as an example; Dumbledore was able to do amazing things with it that he might not have been able to do otherwise. He was able to fight Voldemort, who was tens of years his junior and possibly more powerful than he, into submission with his skill with Transfiguration /and/ his mastery of the Elder Wand. If he had not owned the Elder Wand, he might not have been able to defeat Voldemort like he did on multiple occasions.
3. The quest for the Deathly Hallows can /lead to huge amounts of death and destruction/. What did Grindelwald want in his youth? The Deathly Hallows. This quest eventually turned into a quest to subjugate Muggles 'For the Greater Good' and led to a huge number of deaths and rampant destruction until Dumbledore defeated him. Similarly, when Voldemort wanted the Elder Wand, it caused the deaths of many people such as an unknown Bulgarian woman and the wandmaker Gregorovitch and possibly even more. Who knows what might happen if another aspiring Dark wizard set his sights on the Deathly Hallows in the possession of Harry Potter?
4. The costs outweigh the benefits. True, the Deathly Hallows could be used for good, such as healing people, public services, allowing people to say goodbye to their loved ones, solving murders, defeating dark lords, and protecting people, but it could also be used to kill and harm people, to destroy things, to cause massive amounts of destruction, to defeat people standing in your way, to summon a huge Inferi army for your own use, and much more. The costs outweigh the benefits of such a thing.
5. They were Harry's by right as the owner of all three. What he wanted to do with them was his own decision. Enough said.

I know these are the same points everyone is going to cover, but hopefully mine is at least somewhat unique.

** Against:

The wizarding world is full of objects that are extremely dangerous when mishandled or used with malice. Why single out these two? Why not isolate and study them, like so many other dangerous or covetable items? There is a Veil of Death in the Department of Mysteries. There are time turners. There are creatures which suck out souls.

But the stone is only really harming the user, so its habitual use is the moral equivalent of a drug addiction. The wand can do terrible damage but it too usually gets the owner hurt, and in the end it is only a tool which can be wielded for good just as easily (as Dumbledore did). Presumably most people who wanted the wand for evil were already committed to doing evil without it.

*The most dangerous of the Hallows is obviously the cloak*. If we look at the Tale of the Three Brothers, the wand and the stone are clearly traps set by Death which the first two brothers walk into. But the third brother outsmarts Death and gets a ridiculously overpowered item with no drawbacks. Its express purpose is concealment, which implies doing an action you don't want linked to you. That could be as small as stealing from Honeyduke's or peeping in the Quidditch locker room, all the way up to robbing banks, rape, and murder, or planting bombs in the Ministry.

If we're judging objects as more or less dangerous based on how much moral restraint is keeping the owners from doing terrible things with them, the cloak is obviously the most dangerous, and the wizarding world is lucky that it was passed through the same family of decent people. Then again, if some Potter ancestor /had/ used the cloak to commit heinous crimes... well, no one would know, would they?

*** /Veil of Death/

Immovable, can't really cause much damage with it. Just use Avada Kevadvra if you really want to kill someone.

/time turners/

All destroyed.

/There are creatures which suck out souls./

Agreed. Dementors have been proven to not be under the control of the Ministry, and should be destroyed. A more controllable method should be used to guard Azkaban and have everyone fear it.

/Why not isolate and study them, like so many other dangerous or covetable items?/

Because they have caused a great amount of death and despair? Would you isolate nukes and weapons of mass destruction, or would you get rid of them in some desert so that no one can misuse them for evil?

/The wand can do terrible damage/

Agreed. That's why it was destroyed. If you are the owner of the wand, you are the most powerful wizard ever. And you're also a target. Say you're a bad guy, a Voldemort wannabe - if you possess the wand, you can do tremendous amounts of damage. Now say, by some chance, the owner of the Elder Wand is a good guy - give him a year or two, and he'll be killed in his sleep, the Elder Wand will be stolen and the next bad guy is a real threat to the whole Wizarding World.

/The most dangerous of the Hallows is obviously the cloak./

Agreed - the cloak should be destroyed too.

**** A couple things since I like doing this devil's advocate stuff--

1) The Elder Wand doesn't make you the most powerful wizard ever. Grindelwald had it, and Dumbledore defeated him. Dumbledore wasn't killed a couple years later, he had the wand for 53 years. For all we know, there are plenty of Elder wand owners throughout history who were peaceful, but only the evil ones got noticed, thus the legend of constant bloodshed was born. We don't actually /know/ how much death and despair the Elder wand has caused (beyond Grindelwald), most of it is legend.

2) We absolutely do keep dangerous things around to study, including weapons. But they don't have to be weapons. Useful chemicals/radioactive material can be turned into weapons-- but they are also isolated and studied carefully. The wand is a tool, not just a weapon.
