:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic partially and didn't finish it. Anyone know the name? I think it has something to do with the chamber as well.

There was one more, snape centric story where we see how snape saves harry again and again with a time turner. Goes like canon till year 7 and then harry finds out.

Any other stories with similar premise?

There was also another fic where each time harry dies, he returns in time to his own body, and is quite paranoid due to this as well. Edit:This is linkffn(the many deaths of harry potter)
