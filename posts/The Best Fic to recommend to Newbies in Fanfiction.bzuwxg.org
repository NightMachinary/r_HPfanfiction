I think the best fanfiction to recommend to people venturing into fanfiction would be Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).

Firstly, if the new reader has read all seven of the books, they have enough information to thoroughly enjoy it, knowing about the horcrux in Harry's scar.

Secondly, It does not divert from the canon plot, (As in main task; defeating Voldemort) so the reader is not taken on origional plots, which may potentially put them off.

Thirdly, I believe it has great humour, which is always a great entrance into the fanfiction world, and is one of the most acclaimed and well-known fics in fanfiction.

I think one o the best times to recommend it to someone is right after they have read all the books.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is a great canon compliant political drama if you like that genre.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
