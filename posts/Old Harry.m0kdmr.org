Any recs for a story, where Harry is old (in a combination albus+moody old). I just read the idea somewhere and i think it would be great if it exists. Or at least old badass op harry (pref with no new gen)


** That would be cool, give Harry and his friends a [[https://youtu.be/RzClCJFpSoM][naruto and sasuke vs momoshiki]] moment and his kids are like damn I know dad is famous for killing a dark lord but this is kinda crazy.

** It's dead now, and Harry wasn't Dumbledore-old, just Moody-old, but this was one fic of harry that I rather liked if you could get over his obsession with getting laid.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.
