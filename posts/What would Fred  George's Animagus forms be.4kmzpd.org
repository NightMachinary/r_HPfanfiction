I've never come across a fic were the twins are Animgai. I imagine that if they ever found out that their heroes were Animgai they would stop at nothing they figured out how to do it.


** For some reason, I have the mental image of the hyenas in Lion King right now.

** I'd want them to be Trash Pandas aka. racoons, but they're not thieves. Racoons are still mainly known to be thieving and very easy karma on reddit.

Judging from my stay in Malaysia, Macaques could also fit very well.

** Lemurs.

Edit: Because they tend to form small, tight groups, employ complex methods of communication, and (as mammals go) are extremely intelligent and able to craft and use tools.

** A meerkat and a warthog.

A mouse and an elephant.

A monkey and a dog.

All Fred and George respectively. A fun combo that would make for some good scenes.

** I've felt that they shouldn't be the same form, as they aren't the same person. Fred seems more outgoing while George is slightly more thoughtful.

George = Beaver

Fred = Otter
