Am I the only one who feels like Voldemort is kinda weak?

Like I know he's supposed to be strong, but when I compare him to Dumbledore and Grindelwald, he seems so... lacking.

When he was first rising to power, I can believe that he would soon become greater than or equal to Dumbledore and Grindelwald, but the Horcruxes just made him weak.

I think it's because we never really see any of his feats. With Dumbledore, he is built up from the beginning as being Dumbledore. Defeater of Grindelwald and the only person Voldy ever feared. But with Voldemort we just get, he's dark and spooky. That's pretty much it.

I'm not doing a very good job of getting my point across, but let me know if you also feel the same way.

#+end_quote

This is canonically false. The horcruxes didn't do anything but split his soul and make him ugly.

Dumbledore couldn't kill Voldemort. We see this. He tries. Very hard. I imagine he tried very hard for that whole decade Voldemort was gathering followers and killing off whole families. So, if Dumbledore couldn't kill him with the Elder Wand that would make Dumbledore weak, too.

Voldemort had Dumbledore actively fighting against him. Dumbledore admits to avoiding Grindewald as long as he could.

*** Plus the fact that in their OotP duel, Dumbledore with Elder Wand still needed Fawkes to take a Killing Curse for him which would otherwise have hit him. So if Dumbledore hadn't had external help, Voldemort would have won the duel.

The OotP duel was without a doubt a /strategic/ victory for Dumbledore - he exposes Voldemort, protects Harry and the prophecy, and smartly relies on external aid when necessary. But that's a different question to what the duel says about Dumbledore and Voldemort's respective magical abilities /as wizards/. And from that duel, Voldemort's magical abilities appear to exceed Dumbledore's.

**** I think you're missing a lot there. Dumbledore forced Voldemort to retreat while holding off Bellatrix without killing her and protecting Harry AND handicapping himself by not using lethal force.

Had he simply killed Bellatrix using the statue instead of trapping her, he would've had an additional indestructible statue to use. We saw killing curses bounce off of it.

Also, I would say a Wizard's familiar is a part of his strength.

EDIT: He made Voldemort his bitch despite the insane handicap. Only Voldemort was ever seen struggling and forced on the defensive 3 times, with shield, fire whip and water trap.

***** Also, the Elder Wand doesn't seem to make a big difference going by the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald duel.

Voldemort and Dumbledore are fairly matched in a combat sense, but Dumbledore does seem to have a deeper understanding of magic and greater intelligence. Keep in mind that Dumbledore also never bothered to learn or use the more powerful dark magic for moral reasons.

But that implies that neither party were pulling their punches, so to speak, and I'm of the opinion that Dumbledore was actively handicapping himself during that fight, mostly from the standpoint of not attacking Voldemort with the intent to kill.

***** I'm not sure that this makes a difference. Wizards are not like the Avengers, able to repeatedly take hits and shake them off. A wizarding duel is not one where each party deals a lot of successive damage to the other, where winning the duel comes from crossing some line where the damage becomes too much for your opponent to deal with.

That's the kind of fight where the intent to avoid killing is a handicap, because you have to avoid doing anything which might deal excessive damage for fear of accidentally crossing that line.

But wizarding duels are rather different.

A wizarding duel is basically a contest of who can be the first party to land a spell on the opponent. A single spell is sufficient to disable even the strongest wizard, and there's a multitude of (non-lethal) disabling spells to choose from; it doesn't really matter which one you hit them with. If Dumbledore hits Voldemort with an Entrail-Expelling Curse or a Stunning Charm doesn't really matter. Either way, he's won the duel. Indeed, arguably the Stunning Charm is better, because a Voldemort with his entrails expelled is presumably still conscious.

Even if your spell doesn't completely and immediately disable your opponent, the fact that your opponent is now dealing with the debilitating effects of being hit by a spell basically means that you have such a massive advantage that you're going to find it simple to win the duel in short order.

****** Besides, Dumbledore did shoot a powerful spell at Voldemort, which was presumably /at least/ fairly letal as it looked like another use of the spell from the death eaters' side made walls explode with ease (correct me if I'm wrong about this part) - only, it didn't hit because Voldemort managed to nearly /instantly/ wordlessly conjure a silver shield to deflect this.

This fact alone showcases Voldemort's power.

** I agree totally, but JKR isn't the best world builder. Canon HP was fine when I was a kid and reading “Voldemort is so scary people don't even say his name” is enough to be scared. But as an adult I'm quite disappointed by JKR's villans. Probably why so many love the evil/manipulative Dumbledore trope, bc otherwise it's just so flat.

But there are a lot of fics that do a better villan and why I so much prefer fanfiction. Tom Riddle and Voldemort are great characters to flesh out.

Two recs if you want: I just finally went to read this (imo underrated if abandoned) fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593]]) where Voldemort takes over the world in a much more “realistic” way.

Or one of my all time favorite where Tom is evil and smart and Voldemort is quite narrow-minded but at least powerful and intimidating: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681/chapters/29871909]]

** Well that's because Voldemort was always meant to be the big bad villain who scared everybody but was dumb enough to be outsmarted by the child protagonist. Later on when the books became more oriented towards young adults, JK tried to give him some depth but the damage was done so she had to justify his stupidity as ignorance and pride and his downfall being orchestrated by Dumbledore through some complicated machinations.

*** This is what I think too!

It wasn't until I read some M-rated or higher fics that didn't shy away from exploring what would happen if Voldemort won the war, or showing some horrible things he had done that it made me realize how much of a sugarcoated version we got in the books. They are marketed towards children and teens so of course the most he can do is perform torture with a single spell that's considered the worst thing to endure or kill people. Some of the fics I've read are so fucked up and come up with creative ways to torture or mutilate or destroy people which feels way more realistic of what we would expect from a psychopath like Voldemort. But it's hardly something that would have gotten published, so it makes sense JKR didn't include the worst of his crimes.

Basically, I think Voldemort still has the premise to be a really good and dangerous villain but only in fics where people can freely explore his character. Can even be canon-compliant.

** Voldemort should have been strong. It's my theory, though, that the horcruxes split more than just his soul.

In many cultures, the soul, mind, body, and magic have a balance that needs to be upheld. And they're all intrinsically linked through the soul.

So I believe that when he split his soul, he split his mind (intelligence and reasoning and all that) and magic, which is why he's so weak. And his body shows the effects of it, which is why he's a snake. Actually, the snake thing might have been an animagus transformation gone wrong because he barely had a soul. Well, looks like I have a new headcanon.

Anyway, that's why there's such a huge disconnect between Tom Marvolo Riddle and Lord Voldemort. One has his soul, the other does not. Tom could have been great, and for all we knew, he wasn't as unreasonable and crazy as Voldemort. A lot of what we know about Tom's personality is deducted from Dumbledore's guesses about him. And (bad) memories from his younger years. But the thing was, Dumbledore is biased. He hated Tom from the start. He isn't to be trusted about this sort of thing. Tom could very well have had his heart in the right place about changing the wizarding world, but it's not like Dumbledore would have actually known that. And so when Tom made 7 horcruxes, he fucked himself over. And if horcruxes split the soul in half rather than small pieces, he's doubly fucked because then that would mean he only has 0.78125% of soul in the end. Even Harry has more of his soul than him (1.5625%). And Nagini has the same amount as Voldemort. It's pathetic.

So, I'm of the opinion that had he not made horcruxes, Voldemort would be even stronger than Dumbledore. Much stronger. But he split himself into pieces. And his magical ability now, even when he isn't whole, says a lot about how powerful he should be.

*** The only reason he lost to Harry the second time was because of the Elder Wand. If Voldemort used literally any other wand in the last fight he would have killed Harry, because the Elder Wand refused to kill it's true master. And the first time, well it's my belief that Lily and/or James planned a ritual or spell. They knew he was coming for Harry, they just didn't know when. They thought they would be safe with the fidelius, but if James hadn't planned ahead, would he have really left his wand on the dresser when the house was attacked? He intended to die.

As much as i believe he was a smarmy douche, L. Malfoy showed a lot more promise as the kind of person that wins the style of war that Britain fought inside its own borders.

That was mostly a matter of intent. After Dumbledore's death, most of the Death Eater were busy "purging" Brittain while Voldemort himself pretty much ignored everything in order to find a way to kill Harry. If Voldemort had been the winner of the Battle of Hogwarts, conquering the rest of the world would probably only have been a matter of time.

Also, I think she said it in an interview so not canon, but from what I remember, Rowling mentioned that during the events of HBP and DH, the rest of the world is pretty much shitting itself while keeping an eye on Brittain.

** I absolutely agree with you. However, jk Rowling wrote children's books, not expecting that the children would grow up and see things differently.

Grindelwald was more dangerous because he was sane and did everything willingly. He had family , friends and Dumbledore.

Voldemort, on the other side, was truly insane. I imagine horcruxes cost him his life, body and sanity. He had nobody, he was an orphan. I could actually commend him on gaining all that power as he came from nothing. He could have been a very complex character, just like Snape, if Rowling bothered to do so. Especially the pensieve memories of his youth that Harry saw. He was portrayed as evil psychopath since before Hogwarts. And l don't think he was. She concentrated instead on the Golden trio, which is fine,but boring for some. There is a reason why half of the movie theatre is bawling their eyes after Snape's death.

I compare Grindelwald and Voldemort with Darth Vader and Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren is a loser, inferior to Rey just like Voldemort loses all the time to Harry and Dumbledore.

** From canon, Voldemort and Dumbledore are both on a higher tier than anyone else we see - with Grindelwald likely joining them too. However, obviously it's not particularly possible to compare them, just with how the story is structured and that not being the focus.

The horcruxes didn't weaken him per se, from what I understand. However, I prefer thinking of them as weakening him in terms of his mind - making him more prone to his outbursts of rage/delusion, make tactically unsound decisions, etc - vs a non horcrux version still maintaining being very suave and persuasive and smart. But magically, I don't see why he should be weaker.

Now, I think what you're getting at is that Voldemort doesn't really feel like a terrible threat - and that's because he has to be beaten by the young heroes. In the earlier books, getting thwarted by a 12 year old is obviously going to be humiliating, and he can't be that scary because they were written for kids. Later on, he's still fairly cartoonish and prone to making mistakes, which is fitting for letting Harry win - but not great for making him seem like a terrifying villain.

Dumbledore falls into the same trap of seeming foolish and incompetent through canon, though I think in your case it seems like you took him/his descriptions at face value. He does have the advantage of narratively never having to 'actually' lose, or to have to fight the young heroes, so he can maintain the appearance of his magical ability - unlike Voldemort, who does have to lose. Grindelwald we know little about, comparatively - but he's helped by being able to be just described through lore, which makes it much easier for characters to be super strong (eg - it's much easier to just say someone was brilliant and list a few examples you come up with, vs having to consistently characterize them as brilliant over 7 books/years of their life. Or to just let them do something impressive without having to figure out the logistics)
