In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is exposed to basilisk venom and a potent dose of phoenix tears. Over the next few years, he discovers that something in him has changed... sadly, it's not much use against Voldemort.

This is a Harry with one or two minor basilisk and/or phoenix powers. Some examples (though I'm sure people have thought of others):

**** Phoenix
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: phoenix
     :END:

- *"fire-related powers"*: He has, in effect, a permanent, weak flame-freezing charm.
- *"tears have healing powers"*: He's /slightly/ more resilient against poison (the only practical effect of this is that he can almost drink Hagrid under the table).
- He develops an affinity for healing magic. (Seriously, with all the scrapes the lad gets into, why wasn't he learning anything he could from Madam Pomfrey?!?)
- *"disappear and reappear at will in bursts of flames"*: When he learns to apparate, rather than the usual "crack" of displaced air, he disappears/reappears in a literal puff of smoke. ("Bamf!")
- *"song also has a deep emotional impact"*: He has a particularly powerful voice (or would have if he sang, except that he can't carry a tune in a bucket).
- *"carry immensely heavy loads"*: He often helps Hermione with her book-bag (though he doesn't know why she's complaining; it's not /that/ heavy).
- *"feathers glow faintly in darkness"*: He glows in the dark, which is sometimes annoying when he's trying to sleep.
- *"tail feathers are hot to the touch"*: His backside becomes uncomfortably warm if he sits for more than a couple of hours. Hermione is annoyed at the frequent study interruptions, but the breaks do her good and she stresses less.

**** Basilisk
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: basilisk
     :END:

- *"snake"*: He remains a parselmouth even without the scarcrux.
- *"armoured skin"*: He's better able to shrug off insults, but does get very itchy and has bad dandruff every few weeks.
- *"murderous stare"*: This gives an excuse for the fan-favourite "arresting green-eyes" (just as well they're mostly seen through glass).
- *"venomous fangs"*: If he bites anyone, they get a bit woozy for a minute or so.
- *"crowing ... is fatal to it"*: He develops mild alektorophobia (which Fred and George, naturally, attempt to exploit).
- *"mortal enemy of spiders"*: He hasn't seen a spider for years. Though oblivious as to the reason, Ron becomes mellower and more content with his lot.


** Lol. Like, no "I can apparate through wards" bullshit, just straight up puff of smoke and flame. I think I'll use it in my fanfic.

***** If i remember correctly, it was because he had a piece of basilisk fang stuck in his arm that was somehow still producing venom that got into his blood.\\
His blood became normalized to it thanks to the (increasingly diluted) phoenix tears.

**** Honestly, the only issue with the Killing Curse green eyes trope is overuse. It actually works well in a quite a few fics to give some impact. The problem is that because of such overuse it doesn't have the right impact for the average fanfiction reader that it would for someone unused to the trope.

***** True, but if one gets poetic enough it might even work.

What I hate is the kind of ppl who see "killing curse green" and immediately go to the end of the chapter just to say "I READ KILLING CURSE GREEN AND IMMEDIATELY STOPPED READING YOU'RE SO TERRIBLE THIS STORY IS SH*T GO DIE!!!" instead if trying to read a bit further to see if they like the story or just exiting without yelling at the author for using something completely valid.

**** Not particularly, the other two that I've read were already recced (basilisk eyes and unexpected effects) but they are very different from this specific fic.

The best I can recommend is to try searching through the parselmouth tag for fics or maybe just tagging for basilisk and see what comes up.

****** Off the top of my head:

Prince of Slytherin has a lot of world building, some people think too much since the plot can move a bit slowly. (I'm also behind in this fic, I like to let the chapters to build up a bit so I have a decent amount to read through) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

To shape and change - delves into werewolves and healing magic a bit (I havent finished it yet though, I jump between fics) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]]

Blood - severitus, but really really well written. No weasley bashing either. If anything, read it for the good good friendship. (This has a bit of slash, but exploring sexuality is one of the plot points and its handled very well imo) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3089927/chapters/6696266]]

Antithesis - super dark and heartbreaking, but very good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]]

Theres more I could probably list, but I'm on mobile. If I think of any more later I'll post again.

** linkao3(Basilisk Eyes)

Some venom gets in his eyes, during the fight with the Basilisk. Fawkes cries directly into the to eyes stop the venom, but it's already done a lot of damage, rendering Harry legally blind (can see brightness, but nothing else).

Apparently, when phoenix tears get into your tear ducts, you also cry phoenix tears.

** This has Harry transforming in a were-basilisk. (It's after Voldemort defeat, so it doesn't really help him in the war.)

I wouldn't usually recommend it in this sub, but since this fic has a double ending you can choose from, (one generic and one slash) maybe you could enjoy the generic one?
