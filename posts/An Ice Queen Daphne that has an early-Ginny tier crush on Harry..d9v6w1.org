The cliche pureblood Ice Queen Daphne, except that she's got an ultra-crush on Harry. He's aware of her existence and general reputation, but hasn't given her much more thought than that. She has finally worked up the courage to try making her move. The other slytherin girls may or may not be disgusted, but they're willing to be her pseudo-wingwomen. Hilarity ensues.

Are there any fics like that?


** Looking around the Great Hall and hearing the less than whispers of the other students, Daphne knew this may be her best chance for a shot with Harry. Having spent the previous three years stal...observing Harry, she was certain he hadn't put his name in that stupid (yet glorious) goblet and now was the time to make her move. As she noticed the mudbl...muggleborn, muggleborn, muggleborn (that slip could ruin everything)leave with a stack of toast and forlorn look, Daphne gathered up Pansy (who owed her a favor) and followed.

** i started writing a femharry/daphne version of this yesterday to post @ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/12493023/]] , per the [[/r/haphne]] discord

part of draft, unbeated. fem!harry name is placeholder. (why are fem!harry names so hard?)

#+begin_quote
  "Tracey, look."

  "What?"

  "It's her."

  "Daph..."

  "Look at her. I wonder what she's up to," she mumbled.

  "You ask that every day."

  "Yes, but doesn't she make you think? How do you think she gets her hair to be so black? Is it natural? Does she dye it in thestral blood every fortnight -”

  "This is the third time we've talked about her hair the past two weeks. Stop it. You're creeping me out."

  Daphne looked at her. "Fine then. How do I ask her out?"

  Tracey spat out her oatmeal. "What???"

  "How do I ask her out?"

  "Ask her out?

  "Yes, ask her out," Daphne said. "Hello Lily J. Potter; would you like to date me, daughter of illustrious imprisoned Death Eater Cyprus Greengrass. I have way more money than should be reasonable for an 18-year old girl, as my father left all of his properties to me, and my wealthy but positively horrid mother died of dragon pox last year. I single-handedly manage the Greengrass fortune, I am an impressionable young lady, very vulnerable to spending money on any potential girlfriends, and -"

  "Daph - what? You're into - why would you be into Lily Potter?!" Tracey asked, angrily. "You've never spoken a word to each other in your life!"

  "I once asked her for a quill in -"

  "Yes and she didn't even hear you!"

  "I did ask her." Daphne pointed out, sullenly. "And I would have you know that I have caught her looking my way when I -"

  "Yes but did she even look at you specifically, or just at the Slytherin part of the class," Tracey glared.

  "I - er,"

  "Exactly... Daph, does she even know your name?"

  "Tracey. I am the scion of -"

  "Yes, illustrious Greengrass fortune, business, clothes, bloodline, pretentiousness, so forth, and Harry Potter was raised in a mundane household, runs around with the pigs and probably plays with mud in the weekends."

  "She does not play with mud," Daphne declared, "I know that she is a highly admirable and respectable -"

  "Have you seen her after Quidditch?"

  Daphne pouted. "Shut up"

  "You just like staring at her legs when she wears Quidditch pants," Tracey murmured.

  Daphne coughed, blushing, “I do not stare.”

  Tracey looked at her silently in response.

  Daphne, increasingly embarrassed, looked down at her half-eaten breakfast. “Stop it. You're making me feel like an infatuated schoolgirl.” She pushed her food around. “I don't /stare.../”

  “Daph, you /are/ an infatuated schoolgirl.”

  Daphne wrinkled her face. “Why can't we focus on helping me ask Lily Potter out instead of ridiculing me.”

  “Daph...”

  “No, I'm serious. Every time I bring up other girls you always talk me out of it.”

  Tracey looked uncomfortable.

  Daphne continued, “I don't - I don't just like Lily Potter because of her legs, or her Quidditch pants - although I'm still curious about the thestral blood.” (Tracey groaned.) “It's for all the other things, Tracey. You read the same articles I did. You saw her last year, too. And besides, have you seen all the useless students trying to impress her? /Ernie Macmillian/? The situation is simply such that nobody else is good enough for her, other than me.”

*** On the topic of names: neither James or Lily ever came across (from the admittedly little we actually know of them) like the kind of people that name their children after themselves. And it's not really a British thing to do either.

IMO, just go with Iris or whatever. It is a fairly common femharry name, sure, but it still fits both the setting in style and is a reasonable likely name to have.

The flower theme could just be an oddity of Lily's parents, but I could see her wanting to continue it. In that case, I'd say the best names are probably something like Holly/Daisy/Rose.

*** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6311215/1/The-Lion-Tamer][The Lion Tamer by James Spookie]], book one in a completed Harry/Daphne trilogy. All in all, quite good. Well written, well paced, characters are well developed. The author doesn't get super creative with the plot, which prevents it from achieving true greatness in my opinion, as it is just a tad on the generic side. But it is evident that the author is highly competent, and that the story is very well done.

On the whole, 8/10 would read again.

  First in the Lion's Trilogy. Daphne likes Harry, and decides she wants to get to know him. Harry is receptive to her advances. Little do they know of how their blossoming relationship will change the course of fate.
