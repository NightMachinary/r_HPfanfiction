LF any fics where James and Lily are alive and wormtail was never a traitor, so all four marauders are still close friends.


** That sounds exactly like the *Promises Saga*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/22909/Robin4][Robin4]]. A series of stories about an AU where Sirius is the Secret Keeper of the Potters, not Pettigrew. Keep in mind, though, that these fics are *LONG* and heavy, and are focused more in the relationship between the protagonists than the action itself, and could make you tired of them if you're not too invested.

​

The reading order should be this:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]] linkffn(1248431)
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1567001/1/Promises-Remembered][Promises Remembered]] linkffn(1567001)
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204188/1/Promises-Defended][Promises Defended]] linkffn(2204188)

There's a prequel to all of it called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4881348/1/Promises-Honored][Promises Honored]] linkffn(4881348), which takes place before Unbroken, but it feels better to read that in the end, after you have all the background of all that happened in the other fics.

​

Here Pettigrew is not a traitor, but only because he didn't get the chance to become one, since, as stated earlier, Sirius is the one who takes his place as the Secret Keeper. He is a Death Eater, though, but he redeems himself in a very believable way and later develops into a pretty good character.
