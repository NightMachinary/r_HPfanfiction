** I've recommended it before, but not for almost a year:

(NSFW) [[http://marjorie.auroris.net/harry-potter-cov/a-trip-to-hogsmead/][Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus]] by Marjorie Greene

Summary: "My apologies to J. K. Rowling, but as the magical threesome heads into their late teens, I just couldn't resist expanding their education a bit. In this short work (I can't see it going more than a few chapters), Harry learns the hard way that sex waits for no man, and that there's a lot more being taught at Hogwarts than he thought. "

Why it rocks- despite mis-spellings and ignoring canon in various ways, it portrays all the involved characters as complete characters. The descriptions are rich, the emotions believable and the sex is varied.

There are even some supplementary drawings by the author, with links within the story text (also NSFW, obviously).

** I find it hard to recommend a lot of other places since it has such a laundry list of caveats that make most people just NOPE right out at the summary, but I've recently been obsessed with linkffn(7613196) and its sequels linkffn(8239413) and linkffn(10041727)

The main caveats are: fem!harry (really, HINO), pre-teen politicking, somewhat positive portrayal of snape (though he really is still a greasy git), Unique super-special awesome powers for the MC, and magic cores.

If you can stomach that though (and TBH, I don't even view half of those as negatives anyway), I really dig the alternative take on the HP universe it gets into, kind of Firebird trilogy-esque, but without all the super gross and regressive stuff that that series gets into. And it has a super neat take on potions brewing, making it a lot more interesting than 'cooking with a cauldron'

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

**** The summary of /Serpentine Subterfuge/ uses the word /sinister/ twice in one sentence

That just about killed it's chances for me. The unique potion brewing sounds interesting though. And that it's not psychotic like the FB Trilogy would be a bonus.

***** I think in this case the re-use of the word is a call-back to the earlier reference rather than the writer lacking a good synonym.

It's not badly written or anything, but it's quite morally dubious.
