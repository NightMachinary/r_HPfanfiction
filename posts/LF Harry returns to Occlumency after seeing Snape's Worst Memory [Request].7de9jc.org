This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Dumbledore says that the only thing--the MOST IMPORTANT THING--Harry can do for the war effort is learn Occlumency. And yes, Snape is literally the worst teacher ever for this, obviously; my dude Snape is too petty to make it work and it's frankly reprehensible that he doesn't get over himself long enough to keep the lessons going. (He is an adult and Harry is a child and it is /his job to both know more than Harry and also to be more mature than Harry oh my god Snape could you please put your ego aside for two damn seconds/ UGH.)

But it just bothers /so much/ that Harry not only fails to do this for Dumbledore, but he also lies to Hermione and Ron, even as he acknowledges to himself that 1. he didn't really try hard enough 2. he shouldn't have looked int he pensieve and he REALLY didn't want to know what was in there and 3. Hermione is there to remind him that Occlumency is /really really important/ even after Dumbledore bounces out and Umbridge is nominally in charge of the school!

I want a fic where Harry goes back and tries harder--or Snape drags him back into lessons!--and what the rest of the war looks like with a Harry who can actually Occlude. I prefer fic that hews very close to canon but if I have to dip my toes into Snarry or some other ship to find this I am more than willing to do so. This bothers me so much. I can't be the only one who wants to fix it.

If I can't find it, I'm going to have to write it. Don't make me do this. /Please./


** linkffn(Stronger than hope) AU, focuses a lot on occlumency and legilimency. Harry decides that his actions led to Sirius' death and attempts to learn occlumency on his own. Snape finds out and gets involved. It's a Snape mentor fic, but he is very much in character here (although its written before Deathly Hallows so not completely canon in some ways).

*** Oh sure--and I think saying he "cancelled them" is being too kind. Like I said, it's Snape's job to be the adult here and put his ego aside and he utterly fails. But Harry's is the perspective we get, and we get to see him decide to lie to his friends rather than go back. Snape is absolutely more responsible here for what happens as the adult and the instructor, but Harry demonstrates so much maturity and intelligence and selflessness elsewhere that I wish he could have done so here.

** I love a good fic where Harry goes back to occlumency. There are a lot if you look into fics were Snape mentors/adopts Harry. A fics I love that has Harry go back to occlumency is A Year Like None Other by Aspeninthesunlight. Go on Potions and Snitches and poke around, you'll find so many

I also wrote a fic where Harry goes back to occlumency call Lucky Balance (penname Melibelly). It is a Drarry, if you are interested.

** Check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within by Theowyn of HPG) which is based on this premise, but in 6th year. It's an AU and a mentor!Snape fic, but he's pretty in character. There's a sequel too, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls by Theowyn of HPG)

linkffn(Moment of Impact by Suite Sambo) and linkffn(Far Beyond a Promise Kept by oliver.snape) follows the same themes but Snape is toned down a bit. They're still a good read.

** Well, throughout the series, Harry is treated like a child and expected to act as an adult. It wasn't a surprise that he acted like a child, was it.

#+begin_quote
  it just bothers so much that Harry not only fails to do this for Dumbledore
#+end_quote

You mean do it for someone that caused Harry's isolation and procceeded to avoid his previously "favorite" student at every opportunity?

#+begin_quote
  he didn't really try hard enough
#+end_quote

Just imagine trying to "clear your mind" in the cancerous enviroment that was Harry's fifth year.

#+begin_quote
  he shouldn't have looked int he pensieve and he REALLY didn't want to know what was in there
#+end_quote

The whole scene screams "manufacted bullshit" to me. With how skilled a wizard Snape is portrayed to be, he couldn't spell the pensieve with a barrier or jinx to prevent entry?

My theory is that Snape wanted Harry to see it, both to shatter the pedestal that James was on in Harry's mind and to have an excuse to stop the lessons.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is there to remind him that Occlumency is really really important
#+end_quote

Well /fuck me sideways/, if your annoying nagging friend said it, it must be gospel!

#+begin_quote
  even after Dumbledore bounces out and Umbridge is nominally in charge of the school
#+end_quote

Dumbledore /chose/ to let Umbridge have free reign in the school. He could have confounded her at any time, with the Elder wand no less, effectively neutralising her and saving his students a fuckload of useless trauma, physical, emotional and academic. Chew on that for a moment.

#+begin_quote
  what the rest of the war looks like with a Harry who can actually Occlude
#+end_quote

It looks like canon? Harry fighting off the possession succesfully seems to be equivalent to having mastered occlumency, since no one brings up occlumency ever again.

*** Man, I could not disagree with you more!

For me, so much of the books are Harry being handed a total crapsack deal and rising above it, rising to the challenges he is presented with. This is one situation where he fails and it sticks out.

But your last point is wrong in text--Dumbledore himself says that Voldemort isn't exploring Harry's mind again as possessing him at the end of OotP was agony and it's clear that, as the connection is two-way, Harry could foil Voldemort's plans with the connection as well (as seen in Harry saving Arthur from Nagini). There is no indication he's successfully mastered any amount of Occlumency, just that Voldemort is being more careful with their connection.

  Weren't they learning it in Snape's office or somewhere? I don't think he's paranoid to enchant a barrier/jinx to prevent entry for his off to the side pensieve. Your theory could be true, but it doesn't change the fact that he shouldn't have looked into someone's private business.

Yeah, this one is a solid example of a teen being a teen and not respecting someone's privacy, like that one time I looked through my sister's texts just because I felt like it.

Ah, so you're saying the best thing Dumbledore could have done would have been to attack the government appointed overseer who was there to make sure he wasn't trying to rebel against the government.
