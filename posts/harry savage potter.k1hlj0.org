Can we please appreciate some of the best Harry quotes?

"Yes, you can have a word: Goodbye!"- 24 of November, 1994

(Throws a "Potter Stinks" badge at Ron) "Look, if you are lucky maybe it will now leave a scar! Isnt that what you are so jealous of?" - 22 of November, 1994

Like you fucking savage


** It isn't Savage as it is sassy but fan fiction authors seem to forget this a lot
