Hobby was the wrong word. I mean that he gets a title like Harry, the boy who lives and Hermione, the smartest witch of their generation. It should be something people can witness him doing. Like the silent striker, the master of the elements or the swordman


** I'm co-writing a fic where Ron is just starting to realize that he needs to change some of his behavior, and is developing his own unique interests. We haven't really delved into his family relationships as yet, but it's something that'll be touched on eventually. Also, as a side note: He's recovering from trauma at the beginning of the story, so he's a bit volatile. Just something to keep in mind.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** I'm currently writing a story where Ron taking on a new...well I wouldn't call it a hobby, but career choice is a pretty big part. There hasn't been any issues with Percy so far, but he has been slapped in the face a bit by his knee jerk response to money and is working on it. If you're interested it's

Linkffn(13590250)

Although fair warning it's Lunar Harmony and Ron/Lavender (Although that hasn't started yet) so if either turn you off, fair enough.

  The night of Sirius Black's reveal and subsequent escape from Hogwarts was a shock the Trio couldn't ignore. With Harry's hope of a decent home life gone, Pettigrew on his way back to Voldemort and corrupt government officials covering everything up they find a simple late night talk is the spark they need to light a fire in them they'll dearly need.

*** That's true but I actually mean something big that he will be recognised for and that helps them on more than one occasion. Ron needs a title like Harry being the boy who lives and Hermione being the smartest witch of their generation. Like: Ron, the sword wielder, Ron, the master of the elements, Ron, the silent striker/Assassin, something like that.

**** Chess as his hobby can be developed into being a great planner, strategies for war and all.

Plus other than the sword wielder, I don't think the other two examples can be called "hobbies". I understand you mean that he has something which he excels at that can give him the confidence to overcome his insecurities but hobby is a poor choice of word here.
