H/Hr is by far my favorite pairing for this fandom and I have read many stories for the pairing. It's been a while since I've gone searching, and I was wondering if anyone could point out any good fics with them being closer or even starting a relationship before OotP? I enjoy full a retelling of the entire series, so the earlier on in the series the fics start, the better.

** Most stories by robst are like that, although I don't really like them myself despite being a fan of H/Hr.

** There's always Harry Crow: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]] You probably know it though. It's a WIP but regularly updated. H/Hr that starts in first year, but Harry has been raised by goblins and is very strong, intelligent and weird.

** This doesn't start in first year but is my absolute favorite h/hr story written. Its called harry potter and the fifth element. If you haven't read it you really should.
