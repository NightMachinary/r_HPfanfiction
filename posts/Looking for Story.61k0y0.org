I'm looking for a Story of Fanfiction.net, where Harry is betrayed and disappears to the US where he becomes one of the best wizards in a elite hitwizard organisation, but they betray him and he ends up going to England and he gains ownership of Hogwarts. It's a bit of a crack fic, I've been searching for hours but can't find it. Does anyone know the title? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks


** You probably mean this linkffn(From the Shadows by MK-ONE). It started pretty seriously but ended like crack-fic.

  Harry is betrayed at the final battle and is forced to flee England and rebuild his life anonymously anew.Prophesy has a way of interferring and dragging him back to face his destiny,that doesn't mean he has to like it or cooperate with the powers that be
