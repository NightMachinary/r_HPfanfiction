I just want a story in which some smart and manipulative Slytherin is plotting to reach their goals. If it includes well written politics, intrigue and unique wizarding culture... all the better!


** Most definitely linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter). Politics as the main focal point (though that may not be immediately apparent), huge emphasis on Slytherin cunning, unique aspects of wizarding culture (as well as some thoroughly tropey aspects), and the entire plot revolves around a secret the MC keeps to reach their goals. Ambitious, cunning, intriguing -- I couldn't recommend it more! though admittedly I may recommend it too often

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is a WBWL Slytherin!Harry fic. In my opinion it's a very well written exploration of the typical 'conniving Slytherins' and 'Pureblood culture' tropes. It's a long series that updates frequently. Currently it's midway through year 5. Book 1 is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]"

**** Both fics are WBWL Slytherin!Harry stories that follow the stations of canon with an alive James as a terrible father. Harry starts out with a similar friend-group in each fic. However, the two fics start to diverge midway through book 1 and get more and more different from eachother from then on.

I'd recommend trying both fics. Some people prefer one to the other; others enjoy both. Personally I enjoyed SaS more because of the author's writing style and the personalities of the characters.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
