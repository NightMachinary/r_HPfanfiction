As usual, I'm not sure if I've conflated multiple fics together but this is what I remember: The grangers become part of the order and they do a ritual to somehow link Harry and Hermione (can't for the life of me remember why). Lily and James die, Harry is raised but Sirius and Remus (and Dumbledore maybe?) and has to go and find Hermione who is living in the muggle world. Malfoy is sent to Hermione's school to try and turn her against Harry.

I remembered this fic out of the blue and my brain won't let me rest until I find out what it is and whether it was terrible. Google was no help whatsoever.

EDIT: I've just remembered something! When Harry first goes to speak to Hermione, she doesn't believe that magic is real and refuses to listen to him.


** Its...not terrible. Cliched as all get out but not terrible. I have forgotten the name though. Though i think Muggledad or Blot may have written it.
