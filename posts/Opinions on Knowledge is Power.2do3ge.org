I just started reading it, but I'm on the fence with it. The writing isn't terribly good and the story itself doesn't seem promising. The original author said that he considered the Hogwarts part of the story just a massive prologue and that the real story wouldn't start until afterwards, but from what I can tell it doesn't look like it ever actually got past Hogwarts. I'm trying to find out if it's actually worth giving a shot.

EDIT: Sorry I was unspecific, I don't read Robst so I didn't realize that there was another story of the same name. I'm asking about this story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]].


** I don't think robst is very popular here for exactly the reasons you described.

*** I didn't realize he had a story by that name because I've never read anything of his passed a few chapters of Harry Crow, I meant the story found here [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]].

***** Just checked again. he left because he enjoys what he writes much more than the more diverse readers and writers who review and comment do. I'm sad to see him go because his stories are a great intro to the MOB!dumbles/super!harry/HHr genre and easily attract new readers, such as myself. his stories got me hooked on HPFF, and I can't hate on him or them for that alone. though now looking back and comparing them to the hundreds I've fav'ed and possibly thousands I've read, they just don't stand up.

there's also the fact that to my knowledge, he's never been abusive towards the community, despite the typical internet abuse foisted on him, unlike too many others.

If he does post this new project, I'll be very surprised. he lasted all of what, two weeks after saying he's gone before rescinding that?

** Robst is great to read if you enjoy ultra-badass Harry/Hermione winning over the wizarding world while simultaneously biting their thumbs at a totally idiotic/inept/misguided Dumbledore along with the usual jerkass Snape and Malfoy an quite a bit of assorted Weasley bashing. It helps if you're able to look past the stilted dialogue and frequent awkwardly-worded phrases and run-on sentences. That being said, the man has a great imagination when it comes to those epic scenes that most fics have, even if the delivery isn't the greatest. He's currently rewriting Knowledge is Power as it is one of his earlier fics, so you might have better luck going with another one. I personally recommend No Hurry At All, but I actually like most of his fics except Harry Crow which just drags on forever.

*** Sorry, I tried reading Harry Crow and found it to be horrible so I've never read anything else o his and didn't realize there was more than one story by that name. I meant this one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]

** You may need to be more specific. There are multiple stories that go by the title, "Knowledge is Power." A popular one predating robst's is by an author Oblong/SerpentSannin/Fetuccini/MrJoe (he changed his name a lot) and was abandoned after 150k or so words. Despite a large number of reviews, it too was a controversial story that some liked, many didn't. (I found it very annoying, personally.)

As for robst, despite his billion or so reviews, I've yet to read anything by him that's worth recommending.

*** Sorry, I've never actually fully read anything by Robst after I gave Harry Crow a try and realized it sucked so I didn't know there was more than one even mildly popular story with the name.

**** To my knowledge there are several. There's even a Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power by DisobedianceWriter. I can't find it within myself to hate on Robst's rendition because it was the first fanfic I'd ever read, and I know nothing about the one you linked because it was abandoned and I refuse to read abandoned stories. I just can't stand not having closure even if it is a story as nutty as fettuccini's KiP or Lionheart's Partially Kissed Hero. Damn that guy! Even if it was a half-assed shitpost of an epilogue chapter I'd be satisfied enough with the update. :/

**** Not a problem. The Fettucini one (which you linked above) is the one I'd thought you'd meant as well.

That one I /can/ tell you about. Whether or not the Hogwarts arc was intended to be prologue, the author deleted all his fanfiction from the site in a fit of pique and hasn't posted anything in years. (He posted an unpopular chapter, got annoyed at a few negative reviews, and threw a tantrum.) The story is abandoned part-way through the Triwizard Tournament. What you can find now is a reposted version some folks had had archived.

Why he did it can only be speculated on. I do recall that on one of the forums Fettucini used to haunt, he crafted some elaborate tale about being accepted into a top MFA writing program (which is rather doubtful with his skills) and how fanfiction was now "beneath him" or some such. Folks didn't buy it and he had a bit of a public blow-up before vanishing.

Some things that were good/unique about his story: A few-years-older Harry raised by Remus. A plausible Harry/Fleur relationship. Several decently written OC characters who were pretty fleshed out.

Some not so great things: lots of emo moments (playing Bon Jovi on his guitar to his comatose mother, e.g.), Harry being super-ultra-mega at everything he does (Quidditch, Texas Hold-em Poker, academics), a weird preoccupation with one character's getting kicked in the balls every chapter, open and overt misogyny, and his main character being pretty much the classic [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkSue][Jerk Sue]].

***** Thanks for all the info. Considering everything you've said I think I'll probably have to give it a shot even if I don't think I'll get through the whole thing. Harry/Fleur is one of my favorites, but I've only managed to find one good one, so I kind have to try it out.

** Long initial author's notes. I have low tolerance for those, generally. Awkward phrasing abounds. I dislike the style wherein the author of a work seems to talk to the reader.
