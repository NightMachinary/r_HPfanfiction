honestly, there are many things that can make or break a fic. what are some the deal-breakers you guys struggle with?

personally, OCs are one for me. i've read some great fics that portray OCs in a good light. then, there's also other fanfics where i left after the first chapter because the OCs were terribly written into the plot.


** Over bashing. If they don't want a character in their fic I can generally tolerate a short bashing section to explain why they aren't hanging around but when the fic goes out of it's way to bash a character I usually stop.

**** Arguably if it's not prolonged then it may not be bashing at all. One of the core characteristics of bashing is that the bashed characters /never learn/. No matter what they observe, no matter how many times their plans are foiled, they keep trying the same thing over and over with minor variations.

If you make a character a dick but have them develop in response to their experiences into someone who has learnt from their errors, then I'd hesitate to call it bashing, even if it portrays the character in a more negative light than canon.

** When the author desperately wants to pair two completely incompatible characters, and does so through dumb, unrealistic or plain morally wrong means.

I'm not a fan of pairings in general, actually, and sex scenes usually make me drop a fic, especially if they're not marked clear enough to be skipped.

I dislike a protagonist with whom I can't relate, that includes all those ones where they rebel against everyone and then become a good little lord and learn all the nobility nonsense. This also includes protagonists who are sexist, racist or homophobic, and ones which are so incredibly arrogant that they're a pain to read about.

For example, I recently read a "crossover", in which Harry is sent somewhere else and then gits gud and returns to reshape the magical world. So far so good. Then he finds out about his multiple lordships (groan) and begins to threaten everyone when they don't use "Lord Peverell-Potter" while adressing him. The worst scene was when he meets up with Hermione again after completely ignoring her when he reappeared, and then goes on a sexist rant about how she's not to call him Harry, but the lord title. And then she's a good little girl and gives in, while her parents say they'll have 'words' with their 20 year old daughter. The Harry in this story would also be the kind of guy to make her life hell, politically, if she didn't aquiesce. This is shit writing, and betrays both characters.

** The fine line between admitting a character has flaws and bashing said character is one for me. I love to read stories with flawed, imperfect characters. And I find it interesting if a character's canon flaws are explored further. But, if people move from exploring a characters flaws to ignoring their virtues or, worse, to adding extra flaws which conflict with what we know from the character's personality from canon, I cannot take it anymore.

**** And those themes are what ruined the last book for me. I don't want everyone to pretend that all was well after a civil war and ethnic cleansings, I want swift justice. Like, Malfoy is guilty of everything from using unforgivables to various war crimes (eg perfidy, violating Article 23 of the Hague convention and so on). Half of the Ministry collaborated in a genocide while death squads roamed the countryside. A significant number of people died. All could not have been well, even after 20 years.

I mean, 17 years after the war, the Mossad kidnapped Eichmann to bring him in front of a court which sentenced him to death. That's the kind of aftermath which would have been more believable than "Albus Severus" or Malfoy not in prison. But hey, at least Harry's scar didn't hurt.

I actually really like it. & I get what she was trying to do with the epilogue but you're right, some of the stuff in there is kinda ??? I don't mind people changing that stuff up. But something like Dumbledore bashing really gets on my nerves in otherwise good fics. The King's Cross chapter is just so good in books and ties up both Harry and Dumbledore's emotional arcs so well that it kind of bothers me when people undo that growth solely for the sake of putting Dumbledore down. The thematic stuff is so important to me personally that it's a turnoff when fics change it. But I'm aware this isn't the most popular opinion within fandom and that a lot of people want the exact opposite, which is why there's a lot of fics like that.

****** Look, I'm German and therefore the parallels are rather obvious to me

Forgiveness for Ron is one thing since he was under the influence of the Horcrux (although Hermione was as well and she didn't leave). He deserted, but he came back and there were circumstances which IMO make him undeserving of a deserter's fate.

But for Malfoy? He did nothing which redeemed him. He didn't reject the ideology, he only couldn't murder a person while looking them in the eyes. He had no problem with almost murdering Ron (intent follows the bullet (or poison in this case)). And he turned Katie into a magical suicide bomber.

And Snape, well, what exactly did he do to earn his redemption? He defected yes, but he is responsible for the deaths of Moody and Hedwig, he did not keep the Carrows in check, he did nothing to help Harry in regards to the DoM bait, he tried to have an innocent man summarily executed and he was an abusive teacher.

***** Draco Malfoy or Lucius Malfoy, and what did he do that was specifically perfidy? Also, having trouble finding which "Hague convention" you're referring to, so not sure what Article 23 of it covers.

Both of them are definitely guilty of serious criminal acts, though in the former's case one could argue mitigating circumstances given that his parents were being used as hostages against him. Lucius is just complete scum and never shows any redeeming qualities.

  Art. 23. In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden:

  (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons;

  (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;

  (...)

  (e) To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering;
#+end_quote

So no targeted assassination and no use of poison. Both of which Malfoy did. Said poison also does not appear to be a painless way to go. And the cursed jewellery is the same issue again.

In regards to perfidy:

#+begin_quote
  Additional Protocol I defines perfidy as “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence”.
#+end_quote

Malfoy, by wearing the Hogwarts uniform, is distinguishing himself as a civilian and is therefore protected by various regulations. But by using that protection to hide his attacks, he is guilty of perfidy. Even commando units wear some kind of insignia openly, anyone who did not usually found themselves in front of a firing squad or a hangman pretty quickly. A few German officers accused of ordering such an act avoided execution by claiming that the American uniforms their commandos wore were just for slipping through enemy lines and German uniforms should have been worn during any fighting (the actual commandos caught were executed). Warships (commerce raiders) also made sure to hoist the proper flag before engaging for that reason.

And I doubt that Malfoy wore Death Eater masks or displayed his dark mark while carrying out his plots. It would have rendered his whole plan moot after all.

Additionally, pressing enemy civilians into military service for your side is a war crime on its own, and that's what Malfoy did with his Imperius on Katie Bell.

**** Writing quality. My issue is that the vast majority of 1st person fics are just awful.

Writing in 1st person takes a lot more care in order to be done RIGHT. You really have to nail the balance between constructing the narrative and expressing a unique voice for the POV character. ("I was frustrated at our Keeper's inability to block the Quaffle" versus "Merlin's tits! Why the hell couldn't our Keeper block a single bloody shot?") Then once you find a character voice, it needs to be kept consistent (unless there is a narrative purpose to not keep it consistent).

You also have to reveal the POV character's flaws without them being self-aware of those flaws (something that should be done in 3rd person, too, but it's far more difficult in 1st).

It can also become repetitive. Even though it's in 1st person, avoid using "I" too much; it's possible to tell the story without starting every sentence the same. ("I watched Gryffindor win the Quidditch match" versus "Gryffindor won the Quidditch match.")

I also feel that there's a time and place for 1st person. Comedy is a good one, or deep psychological thrillers. Standard drama - not so much.

Some of my favourite fics are in 1st person so it might be why I'm biased, but I've actually have never looked at it in-depth as to why they are good and why does such perspective work.

** When it suddenly turns into a character bashing story, and there's no warning in the summary or the A/N's, I drop it. (I tend to stay away from character bashing on general).

Any kind of Independent Harry stories tend to be over done. The Weasleys and Dumbledore are with Harry to use him, Harry becoming super OP, being nice to Goblins, overly long explanations on the whole shopping trip, et cetra.

Hermione or another character as completely perfect. I love Hermione, but she tends to be the biggest offender in this case, her, Harry, and Draco. It just irks me to see the characters be perfect, it's not interesting to me when characters are perfect.

Harold/Hadrian, on the flip side, if there's a female Harry, if the female Harry is still called Harry (That's just weird). I'm fine with female Harry, but the female version being called Harry is just really weird to me.

They were best friends for over a decade. He was a good enough spy that not even Dumbledore knew. I've never seen a fic that deals with Peter realistically and that ruins a lot of fics for me.

I also tend to drop wolfstar fics. Canonically, Sirius convinced James & Lily that Peter was more trustworthy than Remus. The only reason Sirius thought so was because Remus was a werewolf. On Remus's part, he 100% believed Sirius was responsible for Lily & James's deaths. It seems like they weren't even real friends during the war.

Like, if you were reading Harry/someone not Ginny, and Harry and Ginny fight over the kids in a long drawn out court battle, would you say its “Ginny bashing”? Probably not. But if the writer writes Ginny as some crazy OOC girl who wants to murder Harry for suggesting he get partial custody, because the writer wanted a “good reason” for Harry to fall into the arms of whoever? Thats Ginny bashing. Big difference

***** Hence my point about "in character" vs "author" biases. Because Draco is in a semi-villainous/rival role in canon, having a Draco who's not a "bad guy" (when in the POV of his enemies) is the same for me as it is for you and redeemed Snape. There needs to be a reason.

**** I disagree, Draco was a well written complex character. Bashing destroys all of that and makes characters into a 1D charicature of an unreasonable incompetent bad guy. Bashing isn't done by the trio, it's done by the author to the character. There is a certain feeling to bashing, and it's annoying. Any "bashing" which is well written, isn't bashing.

Basically, my argument is that for a fic to qualify as bashing, the bashed character needs to be OOC.

- Harry paired with a character I would not be attracted to.

- Harry not the main character (with the exception of Dumbledore, Voldemort or Grindelwald-centric fics).

- Harry's central importance to the plot being undermined/shared with other characters (e.g. now there's a prophecy about Ginny as well!).

At the time Harry uses Sectumsemptra, he has 5+ years of magical education behind him with a particular specialism in (Defence Against the) Dark Arts. I sincerely doubt the spell would have done anything at all had he tried the same thing in first year - just as when he first tried the Shield Charm in GoF, it barely stopped jinxes, but by HBP it was blocking powerful curses from the most feared Death Eaters.

Not only that but is there any other to learn spells other than just practicing the incantation and wand movement.

** 1. *Bait-and Switch:* The fic starts out as one thing and turns into something drastically different than what was reading. HPMOR is a big offender on this, as is the old Naruto fic "People Lie". It's one thing if it is actually a well-done surprise that leads into something I can enjoy, but that doesn't happen often.
2. *Incomplete and Abandoned:* Some people are fine with a story that just stops partway through; I'm not.
3. *Unnanounced Series Entries:* I get deep into a completed fic I'm really enjoying, but start thinking "it doesn't seem like there's enough chapters left for this to properly resolve". Looking at the author's profile, it turns out I've been reading part one of a series that's been abandoned for the past five years.
4. *Lack/Loss of Focus:* This is what drove me away from Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. The concept at the start was interesting, but it built up too many unrelated divergences that (to me at least) took focus away from the actual core story.
5. *Trivial or Excessive Divergence:* Some fics are more or less just rehashes of canon that don't do anything new, different, or interesting. Others are really more like original fiction that's been relabeled with canon names. An AU fic should take me on a journey that's different from canon but that passes by familiar landmarks.
6. *Too Dark:* Over-the-top grimdarkness, unless used to good comedic effect. Contrived events to prevent characters from being happy (I can't remember the name, but there was a Harry-in-Azkaban fic where just as he was starting to recover a bit and do better, a misunderstanding leads to him being permanently blinded in one eye and Hermione going from being his friend to hating him because he caused her mother to miscarry when she attacked him). Luna being murdered for cheap drama points.
7. *"Nope" Pairings and Sexualization of Young Kids:* Adult/child, teacher/student, incest, abuse, rapist/victim - all the classics, available now on AO3!
8. *Slash, MPreg, A/B/O:* I have nothing against at least the first two, just not my cup of tea. Don't know enough about the third to really comment.
9. *Excessive Fluff / Terrible Pacing:* Fluff can be quite nice if well-written, but I want some substance as well. I avoid kidfics because too many of them are just about someone raising a child that just happens to be Harry Potter and either never get to anything Hogwarts/plot-related or take 100k+ words to get there. I also tend to avoid family-fluff because it often involves a lot of cuddling/puppy-piles/etc. and I'm generally uncomfortable with physical contact (and tend to put myself in the shoes of characters I read about).

** 1. Bad grammar and spelling. This is generally a complete deal-breaker. The worst (though funniest) case is when you look at the summary of a long fic and realize the author has been writing the thing for a year and has never noticed they misspelled a common word in their summary, or hasn't noticed that the summary (which is the ad for their fic!) is full of bad grammar or even just awkward language --- I'm sort of glad when that happens because then I don't even need to click through, I already know the rest will be terrible.
2. Truly bad writing. If your words don't flow, if I can't understand what is going on, if sentences don't follow in a logical sequence, I'm closing the page after a paragraph or two. This is also a deal-breaker.
3. I usually won't read stuff written in first person. It's very hard to pull off. There are a bunch of writers who /can/ pull it off of course, but they're usually people who are so good that there are college courses written around their writing. (I can name some exceptions; hard boiled detective fiction of various kinds usually works well when written in first person.) I will try, but usually I get turned off within paragraphs.
4. I can usually tolerate most of the worst tropes out there if the writing is really, really, really good, but mostly people who use the worst of them (see "Lord Hadrian Potter then realized that Molly Weasley had to have been conspiring with the evil Albus Dumbledore to systematically poison him to get access to the famed Potter fortune...") suck. If you're going to write something like that, you had better be a really, really brilliant stylist.

**** I want to disagree, but you may be right. I think that Harry Potter fanfics in particular have really bad OCs. I usually really like OC fics for other books/shows. Yeah, I can't remember the last time I looked for a good OC fic for HP. I think I gave up.

** - Powerful (anymore than canon really) and/ or Indy Harry (even when the writing is decent these both feel like shitty wish fulfilment).
- OC Harry (unless it is the whole point of the story)
- Lordship nonsense
- Bashing
- Breakup of the trio
- Fics that try to be too dark and edgy
- Power boosts in general
- Magic bashing (ie Muggle/ Science wank)
- Pureblood wank
- Whitewashing, generally
- Fics that lack the mystery and 'whimsiness' of canon
- Characters or world not feeling British
- Harry/Hermone. I like them both, I just love their friendship too much though. Love the trio as a whole
- Bad writing and first person
- Generally crossovers
- Drawn out DBZ-esq fights
- Author biases and opinions being obvious (ie character mouthpieces)
- OCs as protagonists

** Chapters with less than 1k words. Thats not a chapter, thats a scene.

Suddenly slash fics.. i hate going through a fic, And halfway through the author writes an AN where they proclaim that its going to be slash. I mean for fucks sake. At least put it in the first fucking chapter or the summery, not the AN on fucking chapter 20.

Oh, and ultra long AN's with review responses. When a third of the chapter is an AN then i just give up.

** No judgement to those who enjoy writing erotica, and sometimes I don't mind it, but I'm instantly turned off when it's clear the writer only wrote the fic to indulge in their fetishes, esp. when it's with an OC probably based off themself.

** - Shit grammar/puncatation, etc

- Character bashing. Critical fics are fine.

- 1st person, especially when combined w/present tense.

- Muggle bashing/wizardwank and Wizard bashing/Mugglewank. Neither side is good or bad, they're just different. Though if anything, wizards take more advantage of Muggles than vice versa.

- Too much info dump/too much diagolue. Balance it out.

** Writing style mostly. I can sit through OCS if they're done well, but if they write like a 12 year old, there's going to be some issues

** Harry being renamed by the author to Hadrian, Harrison or anything else along those lines.

Badly handled OP Harry. Having your protagonist be OP is technically not a bad thing in my book, as long as there's still something that threatens him. But if that isn't the case, I rarely continue to read.

Bad writing as well. Mediocre writing if there isn't anything else I enjoy about the story. I feel like a snob writing this, but I just don't want to read badly written fanfics. I know no one is born a perfect writer, and most will never be one, and I respect anyone who publishes a fanfic, but I don't need to read all of them.

*** Why would you change a characters name? Is it some sort of Alias ?

**** Not an alias, often its that Harry discovers his "true" name when he gets his parent's will or something and then just decides "Hey, let's go use a different name than what everyone knows me at!"

Don't know why some people do it. Maybe they think it sounds better.

** First or second person POV, don't know if it's because I'm not used to it or because most fic like that are badly written, propably both.

Characters that died in canon being resurrected, it can be OK if there's a legit, well-written explanation but 99% of the time it's not.

Lapslock and bad punctuation, honestly I don't get it, how you can work on a story and not take the time and effort (it's not even an effort imo) to properly to present it properly. If you can't even put that much effort in the form, I'm assuming you didn't put more effort in the content.

Huge paragraphs, again it's only the form but I really can't read when there's 20-30 lines paragraph or more, especially since I read a lot on mobile.

** Bad grammar, syntax and pacing is something that will usually make me drop a fic instantly. It just hurts to read.

Lack of consistency/logic is something that, if it piles up, will eventually lead to me dropping a fic.

Yaoi pairings will also make me drop a fic instantly, I am not quite sure why, I just can't read them. Not my cup of tea. It's quite annoying how many good fics have a MxM main pairing and I just can't bring myself to read them.
