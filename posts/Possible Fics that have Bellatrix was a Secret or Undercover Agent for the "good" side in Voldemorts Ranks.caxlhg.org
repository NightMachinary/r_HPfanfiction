i wrote "good" in quote sign, because there is the possibiity that Bellatrix was either working for the Ministry or Dumbledore himself. Neither of them showed any good Work over the events of the Canon and in comparison (Dumbledore doomed Harry to live his entire childhood in darkness and the Ministry was judging the said Person as a lunatic, because its Boss was to ignorant to even consider the possibility of the Dark Lords return), but both of them were the opposing side for Voldemort, who was evil....so.

​

Bellatrix would either survive the War or an AU happens. In either way, when the War is over she wants to recover from her Dark lifespan, but in the beginning her crazy attitude might remain. Possibly she spends her recovery time in a far distant location, so she wouldnt easy be getting caught by either the remaining DAs or the common magical society. Whether it will be revealed, that she was undercover or not.

​

Sirius death would have either be a arranged plan between her and him or it might happen as an accident and she would have to suffer about his loss and recover from it. Both are possibly, but i would rather like the 1st way better, even if it would mean, that he wouldnt be there anymore for Harry.

​

I dont want the Fic to be written from her perspective and with her dealing about all the crimes and murders that she committed, but either from Harrys POV (as usual) or a possible narrator.

​

Ok, this might be just a Subpoint, but i would like Harry find out about her Role post war and at some point (maybe even immediately) be shocked but also impressed, by her devotion for this lifetime Job. He might ask her to give her lessons or even training (possibly "proper" occlumency teachings). he might be consciously or not getting attracted to her. That being said, i leave it to the Fic (if SUCH one exist at all) if they getting closer and might end in a session or not.


** Linkffn(Wind Shear) has her defecting pretty quickly

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** i dont know what defecting mean in that context, but it sounds as if Bellatrix doesnt want to Work either with Voldemort or the "good ones" anymore. If thats the Case, it probably wouldnt be quite what i want to, but maybe i can give it a try.
