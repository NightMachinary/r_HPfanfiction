Why do the majority of M-fanfiction authors accept any level of violence, but at the same time they are very scared of sex?

There're a lot of stories with abuse, bloody murders, human sacrifices, children/infants sacrifices, rapes, etc. But when it comes to a healthy sex between two consenting people the same authors chicken out and omit such scenes or make them short and without much details.

I don't think it's related with the FF.net rules, because there're a lot of stories there with explicit content and also there're other resources like AO3.

Is it some cultural thing? Or it's because sex often related with human feelings and it's hard to write them? Or something else?


** I think a lot of authors are more comfortable writing violence than sex.

Partly this may be a cultural thing - in most of the media we consume (which in turn influences how we learn to tell stories) violence is handled much more openly than sex. Partly it may be down to the part where a badly written fight scene just sounds clunky, where a badly written sex scene is /funny/. Most authors, unless they're TRYING for funny, don't much like being laughed at.

***** That is more literary based I'd argue. Let's say the epilogue had Harry married to Demelza Robins, with two kids, a cat and an owl. Half of the readers would wonder who the fuck this woman even is and the other half would wonder how she ended up with Harry. You can't do such an asspull relationship (and even the canon ones felt like one of those) and expect it to go over well. You need build up, and unless you're writing a "Song of Ice and Fire" level epic, you don't have the time to write a proper relationship, have it fall apart, let Harry recover, slowly build a second one and repeat that seven times until you get the average number of relationships prior to marriage. You still have Voldemort to deal with, your goal is not to write "Sex in the Castle: Hogwarts unleashed". Therefore writing anything more than a second relationship is not feasible, at least if you want to have a plot besides who fucks with whom.

Harry needs to get over his wanting to be "just Harry" and coasting by (Hermione would be more impressed by him if he truly wants to learn things!), while Hermione needs to let go of her authority worship and book-knowledge worship! Not to mention that she has to become a lot more open minded (as it stands it's her opinions/her way or the highway!)), but yeah:

Dating around (using the war as an excuse is kind of bad, especially since the fighting didn't really touch Hogwarts - sure Harry got hurt some, but over all most people weren't seeing Deatheaters regularly!) and getting married outside of one big happy Weasley-Family would have been great (IMHO for all of them! Ron/Hermione makes no sense what so ever IMHO and Harry/Ginny really came out of left field IMHO! Especially after we see her getting over her silly book-hero crush, even after Harry saves her life!)

***** It may not be tied to culture, but the average American has a different attitude towards it than the average European. For example, Abstinence wasn't even considered a form of birth control during my school education (and we had sex-ed 4 times in 12 years) whereas several US states teach nothing else. Homosexuality also wasn't treated any different than heterosexuality, something also not standard in the US. And the US has that weird thing where they have to explicitly state that they are dating exclusively, something that is assumed the default by most people on this side of the pond.

From Anecdotal evidence:

You can often tell that an author is American when there is a disturbing fixation on virginity (I remember a horrible story where Harry "rescued" several women, regrew their hymen through a ritual just to be their "first" a couple chapters later). Ginny is a good example here. Americans often make her slut for dating other boys before Harry (and 3 boyfriends in 2 years is not really much) whereas the Europeans I wrote with disliked Ginny for using the other boys as distraction from/practice for Harry because that's a dick move towards them (unless they were told that their fling was just something physical).

****** I think it's very much tied to culture. A lot of people in this thread have said they're uncomfortable with it. Why? Because we are raised to perceive sex and everything associated with it--wanting to look at it, read about it, write about it--as something dirty and shameful. Even basic intimacy is hard to read and write for a lot of people because we're so cut off from it.

I've written my share of plot-what-plots and I've gotten lots of compliments on them over the years and I've had a lot of fun writing them. There is some sex in my longer works and I've had people actually be surprised that the scenes furthered the plot. Why wouldn't they? The story is about two people learning to live and grow together, so wouldn't sex and intimacy naturally be part of that?

Writing about sex and intimacy has helped me to think about my own relationship and how it's changed over 20-some years of being together. So many of the requests on here are for adult-themed stories, a lot of times under an "asking for a friend" vibe. No, you are asking for you and you owe it to yourself to be upfront and honest about it.

Violence, on the other hand, absolutely surrounds us in often the most mundane ways. A man throwing a homeless man's belongings in the lake, a person casually knocking someone over and taking their phone, a gang breaking windows of cars to steal backpacks--this is all around us and astoundingly, heartbreakingly common. But, it's easier to write about because that violence is something outside of you--separate and safe. Writing about two characters sharing an intimate moment is more akin to baring your inner self for the scrutiny of strangers and that takes a lot of guts.

******* I considered writing sex scenes for both of my stories, but I struggle to see the benefit of spelling out the explicit details of the act over simply implying it and then cut away when the foreplay was over. I mean, smut certainly has its place, but if I have a story with a romantic side plot, does showing that Harry cums when he is ridden really add value to it? Is there a benefit if the reader knows that they did it doggy style?

Maybe in a character-driven piece, but for most plot-driven stories the details of tab P going into slot V aren't really important. Talk about sex, pillow talk and the likes yes, those have benefits because they show us a lot of the characters. But lets say I'm writing Harry's first time making love (as in, with a deep emotional connection and not just to make his cock feel good), wouldn't it be more important to focus on how he, for the first time, feels loved and cared for, even safe in his partner's arms, how he relishes the comfort of her embrace as their gaze into each others eyes (and so on) instead of writing how awesome her cunt felt when it was stretched around his cock, followed by two pages of "The Kamasutra in 5 minutes"?

******** Porque no los dos? I used to do the same "fade to black" and I got complaints. People /like/ to read about the sweating, the shuddering, the weird sounds, the skin that sticks together, the bed that squeaks, the occasional muscle cramps, the spontaneous laughter, the mumbled words ... there is so much more to sex than getting a dick wet and coming.

What's wrong with reading about what makes Harry feel good? What's the problem with reading about how Ginny likes to be on top? Two characters having a dominance fight in bed can be very eye-opening as to their personalities, no? Foreplay is all well and good, but descriptions of sex don't have to be mechanical. There's room for dialog and thoughts along with actions. I'd paste in an example, but this thread is not marked NSFW and I've been yelled at for that before.

It's fine if it's not your cup of tea--if you're not interested in it, then no amount of arguing is going to make you interested, but I do think it's maybe not quite right to assign a value judgement to it.

Absolutely nothing wrong with it. The /problem/, to toss my two cents into the pile, is that I find it adds nothing to my writing. Some authors know how make a sex scene relevant beyond the smut. I don't. I also have zero interest in writing it. If people like reading it, great--there are many fanfic writers who produce that material.

Also, I'm a bit of a prude irl, which necessarily translates into my writing, to a degree. I can't take all of myself out of what I write.

I'm not trying to be combative, just offering an opposite perspective.

******** As an Author you have many options to Cover the "explicit" stuff. If you have written a lemon scene, but doesnt intend to keep it in the Story, you can still mark it "within" your Story as a Lemon Chapter "This chapter contains very explicit sex scenes. It only serves as a "Bonus" and you can completely skip it, as it doesnt have any important information, but i dont want to keep the dirty stuff from you guys, so enjoy" or something like that. You can also completely post this chapter as a One-shot with the Note that its cut content from your main story or you can (if the site rules forbid this) post this chapter on FF sites that allow this stuff and link it into your Fic.

I understand the possible worry, that you created a passage that you could keep, but isnt necessary for your Story, but it would "feed" the users, so you feel as if the Community decides, what you write. But the rest of the Story is your work and the cut content are 1-2% maybe.

******** Also, writing sex scenes matters for pairings, in some respects, especially for Charlie/Hermione stories. Some of the most-reviewed and most-liked Charlie/Hermione stories feature numerous sex scenes. However, most of them are written with a Christian Grey-type mentality minus the BDSM (though some feature this). It's quite sad really as there's so much potential for a great Charlie/Hermione sex scene (one that isn't shoehorned randomly in the paragraphs) yet most authors (and readers) apparently don't care to build anything between them. They think that "having sex" is the build in their "relationship."

#+end_quote

I haven't really seen this in America. Certainly there's a lot of casual sex, and some couples who are dating will specifically say it's /not/ exclusive, but in a steady relationship, it's usually still assumed to be exclusive.

#+begin_quote
  Americans often make her slut for dating other boys before Harry (and 3 boyfriends in 2 years is not really much)

That wasn't just Americans, though. It was also her brothers, although they were nicer about it:

#+begin_quote
  "But you're moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?"

--Fred in HBP

But in general, yes it is cultural. In general, Americans are more squeamish about sex, and that goes double for underage sex, where people (and websites) sometimes get paranoid about any kind of depiction of it. (The purge of MA fics on FFN might have contributed too.)

In my opinion, this is also reinforced by the American movie rating system, where a PG-13 movie will very rarely show nudity (and this was quite different in 80's), but can get away with all kinds of violence as long as there's no blood. I feel like it's helped normalized this double standard in the culture.

** Sex is horribly hard to write. If you're not careful the erotic can become the laughable. Well written sex scenes, even in published fiction, are rare. Long well written sex scenes are particularly hard (pun semi-intended) because you begin to have to vary the verbs, adjectives, nouns etc. Unfortunately almost anything you go with tends to be quite absurd because the alternative phrases used are often absurdly stupid. Then there is the question of, if you want to make it actually read well fitting a nice romantic aspect of it in is exceptionally hard because often romantic sex isn't massively engaging to readers and can come across as ridiculous. Then there's the possibility that you might want to give people some privacy. Some things are perhaps better not intruded upon.

Most importantly for me though there is the question of what it really adds to the story? Most sex scenes offer very little in the way of character development. Whereas violence shows a number of interesting possible reactions and interactions which reflect quite heavily upon how people treat other aspects of their lives.

I personally don't really like rape scenes either, partially because they tend to be a convenient way to create drama and people who haven't experienced it or sexual assault often treat it rather casually. Arguably you could say the same of most acts of violence, but rape scenes tend to rob female characters in particular of agency.

I think this is a huge misconception. Attitude to relationships, intimacy, sex is a huge part of a teenager's development. I think it's crazy when someone is alright with slicing throats, cutting body parts, etc. but is very shy when it comes to sex.

**** Those are fair points. What I am talking about is extended sex scenes. Is it necessary to actually show x person bouncing around with y other person to reveal that they have sexual intimacy? I would argue the average sex scene (and note that I said most, not all) focus on titillation rather than the connotations of such intimacy. It's fairly rare for the precise way in which y laps at the other to real reveal much about their personality or develop them as a person. If it does, congratulations I'll be happy to regard it as a useful addition to the story. However, I would argue most of the actually important stuff is put across equally well in a short and touching scene rather than a long and almost inevitably erotic scene.

In those cases violence is also pointless. Neither should be used gratuitously otherwise they lose impact and relevance for the character. If you want to write smut write smut, if you want to write action write action. However, if you want either to matter to the story then make it make a difference for the characters. I would admit that because violence is used slightly more frequently than sex it has a higher number of occasions on which it adds to the story, though not necessarily a higher proportion.

In any case writing about sex has a sort of intimacy to it which I would suggest many writers struggle to convey. Violence should have a kind of intimacy too, but it's easier to gloss over without losing the sense of what you're really seeing.

If I had to describe my first time having sex I wouldn't want to go into masses of detail. I would probably just say that although it hurt and I cried my partner held me close and wiped away the tears. They looked heartbroken at the thought that they'd hurt me and I struggled for the words to explain that I was crying not just because of the pain, but because the moment was both terrifying and heartrendingly loving. It ripped something out of my chest that I'd taken that step with someone. If I went into detail from there about the various thrusts, or movements I would feel that I had sullied a memory I want to keep. Let the sex scenes sleep quietly, sometimes less is more.

There's so much personally and culturally invested in sex that I don't think authors can easily put everything it means across to the audience. It will frequently merely be a pale shadow of what it should be.

Edit: I should have said it is easier for an author to show character development through violence. What tempo do you write in? How gory is the detail? Is the hero enjoying it? How do they fight, quickly? Or do they draw it out, savouring the challenge? Now transpose that onto a sex scene. Do you want a consensual sex scene which the hero isn't really enjoying? How does that reflect their character? It's a very delicate procedure which can be extremely tricky to write, and as I said before can easily become amusing rather than touching.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's always up to an author.

In the same way I can ask if it's necessary to write a story at all? Does it have any value if the author can't write about relationships between humans?

For you the first sex was something very intimate. For someone else it was just a drunk mistake. For others virginity was just a thing to get rid off. Another one could view sex as something intimate, but then changed the opinion to just fun physical activity, etc.

This is part of who we are.

As I see from the stories I've read, if an author can't write a decent sex scene he or she also can't write a meaningful violent scene. It's always just an image that really affects no one. I don't see much difference with smut in such cases.

I'm not voting to add sex everywhere. I started this topic with very specific case in mind: when an author is very comfortable with detailed violence, but then he or she chickens out with sex.

I understand that it's all about the author's skills. It's just very rare to see an author trying to improve in painting different aspects of human relationships including sex.

****** Necessary to the character though, what do you really gain by doing it. As has been pointed out rather elegantly by [[/u/darklooshkin][u/darklooshkin]], sex can easily come across as an Ikea instruction manual. Of course the stories aren't necessary, but they do fulfil a purpose which isn't fulfilled by something else. Sex scenes can too, but often (as stated) they become porn. If you want porn that's all well and good, but most stories are not pornographic and it would destroy the pacing to make them so. Showing sex is not the be all and end all of human relationships. I have human relationships with my friends, it doesn't mean I watch them have sex. It also rather excludes groups such as asexuals to suggest that sex is a necessity to understanding human relationships. Furthermore I'm not suggesting that sex can't have a place in a story, I'm just arguing that (by and large) blow by blow accounts of it are not massively useful from the perspective of a story which isn't entirely about two people going at it like rabbits any more than the story of how Hermione combs her hair. It's important, it has an impact on her and her character. We don't need to see it.

Absolutely my point. It was something very personal. What do you gain beyond making that clear? Do you need to express every small detail of the sex or can you just make it clear what's going on? Sex is, frankly, fairly repetitive to write about after a point (oh the irony). You asked why the sex scenes are short? Answer, because otherwise they'd become extremely dull. Multiple sex scenes probably more so.

Taking a shit is part of who I am too, I don't need to spend 500 words describing it at every opportunity. It can even be relevant to your character (see Thomas More's comments on how enjoyable it is to evacuate your bowls when you really need to).

Okay, so have you only read good violent scenes in fics with good sex scenes? Because I'd argue there are a vast number of books which I could point to where I'd argue the sex is poor, but the violence is great.

I personally admire Neil Gaiman, but I have little time for his sex scenes, likewise with George R. R. Martin; Tolkien I can't even comment on, but there's a fair bit of decent violence there, and not much with sex. In the case of Gaiman the sex rarely has an impact on the wider story, but the violence often does. In Martin's case both have impacts, but the sex often doesn't really show much, whereas the violence is frequently part of a cunning plan (see Bronn fighting for Tyrion's life in the trial by combat).

Fair enough, but what would the sex really add to those stories? Would you like to give an example where you think it would really improve the story?

That's a reasonable point (that you don't often see authors trying to paint sex along with other parts of relationships), but I'd still argue that of all aspects it is strangely one that (if depicted in detail) adds least to the story. Perhaps because culturally we force it into quite narrow lines.

Edit: I should add that I do think there are occasions when Gaiman really makes sex relevant to the plot (for instance in the retelling of Snow White). However, often, for instance in American Gods, it doesn't serve nearly as much of a purpose.

** FFN rules certainly play a role. Yes, some smut's there, but those stories risk getting deleted if someone complains. And writing two different versions of a story, one for FFNet and one for Ao3, is tedious.

Then there's the fact that often, leaving it to the imagination of the reader works very well for what you want the scene to convey. Character development can be done prior or after the fade to black scene easily.

In the same vein, action scenes can leave an obvious conclusion of a fight to the reader's imagination. You don't need to describe an execution-style killing in gory detail - what needs the detail is usually the fight that led to this end.

Unfortunately there's also the fact that some authors don't really know what they want to convey with a scene of either sex or violence. Of they don't have enough skills to express their vision.

Very often "the fade to black scene" looks like a very cheap way of getting out of the situation the author put himself or herself into.

I agree. When I first started posting HP fanfic, I did so on a curated archive (Checkmated) in their "Bedchamber" section. That's gone by the wayside now, so when I came back to fanfic, I looked at FFN's rules and decided it was too restrictive for me and went to AO3. I actually had a commenter tell me that I should edit my stories and post them on FFN. And then I saw what was recommended here on FFN and decided that I'd just go ahead and post as-is there and if they get scrubbed, they get scrubbed and I have a home on AO3.

** It's because writing about fights and battles is relatively easy. Individual/team A goes up against individual/team B in environment X. Insert variable Y and account for changes in situation during the fight (environmental damage, injuries, deaths on sides A and B) and you are halfway to writing a gripping and emotionally charged encounter between the two parties.

Violence in general is also generally easy to write. Pick an atrocity of your choosing, any atrocity you can think of and chances are very, very good that there will be tons of documents telling you everything from the circumstances behind such events to the psychological profiles and side-effects to excrutiatingly detailed and graphical accounts on how such atrocities were carried out in the past.

If you write about concentration camp-style genocides, you have the Nazi Kz-Lager and the Stalinist Gulag models that you can draw from, both with extremely detailed accounts about how they were run, by whom, when, why and where. If you want to write about the violent subjugation and torture of an entire country, then you will have examples ranging from the Romans to Leopold the second to draw on-along with hundreds of examples in-between. Even street-level violence is easy to research, what with the proliferation of police dramas and true crime documentaries available.

And the more documented the atrocities are, the easier it will be to write about them. Eyewitness accounts become protagonists, forensic reports become scenes, reconstructions become set-pieces.

With the sheer amount of inventive and oftentimes creative ways humans have thought up to kill, subjugate, incapacitate, cripple or enslave other humans, the depth and breadth of violence you can write about is nigh-on endless and a well-written violence scene can often make an otherwise poorly put together piece of fiction.

Contrast that with writing about relationships and sex.

Let's say you have a character in a relationship. It's a first-person perspective you are writing in and your character isn't really a perfect psychic that interprets the thoughts and emotions of others completely correctly (unless he/she is and therefore likely some form of mary sue). They have to listen to their significant other and infer, deduce or otherwise come to a conclusion as to what the other party wants/needs/knows/is confused about in relation to themselves. If they get it right, good things happen. If they don't, bad things happen. Most of the time. It depends on the other person.

You, as a writer, are essentially writing about a conversation between two people that's taking place in another room. The conversation is happening through speech, body language, clothing, habits, manipulation, deceit, love, fear and hate and doesn't end even when neither character is interacting with each other. It's the kind of conversation where the silences and absences are as much a part of the conversation as the actual conversation is. You have a definite understanding of what both characters are after-if you've done your due diligence and planned out their motivations for being in a relationship, which can run the gamut of 'I'm in love with this person' to 'he/she's ugly af, but I want to pop that cherry before the Dark Lord murders my ass, so fuck it. Literally.'... yeah-but you are writing it purely from one person's perspective. They don't have a clear idea as to what the other person wants or is trying to say at the best of times and have to play it by ear.

You have to convey credible reasons for assumptions and mistakes to be made, provide reasons for out-of-the-blue changes in the relationship dynamic, account for the delicate emotional balances of love, hate, jealousy, greed, avarice etc that determines how the couple interacts with each other and generally try to make the relationship feel credible.

And THEN we get to the sex. Which, when you first write it out, invariably reads like a parody of an Ikea instruction manual with a few 'massive', 'bulging' and 'erect's thrown in there for good measure. There's only so many ways that you can write 'gently insert slot A into quivering tab B' before quitting in disgust.

Which is why you, as a writer, will never feel happy with the scene and try to make the sensuous sensations take center stage to bail your sorry ass out before the readers, beta-writers and editors you show it to start impersonating drill sergeants.

Which is when you end up having to map out exactly what is going on, how it compares to the current relationship status between the couple(s), which way the sex actually shifts the relationship itself as it's entirely possible that even awesome sex can somehow ruin a relationship (yes, that's a consideration), what the participants feel from a sensational, emotional and psychological stand-point during the major points of intercourse and how the climax plays itself out on all the aforementioned levels.

And that's from first person perspective. Relationships are one of the rare instances where third person perspectives actually create more headaches for the writer, as a first person perspective can be used to fudge the other person's thought processes somewhat whereas a 3PP will actually have to account for a surface-level understanding of the other character at the very least.

There's also the teeny-tiny problem of keeping your characters interesting when their relationship can easily suffer from bloat and take up half the fucking fic if you don't carefully manage the scope of their interactions. Balancing the two coming off as complete retards and their relationship basically hijacking the whole thing is suffering.

Also, while relationships and sex are hard to write about, secondary consequences such as STD transmission, pregnancy, community reactions and other things also need to be detailed and accounted for. If two characters have consensual sex in a classical setting, the aftermath can oftentimes be considered disastrous to all parties involved if mishandled-and just brushing such issues aside can have disastrous consequences on the number of people reading your fics.

In the time it takes to write 5000 decent words about two people dating and having sex with each other, you can pump out tens of thousands of well-researched and carefully thought-out words depicting violence and pain on a level that will leave even the most jaded internet surfer reaching for the tissue box (mostly for tears, some because they don't want to wait for rule 35 to kick in) and drawn an audience likely to dwarf that a high quality romance section would have achieved.

The fact that it doesn't leave your wall covered in post-it notes detailing the psychological profiles of your two love-birds at each planned point of the fic is a definite bonus too.

*** First of all, thank you for your efforts you put in such detailed answer.

To be honest, putting aside the cultural aspect, I don't see big difference between sex and violence.

Both of them often have huge effect on personality development. While violence is often use in fanfiction, a very rare story correctly describes how it affects characters. Mostly it's just a bloody picture for no reason and in that way I don't see how it's different from bad smut.

Everything you've described about personal and social consequences of sex can be also applied to violence. For example, PSTD is a very serious mental issue that affects a person and people surrounding him or her.

I believe with some efforts it's possible to find a lot of literature (including ancient) about sex. For example, it's possible to start with Kama Sutra. The only question is if an author actually wants to put some efforts into it.

As I said in another thread I'm not voting to add sex everywhere. I started this topic with very specific case in mind: when an author is very comfortable with detailed violence, but then he or she chickens out with sex.

I understand that it's all about the author's skills. It's just very rare to see an author trying to improve in painting different aspects of human relationships including sex.

**** Well, there is one specific reason why good relationship scenes are hard to come by-intimacy.

Violence is often obvious and/or public in nature. It's methodically tracked, dissected and digested by people every time they read a book or watch the news/movie/tv series/docco of their choice. It's something everyone is exposed to on a regular basis and has clear guidelines on how people react to it-or how they should to at least.

By comparison, relationships are intimate, dynamic and discrete (in the mathematical sense) affairs. No two are quite the same and no two end in the same way. So when it becomes a topic of interest, it runs the risk of alienating its readership because they have Views on how the character should react vs how they react in the fic.

That's where I think the cultural aspect comes into play-the expectations one extends onto the characters in given situations.

Conflict has expectations and emotions that are easy to portray because they're nigh-on ubiquitous already. Even the worst of atrocities has guidelines for general portrayal of the events and people's reactions to them-even if the portrayals don't accurately reflect what people's actual reactions to them were. Consequently, you can portray a fight with little risk of rebuttal or condemnation if you stick to the script.

Relationships have very few such guidelines in comparison because the actions depend on the characters themselves rather than the events they are participating in. What few rules there are are informed by the writer's point of view-and that point of view can change drastically when planning things out.

It's both a more liberating and paralysing thing to write about because it's so free-form. A ton of things can go wrong and, in some cases, everybody's wrong is the couple's right. Like when it turns out one of them gets off from being subjected to violence or collapses into a crying mess at the thought of taking off their socks during coitus. Or using citrus fruit as a sex toy. Or only being able to have sex when you have a cat staring at you. Or what constitutes 'talking to your significant other'.

Point being, people are weird. And weird people probably do have weird approaches to relationships. And while the writer may be hunky dory in writing out such things (imagine just how funny you could make such discoveries-"and that's how Hermione Granger found out that cat fur was her personal aphrodisiac" practically writes itself), it would make people uncomfortable reading it because of the intimacy involved in two people experimenting that way.

It would make a great alternative/addition to the standard journey of self-discovery though, where the hero learns as much about themselves through their companion as they do through questing. Hell, a good heroic duo where the obstacles get overcome quicker when the two explore each other and themselves just as thoroughly as they solve puzzles would make for an awesome fantasy series.

But there is always the question of how to portray such intimacy, which is always the sticking point with the readers. The impersonality of violence and porn, with its rules and guidelines, is comfortable when compared to a scene where a couple gets drunk in a tavern and ends up accidentally fucking a fruit basket rather than each other.

The question of intimacy is the difference between relationships and violence. One thrives on it, the other can take it or leave it.

But... There exists a big exception.

One on one duels.

And now I am off to bed. Good night.

***** Extreme violence is often also pointless, I'm not going to deny that. I am not a fan of torture-porn horror films by any stretch of the imagination. I find them dull. I'm merely saying that for similar reasons I don't find there to be a need for sex. Violence is a more common occurrence when facing conflict (particular in a setting such as Harry Potter where an armed conflict is going on). You can avoid sex, that normally happens behind closed doors and unless the participants are interrupted or are up to it whilst something crucial is going on, doesn't have as much of a direct impact on the conflict.

I think there's definitely a point there to be made. Violence is weirdly more socially acceptable. However, it also makes more sense in most of the stories anyway.

******* If you look at my other posts here you'll see I agree. However, I think it is a matter of moderation. I don't think excessive description of sex scenes is of much use unless in erotica, but even in a civil war narrative I don't need two pages dedicated to someone slowly pulling each of a victim's nails out, taking delight as the skin stretches and tears, etc. Don't dance around either, but don't spend more time than necessary in it. If you're writing a piece from a sex addict's perspective the sex is really important, if from a sadist's or a victim's perspective then violence or sex might be very important. Please though, tailor it carefully otherwise the most extraordinary things can become mundane.
