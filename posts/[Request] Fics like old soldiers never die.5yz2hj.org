** Well, Stages of Hope has elements of military battle to it. Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna are the last remaining guerrillas of the Order of the Phoenix and they're rather...combative. Dual-wielding wands, battle potions, etc.

**** Yeah...it is a bit of a stretch to call it military, though the fic does cover the emotional toll of the war rather well--but it's still better than the OP!Harry using outstandingly powerful magic at twelve.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
