Basically something immersive, can't her into most fics nowdays


** So I will try to go for less recommended fics that are, in one form or another, outstanding examples, though as always YMMV.

- linkffn(Circular Reasoning): this is one of the darkest and 'grittiest' fics out there. There is a constant worldbuilding attempt and just undercurrent of hopelessness at play in this fic that is honestly almost Lovecraftian (if you've read his books you'll understand this better). The flaw here is that honestly the fic sort of the script and spent too much time getting railroaded from the overarching plot. Recommend though for an actually true dark!Harry as a character.
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): admittedly, the draw of this fic is actually the characterization rather than the worldbuilding, but that is top tier nonetheless. This is a fully fleshed out 'Voldemort wins but is more temperate' AU, and there is so much new there it puts canon fics to shame in many ways.
- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): ahh, now this is an old classic. This one began before OotP came out, and it definitely shows. And yet there is a true story at play here that is practically unique from canon, with a world that I just can't help want to hear more about. Imagine the Odyssey in Harry Potter form, and that aptly summarizes this fic - filled with monsters and superpowers and barely remembered history that leaves you wanting for more.
- linkffn(Ectomancer): the focus of this one is Harry mostly, but there is a real adventure feeling to this story with new canon additions that are ever so tantalizing. All aboard the Galloping Galleon, am I right?
- linkffn(By the Divining Light): a Harry and Dumbledore team up with Harry as NBWL as they adventure into old magic to fix a failure and confront their demons.

I have more, but you can see if you like those before looking for more.

*** These are all great suggestions, though I think I see By The Divining Light recc'd more often than the rest by far (I'm guessing 90% of the recs of The Phoenix and the Serpent on this subreddit are me XD).

Circular Reasoning is an amazing fic, but not one I'm ever excited to reread, because it's SO goddamn dark. I have to be in a very specific mood to want to read it, which is a shame, because I love the idea of crossing HP with the Dresden Files and Abhorsen.

I never actually got past the first chapter of Ectomancer, I really should give it a shot again. Don't remember disliking it, it just didn't grab me.

I have never read a fic with a Hermione that made me as angry as that fic made me. She went through trauma, sure, but the way the story structures the reasoning behind her impulsive and erratic behaviour behind a layer of mystery was infuriating, especially when the mystery turned out to be so one-note. She was unlikeable, and the reveal so predictable, that her character in that fic was ruined for me.

Reminds me of YA novels where the main character goes through a tragedy... but then he trashes his house, cusses out his parents, burns churches for fun, and the narrative tries to explain it away through "Oh, he's not well in the head".

That doesn't make me /like/ the MC, and to quote Mark Twain:

#+begin_quote
  “The test of any good fiction is that you should care something for the characters; the good to succeed, the bad to fail. The trouble with most fiction is that you want them all to land in hell together, as quickly as possible.”
