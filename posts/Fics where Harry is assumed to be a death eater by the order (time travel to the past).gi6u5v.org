I have read a fic where Harry ends up in the past with Teddy where he has to become a death eater to protect them both. He gets caught by the Order who keep him captive.

This is such a different well-written twist on time travel i just can't get enough of it.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]]

This is a pretty old fic about where Harry finds himself in an AU where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer. So yeah, the Order aren't exactly pleased to see him.

I really enjoyed it back in the day and it's kinda similar to what you're looking for.

*** Watch out though, because this story has him be a massive idiot pretty much all the time. It takes him about 7 chapters and numerous examples that it's not his original world. It gets so frustrating in its idiocy that I had to stop reading.

*** Mannn idk how to say this but --- this fanfiction is one of the main works that inspired Chained. Honestly, I've been in love with this work for years; I just love works where the good guys hate Harry Potter/he has to try and "prove" that he's good (as opposed to just immediately being accepted by them). The angst factor is delicious.

So --- probably one of THE most original fanfics ever (which follows this pattern):

Warrior's Heir:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4343191/1/Warrior-s-Heir]]

Summary:

Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord?

He isn't just suspected to be a Death Eater by Dumbledore/good guys... he's suspected to be the Dark Lord himself. Might not make sense rn but --- 

This fic is sOoo good. Give it a try :)

**** Same here actually. I have loved and desperately searched for time travel fics in which Harry isn't just easily accepted and doesn't exactly have good relations with the supposedly Light side long before I read Chained. When done well they are sooo good.

Well, i'm definitely gonna give it a try :) But when you say that these fics inspired Chained, (I have absolutely no idea) but could they have possibly also inspired some character interaction or plot?(i'm literally just assuming here). Because if so, I would wait to read the fic after Chained has been completed so as to not (possibly) predict what might happen in Chained.

I absolutely fucking love the fact that I am hooked on to every word I read, as I've never read such interactions with those characters before. And also that I have no idea where the hell the story is gonna go.

While we are at it, (if it hasn't been clear enough already) I fucking love chained. Its been ages, but man the updates are worth the wait:)

Will give the fics a try:)

***** Hi! Okay, you don't have to worry about that --- Warrior's Heir is very different from Chained plot-wise. When I said similiar, I meant in terms of relationship dynamics, where Harry has to prove himself people who hate him (like Dumbledore/McGonagall mistrust Harry, etc.). I promise, nothing that happens in WH will help you predict what happens in Chained LMAOO. Two very different stories.

And ahh wow, I love that you are enjoying Chained that really makes me happy! Sorry for the delays rip (and for the 1 month delay in responding to your comment LOL). Just know that Chained will be updating soon :)

Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

â€‹

Its really good. Its well written and I like the characterizations of those Harry and Draco meet in the past. I ve reread this fic twice. And the best part is that the fic is complete. So no cliffhangers for a lifetime situation here.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/][Turning of the Times]] members of the Order and the Marauders assume that Harry has sided with Voldemort's allies after seeing him get increasingly friendly with some of the Dark Lord's Hogwarts-age recruits. Unfortunately the truth is more complicated, but it does not go well for Harry.

*** Is that the fic where Voldemort suddenly has the ability to force somebody into an Unbreakable Vow w/o a bonder? Or is it the one where Harry has to obliviate himself so that Voldemort can't get information out of him because Voldemort is posing as a teacher and has Harry as his research assistant?

****** You were mostly right. The spell Harry uses to hide his memories is similar to, but functions differently than Obliviate in some very important ways. Harry is a TA rather than a research assistant: he doesn't help Voldemort with research, but instead mostly grades papers, monitors tests and answers student questions during office hours.
