rather than place people in the house with the trait they have most of, the students are placed in the house with the trait that they lack most. People still believe that the hat places them where they are best suited so when they arrive at the dorms they believe they really are hufflepuffs at heart and work to bring out that characteristic in themselves to better fit with their house. The entire sorting would be very different and Harry would be an interesting placement.


** Well, this isn't exactly what you're looking for since it is sorta cracky, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting) the Hat decides to stop listening to students and to throw them in the house it thinks appropriate.

Hilarity ensues. For the most part.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** I feel like this wouldn't work, because it would just group similar people together anyways. So all of the brash Gryffindors who have to learn subtlety become brash Slytherins who can't learn subtlety because there's no subtle slytherin in their house - all the subtle slytherins are in gryffindor, and can't learn bravery and brashness because they're all subtle.

Ron goes to slytherin, hermione values bravery above all else as seen by her going to gryfindor so she goes to slytherin

harry is the one I find tough placing, as he wanted to not be in slytherin and be in gryfindor with his friends

***** In canon Arithmancy was just divination with numbers instead of tea leaves. And Ancient runes was just old language. Learning what a symbol means and stuff. And to be honest I don't think there are many people who would just learn for the sake of learning and especially not 11 year olds. Even Hermione learned to get the approval of her teachers.

Harry was pretty hard working. He might not always succeed in what he was trying to do (he could not figure out a way to breathe underwater) but he tries very hard.

**** Definitely Ravenclaw, he needs a kick in the butt. He didn't even know the fucking summoning charm until 4th year, how dumb is that? I think that would be the first spell I'd learn, because I constantly lose stuff. Harry himself wears glasses, so he's definitely familiar with looking for them while not having them.

When Ron got sorted into Slytherin everyone knew for a fact that something had gone wrong. The parents, students, and teachers were all outraged and the hat refused to resort.

** I feel like it is this way for complicated sortings. Hermione was between gryffindor and ravenclaw and (i know she asked but still) she would never have made friends or grown as a person in ravenclaw. Harry couldve been slytherin but maybe he needed the bravery and shit from gryffindor in order to survive. Then you have obvious placements that are just there because they fit (Ron, Draco, Lavender)
