** Like all of jbern's work, it has some great ideas for both plot and world, but is let down by weak technical writing and shallow characterisation.

*** I thought the simple sentence structure served the 2nd person perspective well, like a voice of command.

Agreed though, with the shallow characterization. Though, I thought the Luna - Harry correspondence had the tone of real notes passed between students in class. That I /did/ enjoy.

**** The "litmus test" I use for characterisation is this: if you take away a character's most obvious (or "primary") trait, are the "leftovers" still enough to make an interesting character? Real people are more than a single trait, after all.

In the case of Luna in Bungle in the Jungle, once you take away her primary trait -- she's a normal girl pretending to be odd -- what you have left is completely vanilla.

*** Things I loved: While I wasn't sure at first about introducing Luna as a dual personality type, one of my favorite parts of the story ended up being the Luna / Harry correspondence. I think it served as a fair balance to an otherwise Cassnova!Harry, who was picking up woman left and right. It made the other relationships seem shallow, while Harry struggled to build a functional relationship with someone his own age.

I also liked the original characters, especially Hack and Kwan.

Thinks i didn't like as much: I thought the Weasley bashing went a little harshly, specifically with Ginny and Molly. The way Harry treated Hermione also made me a bit uncomfortable, but I think that was intentional, signifying Harry becoming jaded and spiteful.

***** I agree. In fact, I can't say that JBern has done much with strong female characters in his stories (with the limited exception of Fleur, who doesn't do much.) With Luna, however, it seems that at least Harry has the ability to fuck up his relationships from his side of things.

I haven't read JBern's To Fight the Coming Darkness, with Susan Bones, so maybe he does more with his ladies there.

**** I also liked Hack and Kwan :D

I didn't mind the Weasley bashing, I am used to read fanfics that have this, but with Herminone... I read 2 or 3 fanfics that she is against Harry, but I still feel bad every time I read one.

I am woried that the sequel will have to much bashing on her, but I will read it because it is a good story. And I want to know how it ends.

*** It's a pretty old story now so there are some of the cliches that are pretty annoying today like the manipulative Dumbledore and Weasleys that probably weren't big cliches back when this was written. Still not great to read but I can give it a break because of that.

*Spoilers*

The strengths of this story is definitely everything after once it catches up to the first chapter. The atmosphere of the lost city is top notch definitely helped by the necro wards and the vast amounts of inferi. I like that Jbern wasn't afraid to let people die, what they were doing was very dangerous and the casualties definitely reflected that.

I liked the interaction with Luna, it seemed more like a normal teenage relationship rather than a love at first sight thing like you can find in a lot of other fanfictions.

As far as bashing goes, I'm never really a fan but it's nice to see that it was distributed fairly evenly. In the vast majority of stories it seems that Hermione and the twins are completely let off the hook for some reason while everybody else gets bashed into the ground.

For me the biggest weakness of the story is the first chapter. I understand what he was trying to do with it but it takes away from the excitement of them fighting their way into the city once the story catches up to that point.

*** 2nd Person takes a bit of getting used to, but after about 2 chapters in I didn't mind so much. I wouldn't so go far as to say it made the story more /immersive,/ like a choose-your-own-adventure novel, but I stopped noticing after a while.

THe style was fairly simplistic, but I think that worked for what JBern did in this story, sort of like a straightforward commanding voice.

*** I think JBern did a good job of integrating Muggle Tech into the story, and not overemphasizing it's role. I thought it was especially thoughtful to have some diversity in weapons usage among the mercinaries, with Collins being an obsessive American, to Thundercloud who rarely used them at all. It also helped that Harry did not instantly become Dirty!Harry, and that he resorted to the Shotgun because that was the one weapon he felt he could get a grasp on.

I thought the description of spell-chaining and wards, among other magical innovations, too the emphasis off of muggle tech as well.

** I have a question:

One of the common tropes in HP Fanfiction is increasing Harry's magical ability in an non-cliche way, to the point where he is powerful enough to actually do some interesting things. How do you feel about the way JBern addressed this issue?

What were things that you felt were plausible or intriguing? What things were not?

Some things JBern did:

1) Give Harry more innate power (including an "aura"), because he is a prophesied one.

2) Have Harry grind it out with Kwan (among others), who were ruthless with his training.

3) Have Harry actually study and practice more, specifically with curse breaking.

4) Instant-animagus ceremony.

5) Use of muggle weapons as a means of non-convention warfare against dedicated magical users.

6) Giving Harry his own kick-ass troll sidekick.

*** In regards to number 4, I really liked how that animagus stuff was integrated into this story. He got the transformation instantly but it took him some time to really master it. Also, his animagus continues to have a central role in the story and Harry's development which is definitely a lot better than other stories where getting his animagus form is just another step in becoming super!harry as Jbern put it in one of his authors notes.

1-3 I think were handled pretty well. Even at the end of the story Harry would still have gotten his ass kicked by Kwan and probably even Bill, his training definitely didn't give him instant power.

5 was integrated well, muggle weapons definitely weren't the focus of the story nor were they game breakingly powerful so they ended up fitting in pretty well.

6, I don't really have an opinion on this. Hack was pretty funny though.

*** I enjoy reading Super Harry sometimes, I think they are funny.

In this one, even if he get some power quickly, like the animagus (or is it animagi?) ritual, he take time to use it completely.

He study wards and find that he enjoy it and it is not difficult to understand, but he still make mistakes. Bill says that his work is good at first, but he is comparing it with others beginners work.

And the aura, well, he does need something to fight someone that practice magic for more than fifty years. I think the aura is better than if he could fight Voldemort after a few months of study.

** SPOILER CHAPTER 22

What did you think of he deamon fight? I was curious to see how they would defeat him, since he could see the future.

I don't know if I didn't read but just pass my eyes through the battle. But I didn't understand how the daemon didn't see that Harry would defeat him.

And if he did see it, why didn't try to change it?

EDIT: I forgot we should only talk till chapter 15, now I put a sing saying that this thread have spoiler of chapter 22.
