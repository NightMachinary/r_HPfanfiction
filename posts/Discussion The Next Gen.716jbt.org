How do you think of the next gen? Is James Sirius exactly like Harry's father? Is Albus like Harry? Is Rose like Hermione? Or a combination or a different person?

How differently are the Next Gen to their parents? What do they like don't like to do? Where are they sorted? What jobs do you see them doing? Ect Extra.

Now note this isn't to bash anyone's ideas of the Next Gen. They are your own Headcanons, do they follow Cursed Child or not or a little bit? Ect extra.

Feel free to go in detail of your own headcanon of the Next Gen or just a little bit in detail, up to you.


** Cursed Child is, to me, a fan fiction written by some one who had the connections they needed to get it in front of J.K. herself.

My head cannon is the post war and next gen fics written by little0bird on Fanfiction.net.

** Next gen? wasn't that just part of one of Harry's PTSD induced nightmares?

/Turn on the light Harry, turn it on and there will be nothing there!! There is NO Albus Severus!! It's just a bad dream Harry, remember what the healer said!/
