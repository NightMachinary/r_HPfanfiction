Was slightly torn on the flair i should've use here, decided to go with this one. Seems more fitting then recomendation, for querry of mine is specific enough. Most typos are to be blamed on SwiftKey furiously fighting me for no actuall reason. Toungue tied wording are blame of mine. Too hot ere to use proper humany sentences. Have a feast of Zee-powdered ones.

Pardon me previous words. The title mostly has what i am looking for. Story told either about or from the perspective of one, whom are /addicted to/ or, still interesting but by far lesser margin, /forced to/, either by somebody or circumstances, polyjuicing themself. The concept of identity/identies loss, theft, juggling and fleeing is what i am searching for. Memory charms are a turn off for me, they are a simple plain way to achieve what i desire, but if its written good, i am not complaining. There being a single identity they polyjuice as is also not quite desired, the switcheroo of personas and masks, however, is.

Any fic, most preferably being about either Golden Trio members or someone close to them, at least having a name and personality in Canon, taking place during original series' timeframe (to be blunt - i am interested in neither original characters, nor younger version of canon-ny characters, nor postHogwarts ones, nor modern wizarding world). The difficulty with brewing potion, obtaining disguise's hair, mixing up said hair, and so on are interesting, but not as much as getting into the character and living others' lifes.

That blursed severus malfoy wifey fic is the Opposite if what i searched for.. So please dont bother even mentioning it. Sex and such stuff are not a turn off, despite what eighth rule says, but please abide by it and feel free to message me.


** Ah, not quite what you're looking for but its a one shot that has some of these elements linkao3(such brainsick fantasies)

*** Thats more or less what i searched for. Short, yet precisely what i wanted for hardships and persona "wearing". Nicely written, nicely suggested. Many thanks.

** *Who's Polyjuicing Whom?* - linkffn(5834601)\\
Two characters in this use Polyjuice excessively for romance of the same person. Short ~10k word oneshot.

*Far Too Many Time Travelers* - linkffn(6728900)\\
The two from above make an appearance in this fic from the same author. If they are plot-centric or just a cameo, I don't know. The fic hasn't gotten that far yet.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.
