This is a shameless plug of my *Harry Potter x Marvel Cinematic Universe* series. I'm currently working on the third of six planned works, so here's hope I'll finish before I retire! Helping me is my co-writer and main Beta EssayOfThoughts and she earns most of the credit, really. Without her, I'd have abandoned this monster of a fic somewhere around Chapter 8.

The premise? Harry Potter gets kidnapped and ends up with our favourite Ravagers. The story properly starts right at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 2, where the first changes to canon are introduced. It is thoroughly multi-PoV, but the main character is, of course, Harry Potter himself.

Please read the tags and the notes - this is not really a romance fic. There will be background pairings, maybe one or two prominent side-character romances as well, but any ship that might sail in Harry's name will have to wait until the *end of the main plot*.

Here is the link to the series. Note that the first installation is a collection of one-shots that aren't necessarily important to the plot and can be ignored.

** I'm loving this series so far!! Please keep up the great work!
