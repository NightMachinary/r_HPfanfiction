Yeah... just him being a very supportive content professor. Plot could be about anything - obviously the war has been fought and won as he is now teaching and such.


** He's awesome in this role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]], though that's not really what the book is about.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] is a Neville, Hugo, Scorpius adventure out into the Forbidden Forest. Very light with quirky humor. Really great moments.
