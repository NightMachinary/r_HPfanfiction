Does it count as fanfiction or something like fifty shades which started as fanfic. The only difference that I saw is this book series is free and non profit. So does it count as fanfic?

Also, do you think it is good or worth while? A friend forwarded it to me and I haven't gotten around to reading the book series because I never liked the Epilogue so Im putting it off for quite some time.


** Looks like fanfiction to me! Same world but at a different time. It doesn't have the 'serial numbers filed off'. Hogwarts is Hogwarts, aurors are aurors, a memory charm still has the incantation Obliviate.

As for 'good' or 'worthwhile', that's entirely subjective and you'll know within a minute whether you want to read more.

It has a clear premise, and work has gone into it to make sure it's well-presented and easy to read. It's certainly right at the top end as goes quality, when looking at HP fanfic as a whole, but whether you'll like it or not is going to take actually looking at it and deciding.

** I didn't know this even existed. Really sounds intriguing. Is this canon compliant? From the summaries, it doesn't seem so what with characters we have never heard of.

How much of the HP verse as we're familiar with (not counting magical cores and whatnot) is true in this series? Completely AU or just a hint of it while remaining true to Rowling's World? It does sound like a regular fantasy series with a character we know a little.

** Well... from a legal point of view, it's certainly fanfiction. Of /Harry Potter/. True, Rowling has officially given it a blessing along the lines of "knock yourselves out so long as you don't try to actually profit from it", but she has done the same thing for /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, and, more to the point, said things to the same effect about fanfiction of her work as a whole. If you're a lawyer, it's fanfiction, same as anything else.

That being said, it's not /culturally/ fanfiction in quite the same way as most things we usually talk about here. G. Norman Lippert is a professional writer who started writing it on a lark at a time when he was unaware that "fanfiction" existed as a specific concept, let alone that /Harry Potter/ fanfiction was so sprawling and varied as to qualify for a subgenre of fantasy all on its own. He approached it not as 'fanfiction' but as he would any other book.

In /that/ sense, it's very wrong to lump it together with the sort of stuff we post on Ao3 and ffnet, "fanfiction" as a genre of literature with its own conventions, its own styles, its own expectations. It's even more wrong to call it /Harry Potter/ fanfiction because it's written in complete innocence, with no knowledge of the HP fanfiction /cultural milieu/ --- this is a man for whom the words ‘Daphne Greengrass', ‘bashing' or ‘magical core' are not only null and void, but mean nothing. The results are therefore inescapably extremely different from what we usually know as "fanfiction", which is considerably more self-aware, not always in a good way.

**** Ah, but (and this is also my answer to you, [[/u/SMTRodent]]) I did not say that the key part was that Lippert had /avoided/ the usual fanon tropes.

The difference is between "good fanfiction" as we usually encounter it on this sub, which knows of the tropes and clichés but sidesteps them, and "innocent fanfiction" such as this which never even knew about them in the first place. You can't get quite the same result, much like "spacing out" and "clearing your mind" aren't quite equivalent.

Well, yeah, kind of... I mean, /yes/ fanfic tropes and fanon, but plenty of fanfiction writers ignore them entirely. There's no HP fanfic style guide that gets your work kicked off ffnet or AO3 if they don't conform, and those aren't the only sites doing HP fanfic and never have been.

I... what? No. You do not need to read established works to pick up genre conventions before you write fanfic that counts as fanfic, you just need to be familiar with the original work! (edited this sentence for clarity).

Fanfiction isn't something that needs gatekeeping.

I may be misunderstanding the structure of your sentence, but how exaclty would someone pick up fanfiction conventions just through familiarity with the original work?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's not gatekeeping. At no point did I say this meta-knowledge of /HP/ fanfic conventions was necessary to write a good story. Indeed, if anything, self-consciousness about tropes is a weakness. Someone writing a canon-compliant Dumbledore in earnest because that's their understanding of Dumbledore will no doubt write a better, more consistent Dumbledore than someone who's constantly second-guessing themselves and wondering "am I accidentally writing a manipulative Dumbledore? will everybody hate me? oh dear I put in a lemon drop without realizing it, am I an uncreative hack?".

My distinction between “/HP fanfiction/ the general fact of fan fiction based on /HP/” and “/HP fanfiction/ the Internet phenomenon with its own tropes and conventions and community” is purely an academic matter; I make no claim that one is better or more deserving than the other.

#+end_quote

They wouldn't. I argue with the premise that fanfiction needs to follow fanfiction conventions to be 'real' fanfiction.

Yes, it's nice that fanficcers discuss things and that tropes evolved, and keep evolving, but it's not required that a fanficcer has read other fanfiction for their work to be part of the general body of Harry Potter fanfiction.

It's not a club. It's not a society. It's not an academically-taught process with qualifications and levels of commitment recognised by the wider world beyond whether readers happen to like that particular fic or not. It needs no other hoops than being a reaction to an original work.

Your distinction is entirely artificial. One does not need to study fanfiction to write it, or be part of any culturally savvy community. Yes, there is fanon shared by different groups in different fora, but those are no more 'real' than anyone who picked up the books last month and got inspired.

Basically, there's an entire 'not one of us' vibe I take an objection to. Your distinction is entirely unneeded, and exclusive in a way that is just making an 'us' and 'them' where there does not need to be one.

There's no reason, at all, to draw any sort of line between G. Norman Lippert and any regular to this subreddit or any poster on AO3 or ffnet.

I think you're mixing up fanon and fanfiction, myself. That's not at all the definition of fanfiction, which is simply:

#+begin_quote
  fiction written by a fan of, and featuring characters from, a particular TV series, movie, book, etc.

**** That's the /basic/ definition, yes. And I prefaced my post by saying that /in that most basic of senses/, then yes, clearly /James Potter/ is fanfiction. But just like "musicals" as we understand them usually come with a set of conventions and expectations not encompassed by “a play where characters sing about their feelings instead of talking”.

I think that at this point, /HP fanfiction/ has grown its own genre conventions, of which fanon is only part; i.e. usual length of chapter, the irregularly serialized format, Author's Notes and Omakes, summaries which explain the premise in a few sentences then give the pairings and/or tropes used or avoided...

***** And again, I'd say all those conventions and expectations are parts of fanon- the OP is asking whether the series is fanfiction because it is physical copies of books blessed by JKR, making it seem more official, not because it doesn't have the hackneyed stereotypes we've grown used to. That doesn't make it not fanfiction in any sense.

*** It seems like you have a strange definition of fanfiction. As long as someone writes a text and it identifiably uses character, plot or setting from an existing narrative, its fanfiction. It doesnt matter how involved he is in the fandom and the community.

edit: little nitpick, but i guess you want to say that Ice Queen Daphne Greengass means nothing to the author, and not that he doesnt know canon characters because he never even read the books.

Oh, sure. Though "means nothing" is a close enough bit of hyperbole when we're talking about a background character who's mentioned something like twice in the entire series.

*** I do like your point but a part of me can't help but wonder if it crossed the line like how folk heroes gets reimagining or re cast as something totally different. In a way, he simply borrowed familiar concept and built on unknown or not talked upon character in ways that it can be a separate entity itself.

Like how La morte d Arthur or the romance of Sir Lancelot and gwen each spurned on tales on their own. Each featuring familiar stuff from tales but rarely do people seem Merlin as a fanfiction or any next Arthur stories. I wanted to use Neil gaiman's work but I think biblical myth and use of pagan gods in tales are a different animal altogether.
