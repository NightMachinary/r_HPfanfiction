I am genuinely curious as to the consensus (if there is one) despite the seeming simplicity of the question. So, let's hear it! And try not to turn this into a war zone, everyone's opinion is welcome.

Right now this is really hard for me to answer, and I'm pretty sure I'll be in the minority but I'll go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence][TheBlack'sResurgence]]


** Well, I love every story that [[/u/TE7]] has written, even if it's been awhile since I've read them. They're still updating their newest story, thankfully.

Also, does it count if I say Plums, and Kathryn518? They both just updated for the first time in forever, but it still counts! Love their crossovers.

  Something's up with Hermione Granger. Well, more than the usual, at any rate. And Harry Potter, having bestowed upon him the exclusive privilege of bearing the brunt of her strange moods, has reached the point of being jolly well fed up with it. It's high time to get to the bottom of this all but insoluble mystery...

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I got 4 at the moment. I like a bunch others but these are my favourites.

Taliesin19 - From Grow Young with Me. She's just too wonderful not be my favourite. Always giving us random facts, being so cool and thoughtful and funny by respoding to every single ask on her tumblr.

BolshevikMuppet99 - From the Downward Spiral Saga and currently writing Echoes in the Fog. Just a great writer that not only listens to feedback, but loves to tease on his reponses from the reviews, not to mention he gave me inside info before he even started writing Echoes, which is so fucking cool imo.

JacobApples - From, well, a whole fuckton of fics, he just doesn't stop. I found out about him on his third chapter of Disorder of the Phoenix and never stopped. Great divergence points and cool ideas and is the who made one of my favourite pairings that I didn't know I even wanted, to happen, Harry/Andromeda, which is sooo nice to read, and it felt so realistic somehow. I love you bud, keep it up.

Last but not least, Firefawn - From Eclipse in the Sky. This fic was a surprise to me, because the first time I started reading, I got sidetracked by another fic and dropped 100k words in, and forgot about it completely. But one day when the power in my neighborhood went out, I was searching for old fics in my phone and I found it there. Just waiting to be read. Suffice it say, it suddenly became my top 3 favourite fic all time, which is only a bonus because the author is so so so nice to talk with. At the moment he's having a personal issues so he hasn't updated in a while, but this level of fic, in my opinion is worth the wait.

Just like GYWM, which is THA BEST. (Love you Taliesin <3)

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] even though I still haven't finished /Limpieza de Sangre/ or even started his latest /Cleansing the Sins of the Past/. Mainly because I have so little free time, and I know that if I start back with one of those, I'll simply read for 12 hours straight and screw myself over in real life... One day...

** No one's mentioned ShayaLonnie. Author of works such as the Reclamation of Black Magic, Presque Toujours Pur, and the Debt of Time among others.

They're a bit sporadic with the updates (a lot of works are marked as indefinite hiatus) but they always come through, and given that the Debt of Time is complete and over 700k it's clear they eventually overcome.

** Definitely Carnivorous Muffin and Murkybluematter whom have already been mentioned.

Also it looks like Inverarity is going to post something relatively soon for the first time in years.

I'll also give an honorable mention to silenceia. She has written a bunch of crossovers that I like, but loses some points in my favorite ranking because most of them aren't being updated. The rewrite of her first fic has been pretty consistent so far though.

** Just off the bat I would have said Colubrina and ShayaLonnie. However, I've jumped onto Ao3 recently because I needed more to read than ffn has been giving me. So right now I'm powering through Saras_girl's fics. And that's after having gone through firethesound's and bixgirl1's.

** I personally love tsume yuki, her works are not just limited to harry potter, and she often writes crossovers of harry potter with other fandoms such as game of thrones or naruto. Many of her works feature fem!harry or mod!harry and they are all extraordinarily well written. She flicks between which of her fics she updates at a time, jumping between her ideas but they're all great. On mobile, but one of her most well known works is 'time to put your galleons where your mouth is'.

#+end_quote

This is a bit of an understatement imo, and a more accurate description than flicks would be, with rare exceptions moves on to new ideas and stops updating the old ones. Still I do like her work that I have read. It is certainly well written. I would have even probably had her on my favorite authors list while she was still actively writing marines. Most of her work since then has at a glance seemed more romance heavy than I typically care for so I haven't read much of it, but that's just my personal preference, nothing against her as an author. I am however hesitant to get invested in any of her fics that aren't clearly intended to be on the shorter side at this point after being burned several times.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
