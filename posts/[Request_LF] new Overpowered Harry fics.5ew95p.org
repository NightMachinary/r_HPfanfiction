  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of growing meek and weak of will with the Durley's like Dumbledore expected, Harry grew up to be assertive and strong thanks to an early curiosity about the strange powers that manifested in him. The wizarding world doesn't have a clue of the storm that's coming. And Harry Potter will be at the forefront of it. Powerful Harry. Harem. Manipulative Dumbledore.

  YEAR ONE COMPLETE! Harry often wondered how he was supposed to raise a baby Phoenix, live life as a game, learn magic, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, and dodge political manipulations all while trying to make it through Hogwarts alive.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. --- (Eventual Harry/Hermione) Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

*** Has the author said anything about when this story will end? I've seen this recommended a lot, but I'm afraid this story may go unfinished or still have YEARS to go... especially when I've read stories that started in 2002, and finished in 2010.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
