There's obiviously a few that most people have read, and a few new ones that are coming, like linkffn(What we Lost by jacobApples; Grow Young with Me; You and I by emilyherself; Madley In Love) and a few others that I can't remember.

I'm looking for new ones or some rare and forgotten ones. Bonus points for Harry/Daphne pairing. No H/Hr or slash though. Thanks.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood) kind of revolves around why he is a single parent.

  The war is over, the Chosen One has defeated Voldemort. How does the wizarding world recover from such dreadful times? How do Harry and his friends maintain peace? Starting after the Battle of Hogwarts, follows canon as best as possible.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Post- DH/ AU. Healer Sadie Lewis never knew that fixing Al Potter's broken leg would lead to such a profound romance with his father. Harry/OC, Ginny/Dean, all other canon intact. Rated M for later chapters. All reviews appreciated!

  Living a frugal life in a small cottage out in the middle of nowhere, is Harry Potter really who he seems? New recruit Laura Madley finds an odd file going through the tax records and begins to investigate. She doesn't know what to think, but something about him keeps pulling her back.
