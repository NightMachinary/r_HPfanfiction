The Verge recently posted an article ([[https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/5/21281528/harry-potter-hbo-max-series-spin-off-prequel-ideas]]) that has some interesting ideas l, but I would like to hear your ideas.

Me personally, I would like a show focusing on the rise of Voldemort. Him forming the Death Eaters out if the Knights of Walpurgis, their many crimes and reasons they would be feared (because the ones in the movie showed a lot to be desired in that regard), and even ending the birth of Harry, the betrayal of the Potter's, and Voldemort's first fall.


** Literally I just want more exploration of the wizarding world and magic than we actually get in canon, I don't give two shits what the plot is supposed to be give me w o r l d b u i l d i n g

** Not a single thing. After watching what happened with game of thrones I'm apprehensive to the idea of them diddling another beloved IP.

*** Game of Thrones was the fault of Benioff and Weiss, the show runners. HBO had limited creative input, and they were more than happy to fund 10 full length seasons. If they put some decent people in charge of it, it could be good.

** Stay away from the characters we like, I want to see something like the Aurors/Hitwizards/Unspeakables dealing with dangerous monsters, wizards and other things (demons?) as a new Dark Force rises in the back ground in the 20+ years since Voldemort. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna and everyone else are all shadowy figures you might get "Orders from Potter" or "My kid was begging for a Autograph from Weasley... The girl one" or whatever but Classic character appearances are SUPER rare and big deals even if it's just a episode

** Honestly I would love to see a gritty Muarders story. Have it be narrated by Remus the day before the Battle of Higwarts as he tells the story fir his infant son the last time.

** I want more of a focus on Harry's friendships. I honestly never get the sense that Harry truly opened up to anyone, it's why I think fanfics can break him apart from his surroundings so easily.

** I want to see a Harry Potter show never get made, and for the World Court to write an injunction forbidding JKR from doing any more damage to the story.

At this point, she's milked the cow dry and has beat the dead horse into paste. Sheer greed is motivating the garbage we're seeing now. Harry Potter theme parks? Fucking JOHNNY DEPP as Grindelwald? *vomits uncontrollably*

** So basically "any non-AU fanfic ideas".

But I'm actually in favour of a Cursed Child film, or a filmed version of the play. Most people who have actually it as it was intended to be seen thought it was great. While it has its weaknesses, in my opinion the reason for the vast majority of the dislike stems simply from the fact that play scripts are not meant to be read, but performed; but most people have only read the script. A filmed version would go a long way to redeeming its reputation.
