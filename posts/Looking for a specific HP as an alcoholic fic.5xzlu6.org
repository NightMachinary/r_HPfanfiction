It was an older fic I believe, maybe even before DH came out. Harry defeated Voldemort, and the Weasleys and Hermione gave him some time to himself causing him to feel abandoned. Harry turned to booze, and became a drunk. I want to say it was Harry/Ginny fic, and all I really remember is that the shopkeeper knew he was underage to buy booze, but would sell it to him if he promised to only buy it from him. Oh and he lived in Sirius's house.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** Nope, it was far more dramatic and less comedic. Thanks, though.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** Linkffn(yellow submarine by deadwoodpecker) comes to mind. Probably not exactly what you're after but it shares many elements.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
