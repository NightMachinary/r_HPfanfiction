Hey guys, please send me your best Fate/Harry Potter crossovers, i have some points that i would preffer.

-NO Slash\\
-No FemHarry\\
-Harry as the focus\\
-The fuyuki holy grail war as the focus (Not the wizarding war against Voldemort)\\
- I would love to read something where Harry was summoned as one of the heroic spirits\\
-If there's pairings in the fic, don't want Harry with Hermione or Ginny.

That's it !
