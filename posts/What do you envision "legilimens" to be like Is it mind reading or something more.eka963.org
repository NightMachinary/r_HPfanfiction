I'm wanting to delve into legilimens for a future fic and I wondered what you enjoy and what you hate about the subject. Some say mind reading, others vehemently deny that and jk is pretty vague. What do /you/ think it looks like?

Specifically it's Snape using legilimens to teach another character how to use occlumency if that helps.


** Only Muggles talk of ‚Äúmind-reading‚Äù. The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing -- or at least, most minds are.

Sorry, couldn't help myself üòÇ I think it's more complex than mind reading. You don't hear people's thoughts (people died really think the way it's described in fiction anyway). I think it's more impressions and feelings and not necessarily in a logical order but jumping to other connected memories.

** See, when I think of how I think, I guess there's that surface level constant monologue. On a deeper level, I think it's just a constant jump from memory to memory to memory. The memory doesn't have to be real (that's important) but even if a fake thing, it's still a memory-like or remembering-like experience.

So for legilimency, I guess imagine those complex web-like graphics of neurons. Each synapse(?) is where one "memory" is and what a skilled legilimens can do I guess is choose which of the connected synapses it wants to go towards until it gets where it wants.

Side note: The connection between neurons in the brain can get strengthened or weakened by constant use/disuse.

Occlumency would then be like destroying or diminishing those paths from memory to memory.

I know I'm being vague but it's hard to understand the brain by using the brain.

** Ok first of all the magical art is called legilimency and a practicioner of it is called a legilimens, legilimens is also the spell used to get into the mind

It is not mind reading, more like perusing the current thoughts of someone but I personally have a headcanon that skilled legilimens' can call out certain memories they want to see.

Snape put it well when he was trying to teach Harry occlumency (the art of protecting ones mind from legilimency) but I don't remember the exact phrasing he used
