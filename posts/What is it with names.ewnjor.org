I see it all the time reading fics, and then I stumble upon a name that's completely wrong.

It's Kreacher, not Kreature. Who would call their servant creature?

McGonagle or Quirelle? That sounds like a bootleg character!

It's Knockturn Alley, not Nocturne Alley - That's the joke!

** Could be many reasons:

1. The author could have really only seen the movies, and was going with a phonetic approximation without checking.
2. The author could have read the books in another language and was carrying over an alternate spelling
3. The author could have spelled it correctly but had it autocorrected to another spelling.

** Well, it could be a problem with other languages.\\
Here in brazil the name of the elf Kreacher was translated to Monstro (Monster in english)\\
I think that's because of poor translators, they saw the form that Kreacher was spelled in the books and translated to Creature and so they transformed into Monstro to have a better appeal.\\
I think that most of the times it can be because of lazy writers but can also be because of wrong translations to other languages.

***** They're synonyms, but here in brazil Monstro was better than Criatura, because some of the times the word Criatura is used as a casual and sometimes cute form of adressing to someone.\\
Monstro had the same sensation to the name Kreacher and our voice actors are pretty good, so even if Kreacher was not necessary to be changed, it was still good.

Hearing Sirius's voice acton yelling Monstro ! Angry all the time was very good.

**** I think that i would not have changed the names that didn't need.\\
You see, James Potter in portuguese was translated to Thiago Potter, here in brazil is't as bad as could be, but i would keep the names that didn't need the change, like Kreacher, James and Albus (Here in brazil is Alvo)\\
But some names like the Knockturn Alley were necessary to change because they didn't make any sense in portuguese.\\
An Alley in my language means "Beco" in portuguese, this place was translated to "Travessa do tranco" it's a bad translation but necessary.
