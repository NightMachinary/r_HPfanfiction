**** I wasn't thrilled about the ranting parts but I did like the book.

But my dislike of ranting harry is more a product of fanfiction. Pretty much every fic I've read where harry rants all the have been overly angsty and quite cringe worthy.

***** Yeah, in canon his angry outbursts are more on the order of "why is everyone keeping me in the dark? why do so many people think I'm lying? why are there so many things I'm powerless to do anything about? also I can barely get proper sleep and I have unresolved trauma from last year" which is understandable though it might be annoying to read. In my experience most fanfic authors don't know how to strike that balance at all.

***** every Harry rant is just him getting ahead of himself thinking he knows shit and trying to show his maturity and why he is independent and better than everybody else. Really it makes him look stupid and childish. Nobody gives a shit that you used the tournament to get your lordship, you didn't do fuck all the goblins told you that it happened.

**** I think my half sister dropped the series because of OOTP. She's a lot older than me, like a lot a lot, and at the time I didn't understand. The last time I re-read it I saw where she was coming from.

(Actually there's a slight possibility she noped out at GOF but I'm pretty sure it was OOTP.)

***** I'd say Harry's attitude in OOTP is probably the most realistic though tbf to JKR

** I am sorry nothing immediately comes to mind, but... are you sure you are not just looking for canon?
