  This is the story of the Dursley familys perspective of things. After a small chapter of the Order planning for the Dursleys safehouse, it starts off with Petunia Evans´s childhood and what happened to her back then that made her behave so unreasonably strict towards Harry Potter. The main story however, tells us what happens to the Dursley family after they left no 4 Privet Drive to hide from Lord Voldemort. They were leaving with a witch and a wizard and something were bound to happpen between them.The story mainly reveals where the Dursleys went and who they met. How they would endure to be surrounded with magic, and what they did on a day to day basis. It contains a bit of magic, just enough to intrigue some family members and scare another. Some known names from the Potter books are mentioned, together with a couple of new introductions I made up. The story includes the Dursleys dealing with magic, oversized bumble bees, a murder, and a battle amongst other things.

  The life of Dudley Dursley and his family as he gets pulled back into the wizarding world years after he thought he was done with it. Mostly epilogue compliant. There will be references to alcoholism and implied romance, hence the T rating. The disclaimer: I own nothing but the characters I have created for this story. Everything else belongs to JK Rowling.

**** Describing Petunia as "unreasonably strict towards Harry" has gotta be one of the best prices of unintentional comedy I've seen in fanfic.

** This diverges from canon/EWE but it still a great read. To read the later chapters you'll need to click on the 2011 tag on the fic/side bar as the direct links don't work.

** Linkffn(Dudley Dursley and the Quest for Truth)

This is a great fic for what it is. It struggles a bit in that it feels like it's trying to name drop every named character, forcing them in when it doesn't always work. But overall worth the read. I also have a very weird memory of this fic having a lot more at the end of the fic, but maybe I'm just imagining it.

  When Dudley Dursley and his parents are forced to spend a year with-gasp!- witches and wizards, Dudley decides this is the opportunity to learn more about his apparently famous cousin. Potterwatch, tall tales and magic, oh my! Rating changed for safety...
