I've read a few chapters ahead, to help out Firefawn, and I can honestly say it seems like a wonderful fic and has a lot of potential to be one of the best postwar fics with H/D pairing.

Do give it a try, its worth it, even if you happen to not enjoy it.

** Blubberinoo, how do you figure that the characters are, in your eloquent phrasing, "retarded"? Are you seriously suggesting that you would instantly be able to identify someone you went to high school with and never ever interacted with based on mannerisms alone? Unless you are some kind of mystic psychic that wouldn't happen. Daphne is clearly glamour charmed to be unrecognizable and she clearly has recognized Harry and is pretending not to. The chicks a Slytherin and they do a good job portraying her as such. Harry is aware she is glamour charmed but too good hearted to force remove it.

Thanks for the rec on this fic. I read it in one go and despite some people's inability to pick up on subtle hints in fiction it is one of the better ones I've read. It's got a great premise.

** Tried it, had big hopes. But the characters seem to all be retarded sadly. 50000 words and both have not figured out who the other is? With one being an auror and the other being a scheming Slytherin? Yea right lol. This is even more Harry/OC than other Haphne fics out there. They at least use their real names in those.

Also, half of those 50000 words are spent on pointless banter that can be skipped without missing anything. It does not help define the characters or give them more depths. Neither is it fun to read or advancing the plot. There are literally whole pages of conversation where nothing of value is said. It's insane.
