** Not a coat rack, an umbrella stand fashioned from a troll leg.

Fanon is that it is enchanted against metamorphmagi, befitting the bigoted views of Walburga Black.

**** The tripping is often considered to be caused by the constantly shifting balance that comes with being a Metamophagi.

Pretty sure in the books Tonks bumps into things at Dursleys and Grimauld.

  I'm actually not sure if her tripping over the hat stand in the Black House is canon or fanon.
#+end_quote

If you mean the troll leg umbrella stand, then yes, it's canon. I vaguely remember reading a fic where Bellatrix cursed it so Andromeda would trip over it and Tonks inherited the effect, but the title eludes me.
