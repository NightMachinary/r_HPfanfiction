** So young... He will be missed.

Even though I don't enjoy harem fics, it's impossible to ignore his contribution to the fandom. He was loved by many. Goodbye friend.

** Death's Pride is one of my favorite pieces of fanfiction and one I have read repeatedly. Such a good story, though it was not completed.

RIP Paladeus

*** Hey I started trying to read Death's Pride but these letters back and forth between Harry and Hermione at the beginning using [[/r/creepyasterisks][r/creepyasterisks]] throughout is very tough to push through. Does this stop?

And, of course, respects to Paladeus, very sad to hear someone so involved in bringing us solid content has been lost.

** Having read the article, I have a gut feeling that this is a homicide. May he rest in peace.
