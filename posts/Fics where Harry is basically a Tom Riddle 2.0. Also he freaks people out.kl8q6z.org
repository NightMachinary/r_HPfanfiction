** There's a story that I just read that was like this, but its Harry/Voldemort. I included the link below if you wanted to read, sorry it was on chapter 4. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14371158/chapters/35488443#workskin]]

*** I just read this and it's not Harry as Tom 2.0. Yes Harry has his own issues but they are very different (and I don't just mean in the story itself). It is a very good story though.

** In linkao3(6614155), Harry Potter and Tom Riddle are endlessly reincarnating with each other, only remembering their past lives when they make eye contact. Tom grabs Harry in Godric's Hollow and they leave. Harry recreates Tom's introduction to magic almost verbatim to scare Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
