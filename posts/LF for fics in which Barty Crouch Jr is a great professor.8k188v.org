** He kind of is in canon, isn't he? In the sense of actually doing the job properly.

Which should have been the /first/ bleeding clue the man was a ringer.

*** I have to agree, in canon everyone seemed to be learning what they were suppose to be learning. And as far as I know, teaching the Unforgivable's was Ministry approved in cannon, so there wasn't any thing wrong there.

** linkao3(427653) - The Well-Groomed Mind by Lady_Khali

It's basically alternative character interpretation: the fic, combined with sort of... rationalist!Harry? Also has Evil Dumbledore and doesn't like Ron very much, but it's probably the only fic I've read where these two tropes are somewhat well-executed.

And Barty in this, holy hell. He's my favourite character. He trains Harry (as Moody, of course) and is a really great teacher to him.

Also it's written in first person which /I know/ is another strike against but seriously, give it a shot. Also Author's Notes are almost half as long as the actual fic and really interesting.
