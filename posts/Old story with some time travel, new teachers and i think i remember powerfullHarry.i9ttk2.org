I've been looking for a story i read quite a few years back.

the things i remember about it is:

Harry/ginny ship

I don't think it was ever mentioned straight out, but adult Harry and Ginny has gone back in time and become teachers at Hogwarts for their younger selves.

As teachers they make a new large auditorium style classroom with a stage.

I think i remember that there was a sequel that wasn't complete when i stopped reading it. I think i remember that in the beginning of the sequel starts with harry waking up in ginnys bed at the weaslies and doing something with some sunglasses.

Adult Harry and ginny talking with dumbledore mention that they came back because something happened in the future and they needed more time (think this was the only hint that they were Harry and Ginny, other than looks)

--------------

I'm pretty sure the story was at SIYE at some point, but looking through my favourites there i can't find it, so either i never added it as a favourite or it has been deleted from SIYE.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

  Completed Sequel to The Order of the Phoenix. Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts has begun and with it a mix of friends and enemies, old and new, an ominous prophecy, great battles, and a pair of truly crazy DADA teachers. All hell is about to break loose.

*** That is it!

I had some of the order wrong, but that can hopefully be forgiven considering it has apperantly been 17-18 years ago...

Cheers!
