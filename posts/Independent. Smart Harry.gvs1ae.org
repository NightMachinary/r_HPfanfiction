Can't sleep and in the mood for smart, independent (hopefully gray, morally gray or dark) maybe political Harry stories. I love the stories where he goes to Gringotts (when his younger) and learns he is the last Potter (Lord Potter. Heir Potter.) I love the stories where he thinks things through and starts paying attention or studying and TAKES CONTROL over his life.

I'm a sucking for Dumbledore bashing, selective Weasely (love the twins) bashing. I prefer slash or no relationship, i'm just not a fan of Ginny's character or Harry/Hermione or Harry/Daphne (Luna i've found isn't to bad). I also like mentor fics, where Snape, Tom, (read one once where it was Bill), Barty, Remus or Sirius help him and teach him maybe even step in and take over his seats in umm Wizengamort.

If you know a fic that has some of these please recommend it. Thanks.


** linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven; Harry Potter at the Knees of the Marauders; Harry Potter and the Interlude; Harry Potter and the power the Dark Lord Knows Not)

This series has pretty much everything you're looking for(and is complete!), even if this sub seems to hate it. It does eventually have Harry/Daphne, but only in the very last book, and it's not the main focus at all.

  When a more studious Harry Potter enters Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming

  After a summer spent attending Quidditch World Cup games and tutoring sessions, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of schooling with plans to study hard, have fun, play Quidditch and become an animagus. Too bad there's a Tournament that gets in the way. The fourth (and final) part in my series, 'Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven'.

** Try a google search for "Dark!harry fanfiction" youll probably end up with a few ffn community pages which usually have quite a few stories to get through. Also, you might like "Harry crow" by robst. It doesnt really fit your request but its close enough i think you might enjoy it :)

  The only way Harry can get free of those who wish to use him is to agree to an already made betrothal contract created by Dorea Black-Potter. Will this simple thing change the course of Harry's predestined - at least by Dumbledore - future? Will he remain neutral or will he turn dark after he learns everything Dumbledore's done? Will there be a wedding in future for Rabastan and Harry? Can they have a chance of happiness or will the two Slytherins by nature at least, only presume to use one another?
