Looking for any AU in which Voldemort won, and members from the Order or DA are fighting back. Preferably complete works, but interested in any!


** linkffn(Simple and Clean) is probably one of my favorites. Ummm there's another one that's kind of similar where Hermione leaves with Ron during Deathly Hallows and they end up losing the war, Harry spends years and years alone, and then Hermione and Ron's kid ends up finding Harry and they storm Hogwarts with a huge international team to win the war. I can't remember the name right now but I'll try and find it for you when I get home

Edit: also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia) has one of my favorite Voldemort won the war setups. That's not even remotely the simple and clean I meant let's try it again

  Chaos and kismet mixed and mingled to create an unavoidable outcome as the two almost innocent boys slept. The bitterness of fate, the oblivion of love, and the wish of destiny held tightly to the two bonds forever sealed. All that was meant to be was forgotten as all that is and should be took its place. And there was nothing the unaware ten year old boys could do.

** Resistance of Azkaban definitely fits your description; about 20 years have passed since Voldemort won, he heads a surprisingly competent government that has successfully brainwashed the next generation, and Harry leads a resistance from the nigh impregnable fortress of Azkaban (if that's not a kickass premise then I don't know what is).
