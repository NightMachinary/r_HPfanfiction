** My favorite has to be the one where Trewlaney reads her cards and goes to live with the Dursleys and Harry. It's called The Inner Eye of Harry Potter. I can't link to it since I'm on mobile. :)

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

** A few. There's Linkffn(Harry McGonagall) though that's more by periphery. There's another where Harry lives at the castle and is basically raised by all staff. I found that one kind of sad since Harry didn't audit classes before he was supposed to attend classes.

  Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr

**** No, that's probably the convention that a slash means a romantic relationship, but an ampersand means a platonic relationship. And it is listed as Gen.

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so. See first chapter for preface. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. McG first contact/mentor. PM for pdf.
