Can anyone recommend a good fan fiction where Harry is powerful, independent and learns powerful 'light' magic. I want a fic where he is pretty much the next 'light lord'. I dont care whether Dumbledore is good or bad.


** To Shape and Change has healing parselmagic which I'm not sure is considered fully light, but he certainly is very light in the fic.

Also Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond (Keira Marcos) again parselmagic but still mostly light

Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord I think was also one as well

Those are the ones that stick out to me and are very well written imo
