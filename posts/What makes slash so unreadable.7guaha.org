I'm working on a long fic, past 300k now - Slytherin!Harry with no Horcruxes, no Lord Potter nonsense, no character bashing. It's a fun project, and I really enjoy working on it, but I've noticed a pretty strange theme amongst reviews, right.

Harry goes from partner to partner in the fic, just because he's a teenager - so he kisses this girl, goes out with that one, et cetera, et cetera. I write Harry as bi, so there's also an attraction to men present, but because there are, as yet, no "endgame" ships that really /last/, I've not bothered to tag all the ships in the title. It'd be pointless and misleading.

Every now and then, I'll get a review from someone declaring - often angrily - that I should have left a warning that the fic is slash. They'll either get to a moment where Harry feels attraction to another boy and stop reading, or they'll get to the moment forty chapters later where Harry actually /touches/ another boy, and they'll complain then.

I don't get it, I guess. What is it about a character not being straight that "ruins" the fic? I'm not trying to attack people who don't like slash with this, it's more just... A lot of people say they don't like "slashfic", and they sort of say that slash tends to have weird stuff that they don't like, or that they think all slashfic is bad.

But to read 24 chapters (or 50-something chapters!) into a story and be really enjoying it, but then completely abandon interest in it because one of the characters is gay, what's the actual like, issue there? What is it about that in particular that makes a fic so completely unreadable?

I'm a gay man myself, and I've read a lot of heterosexual and lesbian fics, so I guess having that sort of complete aversion has never really occurred to me.

*EDIT:*

So, to recap, these are the main reasons people don't want to read slash fic:

- They like to insert themselves as the protagonist, and it's not possible to empathize with a male character who is attracted to men.
- People find imagining gay relationships "icky", or they become "uncomfortable" with them.
- People think all slash fic is smutty, and don't want to read it "for the same reason they don't watch gay porn".
- People think all slash fic has a lower quality of writing.
- People don't like Drarry, Snarry or Harry/Voldemort, and they associate all gay pairings with those three ships.

If you find yourself agreeing with the first two, I'd just like to gently say that maybe you should have a think about what your relationship is with gay people. This isn't a big accusation of homophobia or anything, but like...

I'm gay, I said that in the opening post. In the course of my life, I've had a lot of issues with my sexuality - thoughts of suicide, dangerous behaviour because of low self esteem, et cetera, et cetera. I've been stabbed because I'm gay. I've been harassed because I'm gay. Friends of mine have been set on fire or sexually assaulted as a result of their sexuality - and I'm 20. I'm from a decently liberal area in the South of Wales, in the UK. None of the stuff I'm talking about is a thing of the past.

When you say that you can't identify with a character as a result of their sexuality, because you find the idea of being attracted to men to be the same as being attracted to a child or to Jabba the Hut, or whatever comparison comes to mind... It's kind of dehumanizing. Making out that gay dudes being interested in other men is the same as being a paedophile or wanting to fuck Jabba the Hut points to some maybe issues with the way you think of gay people and their relationships. Do you think we're all fucking each other all the time? Do you think we all have AIDs? When you think of a gay man, what exactly do you imagine?

We all have our preferences - I'm not saying that overnight you have to go read the creepiest Snarry fic out there, or go out and have a gay orgy.

But just maybe think and self-analyse a little about precisely why you might dislike slash, I guess. I found this thread a little more upsetting than I thought I would - I find homophobes quite funny, but to read so many accounts of people who can't empathize with gay people, but consider themselves tolerant...

I don't know. That's pretty tragic from my perspective, I guess.


** Most reviews on FFN are subjective. They have more to do with the reader's personal preferences than the quality of your writing. You can also get railed on for choosing the "wrong" pairing for Harry, making him too weak, not giving him a harem, or what have you.

Not only is it just about the gay relationship, but around half the characters turn out to be gay to try to normalize it. Which has the opposite effect in my case because having 50% of you main characters gay kills my SOD, it's just too much.

It's a whole suspension of disbelief thing. If Harry and like 3-4 other characters are noted as gay in his class year at Hogwarts, that's just statistics. Any more and I know "Oh, this author wanted to write about gay people as a community."

The latter is fine, it's just not my cup of tea.

** Well, there are a couple of reasons other than Homophobia. "Weird stuff" is correct - many slash fics pair Harry with Draco, Snape or even Voldemort. MPregnancy is another thing often associated with HP slash fics. Another complaint was that slash fics often portray Harry as an emo sub.

Heck, I've written a story with a Harry/Ron/Hermione polyamorous relationship, and yet I generally don't read slash stories because pretty much every story I see has one or more of the above things listed in the summary, which are pretty much game breakers for me.

**** The reason slash feels like it's targeted more is because it's more popular. There are way more homosexual stories than there are the others and people are more aware of it. People don't go into a fic wondering "Am I going to have to dodge creepy Harry/8yo!Lily Luna?" even though that fic does exist.

Also, homosexuality is always going to turn some people off even if they aren't homophobic. There are a lot of people in real life that will say "You do you" and be tolerant, but having to do that in a story that they were previously enjoying is kind of annoying.

**** Harry/Gabrielle has a much smaller age difference than a Snape or Voldemort ship and stories tend to age her up or be postwar.

But slash has a big issue. Almost all gay Harry ships turn the +magical Waffen-SS+ hot actors into misunderstood people instead of the scum they were. Anyone with a dark mark should get a summary execution for murder, treason and war crimes. Britain had the Death penalty until 98 and the dementor's kiss was a thing. Draco's attack on Katie would earn him at least multiple lifetimes behind bars. So how the hell do you rationalise Harry getting into a relationship with the people either responsible for his parents' murder or people who were devoted supporters of Voldemort. Draco called for racial purges at the age of twelve. Snape called his best friend racial slurs when he was 16. They did not turn until they realised that they were losing the war on a personal level. Snape was so redeemed that he condemned his best friend to her death because he did not care that someone would die.

I could understand Neville or Justin FF as ships, but Voldemort's supporters?

***** Yeah, exactly, Draco was TWELVE when he called for blood purges. He was brainwashed by his parents and couldn't have possibly known any better at that age. But it's been stated specifically by JKR that he totally changed his view by the time he was an adult. Children do not get “multiple lifetimes behind bars” for non-fatal attacks. Are you seriously saying that someone who was basically brainwashed into a cult from the time they were born, and did some violent things as a youth because they were literally threatened with the death of themselves and their family, is just an irredeemably evil person who doesn't deserve love? Even if they totally changed into a different person by adulthood?

And yeah Snape called his best friend a racial slur when he was a child and then spent the entire rest of his life regretting it and trying to make up for it to the point of literally dying fighting against the racists. So your view is that if someone is a racist as a kid when they don't know any better, even if they change and give their entire life to anti-racism it doesn't matter? Glad you're not the one running our justice system, since you think people should be executed or locked up forever for being racist at age 12.

******* Wizarding society is pretty barbaric and behind the times as far as punishments go, but even they don't seem to send children to jail for life.

Are you seriously arguing that someone should go to jail for life for stuff they did as a kid, even knowing that person grew up to be reformed, no longer a racist, and a normal productive member of society?

You realize the point of prison is supposed to be rehabilitation, not just torturing your enemies?

Do you really not get that kids like Draco aren't responsible for their actions when they're both brainwashed from birth and threatened into them with threats on themselves and their family? In the real world some of the worst regimes do use child soldiers, forcing them to fight by using brainwashing and threats. In your view we should chuck those child soldiers in jail for life rather than helping them? That's honestly really sick. Again good thing you're not running things, because that's definitely not how we treat child soldiers.

Obviously I mean Snape regretted it by the time he joined the light side. The whole war may have been lost if we'd gone with your plan of executing Snape or sending him to jail for life instead of letting him join the fight against the dark and actually do something useful.

******** If we are talking about getting caught with weed or stealing a six-pack beer then these things can be put away as youth sins and ignored. But Malfoy is a particular piece of trash. He carried out two assassination attempts, both of which nearly killed bystanders. He broke the Geneva convention multiple times during these attacks, committed countless crimes against both magical and British law and due to his actions a group of terrorist were able to enter a school full of children.

He could have avoided all of this. An apparation to Heathrow together with his mother, two disillusionment spells and they could have been in Tokyo. But he chose to work for Voldemort instead. He made a choice, despite knowing that the ideology he was supporting was utter bullshit. A muggleborn repeatedly bested him academically while another blew Voldemort out of his body for over a decade. Draco made wrong choices but he made them nonetheless.

And if you had summary executions for everyone with the mark you could have thinned out the Death Eaters rather quickly, reducing Voldemort's forces significantly while simultaneously lowering the Death tolls. You'd only need a couple dementors with an Auror squad nearby, randomly checking people for the Dark Mark.

And we see how redeemed Snape was in PoA, especially his speech about happily wanting to watch Sirius undergo a horrible fate. And outing Lupin the next day.

It's easy for an outsider to come up with an easy solution but a brainwashed child who is having his and his loved ones' lives threatened doesn't always make the most logical decision.

In real life, we absolutely do not execute child soldiers, who didn't even kill anyone, who were forced through threats and brainwashing to fight, for breaking the Geneva conventions because "oh you could have escaped if you tried harder."

In the other one, you're reading about an adult falling for a child. Its way creepier.

** Interesting thread. Further to my response [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7guaha/what_makes_slash_so_unreadable/dqmd8u5/][here]] regarding degrees of identification with a character, I would make the following observation:

What I think this thread reveals is (to generalise dangerously) that how gay men feel towards women is not the same as what straight men feel towards men.

You might consider them equivalent - the gender to which one is not sexually attracted. But the impression I get here is that gay men have a kind of neutral feeling towards women - they're not attracted to them, but nor do women particularly repulse them. Women are just "meh".

In contrast, men are physically repulsive to straight men (or more specifically, the thought of sexual contact).

Following on from the observation that readers generally dislike protagonists being romantically involved with anyone they consider unattractive, the dislike of slash by most straight male readers is not so strange. It's no different to if you paired Harry with a hideous woman.

This is perhaps what it is that, as a gay male, you cannot get a feel for - the fact that straight men find sexual activity with other men actively repulsive, rather than "meh".

For the avoidance of doubt, I am not saying straight men find gay men repulsive i.e. homophobia. I am saying that straight men find the idea of themselves engaging in sexual activity with other men repulsive. That is to say, the OP commits a logical fallacy when it draws an equivalence between "men finding men unattractive" and "men thinking it is wrong for other men to find men attractive". In the same way, a man may find tall women unattractive but that does not mean he is committed to the idea that it is wrong to find tall women attractive.

*** This is an interesting perspective for me as well. I'm a trans woman and this resonates with me. I consider myself mostly bisexual, with a very strong preference for women. I have a hard time reading a slash protagonist though in the same vein you have mentioned. But I also have no issue reading a Fem Harry with male pairing.

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but it definitely lines up with my own internal image. I have no problem fantasizing and immersing myself as a female protagonist with men or women. And I also have no issue immersing myself as a man with a female partner. But for some reason slash just does nothing for me. It throws me out of my immersion. I've done exactly what the OP has mentioned, read like 20+ chapters of a story, but as soon as slash got featured heavily, I just lost interest. Instead of a smooth reading experience where I can get lost for hours reading, those situations make me feel like I'm forced to get though it. Which ruins the enjoyment I was getting from it.

But I've always been a very immersive reader. When Harry Potter first came out, I remember getting the books at the midnight release, getting home, and just non-stop reading until they were done. I literally lost hours of time. I love stories where I get immersed and nothing pulls me out until it's done. And sadly, Slash does the opposite. It instantly drags me out of the experience.

What we want is the callous disregard and disparaging language used whenever a piece of slashfiction or author/reader of slashfic is brought up in this sub to end, or at the very least no longer be tolerated. Requests for m/m or f/f pairing fics are constantly downvoted for no other reason then the poster asked for such a pairing. Other redditors immediately dismiss a story rec on the basis that it's slash and therefore must not be as good as a het story. Language like 'betrayal of trust' and 'if you ignore the slash it's a good', 'it was good until it became slash' are inherently homophobic. Decrying the depictions of such relationships as abnormal, unrealistic, disgusting, and unworthy of praise is most certainly homophobic. Not maliciously so necessarily, but that's the truth of it.

** I largely dislike slash for the same reasons that I largely dislike /any/ pairing fics:

- Sturgeon's law is boosted up to 99% when it comes to fic
- the writer has a poor grasp of romance as a genre
- a tendency to avoid characters of color as part of main pairings
- obvious wank material is obvious
- the relationship is idealized/fetishized to a creepy and/or unrealistic degree
- some fans' leniency towards gross (and often illegal) age differences
- pairings takes precedence over plot
- my God, sex does not work that way

Bad slash, though, often bothers me because of:

- men written like (poorly-written) women, but with dongs
- garbage yaoi tropes
- bigotry towards characters who are trans men, canon or otherwise
- misogyny and dislike towards female characters
- the whole "het is gross," and "gay love is so pure," holier-than-thou attitude of some writers and fans -- (it's a disturbingly vocal minority)

And, for this fandom, specifically, I've always hated when wizards are suddenly homophobes so that the main characters can have a paint-by-numbers coming out story. It's just so ... /lazy/ in terms of worldbuilding.

Basically, it's a combination of shitty writing, shitty characterization, and shitty attitudes (of characters, fans, or writers) that turn me off most shipping fics, regardless of orientations involved.

There is also the average age of this particular fandom to consider -- older fandoms tend to have writers who do more research and have more life experience, which shows. And speaking of experience, f/f tends to be of slightly better quality, in part, I suspect, because those that write it tend to be women writing women.

On FFN right now, there are 916 fics listing Cho & Harry, while there are 1,600-odd fics listing Daphne & Harry. There's no guarantee that all of those are pairing/romance fics, but it's curious how a barely-there character like Daphne has more fics with Harry than one of his canon love interests does.

You can find similarly curious patterns in /Star Wars/ -- compare and contrast the number of Finn/Poe fics to Kylo/Hux fics. Or see the /Avengers/ fandom where there is a dearth of Tony/Rhodey despite there being ample fuel for the fire.

The problem seems to be of two parts -- creators who largely have white characters as main characters, and fans who largely select white/white pairings (of which m/m pairings are overwhelmingly popular).

It's the exact issue I have with too many fem!Harry fics: all sense of characterization is lost in the face of Twu Wuv.

I mean, it /could/ work, possibly, but structuring a believable romance like that while keeping everyone in character would take more effort than writing a standard antagonism-passing-for-romance fic.

** People invest into characters. Its why we read fiction, to escape our reality and into theirs. As we journey through with a character we like we want the best for them. In our heads we align their desires with ours. For that reason most people would rather the MC of a story ends up with a model like partner than Jabba the Hut for example. Remember they put a bit of themselves into the character, they might even be a bit repulsed by the idea that a bit of them is making out with Jabba the hut. Do you have to hate obese space worms to find the idea of kissing one unpleasant?

What happens between consenting adults should stay between consenting adults. What people get up to in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business, not mine. Fiction is sharing. Do whatever you want but understand that some people won't relate to your character anymore. They have been torn from their immersion because they can no longer follow or understand your choices. I think blaming homophobia, which I'm not saying you have, is an easy out when really most people just want what they feel is best for their character and through what they've invested, themselves. It would make no sense in the context of the novels for example after all that for Harry to declare his attraction to Millicent Bulstrode. After the way she's described people could never understand what about that is attractive. If IRL she made him happy then fine, whatever, not my business but people have invested emotions and hours into the story and they want a happy ending for that. For them, a happy ending is the attractive redhead. A bit of them gets to live happily ever after with someone who in all honesty is likely to be described as more attractive than any partner they might achieve IRL. Part of the reason Ron gets bashed is because a lot of girls got behind Hermione and wanted the best for her and didn't see Ron as the best.

Should you put a warning? Probably if you don't want more of those reviews. 300k words is a lot. That is a lot of time and emotions invested in a story and in the end they're not getting the return they want. Isn't it somewhat natural for them to be irritated, especially when if they'd had that warning they wouldn't have /'wasted'/ their time. The fact they're annoyed if anything is a compliment since it means that they had successfully got behind your character.

Because it wasn't a waste, not really. I'm not going to get to the climax, or the resolution, but the time I spent reading it was enjoyable. I was operating at the time under the assumption that I would have some closure, but even though that assumption was wrong, that doesn't mean that it wasn't a good story.

** I dislike most slash for the same reason I dislike Allbus/Minerva. Changing a characters sexuality alters them drastically. It brings the question of whether sexuality is a choice/influenced by external means, or is it biological and cant be changed or helped. So fanfics that deviate from canon for the sole purpose of having a straight person be bi or gay, or a gay person be bi or straight ruins a lot for my personal beliefs. There is plenty of opportunities to have same sex couples in the HP world that dont deviate from canon, like making Seamus/Dean, or Tracy/Daphne, Fred and Lee (And Lee comes up and kisses George by mistake...I need to find a fic like that), Remus/Sirius could both be Bi and would be fine. What fails is since Harry is the main character, we have a direct view into his head, and know that he hasnt shown any signs of being attracted to same sexed people, so whats the point of changing that other than to fit the authors desires for a romantic pairing they dream about.

This then leads to the vast majority of terrible Slash fics that further soil its appeal. Even if Harry liked guys, he would be attracted to people who he can relate to or enjoy being around. People like Ron, Neville or Cedric come to mind. However Harry/Ron pairing has 149 results on fanfic.net, Harry/Cedric has 56, and Harry/Neville has 50. More popular Slash fanfics are Harry/Draco (4.2k), Harry/Snape (876), and Harry/Voldemort (351). What this shows is that Slash writers don't know who Harry really is, but in general don't know good relationships at all.

Whenever Harry mentions Tom Riddle in sixth year, there's normally a mention of how very handsome he is; ditto whenever Cedric comes about, there are a lot of descriptions of how handsome he is. A lot of men in their teens, like, they /won't/ admit to seeing other men as handsome unless they're gay, genuinely: it comes across as super gay to do that, and a lot of straight lads will say they don't notice if other men are handsome or not.

Harry goes on a date with Luna Lovegood: they hold hands, they kiss. He tries to ask out Cho Chang; he gets butterflies in his stomach when he sees one of the Weasley lads with his shirt off, and think it's bizarre. He tries to reconcile his sexuality with the way other people /talk/ about sexuality, and about love.

It's a natural teenager's progression through understanding their own attractions - something every teenager goes through, regardless of their actual sexual identity.

************* I suppose that's fair but if the pairing and story in general was written believably would it really be that big of a deal?

For instance I tend to hate Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione, just because I can't see it happening; either one of them. But if the story was written well, and the pairing was actually done in a believable way I'd actually give it a chance.

And I can understand being uncomfortable about a slash or femslash pairing, but if you were truly not homophobic and were merely uncomfortable with the pairing then after some time you would surely get used to reading slash/femslash.

Again not hating on you or anyone else who is uncomfortable with slash/femslash but just the idea of warning for slash/femslash is strange even if it makes sense to do so for people who are uncomfortable with it.

I'm a straight female, I'm comfortable with reading het/slash/femslash as long as it's written believably, just because a character is gay/lesbian does not change their personality or believes in canon after all.

********** What does being bi bring to the story? Does it add to the plot? Does it add suspense, drama, anything that gives something back to the story? Why is Harry bi? Could you write the story without his bisexuality and have it be basically unchanged?

These are the questions you should be asking yourself when you write. Not only about sexuality, but about anything. If it doesn't do anything for the story but is some sort of wish fulfillment on your part, or pigeonholed in there to make a statement, then it detracts from your story. And it will lose you readers.

If I were to read your story and all of a sudden be hit with Harry checking out another man, then I would be irritated as well. It ruins my immersion, my suspension of disbelief, and brings me out of the story. It makes me wonder why you bothered. I would have the same reaction if Harry was suddenly the leader of a harem of women and that wasn't in the summary (because I avoid those fics almost as much as I avoid slash fics).

Now, if Harry were gay, or bi, in canon, then we wouldn't be having this discussion. It would be normal, and I'd expect it. It wouldn't need to add anything to the story because it's already there. But, without reading the story, it seems to me that you thought it would be a cool thing to have Harry be bi for reason other than "why not?"

****** Canon Tonks is nearly a blank sheet. We know very little about her besides a tendency for slightly unhealthy relationships (Remus was anything but a good man/husband). So, what do we need to change to get a Harry/Tonks relationship? Surprisingly little. The age difference between them is 6/7 years, whereas Lupin was 14 years older, therefore, this point is moot, especially since Harry is more mature than his age due to all the shit he went through. A chance encounter at Number 12 or Hogsmeade can be enough to start an attraction.

We do not need to change established sexuality.

But we know that Harry is straight and quite a lot of his actions are steered by this. You would need to change a lot about Harry unless he is simply bi-curious. And then you would have to change the sexuality of the "target" as well. Cedric is known to be straight. So now you have to change two characters. [[https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf][According to the Williams Institute around 3.5% of all people are gay or bi.]] Therefore having two gay/bi characters is only 0.1225% likely while having two characters of the opposite gender match sexuality has a 96,63% probability.

That is the statistical reason why having a slash pairing that goes beyond bi-curiosity (which has a 1,1% probability and is therefore somewhat believable) is more often than not immersion breaking unless you state that you are writing an AU which has gay characters (putting a warning in the description or at the start of chapter 1).

**** Sounds like it's less an issue of attitude towards homosexuality and more an issue of the degree to which you identify with a character.

It sounds like you sympathize with a protagonist but that you don't literally consider the protagonist your avatar within that world. Many readers do the latter, however. Which is why they are happy to read characters doing things they would like to do in real life but can't, but cannot read characters doing things that they would not want to do IRL. It's just a specific example of the much broader theme of readers being turned off by characters making decisions they think are the wrong decisions.

This surely holds more for the romance side of fiction than any other. Romance in fiction is essentially wish fulfillment. If you go looking for wish fulfillment you don't want to read things that aren't what you wish for, and you certainly don't want to read things that you would find actively unpleasant if that situation happened to you IRL.

This isn't peculiar to slash. You will find the same reaction if you pair the main character with anyone the reader finds unattractive, e.g. Millicent Bulstrode. Or, to Harmony shippers, Ginny.

**** I think sometimes it doesn't even have to do anything with who you are attracted to. I am a straight woman but I am generally not a fan of slash even though I am attracted to men. I read it occasionally when I am looking to read something smutty, but for fics where I want to care about the characters and the story I usually really don't like it.

I find that more often it completely ruins characterizations and just takes me out of the story. The main characters to me are straight. I feel like it's part of their identity so I don't like them being gay all of a sudden. I do not like reading about Harry coming to question his sexuality or discussions on homosexuality in society, or everyone all of a sudden discussing what it means for men to date men in wizarding world. Its not something I care about and turns me off the story. Maybe it's because I am straight that I only like to read fics where characters are straight because I just can't relate or care otherwise. Plus characters in slash fics just tend to act unrealistically and annoy me.

That said, I rarely discriminate on slash or no slash, but I considering the amount of slash fics I have started reading, I clearly have no taste for it considering how few I actually ended up liking or finishing. Most just end up with OOC characters, or they start out good, but then turn focus on slash and everyone starts acting OOC which just drives me nuts especially since this is usually what happens to slash fics that I do like.

Some examples of fics where slash completely detracts from the fic and I really wish they weren't slash:

linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot by starcrossedgirl) This fic is so good up until there is slash (thankfully not until the end mostly). Good characterizations, great writing, absolutely hilarious and even emotional. Then all of a sudden Harry kisses Snape (wtf, why??) and Snape actually seems not to be too angry about it (what???). Thankfully he obliviates him and then there is a break until more OOC slash later, but I just don't understand the appeal or why they just start a romantic relationship like that.

linkao3(Again and Again by Athy) Again, starts out great, but later on the focus shifts to much to slash and characters actions start to seem OOC which is really annoying when the fic starts out well written and good.

And this seems to only relate to fics that have slash for me. I just don't think I have ever been put off or saw a drastic change in tone or characters due to romance in fics that have heterosexual relationships.

***** it seems the issue is that you find gay-ness in itself out of character. I get that its a personal thing for you as you see /all/ characters as straight. I've read The Boy Who Died A Lot And I didn't find they suddenly broke character when the romantic interactions happened, in fact I would argue both Harry and Snape stayed true to the authors characterisation that had been set up since the beginning. And it certainly didn't come out of left field (for Harry at least). I would argue that the one moment of OOC-ness was when Snape let slip that he was also gay, and it was addressed in story by Snape himself wondering why the fuck he said that.

I'm not blaming you or anyone else for this next opinion - it is just an observation - but in most media and discourse on media, there is an expectation that gay people should still be able to identify with a straight character, while heterosexuals should not have to identify with a gay character. This is an obvious double standard, and double-standards are an undoubtable part of homophobia.

And about Again and Again - Voldemort for me was OOC from the time Harry helped him resurrect. The story just kind of loses it's way in the last few chapters, and from someone who /can/ comfortably relate to a gay character, this falling apart had nothing to do with the m/m relationship and everything to do with not keeping a tighter reign on the plot. It doesn't help that it stopped only a chapter or so after the relationship stuff was essentially resolved. I still have hopes Athy will fix up the last few chapters and continue the story but I've almost resigned myself to an 'abandoned' tag at this point.

**** The argument here seems to be about whether being uncomfortable with sexual or romantic acts of a sexuality not your own makes you bigoted. I think something that might be useful in understanding these differing points of view is asexuality. Some asexual people are sex-neutral; they can read or watch porn or have sex and not get much or any enjoyment out of it, but be okay with it and not grossed out. Other asexual people are sex-repulsed; depending on the person, having sex or even being kissed can make them nauseous and extremely uncomfortable. Both kinds of people can be sex-positive; that is, okay with other people doing these things as much as they want, because they know that for most people sex is healthy and fun and great when done right.

Basically, this might extend to heterosexual people: some of them are unaffected by slash and might even want to read it (it's pretty hot, sometimes), but would never want to have homosexual sex themselves, or at least would not get turned on by it the same way as they're turned on by heterosexual sex. Others would never, ever want to have homosexual sex because it makes them nauseous or uncomfortable. It just feels /wrong/ to them. Again, both types of people can be totally okay with other people having homosexual sex, because, once more, for homosexual people sex can be healthy and fun and great when done right.

I... don't actually know if the way asexual orientations work can be extended to fit other orientations, but it makes sense, and I don't see why it wouldn't work that way.

As in attacking homosexuality or homosexuals. I know plenty of people who have a "dont shove it down my throat and I dont care what you do" mindset. The way to make these people more comfortable with homosexuality is not to attack them for these thoughts but to simply act like homosexuality is perfectly normal, because it is. And i always use Mass Effect as a shining example of this. Also people can have a preference of one race over another sexually as long as it purely on a sexual basis. Race is appearence and so it is no different than preferring blondes or skinny or curvy or muscular.

******* Er have you actually read 1984? Because thought crimes (the idea of thought crimes comes from that book) were things people could literally get imprisoned and tortured for. And obviously no one is proposing that.

People can absolutely have thoughts that are wrong and/or immoral. Like, say someone thinks rape should be legal (my former best friend actually thought this.) That's clearly an immoral and wrong thought, and judging it as such isn't calling it a “thought crime” because no one is saying you should go to torture jail for having that thought. If you think something like this it's obviously going to affect how you behave towards people, and if you're SAYING you think this then that's hurtful to a lot of people for entirely valid reasons. Recognizing that it's wrong to think this isn't “thought crime,” it's just logical. Sometimes people think things that are immoral and wrong, and there's nothing wrong with calling that out. In fact, a lot of people have internal biases against homosexuality that they don't even realize, so calling it out is the only way to get them to realize it and change.

Criticizing someone's thoughts is NOT “close to thought crimes.” Thoughts are what shape who we are and how we act towards people. The only way we got the LGBTQ community as accepted as it is today is by changing the way people THINK about LGBTQ people.

My point is that you shouldnt criticize people for what theyre thinking. Because you dont know what someone is thinking you are just unfairly judging them. Judge based on actioms not thoughts.

And your last point brings me to the point that the best way to fight homophobia is to treat homosexuality normally. Put it in media and literature and culture and dont say anything more. Because its normal and shouldnt be treated as anything but.

**** Well, not really... Queer people can identify with straight characters, yes, but that may be because they are raised in a society where straight people are more abundant than the LGBTQ community. Some may have even undergone abuse in an effort to stamp their peculiarities out. Queer people see straight people every day. Most of the humans they'll see are straight. Most of the humans in our society are straight. Do you see my point? Queer people are the minority in a world full of straight people or at least straight ideals. You can imagine yourself as straight since you've been living in a world where straight beliefs are very common. Us, straight people on the other hand, have trouble putting ourselves in those situations since it's uncommon, we're not used to it, and it just simply seems wrong for us to do it. The LGBTQ is new in this world. A very recent movement. It's gonna take some time before it finally becomes truly accepted. I actually have a gay friend, and it's disheartening hearing how his parents tried to blackmail him to stop by saying that his dad will get depression and kill himself.

*** Going to have to strongly disagree here. Gay people identify with straight characters /all the time./ The predominant writers and readers of slash fic are /women./ So to say that it boils down to a simple matter of not being able to relate with the characters is just...wrong.

Look. Let's be honest and admit that homophobia is a definitive reason why many straight men won't touch slash fic. The romantic aspects of the fic could be completely minimal, there could be no smut whatsoever, and the characters could be entirely IC, yet there will be folks who balk simply because Harry is interested in men. It has absolutely nothing to do with "relatability," or even in-characterness, because if there were a well-written Voldemort-centric or OP!Harry fic out there those same people wouldn't hesitate to read it.

I remember this post I came accross on DLP where this one gen fic was rec'd and basically everyone came out of the woodwork to warn that the fic probably wasn't going to be up to par because the author wrote slash fic. I checked out the fic myself and the author made it absolutely clear that there wouldn't be even a hint of a pairing, yet those asshats had already decided not to read the fic because the author wrote slash in the past.

Homophobia is a major factor in why some people will not read slash, and I think it's really disingenuous (and problematic) to suggest otherwise.

Please note that I'm not accusing every straight person who doesn't read slash of being homophobic. Just a lot of them.

I'm not disagreeing with this statement, but it is possible to argue that Harry could be interested in men, in canon, and he just never realises because he meets the love of his life at age 16. There are numerous instances of Harry noticing that another male character is attractive and you could use these examples as evidence that Harry is not entirely straight. It's incredibly common for people not to realise they're gay or bi or whatever until they're well into their 20s and even later.

If someone can read a Harry / Daphne fic and identify with Harry, and they can read a Hermione / Ron fic and identify with Hermione, then leaving a fic because it's Harry / Ron and they can no longer identify with the character is homophobic.

I don't mind Harry/Daphne because i can identify with Harry and find women desirable. I dont mind Hermione/Ron, because i still find one participant as desirable even if it's from a different pov. I don't like reading Harry/Ron because i find neither party desirable.

I don't mind if there are gay side characters, but usually romance plays a large role in the story, even when it's not the story itself. If i read a fic i like to imagine everything thats going on in my head and well, 2 main characters being shown intimate, when i find neither desirable, is going to be icky for me the same way a prepubescent child would find 2 adults kissing icky. On the same note femslash is perfectly okay with me, because i find both participants desirable.

In Harry Potter fanfics there are ALOT of maleSlash fics. I assume the vast majority of those are written by female or gay authors. As someone who is neither i don't like to read them, because as far as romance is involved the fic doesn't do anything for me.

Gay people wanting to be treated as humans isn't a system of ideals. It doesn't affect, for example, what sort of car they might like to buy, or what they do to combat global warming, or whether they think the death penalty is ethical or not.

Ideologies, on the other hand, will affect those greater decisions because they're whole systems of morals and ethics that have a central theme dictating them.

Nazism, for example, is centred around racial purity, but also has a lot of emphasis on the role of the government in order to control that racial purity. Nationalism is centred around doing what is best for one's own nation, and sometimes includes /expansionism/, an ideology based around expanding the land of one's nation to include more land and people, et cetera.

A political movement, in contrast, is just a push towards a specific single issue.

******** Yeah, like, don't get me wrong, I love relationships that can be difficult or awkward or emotional - I'm not really interested in an apple pie fantasy where characters meet, kiss, marry, and have 2.5 kids.

But how is a boy kissing a boy somehow super alien and terrifying... And yet a fourteen year old having sex with dozens of women, some of them adults (so it's sexual abuse, whether someone thinks it's "sexy" or not), and having a whole "harem" - that's not alien or terrifying at all. That's a fun romp!

That's mostly because "homophobia" ("Fear of the gay") is an inherently dumb word, that tries to equate dislike with fear. And then feels like it's trying to bludgeon you via the "you would want to be a coward would you?" argument.

Just because you don't like something doesn't mean you fear it. I don't like humus, I will not eat it under any circumstance, you could even say I hate it. But I'm not "humusphobic".

** I'm a straight female so I don't know what you go through but I personally enjoy reading het, slash as well as femslash stories; even going to the point of writing slash and femslash stories.

You'll get all kinds of people saying oh if you like slash/femslash then you're gay/lesbian yourself, which isn't always the case as I am a straight female as I said before.

I think one of the reasons why people have trouble is because A: A person is shown in canon to be straight and then suddenly being gay/lesbian doesn't "make sense" for their character. Which doesn't make any sense in that regard, just because a person goes from being straight to being gay/lesbian in a story does not change their personality or believes.

Another reason why I think some people have problems with the characters being gay/lesbian is because they are insecure of their own sexuality and/or are just uncomfortable about it because it's likely that they haven't been around very many gay/lesbian people in real life.

Of course this is merely speculation on my part; but something that I have thought myself when I'll get a review insulting my sexuality just because I write characters being gay or lesbian.

** Theres a few reasons, but the main one is that I tend not to read slash for the same reason I don't watch gay porn. I have no issue with it existing, I certainly it don't hate it, but it's just not for me. Especially since slash to me implies, very strongly, that it will involve explicit gay sex scenes.

On the other hand, I usually don't go in for romantic gay stories either. Of the possible relationships for Harry, most are antagonistic (Drarry, Snarry, Voldemort/Harry) or rather problematic (Sirius/Harry, Dumbledore/Harry). Ron/Harry doesn't interest me because Ron tends to be a boring character in fanfic, and those 6 ships seem to cover the majority of slashfics.

Finally, there's Poe's Law. While that's true for all fanfic, the 90% is much larger when it's something you're not fond of to begin with.

Tastes terrible to me. But it's perfectly fine that other people love it. That's fine, that's great; eat all the chocolate you like, but it's not for me, thanks.

Of course, sometimes, I'll get some food that I didn't know had chocolate in it, and I'll get an unfortunate surprise. Now I know there's chocolate in the meal, and the meal as a whole becomes unappealing. Maybe I can eat around the edges a bit, but I'll generally ask for another dish, because when you bake with chocolate, it tends to permeate the rest of the food. That's simply how baking works.

Now, it's rather ambiguous as to whether you mean "taste in regards to biology" or the sort of "your sexuality is not a choice, sexuality is genetic, etc." Assuming the latter, there is another element at play with slash fic. Because, if you presume that sexuality is set in stone, so to speak, taking the nature argument over the nurture one, then in a fic that is either canon-compliant, or canon-compliant up to some divergence point, any character in that fic that was born before the divergence point, should retain their canon sexuality.

** The major reason, I've found, is 'many people don't like reading gay relations for the main character in any way (or, rather, for the /perspective/ character which isnt always the same thing). Lots of reasons why they don't; including religion and sexual preference (especially important with Harry, who always was a good character for people to identify with and imprint themselves upon).

Personally, I don't like reading gay relationships that are explicitly shown to go beyond small PDAs. Though this is not exclusive to gay relations--I was raised with the idea that small displays of affections are all that's allowed outside the privacy of one's home--it is amplified for them because of my rather religious surroundings even if I'm not particularly religious myself (which, interestingly enough, is much /less/ so for lesbian fic. Dunno why, it's not as if the community I live in dislike lesbians less than they dislike gays).

Then, of course, you have the type who are questioning their own preference and then they read a gay moment in the 'fic and it all gets so confusing inside that the easiest way to deal with it is to drop the story and/or rant at the author. Bonus points if they are gay but have been raised to believe it's wrong and they don't want to go to Hell.

Therefore someone in this story will be attracted to a girl, something I can emphasize with. It is as simple as that. I do not see how a man could be sexually attractive. I mean, I have no problem with saying that some men look good. But it is "nice physique" or "nice suit" and not "I wanna fuck that".

I like to imagine myself in any given story, either as one of the characters or as a bystander.

**** Same here, except I'm the exact opposite. I'm a woman who likes men and I will read slash fics because there are two men. When I filter for character-based reasons I am usually filtering so that the story's protagonist is the male character I prefer and then I pair him with whichever woman has the personality I like the most. Or if I'm not filtering and I come across a story with a decent sounding plot but a male is paired with another male character that I also enjoy reading or find attractive, I'll give it a go. I will read femslash if the plot line is intriguing enough, but in general, I don't seek it out if I'm looking for a story that has a relationship based pairing.

If you want to read a story that is het or femslash because you like girls and need at least one female protagonist, more power to you. If you want to read femslash because you only want to read about girls being attracted to girls, or just a more female-centric story - also cool! Same with slash. If men loving men is your thing, read it!

I have enough options with my preferences so I generally stick to those. When I run out of things to read with my favorite filters then I generally branch out.

I generally avoid all stories that feature Ron though. People read what they like. Whether they are reading to imagine themselves in the story or to fantasize about the characters who they don't relate to but who are someone that they find attractive or intriguing about. I think it can really be both ways, if someone is homophobic, yes, they will not read slash because it grosses them out but someone could also choose not to read it not because they are against men loving men but maybe they don't like the pairing personally. I'm picky about my male characters. I only like 3 or 4 different male characters. So if it's not a combination of those few preferred guys I'm not going to read it.

** Some of my favourite "NO SLASH" reviews thus far:

- "Absolutely brilliant fic, was enjoying it so much until you ruined it by making it slash. Put a warning in the summary so people don't waste their time. I'm no longer reading. Such a shame, it was going so good. Ruined..."
- "Are you kidding me? 24 chapters and how many thousands of words into that story, and now you decide to drop none-too-subtle hints that this will be a slash fic. Really, and you don't think readers would appreciate having that info earlier? Why do some authors insist on adding "Surprise!" pairings to a fic? It's not just slash, either; I've seen surprise!incest, surprise!pedophilia (/cough/ Snape/Hermione), surprise!pederasty (Harry paired with Tom Riddle, or Lucius Malfoy, or Snape)."
- "Nnnnnnooooooooo, why did you make him gayyyyyyy, you didn't even do it poorly so I can't accuse you of that but whyyyyyyyyyyy"
- "uh, homosexual story, I love your idea and the way you put it in words. The plot you created is quite great, it is obvious even from the beginning. But I guess it is not really my story that you made it slash. My most loved character is being gay is just too much for me to continue reading your story and enjoy it."

And then these three, sent in by the same person, on chapter 24, chapter 59, and chapter 69:

- Please can you put a warning up if Harry is going to be homosexual. Would not of started to read this story if that was the case.
- I have a feeling Harry is bisexual considering how often he thinks about how good looking certain males are, first story I have continued reading where Harry's not heterosexual. Just goes to show how much I'm enjoying the story.
- And i'm out please put a warning in the summary for people who dont want to read about a bi harry.

I do kind of want "/uh, homosexual story."/ on a t-shirt, I admit.

*** In addition to my post below, consider the reputation of slash fics in most people's minds. It is not, I'm willing to bet, a romance between two men--equal to the het fic except the same gender.

It is Harry/Snape. It is Harry/Draco. It's Harry/Voldemort. It's Harry/Sirius (and so many more). It's ABO (where Harry generally isn't the A, which I feel people could be able to live with... eventually), as outdated a model of pack dynamics as it is.

Slash fic also have a reputation to make /everyone/ gay, warping well-established characters to do so, instead of having a few islands of gayness in an ocean of heterosexuality as in real life.

Of particular note is the 'you didn't even do it poorly' comment. It implies that the reader went in /expecting/ the romance to be done poorly.

**** Pretty much. I'm not a huge fan of sex scenes in general, but can skim over one or two hetero scenes. But gay sex just doesn't interest me, and my experience is that slash stories tend to have a lot of sex, depending a little on the fandom. That combined with how trope heavy they tend to be in Potter verse and I skip all stories tagged slash.

That said, I abandon stories for a lot of reasons.

SAAAAME. I've abandoned stories over the pettiest things. If any of the first five paragraphs contain:\\
1) more than one run-on sentence\\
2) start with a run-on sentence\\
3) have odd sentence flows\\
4) have odd paragraph flows\\
5) start /in medias res/ with a statement the character wouldn't otherwise say

if said first paragraphs (or the first chapter in the case of 5) contain any one without the story making it clear somehow that this is intended, I skip.

If it contains 5), I tend to skip regardless. There was one recommended Naruto fic that I didn't even start (naruto who talked like a pimp, to be precise, dont remember the name), and, notably, the Prince of Slytherin.

Call me an elitist, but stories have to /earn/ their AU tag. Either through above average characterization or worldbuilding (which includes stuff like the first bits in 0800rentahero, which I dropped later for other reasons not limited to disgust at the author), preferably both but this remains fanfiction so the standards should remain low :p

Which, of course, doesn't get into the reasons I could drop fics later on.

And I was thinking - maybe JKR should have introduced a proper LGBTQ character in the series. Dumbledore's homosexuality seemed more of an afterthought and anyway we came to know about it too late. The Percy Jackson series on the other hand, though nowhere near the brilliance of Harry Potter, is very progressive in this regard. Maybe, the second instalment of Fantastic Beasts might change things in the magical world.

You tag many other, more useless things in the AO3 version. It just sounds like you're being stubborn about not doing it and then you complain when people dislike it.

That, and reading the tags in AO3 for the whole series /many/ characters are gay or bisexual within the main cast itself, so it's a fairly big part of the romantic relationships--for some, it also can break SOD having that many.

** First of all, for the record, two of my top three HP fics are slash.

Now, with that out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks. Self-identification with sexuality isn't a thing with me, being Ace, so I can't comment on that, but what I can say is that I generally roll my eyes and skip over slash for one reason: QUALITY.

About 90% of fanfiction is horrible About 97% of slash fanfiction is horrible

I've given just about every possible pairing (especially none) a fair shake. I genuinely love a good story, and relationship being started isn't going to stop me. That being said: if a fic begins with an interesting canon divergence, follows it for however long, then decides it wants to be a relationship fic, fuck that story.

Relationships are a part of life; an important part, but it's not like folks completely drop every priority and moral and sense of self just because they're sexing up someone all of a sudden. (They may lose a bit, but not all)

Lots of folks write fanfiction for self-satisfaction: That's fine, I get it, but it just seems like there's a greater proportion of vapid nonsense in slash.

On the topic of OOCness. I think the issue that myself and the non-closet homophobe folks have with random characters being super OOC is that the author (Whether in bad het, bad gen, or bad slash) doesn't give /Context/ to why there is a change in personality.

  When you think of a gay man, what exactly do you imagine?
#+end_quote

I imagine my best good buddy that I've known for 20 years and how I was able to participate in his wedding and how now he and his husband are going through the ups and downs of the adoption process. I think of the amazing community of singers I know and how I fear for a lot of my gay friends when they travel internationally. I think of my cousin who is in the closet and will probably never come out. I think of the gay truckers and gay Harley riders I know.

Everyone has the right to not be into something, but I think the argument that people identify with the hero of the story to be pretty weak. "I'm not gay, therefore the hero of the story shouldn't be gay!" is lame and to paraphrase Ron, "(They) need to sort out (their) priorities!" and figure out why it makes them uncomfortable. An unexamined life and all that.

You write what you want to write and don't twist yourself into knots over what people think about it. Share your lived experiences through your writing with honesty and you will reach someone. Some will like it, some won't, but if it's a thing you enjoy doing, keep on going. Not everyone likes everything Neil Gaiman does, but it doesn't stop him.

I have a gay character in California Dreamin' and stories that take place after that and I haven't received any hassle about him. Like gay people in real life, it's not a big deal that he's gay--it's just part of who he is.

For my own part, I don't read a lot of slash because I'm not into Harry/Draco/Tom/Sirius/Remus/Cedric. I've read a few that I enjoyed, but I don't generally seek it out. But! Give me a good Trio fic and I'm all in.

** OP, I think part of the problem is that most people don't expose themselves to slash, and when they do, wonders of wonders it turns out to be the poorly written kind, since most fanfiction is poorly written.

I think the Harry Potter fandom is especially vulnerable to poorly written slash though... There are too many bad popular pairings, such as Harry and Tom or Harry and Draco. Those are straight up unhealthy and stupid and most writers aren't thinking enough to care enough to realize the elements that come with such pairings.

It's why I tend to stick to Naruto fanfiction if I'm reading slash, and usually specific authors.

However I also find reading slash specifically more uncomfortable when it's a view point character or main character than her or femslash. I don't feel that way watching say modern family, even if the episode is Cam and Mitchell going on a date, so it's something about it being writing I guess, sort of hard to describe.

However this is all personal preference stuff not saying writing that is bad or you shouldn't write it. I just don't like reading it. So warning are appreciated.

As I said I prefer no romance at all, so I probably wouldn't read a Harry goes from partner to partner fic even if it was all straight relationships, but again that's a personal preference thing, not saying writing that ita bad to write that type of fic.

But rather than homophobia, as I act similarly for straight romance when it takes up too much of the story, I think it's because I don't read romance. Call it emotional damage from past experience, immaturity, a-sexuality, or just being weird.

Even well-written and/or critically acclaimed romance leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I cringe and roll my eyes and... Yeah. I guess slash is unique in that it doesn't appeal to any of my own interests, whereas, being straight (if still weird), I can at least tolerate a bit of straight romance if the story is good enough.

I dunno, maybe I'm just emotionally stunted in the "Gross, they're kissing" phase.

I find your observations quite sad. Personally, I'll read slash but I don't seek it out. In other fandoms I have, but with HP I tend to focus more on the younger generation and I don't really think any pairing there would fit. HarryxRon or HarryxDraco is just a no. When I do read something Marauders era or something AU, I'm totally not opposed to SiriusxRemus or even SiriusxJames though the latter messes with the endgame, depending on timing. Actually I'm not sure why I said “not opposed” because SiriusxRemus is everything.

I guess the reader insert one makes a bit of sense... I guess... but the others are just completely ridiculous IMO. The gender of a pairing has nothing to do with the quality of writing. I can't believe people actually think that. All slash fic is definitely not smutty either. I've read some pretty disgustingly smutty HP fic, and none of it was even slash.

I don't know if you linked your fic elsewhere in here, I'm going to check, but I'd love to read it and leave some reviews to offset the idiotic ones it sounds like you're getting.

There are actually professional studies going back decades on the problem of why girls will read books with male or female protagonists but boys generally refuse to read books with a female lead.

But with homosexual relationships it needs to make sense and actually make me feel like the characters are in love. Otherwise I abandon the story. And in fanfiction just about all romances are written poorly. There have been a few occasions where slash snuck up on me and was written well enough that I found myself rooting for the romance.

That said, I usually avoid ALL stories obviously centered on romance. Not something I'm interested in. So when I see a story marked slash I avoid it, as those stories tend to focus too heavily on romance.

I'd also like to add that tolerance can still be had if one does not empathize, they are not one-in-the-same thing. In my opinions I allow homosexuality as an acknowledgment that others are different and have a right to their own preferences. That is tolerant, and yet, I do not empathize. I can empathize with someone being persecuted for being gay, because I have been for the color of my skin.

I don't care for smut, as it is rarely well written and in nearly every instance I encounter it, I wasn't looking for wank material in the first place. While you can have relationships in a story, and have them enrich the overall tale, many authors are incapable of holding back from describing their characters intimate moments.

2. Near illiterate homosexual teenage boys who get creppily explicit

3. Literate versions of the above who unfortunately hav no writing tallent whatsoever who get creppily explicit

** Simple for me.

To often authors use Slash as a means to basically make Characters emotionally and mentally weak. To often you will see Gay characters suddenly crying at Insults that would of run off their backs if the author had written then as hetero. There is often a lot of cutting and self harm by Gay men in these stories as well despite Self harm being significantly more prevalent in girls (Three times more likely to). It often sometimes feels like the Authors are subconsciously bashing the Characters in canon and are feeding stereotypes. Like the idea of masculinity in any form is wrong and thus in the story, other than Penises, other traces of stereotypical masculine thoughts and ideals are replaced with feminine actions.

Slash comes off feeling like it was written as Femslash and then converted to Slash, or its Het but many normal masculine traits cut from the Top.

A perfect example was a HP Avengers story I was reading. The first story was Gen and was Harry joining and helping the Avengers and fighting along side them. The sequel was given to a new author, the very first chapter has Harry having a mental break down for no well explained reason during which he injuries himself on broken glass and every male avenger going Gaga over poor little feminine Harry (the author even went out of their way to describe Harry as rather feminine) leading to Harry falling a sleep and being fought over by Tony, Thor and Cap as being the one to take him to his bed and tuck him in. Harry had gone for world weary, Magical avenger badass to being the softest flower that the Avengers had ever seen and needed protection from the world.

Reading 69 chapters and then closing the fic is far more than seeing just a hint of slash and fleeing afterwards. We could assume (though not state as fact) that the reader actually liked the plot of the story and stuck with it for 69 chapters. Just look at the review the reader left for Chapter 59 (taken from one of the OP's comments above): "I have a feeling Harry is bisexual considering how often he thinks about how good looking certain males are, first story I have continued reading where Harry's not heterosexual.

Slash in general just seems like a way to get out your sexual fantasy rather than good literary work. As OP mentioned, much of slash is lower quality work as well. I don't mind a slash pairing as long as the whole fic doesn't center around it, but thats just me because i don't like any fic thats solely romance, i prefer just a strong character thats not in a relationship.

Based on some reactions, it seems like people think it's an assault on or threat to their sexuality/personality/integrity, which also makes it seem like they don't know what homosexuality means. It can hardly change who you are as a person or make you instantly amoral, but that's my take on why they fear it so much.

But there's something magical about reliving my childhood, and I don't have the time nor grit to write my own fic. So I'll look for others with specific pairings, elements, ideas, etc.

That being said, if you're wondering why readers who are enjoying your fic see a same sex relationship and immediately quit? It's because they are homophobic. Or ignorant. Homosexual relationships are extremely frowned upon in many international countries, especially China, Korea, Russia, Indonesia, etc. just as they are frowned upon still in red states here.
