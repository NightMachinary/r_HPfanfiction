James and Lily are alive, but have gotten a divorce. Lily has custody of Harry, and marries Mr. Greengrass who also divorced his significant other while managing to achieve custody of his own children successfully.

No Haphne please in this occasion, Harry and Daphne have a platonic familial bond with each other and Astoria.


** I think that's way too specific to actually have been done before, dude. Sorry. Like if you ask for a story where Sirius is LGBTQ and Harry has one arm and Voldemort's wand is a staff and Dementors eat chips...
