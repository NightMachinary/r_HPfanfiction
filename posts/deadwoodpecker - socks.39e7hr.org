I've heard that this story may have been completed. If so, does anyone know where i would be able to find it?


** I thought you said "Deadwoodpecker sucks" and I was about to go ham up in here.

To answer your question, no I have not seen it anywhere unfortunately.

** Fuck, Socks is awesome. Too bad there's isn't much of it. I /think/ Deadwoodpecker finished this on her LJ account, which has been purged since then, but that's just hearsay. I heard she completed Yellow Submarine on LJ as well, so if anyone has that version, then I would love a copy of it as well.

*** I've been hoping that someone would throw the finished version up on reddit, but so far no one is showing the love. It irritated me so much to "finish" the story only to find out that the last chapters were held hostage for something. A charity, I think, but they were still hostage.

*** I've heard, but cannot confirm, that one can look Ella up on Facebook and get updates on her stores/links to their most recent versions. I believe she did an update on one of her stories (BWP1?) on fanfiction.net with coordinates for how to find her in social media.
