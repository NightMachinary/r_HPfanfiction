** I'd say Hogwarts Houses Divided is a great fic to read after having finished the books. It follows Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts, along with some new kids related to familiar characters in various ways -- though Harry has a semi-major role as Teddy's godfather, Neville is the most prominent teacher as Head of Gryffindor, and pretty much every surviving character from the series make at least a cameo.

The tone and feel is pretty close to the original books, if perhaps a little more focusing on problems that the books ignored, such as the negative sides of the inter-house rivalries.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** I would suggest you try Isolation by Bex-chan if you're fine with non-canon pairings and sexual content. It's the absolute best there is, to the point that it has its own goodreads page. Many people (including myself) sometimes replace the final book with this, that's how good this is. Just remember, this may change you.
