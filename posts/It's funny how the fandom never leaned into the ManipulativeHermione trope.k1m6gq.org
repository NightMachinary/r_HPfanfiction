** This isn't manipulation. This is a suggestion, or the sharing of an idea. Manipulation means making someone do something by subtly influencing them to do it your way or by using some form of deception - she doesn't do that. She outright asks him to teach the group and explains why he's the best person. When he has doubts, she counters them with facts and encouragement. She straightforwardly puts her case across and is upfront about what she wants him to do. No one is manipulated.

*** I was mostly just poking fun at the Manipulative!Dumbledore and Manipulative!Weasley tropes. Dumbledore and the Weasleys never actually got anywhere near Harry's fame, let alone used it for their devices. Hermione did though, and the fandom completely missed it. She used his fame to further her own goals. The goal wasn't self-serving, but it still used Harry's fame, and that's a plot point common to Manipulative!__________ stories.

And Hermione got Harry to teach when he otherwise would not have, leveraging both his frustration against Umbridge and his need to do the right thing. Furthermore, while Harry agreed to teach a small study group, he definitely did not agree to her using his fame and the general curiosity about him to recruit.

**** I don't think it used Harry's fame - she says that more people will come if it's Harry, but that's not about his "fame" - look at the students who come to the meeting. All the Gryfs already know him and aren't starstruck about the "boy who lived," he's just Harry to them. Luna couldn't care less about anything like that anyway. Cho already likes Harry as a person. Marietta is there because of Cho, nothing to do with Harry. Zach Smith clearly doesn't even like him, he just wants to know what happened to Cedric but he's the only one. The other Hufflepuffs, again the novelty of Famous Harry Potter has worn off - they've had Herbology with him for years.

Hermione absolutely didn't use Harry's fame, she "uses" (for want of a better term) the fact that people /like and respect him/ and that they all know he's good at DADA. It's not just Hermione - in the first meeting loads of the other students make points about why they'd want to learn from Harry, and none of them are "because you're famous," they're things like "mate you killed a basilisk when you were twelve of course I want to learn defence from you."

No one is using his fame. Hermione, and then the others later on, identify Harry as the best person for this role because of his /abilities and experiences./ It's only in Harry's mind (and a little bit in Smith's attitude) that people are only there because they're curious about Famous Mental Lying Harry Potter, and we as the reader only have that impression briefly and again only because the books are from Harry's perspective. The behaviour of every other character shows that Harry's notoriety has absolutely nothing to do with people showing up to the DA or Hermione wanting him to lead it. They do these things because of the respect they have for his ability and for him as a person.

Asking someone to do something and giving a rational, factual argument about why they are the right person for the job is not "leverage." Leverage means having power over someone to affect their decision, usually by having it in your gift to grant or not grant their desired outcome to something. Hermione has no power to affect his decision, she just tells the truth and he eventually agrees. Just because she /mentions some facts he agrees with/ such as "Umbridge sucks as a teacher" and "Voldemort is dangerous" that does not equal manipulation or leverage. Harry agrees straight off that they need a group, he just doesn't think he should lead it because he believes the rest of the school think he's gone mental. He is, as he realises in the Hogs Head, incorrect. That's not manipulation on Hermione's part at all, that's just, life and facts.

Re your Dumbledore/Weasley fic point, yes. The issue with Dumbledore is that Harry didn't always know what he wanted upfront and Dumbledore did, to an extent, engineer situations in a way Harry wasn't aware of - although the Manipulative Dumbledore trope is so far overdone it's got ridiculous, and as for the Manipulative Weasleys one, that's just, I don't get it. Not Molly's biggest fan, but she's not Manipulative.

***** Here's the definition of Manipulation from Merriam Webster:

#+begin_quote
  to change by artful or unfair means so as to serve one's purpose
#+end_quote

While not unfair, Hermione was certainly artful. She appealed to what she knew would get Harry to give in despite his very vocal reluctance. It isn't hardcore or evil manipulation, but it was manipulation nevertheless. Hermione wasn't going to take no for an answer and she used everything she had to get Harry to agree.

And like I said, the manipulation part was really just me referencing the Manipulative!Weasley and Manipulative!Dumbledore tropes. People going after Harry for his fame is common in these stories.

​

#+begin_quote
  she "uses" (for want of a better term) the fact that people /like and respect him/ and that they all know he's good at DADA
#+end_quote

This is OoTP we're talking about. Everyone and their mother were calling Harry a liar. He almost got into a fistfight with Seamus Finnegan because Finnegan called him a liar. There was a smear campaign against his name, and people were falling for it right, left, and center. Please note that this isn't also the first time that people doubted Harry and believed the rumors against him. While for sure there were people in that room who believed outright, there were a lot of skeptics in that room too (Finnigan notably was in that pitch too).

We also see in the meeting in the Hog's Head that all his schoolmates knew about his heroics were rumors they weren't sure to believe. Half of that meeting was Harry clarifying said rumors. If they were the kind of people to care about rankings, they probably knew he got good marks in DADA, but most people don't. And even then, good marks aren't actually all that remarkable here.

So really, the only reason all of these people came were because Harry is famous (note: /notorious),/ and they were curious. Hearing out his and Hermione's pitch gave them the opportunity to ask questions and sate their curiosity. While they did eventually come to believe and respect Harry's ability, the /initial pitch/ was only as big as it was because Hermione successfully used Harry's notoriety and people's curiosity to get them to come in the first place.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Disgree. "Artful" in this context means cunning, ie using deceit or evasion to achieve goals. Hermione at no point uses deceit or evasion. She lays out facts and is open about her desired outcome. Just because Harry is uncomfortable with it at first, for reasons connected to his own self esteem tbh, does not make it manipulation. Nothing that happens is manipulative. He says he doesn't think he could do it, she says "sure you can you're great plus you have the experience we need of actually fighting Voldemort." That's the truth, no deceit or evasion. She convinces him with facts and a dose of reality. The thing that /actually/ changes his mind is that Hermione is taking it seriously enough to say Voldemort's name. At that point he realises that others are as invested in this as he is. That's not manipulation by Hermione, that's Harry pulling his head out of his arse and realising that the war affects more people than him, Sirius, and Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  the initial pitch was only as big as it was because Hermione successfully used Harry's notoriety and people's curiosity to get them to come in the first place.
#+end_quote

Again, I respectfully disagree. Of the people who showed up, the vast majority already actively like and respect Harry. His dorm mates. (You mentioned Seamus - he'd already apologised to Harry before he joined the DA in a scene separate to and before the Hogs Head meeting, so again that's someone else who is already on Harry's side.) The Quidditch team. Luna. The Creevey bros. Lee Jordan. Ginny. Cho. Most of the others quite like him - Lavender and the Patil twins, the Hufflepuff girls, Justin. The only person who shows any kind of sign of only being there because they want "proof" is Smith, and everyone sits on him to shut up. He's a lone voice. So your assertion that the majority of the room was skeptical is demonstrably incorrect. At least 60% of people there if not more were already vocally pro Harry or neutral-leaning-to-approval.

#+begin_quote
  We also see in the meeting in the Hog's Head that all his schoolmates knew about his heroics were rumors they weren't sure to believe.
#+end_quote

Again, absolutely wrong. One of the main things that's brought up is all the stuff he did in the Triwizard Tournament, that they all saw. They all know he's good, because they've seen him outfly and outmagic students three years older than him and take the lead in a tournament meant for of age wizards when he was 14.

#+begin_quote
  So really, the only reason all of these people came were because Harry is famous (note: notorious), and they were curious.
#+end_quote

They were curious about the stuff he got up to at school, though, which is a separate issue to his wider fame as presented in the Manipulation Trope Fics. Plus, it's only a few of the students that behave like that. You really think Luna, or the Quidditch team, or any Weasley, thinks badly of Harry? Cho doesn't think badly of him either, nor does Neville and Dean or even, by this point in the narrative, Seamus. Most of the people there would have gone anyway, because they like Harry.

Sure, everyone is curious about things like what happened with Quirrell or the graveyard and so on, but that is absolutely not the same as the Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasleys fics which is about people using his wider "Boy Who Lived" fame and the influence in the wizarding world that said fame offers. A schoolkid wanting to know what really happened in the Chamber of Secrets is absolutely not the same as a grown adult such as Dumbledore or Molly wanting to use Harry's fame to influence other factors. The kids just wanted a good story, wanting the truth isn't "using" someone and the fact they asked proves only that they didn't know the full facts (which let's be honest no one really does), not that they didn't like or respect Harry or even that the truth about the rumours would have had any impact on whether they joined or not. Anyone would want to know about the truth behind the rumour that a 12 year old killed a deadly creature, or escaped the clutches of a mass murderer.

Wanting the truth from the source in no way indicates that you lack respect or admiration for the source, which disproves your argument that Hermione only got people to come along because she implies they'd get answers. She doesn't. She lets Harry's /popularity/ draw people in, but again that is not manipulation. That's saying "hey, this person you like is doing this thing, want to be involved?" Like I've said, the majority of the people in that meeting would have gone to it under any circumstances.

The thing you're missing in your analysis is that the Manipulation Fics (which we can both agree are a ridiculous genre) involve an /imbalance of power./ Harry is young, unfamiliar with the wizarding world, doesn't know fully what's going on and isn't wise to what's happening behind the scenes to affect his behaviour and choices. In the events leading up to the creation of the DA, there's no imbalance of power. Harry and Hermione are equals and they have access to the same information. Nothing is taking place "behind the scenes." She makes her pitch, he thinks about it, and eventually agrees. Did she say things she thought would make him say yes? Of course she did, but they were truthful things that she was open about which is not manipulation.

Manipulation is done without the person being manipulated's full knowledge or understanding and they end up being influenced without realising it. To successfully manipulate someone, you have to have more knowledge than them. You have to hold all the cards, even if they don't realise it. Hermione is totally open with Harry, has no power over him, and doesn't hold the cards. /Harry/ holds the cards, because he's the one with the power to say yes or no and the knowledge and skills to make the group successful. He has what she wants, not the other way around.

TL;Dr: more than half of the people who went to that meeting were his mates anyway who don't give one shit about his "fame", and Hermione asking him to do something for the one reason that he'd be good at it isn't manipulation, because manipulation requires a power imbalance. This is not the case in the relationship between Harry and Hermione at this stage or indeed at any other stage in the series. Oh, and Manipulation Trope fics do indeed suck.

******* Artful in this context does not mean cunning or deceitful. Those definitions already fall under the "unfair" category. Artful here means skillful. And Hermione's management and anticipation of Harry's arguments definitely fall under skillful.

I think you're hung up on manipulation needing to be unfair or to the detriment of one of the parties involved, and you're right, most of the times it would be. If that is the case, then consider how being the instructor for the DA meant that Harry had to answer extremely uncomfortable questions and prying to do so. Consider how she railroaded Harry's objections by bringing weak spots and sore points (that no one believes him about Voldemort, that people will die or get hurt if he doesn't).

You're right that Hermione's actions do not hold a candle to the manipulation in manipulation fics. But just because her methods, her goals, and her influence were not as extreme that does not make it any less manipulation.

Another misunderstanding here is that you think I believe Hermione to be the same as Manipulative!Dumbledore or Manipulative!Weasleys. I don't. I'm merely pointing that it is Hermione, not Dumbledore or the Weasleys who had come the /closest/ to manipulating Harry. I am not saying that they are the same.

Hermione manipulated Harry's emotions until he gave in. She cornered him, and gave him no option to refuse. There is no deceit sure, but the way she pushed at his buttons until there was no way he could say no were still manipulation nonetheless.

I do recognize though that we probably hold different standards for what counts as manipulation and what does not. We're at an impasse, and I think we should just consider this part of the conversation done.

#+begin_quote
  You mentioned Seamus - he'd already apologised to Harry before he joined the DA in a scene separate to and before the Hogs Head meeting
#+end_quote

No he didn't. His apology came after the Quibbler was released around February, months after the meeting at Hog's Head. He was still a skeptic during the Hog's Head meeting. And yes, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army][you are right that about half being Gryffindor]] and going because they already know and trust Harry. There were 14 Gryffindors out 26 attendees. Minus Seamus plus Cho and Luna, you have around 57% who came because they believed in him - or at least trusted him - already.

43% of the group neither knew nor believed in him. That is still a lot of people. So what exactly lured them in? Why did they come? It is to these people that Harry's notoriety mattered. The fact that the DA was interhouse instead of being overwhelmingly Gryffindor is due to Hermione managing to leverage Harry's fame and notoriety well enough that these total strangers came not only despite just knowing Harry's reputation, but even despite outrightly distrusting him (eg. Zacharias Smith).

The points about his performance in the Triwizard Tournament and his other accomplishments came later. They came because they were curious about Harry. They wanted to hear the story from him. That is the work of his notoriety and fame, and Hermione used those to convince them to at least hear him out before they make their judgments. I stand by what I said, the initial pitch was only as big as it was because of how Hermione used Harry's fame in the recruitment.

******** The other factor I don't think we've discussed properly is about her "using his fame." However she got him to agree to lead the group, manipulation or not, the /reason/ she got him to do it is because /he would be best at it./ She didn't choose him because he would be a pull-factor for others. She chose him because she knows full well that Harry is a) the best at defence in their year and probably the school and b) has real life experience of what it's really like to be in a life or death situation.

Are there DA members who initially went along, even in part, because they wanted to see what Famous Harry Potter had to say? Yes - Zach Smith is a clear example of that. However, at no point does Hermione say either "come along and meet Famous Harry Potter," nor does she promise anyone stories about his adventures. She, as far as we can tell from the information given in the book, says "I'm starting a study group because Umbridge sucks, Harry is going to teach the practical elements, are you interested?" If some people chose to go along out of curiosity about Harry and the things he's done that is /their choice and their choice alone./

Hermione does not push Harry's fame to get more members. Given her paranoia about being found out (evidenced by the hexed parchment) she wouldn't want hangers on. It's clear from her pronouncements at the HH that the club is for people who will take it seriously, not people who are interested in Harry's fame. The reason she chooses him to teach is a purely logical one - he is the best candidate for the job. If Colin Creevey had been the best at defence, she would have asked Colin! Harry's fame being attractive to others is incidental to what Hermione is up to, and it's actually that particular assesment of her character in your post that I think specifically does her dirty. She would never, and does never, use Harry in that way. She knows he hates his fame.

#+end_quote

No, I got you weren't saying that it was anything like those kind of fics, which are madly exaggerated and, especially in the case of the Weasleys, pulled out of a vacuum. My argument is that Hermione never manipulated Harry at all, not even here, not even a small bit. She made some suggestions and relied on her inherent understanding of his character to support her belief that he would agree eventually and thus he was a sensible person to ask. That's not manipulation, that's just asking for something. Nothing was affecting Harry's decision that wasn't true, and no information was hidden from him or edited to influence him one way or the other, nor does she push inherently irrelevant factors to play with his emotions and influence an outcome. Everything she says is true, relevant to the topic 100% and presented in an above board way.

#+begin_quote
  No he didn't. His apology came after the Quibbler was released around February. He was still a skeptic during the Hog's Head meeting.
#+end_quote

We're both wrong! - Seamus wasn't at the HH meeting at all. He was brought to the DA by Dean after apologising to Harry (which was indeed after the Quibbler article), so let's discount him for these stats as he wasn't one of the people who went along initially.

So, removing Seamus, there's 27 members not counting Harry or Hermione.

/Gryffindor or otherwise Pro Harry/: Ron Weasley Alicia Spinnet Angelina Johnson Dean Thomas Colin Creevey Dennis Creevey Fred Weasley George Weasley Katie Bell Lavender Brown Lee Jordan Parvati Patil Neville Longbottom Luna Lovegood Cho Chang Ginny Weasley

/Neutral, probably ok/: Anthony Goldstein Michael Corner Padma Patil Terry Boot Ernie Macmillan Hannah Abbott Justin Finch-Fletchley Susan Bones

/Hostile/reluctant/: Marietta Edgecombe Zacharias Smith

That's 16/27 that are absolutely pro, which is 59.2%. So as I said, sixty percent of those in attendance would have attended anyway.

#+begin_quote
  43% of the group neither knew nor believed in him.
#+end_quote

That's also not true. The only person who is actively hostile is Smith, and Marrietta is the only one who's truly reluctant. The people I've listed as neutral all definitely knew him as they were in his year and had classes with him. Some of them will have liked him! That counts for eight people out of our 27, or 30%, who would /probably/ have gone along. So combine their total with the "actively pro" group, giving 25 people out of 27 (90%) who were not hostile. Sixty percent of the group would definitely have gone under any circumstances, and a further 30 percent would probably have done so. That's not a hostile grouping.

#+begin_quote
  This is where Hermione used Harry's fame and notoriety in the recruitment. They came because they were curious about Harry
#+end_quote

You discount all other possible factors - the main one being they'd all experienced Umbridges lessons and knew the same /objective truth/ that Hermione puts to Harry - her teaching will not get them through their exams. They turn up because they've been told that a study group is being run for a class they're worried about failing, and it's being run by the resident school genius and the kid they all saw fight a dragon. I think we'd all show up to that!

Curiosity about Harry and the current situation was a motivation, sure. But for most of them, this is the only way they've been offered that means they'll pass DADA. Getting a cool story about a snake or about Voldemort is just a bonus.

Hermione doesn't need to manipulate anyone, because she knows Harry will do this in the end because that's who he is. She doesn't need to influence him, she just needs to give him the information to make the decision himself.

And she doesn't need to "use" his fame to get members. The whole school knows Umbridge is an awful teacher, and most students don't want to fail their exams - especially not OWL and NEWT years. So they don't need much of an incentive to come - Harry being interesting and probably mad is more than likely a secondary factor in most decisions, but just because it is a factor it doesn't mean it's a mark of Hermione's manipulation.

But for the record, even if you don't count it as manipulation, Harry certainly did.

#+begin_quote
  This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was.
#+end_quote

As for the percentage, I didn't count Ron as part of the guests at Hog's Head. He was already read in and was there for nearly everything before that. But sure around 60% with 40% strangers.

I also never claimed that they were hostile - just people who didn't know him personally, and therefore may not believe him. I agree that they were neutral because Hermione would not have brought a person who can't be convinced otherwise. Neutral doesn't mean they believe him though - just that they are willing to hear him out.

Anyway, my point is that it was Harry's reputation and notoriety that brought them there. Sure there are other reasons, but there are other study groups, and ones that are likely not as dangerous or controversial as Harry's. As much as the DA would have been helpful to OWLs or NEWTs students that wasn't what they came there for.

They came specifically to hear Harry out. (I finally managed to dig up the book!)

********** I suppose what you're calling manipulative behaviour, I'd call "coaxing him," or similar. She /influenced/ him, on that I think we can agree. He wouldn't have had the idea on his own, that is for sure. But I think there's a clear line between influencing someone and manipulating them - to influence someone can be a good thing, a neutral thing, or a bad thing. Whereas manipulation is always negative, and I don't see her behaviour as negative.

I think there's one line from the book, which you have quoted, which specifically undermines your thesis here tbh. I'll emphasise it within the quote.

#+end_quote

Hermione /should/ have seen this coming. Not that she /did,/ not that she /set it up,/ but that she /should have realised/ (which means she didn't) that the people who arrived wanted to hear Famous Harry Potter stories, not learn defence.

That doesn't say to me that she deliberately used his fame. It says to me the opposite in fact - that she actually /overlooked/ his fame, and assumed that people would be logical about it and keen to learn because, well, that's what /Hermione/ would do. But ofc the rest of the student body isn't Hermione, and wants to gawp at him because they've heard some stories.

Hermione doesn't use his fame, because it would never occur to her to use his fame. If people say to her they're interested in hearing what Harry has to say, she interprets it as "I want to know what it's like to really face a bad guy," because that's how /she/ sees it:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... We need to know what it's really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort.
#+end_quote

For Hermione, it's not about his fame. It's about the /benefit of his experience./ She's just naive enough to think that others will approach it in the same way. That is the opposite of "using" his fame.

So yeah, she talked him into it fo sho, (manipulate is a v strong word though) but she categorically didn't use his fame, and even Harry acknowledges that, because it just didn't occur to her that people might be interested in "the boy who lived" and the gossip inherent in his fame rather than focusing on the fact he's capable and has unique, relevant, lived experience. Hermione is logical to a fault, and it makes her blind to the fact that others often act irrationally.

She panicked and lost control of the conversation, but her pitch to them was that she's offering them the opportunity to hear what Harry has to say. She backtracked because she saw how uncomfortable the questions were making Harry, but the plan all along was to have these people hear him out.

​

Also, I'm just realizing that we probably understand "using his fame" very differently. I realize that half of this is my fault for using the word "fame" and not recognizing the connotations.

I meant that Hermione knew people are curious about Harry, his story, and his claims. And she used this as bait to get them to come where the actual pitch was happening. I'm not saying she went around saying "Here's the famous Harry Potter". I'm saying she recognized the lure of Harry's story, and people's thirst to hear that first hand. I'm saying that she understands how people are magnetized towards him and that having him as the head would have pushed out the narrative she was selling: Voldemort is back - let's learn to prepare ourselves.

And you are right that a lot of this is about Harry's experiences and skills too. But that came later. The lure - what made them come in the first place, what came before the debate and conversation - is that Harry is the /boy-who-lived./ And he's claiming to have faced Voldemort again. People want to know him, and Hermione took advantage of that to give her the opportunity to actually do the actual pitch.

Yes, hear him out about his relevant experiences, and hear him tell the truth about Voldemort and why it's so important to do well in DADA and actually learn the spells. Hermione, being Hermione, expects a rational conversation, because everything she says and does is rational. She idoesn't expect them to put him on the spot the way they do, she didn't see the uncomfortable questions coming. If she herself asks questions, she sticks to facts. She didn't expect the personal, hurtful, intrusive questions, because it's so out of her way of thinking. If Hermione has one fault, it's an inability to realise that the way she sees the world is unique and she expects others to act the way she would act. She's often thrown when others act illogically - and that's evident here. What happened was not what she expected and was not what she /thought/ she had set up.

#+begin_quote
  People want to know him, and Hermione took advantage of that to give her the opportunity to actually do the actual pitch.
#+end_quote

Again, I think she gets that but she thinks they want to know him because they want truth and facts, not because they want juicy gossip. I don't think she intentionally exploited his fame, and I don't think the BWL factor occurred to her - what occurred to her is "Harry has seen this irl, and once they all realise that's the truth they'll want to learn from him." She doesn't realise others may see it as a chance to quiz a, for want of a better word, celebrity.

Re your original comparison with the Manipulative!Weasley fics, I think there's a difference between exploiting his /national fame because he's the BWL/, which Hermione categorically does not do (and someone in those kind of fics always does do) and realising that other Hogwarts students find Harry interesting (which I think she does do, but it's so separate from Harry Potter Famous BWL in her mind, because that's not how she sees him). I think she honestly thought he would make a short statement along the lines of "Voldemort is back and he's terrifying, but I keep beating him so listen to me kids here are some tips" and that would be that.

I don't think she was prepared for the morbid stuff about Cedric and I also don't think she quite realises, even after five years, who Harry is to the wizarding world, because to her he's just her mate Harry. Obviously she's objectively aware that he has fame, but she didn't grow up hearing about him the way the magic raised students did so in many ways she approaches it from a different perspective.

Basically, I don't believe she deliberately used his fame. She understands that people are interested in Harry, but she also knows he is the best at defence and damnit they should know that too because they all saw the Tournament... She's overly logical, and almost doesn't consider how others may react to something like fame, because for her it's not a factor. When she hears "I'd like to hear Harry's side," she interprets it as "I want to know the truth," whereas that person may have meant "I want to hear Harry dig himself into an even bigger hole" (definitely what Zak Smith meant, for example).

************* I do believe Hermione had all the good intentions you have written. It's just that I don't believe that those exclude that she used his notoriety as a hook. Her understanding that he is the best at defense does not mean that she doesn't get that he draws people to him whether or not he wants it. Considering that her pitch was literally "they just want to hear your story", she understands that his story has power. That is a very deliberate way to use his fame and notoriety to convince people to join her.

#+end_quote

I really disagree with this. She just got caught in Harry's fame the year before and suffered for it. And she exploited said fame again when she got Rita Skeeter to publish the article in the Quibbler. She had thorough discussions about his fame in 6th year. She knows of the ways the Wizarding world had glorified him and scorned him by turns. She was the one who stood by him through them.

Harry may just be Harry to her, but it does disservice to her character to claim that she has no clue about the Wizarding perceptions on her best friend. She knows more than anyone else exactly how famous he is. And she does so because she is an /outsider./ She had seen the effect of that fame on Harry, and she is removed enough from the situation to analyze objectively what this means for all of them. This is doubly true because her focus is on /Harry./

#+begin_quote
  Yes, hear him out about his relevant experiences, and hear him tell the truth about Voldemort and why it's so important to do well in DADA and actually learn the spells.
#+end_quote

You just agreed with me. That's exactly what I'm saying. Hermione is practically pimping out his story to convince them of Voldemort's rise. None of the people she invited were out for gossip either - just truth. It's still a pretty deliberate way of using Harry's fame even if she isn't selling him for gossip (where did I argue that???).

#+end_quote

Yes, I also agree that she didn't manage to calculate for people's ill-intentions (although Smith invited himself), but that's beside the point here. The point is that she understood people were interested in him, and then used that to gather them around for her to make her pitch. That she lost control of the conversation was a flaw in her plan, but it didn't make them gathering around to hear Harry's story any less her intention. Whether or not those people came for the truth or gossip, the fact is that Hermione all invited them to hear what Harry has to say.

Also, please just drop the comparison to Manipulative!_____ tropes. It was a joke. I don't think Hermione is or will ever be comparable to the characters in those fics.

Anyway, I'm done with this conversation. I offer an impasse. I can't convince you and you can't convince me. We interpret these scenes and their motivations too differently to reach a suitable compromise. It's been nice talking to you, but I'm leaving off.

** Huh? What DA operations did Hermione work on?

Harry wasn't just a figurehead and the main instructor. He was the leader and the /only/ instructor. The only other leader of the DA was Neville, who turned to Harry in DH.

#+begin_quote
  After all, she (and Ron) were the ones who taught Harry in 4th year.

No, OotP makes it clear Hermione was learning alongside the other members. Something along the lines of 'the only person who mastered the spells before Neville was Hermione.'

#+end_quote

Recruiting and motivating the instructor (Harry), recruiting the students (leveraging Harry's fame), organising the logistics (Protean-charmed galleons), ensuring security as far as practical (Parchment Jinx). That's what "operations" means.

She set Harry up as the leader because that fit her goals. Neville took over because none of the trio were there in DH. And, at the Battle of Hogwarts, they would have followed any of the trio's instructions, because the trio actually knew what needed to be done.

Hermione probably learned the Patronus Charm from Harry, but the rest of it? Like the post says, she'd learned all these spells at the same time as Harry, but then she and Ron spent all their time helping Harry actually master them.

She didn't 'set him up up' as leader. They voted on it. She asked him to teach because he was better at DADA than her. If Hermione was this manipulator she would've used Harry to advance SPEW.

The Third Task, GoF:

It was both. Hermione got everyone to come by leveraging Harry's name, then pushed for both the vote and Harry's candidacy (though Cho named him first):

#+begin_quote
  ‘Well, I've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and -- er --' He noticed a raised hand. ‘What, Hermione?'

  ‘I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione.

  ‘Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad.

  Harry's stomach did yet another back-flip.

  ‘Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed. ‘It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So -- everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?'

  She asked him to teach because he was better at DADA than her.
#+end_quote

Nobody disputes that. Harry's nonmagical talents---athleticism and nerve---allow him to punch significantly above his magical "weight" in combat.

#+begin_quote
  If Hermione was this manipulator she would've used Harry to advance SPEW.
#+end_quote

She tried. Got him to join and (I think) wear the pin and all. One can be manipulative and still fail. (Almost all Manipulative!Dumbledores do.)

I am not sure what the point of your quotes is. In GoF, Harry practices the Shield Charm, Hermione doesn't, instead helping Harry practice it by flinging spells at it, so Harry eventually masters it. In OotP, Hermione practices it with Harry's help, and masters it.

If organising a group around someone, and then setting up a vote to give him authority isn't setting someone up as a leader, I am not sure what is.

As for the second thing, OK, fair enough, they didn't /teach/ him those spells. They all /learned/ them together, and then they helped him /master/ them, and he repaid the favour in the following year.

The main point, though, is that Hermione didn't need to set up DA to master those spells; there were safer and more efficient ways she could get her practice done.

*** Hermione envisioned the DA, recruited the instructor and initial members, had them sign a contract of secrecy (without them realizing it), and then created the communication system they used to safely inform everyone involved. Harry was the instructor, but Hermione dealt with the operations that actually had the DA running and functional. Harry's the king, but Hermione was the prime minister.
