** He can, if Harry also had Riddle's and Dumbledore's early interest in academics and magical knowledge. Basically, if you mix canon Harry and canon Hermione you'd get Dumbledore or Riddle. Harry was purposefully handicapped by JKR because she wanted an every-man-hero rather than a magical Tony Stark.

** Agreed. I doubt that Voldemort at 60 is much more dangerous than he was at 18 already. If you look at the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel in OotP, what is there? Animation, animate transfiguration, conjuration, levitation, curses. All of it covered at Hogwarts. The only spell that isn't really within Hogwarts' curriculum (that we know of) is the unknown powerful spell that Dumbledore uses.

What makes Dumbledore and Voldemort dangerous is that they can execute this well-known magic quickly, powerfully, at scale, and in a sophisticated manner. It's not that they know secret, powerful spells. It's that they're so much better at the same magic everyone else knows. We know that talent is already fully established by the time they leave Hogwarts - contributions to scholarly journals while still students, showing examiners things they have never seen before, etc.

By way of example: any NEWT Transfiguration student could probably animate one of those statutes, but they'd probably need multiple attempts over maybe 30 minutes to do it, and probably its behaviour would be less sophisticated. Dumbledore can imbue a number of them with sophisticated behaviour at the flick of a wand.

So what's the difference between Voldemort at 18 and Voldemort at 60? Well, Voldemort at 60 has likely collected a wider array of obscure items of magic. But the utility of these skills is likely to be limited to niche applications. That's not to say they aren't powerful or useful (something like possession is definitely a powerful skill), it's just that they are narrow specialisms compared to the fundamentals laid down at Hogwarts which already cover 97% of the things you'd want to do with magic.

In a completely fair fight, would a 60 year old Voldemort beat an 18 year old Voldemort? Sure. He has a marginal advantage, but an advantage nonetheless. But it would still be a very close contest.

*** I feel like skill at magic and skill at dueling only partially intersect. My conception of dueling great relies on, for example, the ability to read your opponent, to guess what spell they're most likely to be attempting before they've even finished the first half of the wand movement so that you can instantly get the proper defence. This is the kind of talent which only years and years of practice would hone, no matter how great you were at any specific spells in a controlled environment.

For example, Nicolas Flamel is no doubt a very powerful wizard in the abstract, whose understanding of magic is equal to Dumbledore's --- they did scholarly work together, after all. Yet it does not seem that he participated in any of the Wizarding Wars. My interpretation would be that Flamel is good with spells but not so much with people.

By contrast, I once pondered that it would be thematically fitting for Lucius Malfoy not to be that powerful or knowledgeable a wizard /per se/, but sufficiently good at reading people to still be an asset in battle for the Death Eaters.

The truly top-rank duelists, naturally, are those who are both very attuned to their magic from the start, giving them a degree of "instinct" (i.e. Tom Riddle's uncanny control of wandless magic as a child); very good at reading people (young Riddle was famously charismatic; Dumbledore is a schoolteacher and a politician, and quite successful inboth capacities); and, of course, magically knowledgeable, with a full library of spells at their disposal (your "NEWT students know how to animate statues" is a fair point, but /Kwikspell/'s whole business plan relies on the fact that most Hogwarts graduates very quickly forget the bulk of what they learned for their NEWTs).

**** I think a major thing isn't inborn, having that inborn skill might help but a lack of hesitation that you get with experience is probably a bigger thing. Not flinching or worrying when a deadly spell comes your way, knowing what to do in a given situation, very good quick aiming under pressure., no unnecessary movements. That sort of thing. In my mind professional dueling is all about gaining and holding an advantage. Like trying to get your opponent off balance to slip a spell in. I think a story was called to reach without that had the MC doing a bunch of difficult training things to be better at dueling that I really liked.

** Dueling seems to be one of those areas where a lot of experience /is/ necessary, and unlike, say, chess where you can get this practice at home playing dozens of games a week, the nature of dueling is such that it would take rather more time to have enough experience.

/And/ you have to factor in that he would have to learn hundreds of spells. I've seen estimation that the average, adult wizard "knows" around a hundred spells, and is only really good at a dozen of them or two. Voldemort and Dumbledore know thousands and are the best there is at hundreds. And judging by what we see of Hogwarts's curriculum, it takes at /least/ a week to master most spells, though I imagine it'd get easier the more spells you already knew (learning patterns common to most Transfigurations/Charms, etc.).

And all that is without going into the fact that what we see of Harry in canon suggests he is an above-average wizard, but still nowhere near genius-level. Voldemort, on the other hand, could do wandless, wordless Unforgivables before he even learned Hogwarts existed.

**** It's not a matter of practicing /magic/; skill at Dueling, I believe, would take having a bunch of duels under your belt, to get good at vital skills like reading your opponent's movements, guessing what spell they're going to use next ahead of time, etc.

**** If you completely change Harry into a magical prodigy that can pick up spells on a whim, then have him trained by mad eye moody for a few years. Then it is possible 25 year old Harry would stand a chance. But most fics want this to Happen with Harry before he turns 17... it's completely illogical he could gain meaningful experience in deadly combat warfare and strategy and learn about all of magic in less than 7 years.

***** I'm going to disagree with the amateur statement. What's the difference between an amateur and a pro? Training, something Harry never got, and both Tom and Albus got a ton of. All it takes is one year and Harry could become the new Tyson, but he wasn't ever given a chance.

** Mate, I'm not debating the age. It's the experience level. Notice the words amateur.

Mike Tyson was an absolute freak though. If you had to make Harry Potter into a â€˜Mike Tyson' he'd need to be more powerful than Voldemort or Dumbledore and completely ruthless. Plus have style that's difficult to combat in some way.

** Think it's minimum 5-8 years of training to take on masters. It's not like Tyson started boxing at 19, it was 13. If Harry had started when he was young, would be possible to emulate. One year would be adequate for him to be a decent fighter and not get his ass kicked by run of the mill adults.

** Molly Weasley beat Bellatrix Lestrange. Nuff said.

If anyone says anything, it's complete head-canon. A simple housewife beat Voldemort's right hand.

Harry was dumbed down because of the plot. PIS(Plot Induced Stupidity) is a huge pet peeve with me, and is a huge reason why I hate Canon-Harry.
