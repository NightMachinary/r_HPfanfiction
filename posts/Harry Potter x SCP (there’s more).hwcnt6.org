Y'all want a challenge? No? Well too bad I'm giving one anyway, and it's a tough one. Google SCP 1762 and either read it or watch a video about it. Now imagine that that box was found first not by the foundation, but by Harry Potter as a young child. He manages to tell the inhabitants of fantasy about his life with the Dursleys and they manage to bring him through the box into fantasy. The rest is up to you, although I do recommend bringing other non-hostile SCPs into fantasy as well. Have fun!

*** Yeah that's one of the reasons I made this challenge. That broke my heart when it happened, but in fanfiction anything is possible, including Harry stopping such a thing from occurring!
