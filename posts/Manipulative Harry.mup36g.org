Any fics where Harry is the one who manipulates every situation he's in for his own gain?


** There's one where he manipulates a bunch of girls to get in their pants. But that might not be what you were after. :)

**** ... Dark Discoveries. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13084626/1/Dark-Discoveries]]

For the record, I'm not quite halfway through this and while what's gone on so far isn't crazy awful for non_triggered folks, I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU READ. This could turn into something horrible and I wouldn't know. Just making that clear. Smut with some shit you've probably seen at a Highschool beer party plus magic. YMMV.

****** No. Or none I've noticed. Seems like the smut is the entire plot.

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) features a highly manipulative Harry, especially in the first half of the story.
