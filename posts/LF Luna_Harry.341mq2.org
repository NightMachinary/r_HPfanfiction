That's a pairing that has always struck me as odd but fun to read. I've finished a few fics that featured the pairing but I've slept since then, don't remember the names.

I'm generally not an angst fan and prefer a more lighthearted story.


** Lighthearted, you say?

*** The only good Harry/Luna story ever written. I like it mostly because very little of it is sexual -- any story that overly sexualizes Luna is an immediate turn-off for me.

*** This fic at the beginning (like all Rorsh fics) is awesome but with the introduction of crazy!Luna makes me hate her. Luna written by Rorsh is one of the most hated characterization in HP fanfics for me. She is not cute, sexy or anything else she is massively annoying. The fic itself is a good time waster but the last ~15 chapters where very bad and it would have been so much better without crazy Luna.

**** Honestly it was rather amusing, Harry found an old porn mag hidden somewhere in his dorm and was shocked to see a younger Mrs. Weasley on one page. He told Hermione, who was also shocked and wondered if they should tell Mr. Weasley. Harry said I think he probably knows already... look at the next page.

** A list of recs for the pairing I posted in an earlier thread. Some are dark, but all avoid the majority of terrible fanon tropes that surround her character.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1500318/1/Luna-s-Year][Luna's Year]] by michelle-31a is the oldest of the lot. The world-building is nothing spectacular, but it's a neat little story with some interesting ideas and characterization.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5241798/1/Pathetic][Pathetic]] by A-Kubrick-Spent has a whole host of content and style issues, but there is a lot of good to say about its imagination. It's also the only take on a darker Luna I've ever found remotely engaging, but your mileage may vary. Not light-hearted.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] by enembee should not be read before reading its prequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By the Divining Light]]. If you haven't read them before, you should do so---not because of the pairing, but because they're two of the finest Harry Potter fanfics ever written.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=116462][Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Rift]] by Illyich follows a somewhat cookie-cutter template, but contains some rather compelling moments and ideas. One of the best pacifist!Luna characterizations, but it's not a light-hearted story.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au is simple but very intelligent fluff, and well worth reading despite being abandoned after 8,000 words.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help of a Seer]] by aealket is pretty good. He's got a few more Luna-centric fics but this is the only HP/LL one.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etigerman][TigerMan]]'s Runemaster and After Dark are both HPLL. His English isn't great but the quality is still better than most. Runemaster is much more lighthearted than After Dark, though I'm sure you could figure that out by reading the summaries.
