:END:
I remember that Harry is invited to teach at Hogwarts, he has two phonixes and becomes wrapped around his little sisters Fong. Does anyone know which fic this is off of a very vague description???


** i think i know what you're talking about.

two pheonixes one black one white harem with fleur and gabrielle delacour and some random vampire girl fights some big baddy (maybe voldemort i can't remember) on the hogwarts train.

i don't remember the name but maybe that can help you narrow it down
