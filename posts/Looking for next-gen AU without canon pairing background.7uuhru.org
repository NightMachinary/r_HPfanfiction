I find the idea of next-gen fics interesting. But for me neither Rowling's pairings nor her positive portrayals of Snape, Draco and Dumbledore made any sense. So I was wondering whether there were any fics that show the next generation at Hogwarts without having a Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny or Draco/Hermione background. And definitely without Harry's child being named Albus Severus. Please, no main pairing slash or Death Eater apologism. Otherwise, I don't care if it has a Harry/Hermione, a Harry/Lavender or a Hermione/Terry background, I take anything outside canon pairings and good Death Eaters.


** You know what would be cool, Harry/Tonks where their child has to deal with the pressure of being the son/daughter of two amazing aurors.
