I thought this would be a pretty fun idea. Very simple, all you have to do is ship as many HP characters as you can with other HP characters, but you can't use the same character twice. So, to those of you who regularly pair one character with several other characters, this may be a challenge for you. Three ways, four ways and the like are allowed, just to make things more interesting. Ideally, don't bother with characters that don't have much of an established personality at all, as that makes things a bit too easy.

So, for example:

Harry - Luna

Ron - Hermione

Draco - Ginny (I suddenly feel like I'm in 2002 again)

Dumbledore - Grindelwald

Voldemort - Bellatrix

Fred - Angelina

George - Katie Bell (kind of a blank slate, but I couldn't think of many others)

Cho - Cedric

Lavender - Colin

Snape - Mcgonagall (couldn't think of anyone else for him)

James - Lily

Sirius - Remus

Umbridge - Centaurs

** This reminds me of Portkey's shipping policy---H/Hr was compulsory and unbreakable, but you could also write and post James/Lily, Draco/Ginny, or Ron/Luna, because for whatever reason those were the Compatible Ships.

I'm guessing it was the same way for R/Hr and H/G sites, but were there pairing "rosters" like that for the other big pairings that wound up non-canon (i.e. all the Draco/Gryffindor ones)? I never visited any other pairing-specific archives.

**** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marlene_McKinnon][Marlene McKinnon]] was in the Order and died in 1981. In DH, the letter from Lily to Sirius mentioned that Peter seemed to be sad, and Lily thought that may have been due to Marlene's death. This implies that Peter and Marlene either had romantic feelings for each other (or unrequited) or they were friends. However, I've read fanfictions where Marlene and Sirius are paired up, and although not much is known about Marlene's character, she tends to be spunky and outgoing in most stories. The common pairing of Sirius and Marlene may be due to Sirius pointing her out in an old photo of the Order to Harry in the film version of OotP.
