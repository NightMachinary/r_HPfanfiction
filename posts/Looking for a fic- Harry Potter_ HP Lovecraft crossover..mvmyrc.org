:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I followed a link on here a few weeks ago to a story where Luna casts a spell that opens a portal to the realm of the Old Ones, or some other group of eldritch horrors while in the Great Hall.

Luna was trying to get a necklace back from a pair of bullies and Snape was being an ass about it.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
