Just a random silly thought I had earlier today.

Imagine if Harry was doing all sorts of wandless magical stuff, and nobody believed it even when they saw it happening, putting it down to their imagination, a hidden house-elf or other wizard doing tricks for him, their own accidental magic, a completely normal non-magical thing happening...

Also an option; Harry breaks out of Azkaban, but everyone treats it as a joke because 'it's impossible to break out of Azkaban' and his going around in public as himself gets him booked for 'causing a disturbance by impersonating a major criminal'.


** Why not top it off with 'Harry breaks out of Azkaban, but noone believes it because Harry held back in school and his grades are shit.'

** Self-delusions are really hard to read about when the reader knows what's bullshit and what isn't. Tends to be cringy.
