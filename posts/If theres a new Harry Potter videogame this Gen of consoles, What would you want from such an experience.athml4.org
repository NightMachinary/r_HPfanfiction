I vaguely recall some leaked footage of an alleged new game floating about twitter last year but its gone very quiet since. If the game is real what would you like to see that hasn't been done before in the other games from the series?

I have a vision for it being set in an era we are familar with and all the characters we know and love are around. As its hard to sell a Harry potter game without Harry potter so id think it'd be good if Harry and co are all around in the background while your character has their own orgional story going on. Having said that they could set a game in anytime peroid with all knew characters and i think it would still be great.

I'd hope the devs look at an rpg like Persona 5(also set in a highschool) and implement some ideas from there. Like having to really study, taking exams and maybe even getting a weekend job down in Hogsmeade in one of the shops for some extra galleons.

Maybe you join the dueling club or potions club in your spare time, maybe you help Hermione with her Spew club, Colin has a photgrahy club wnats photos of lost of Hogwarts locations, ghosts students creatures from teh forbbiden forrest or maybe Ron has a wizard chess tournament going, or you want to join the Quidditch team of your chose house and have to attend training and matches ect.

Then at night your character and party of friends sneak off to battle creatures and explore the forbbiden forrest where all the action and leveling up happens (maybe there are also hidden dunegons and portals to other places out in the forest feel its been an untapped location in pervious potter games anything could happen in the forest you coudl fight all manner of magical creatures or dark forces out there).

Also just steal persona or mass effects dating/romance system as we all love some shipping right? haha maybe your orgional female or male character tries to hit on ever npc they meet, maybe they are single the whole game or they bond with one of our other original party members...or can even pick up(or attempt to at least) characters we all know and Love(would need to get a bit AU here to allow for your guy or gal to be able to date soemone like Luna Harry Hermione...maybe Malfoy if your a slytherin Character haha)

Rest of the game is exploring Hogwarts going to lessons and typical stuff we've seen before but also being able to travel to hogsmeade and vist all the shops and so on, doing side quests for various people around the village? any of these half-baked ideas seem any good to anyone ahha?

Again what would you want too see in a new harry potter game?


** I don't want open-world, I don't want an MMO, I just want a good, old-school, linear RPG where you get to learn spells, have lots of quests where you talk to fully-realized classmates and professors, encounter magical creatures and artifacts, and unravel a sinister mystery.

I don't want Slytherins to automatically be evil, I don't want a janky combat system, and I don't want just a million fetch quests.

Think Mass Effect crossed with Skyrim. That's what I want.

What do you mean by that? Bethesda is still working on Elder Scrolls 6. That single-player IP never stopped being profitable for them, so they have no reason to abandon it.

I think the biggest annoyance would be the "mandatory" (ie quest giving) friends if you happen to dislike them. You can ignore the squadmates you don't like in Mass Effect, or the annoying followers in Skyrim. But that wouldn't work well in a school RPG unless the quests are a lot more dynamic than in most RPGs.

** A Persona-style engine where you actually go through events day-by-day (in game time), with plot events happening on specific days, sounds like it would be a pretty good fit in general.

** Yeah, I think the only way to make a Hogwarts-era HP game work is to make a Persona-esque half-RPG/half-boarding school simulator. Personally I'm a little cool on the idea of setting it during the book/movie era, because there's going to be a lot of clashing with canon and your character won't get anything particularly interesting to do since we know what happens in canon. Same thing for the romance angle, we know the dating histories of the trio and people like Malfoy, so it's a bit weird for your character be like "yo I totally dated Harry" despite us knowing that he's really only dated Ginny.

I think the leaked game, don't remember if it was from Rocksteady or some other dev, was set in the late 19th century, which I think was a great idea because gives a lot of room to explore the universe without stepping on Rowling's toes too much.

***** There's no perfect way to adapt HP magic to a video game, because there's no way to really account for the sheer breadth of magic spells there are while also conforming to modern gaming trends.

Sure you can use a sort of spell-slot mechanic where you cycle through spells like weapons and shoot them at enemies, but that fundamentally turns the game into Max Payne with wands instead of guns and some people might consider it lazy. A turn-based system can definitely account for all the spells you can learn, but it also can slow the flow of the game around and tbh turn-based combat isn't really in vogue anymore the way it was during heyday of JRPGs. You could also run the game like a classic CRPG with a party and semi-real time combat, but I don't know how you go about balancing combat mechanics when all of your party members are squishy wizards.

****** First, there is no reason everyone has to be squishy. Because I seriously doubt that Dumbledore is defenseless even though a single bullet would end him. Just instead of regular tanks he'd be a shield tank with lots of cover creation. The more offensive characters (Riddle, Bellatrix) would go for overwhelming with damage while regular characters would be cover and counter focused.

You would have to limit the spell repertoire for every character to 8, 10, 16 or 20 (8 and 16 for controllers), which gives you enough freedom but also an arsenal of 80 spells for a four player party.

Potions can be used for grenades, possibly even with gas mechanics like Verdun/Tannenberg or Battlefield 1. Bubblehead charm as gas masks. Transfiguration is about terrain manipulation (stone spikes, quicksand) and cover, or about NPC pets. Charms either about buffs and debuffs or healing. Herbology either about healing, aoe debuffs or traps.

That being said, the killing curse would hands down be the most effective spell, but that's canon. Even Bellatrix was taken down by a single hit. You'd have to gate it through long cooldowns or similar restrictions (or limit it to bosses).

******* The killing curse is a huge mechanical problem on its own: canonically none of the good guys use it, all of the bad guys use it to excess, and there are no restrictions to its ability to kill. Frankly, that just won't translate well at all to a video game. Unless there's a morality system attached to the game, your character most likely won't be able to use the killing curse, and basically handicapping the player against enemies that can one-shot them at any point is hardcore in a way that even the most punishing games of this era aren't. For all the memes about how difficult games like Dark Souls and Ninja Gaiden and Cuphead are; I've yet to see a game where nearly every enemy can one-shot you on a standard difficulty /and/ you aren't able to do the same to them.

Removing the killing curse entirely or putting restrictions on how often it can be used or what it can work on (a la Power Word Kill from D&D) requires a huge suspension of disbelief for anyone familiar with canon, and using it only on bosses seems like a good way to reduce all bosses to a shooting gallery until you manage to hit them with one. I suppose that you could set the game during a period of time where the killing curse is relatively unknown or hasn't been invented yet (has Rowling ever given us a date on that?), but the further back you go from canon, the less it'll have in common with the universe that audiences first fell in love with.

** Honestly, I don't foresee a quality HP game based around the trio or cannon story. It's too restrictive and there are too many problems with the idea of portraying the canon characters to everyone's liking.

What COULD be a good game however is one based around the "idea" of Hogwarts itself. It would HAVE to be a quality RPG based around 3 primary things:

1. Exploration of the school, grounds, and Hogsmeade.
2. Learning of Magic, Potions, and other such crafts.
3. Social interaction or relationship development.

Now obviously there is a 4th in terms of a "story" but that's implied in the fact its an RPG.

Now... 1 and 2 are fairly easy to do. The cannon world lays out the groundwork to build upon and it would NOT be hard to design around. If anything, it would be way easier than designing from scratch and magic itself does not really have to make perfect sense. It is magic after all. No... the hard one would be #3... social interaction or relationship development.

You have to be able to write and develop a quality social environment to begin with, which takes a truly talented studio and writers to do, but you also have to do it within the confines of a "school" environment. And that, ladies and gentleman, is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT without problems arising. Romantic entanglements? Realistic but these are school children so you really have to tread a careful line. Think of the issues with regards to anime and menga's when broaching such topics. Writing realistic children with realistic social interaction with each other? Extremely hard to do, especially for adults looking back on such things without bias or misunderstanding. These and so much more in my view make it unlikely to ever happen.

The best we would likely get would be a "wizarding world" RPG that takes elements of cannon and develops an entirely new story but from the adult perspectives. Of course, that's less likely to draw in as many fans or players because it's not within the "confines" or "context" of the books.

** Basically I want an Elder Scrolls: Hogwarts. That is to say, open world RPG with a main quest line that follows the major plot events of the story and a bunch of different side quests. Make, customize, and name your character, then just have an endless amount of things to do and interactions to be had.

Vanilla start would be you getting your letter, creating your avatar, then going to Diagon Alley where you can do a bunch of side quests while gathering school supplies and meeting familiar faces along the way. From there, do whatever, just like Skyrim.

Sorting Hat would be like an internet quiz, but a lot deeper and more scientific so that you couldn't just choose "I would be cunning and ambitious" if you were trying to get Slytherin. You could choose other factions, like loyalty to Dumbledore's Army or the Death Eaters.

Classes would allow you to level up attributes like a perk tree that would make spells stronger, last longer, effect a wider area, etc. There would be books lying around with lore friendly content that you could read and store in your living space (dorm room, family home, Malfoy Manor if you're a Death Eater). Some would also increase your skill.

Instead of races, you would have genetics. Pure-blood, half-blood, muggleborn, maybe some half creatures like half giant or half Veela, all with their own strengths and weaknesses in different areas of magic and combat.

Speaking of magic and combat, that would be played like a fighting game. As in, you would have to input certain combinations to get different spells, and the more complex the spell, the more complex the combos. There would be a screen that kept track of all of them as you learn them, of course, but being able to memorize them would make gameplay a lot more challenging and immersive, not to mention more streamlined.

Are you honestly still reading this? Holy shit, good on you, mate...

You would start out with a certain amount of money and doing favors for teachers, classmates, and shopkeepers would let you earn money which could then be spent in shops or buying small items from your classmates, like a few of their ingredients for potions class if you're missing the required items or some prank items from Fred and George. Food and drink would give you health and stamina, prank items would work on just about any NPC, with different consequences to be discovered depending on who you use them on.

I could go on and on, as I've thought about this so very much...but you get the gist, I'm sure.

** I want to be able to be a bad person or a bully and for it to have reprecussions. For example, in school, I bully a guy and am a dick to him. Later, I'm in danger and he's the only person around and i ask for help but he leaves me there because I was a dick. Tldr; actions have consequences and actions shape relationships

Choose a romantic partner and sexuality, but have it as background or optional.

Explore magic like being a metamorphmagus (that would be so fun) or an animagus

Explore spells that arent in canon.

Have quests where you play pranks and generally have fun. I want it to seem like a school

Optional quidditch

Character customization, like appearance, height, clothes, house.

People wear robes, not mismatching blazers over wooly jumpers and shitstain brown pants like in the movies. Basically normal clothes for the nineties (please tell me no one actually dressed like that in the 90s)

Diagon Alley like in the books

Maybe have some set after hogwarts, like if your character joins the Order in the First war.

Marauder Era.

(Long list, I know.)

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk

***** 'Bully' was game about this kid being shipped off to the worst boarding school in america and having to survive all the different factions of 'nerds' 'preps' 'bullies' 'jocks' and 'greasers'. it followed a full school year and had you going to classes and also exploring the nearby town fighting people off with hand to hand brawler style combat, riding about on a bike or skateboard hitting people with a sling shot all very denis the meance a great game. Persona is a JRPG about japanese highschoolers fighting various forces of evil. while also going to class hanging out doing everyday silce of life things as well... both have many elements that should be stolen for a harry potter game imo.

** Considering that NextGen is rumoured to at least be announced next year I doubt it'll be for this generation, and honestly I'd rather them work it over for a fully realised NextGen release than to rush it for a late CurrentGen release. Though considering it looked as if it was at least at a Beta level, it could be that it will be a late gen release with a nextgen port.

​

As for it's setting , it looked to me as if it was Victorian era, though I think there was an estimate that narrowed it down further based on the cut of their clothes. But that can easily be chalked up to as Wizarding fashion/ something else.

** My ideal HP game would be:

- Story driven RPG with a custom fully voiced character set post Epilogue at Hogwarts

- Covers all 7 years, with branching paths

- Main story is about breaking the statute of secrecy and the rise of Neo-Grindelwallism

- Third person camera ARPG

- Fully fleshed out sideplots, including romance

- For solving the menu clutter problem, split the shortcuts into parents:childs. So you'd have battle magic as the parent shortcut then fire magic as a second level shortcut, and then all the spells for that. So on a keyboard you'd press 1 (select battle magic), 1 (sub cat fire), 0-9 (specific spell). This would allow around 1000 spells to be shortcutted.

Or, if this game is made by Capcom:

- It's Resident Evil but with Harry Potter

- You have spells instead of weapons

- You fight inferi and dementors

** Just a straight remake of the Chamber of Secrets for Gameboy Color.

However, they /have/ to make the flowers quest in McGonagall's office as equally vague and unclear, so that you're constantly grinding up versus the older students in the Dueling Club because you have no idea how to advance the story and this is the only other thing you can do in the game.

It was a 10/10 experience the first time around, for sure.

But nah, for real? I'd be good with a canon rehash, maybe with a party system, and give the characters bonuses in certain stats and skills, and special abilities.

Give Ron a Berserker state, that activates when one of his friends get hurt, increasing his attack speed and attack power for a brief time.

Give Harry a passive dodge ability, allowing for him to dodge spells easier than other characters.

Give Hermione the ability to learn/master spells easier than other characters.

That kind of thing.

*** I'm fairly certain it was Rocksteady, not Rockstar. While Rockstar has made school-inspired games like Bully before, I doubt they'd be interested in making a game that didn't involve robbing and shooting people in some capacity nowadays.

Edit: That, and going from set, usually mid-30s-to-early-40s, male protagonists to a teenager whose characteristics are determined in a character creator is a huge deviation from Rockstar's wheelhouse.
