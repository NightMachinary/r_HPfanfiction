The first one that I can remember is linkffn(The Darkness Within by Kurinoone). Hasn't aged that well, looking back on it; but when I first read it, it (along with its sequels) was like gold to me. Of course, it was rewritten - and the rewrite is infinitely better than the original - but I'll always remember this one as the first that I ever read.


** I tried to read Methods of Rationality, I really did. But I gave up before I'd even caught up to where the story was updating. All talk, no action, and enough pretentiousness to fill a Seattle coffee shop.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** Hmmmmmmm... I know I started reading HP fanfic in my early teens, while waiting for Order of the Phoenix to come out... it was after I'd devoured the first four books within a couple of weeks and wanted more Hogwarts, and the only way to get more Hogwarts was with fanfic...

But what was the FIRST?

I remember two fics very distictly, not sure which one was the first. And one of them wasn't really a fic, it was basically the HP characters answering the old "why did the chicken cross the road" question... I especially remember Aunt Marge's "If the chicken can talk that easily about crossing the road, it's clearly not being hit by cars enough," which I thought was amusing.

The other fic was actually a fic. A one-shot fic about the Weasleys, more specifically about the time three-year-old Ron broke Fred's broomstick and Fred turned his teddy bear into a spider. I don't even remember which site it was on... it wasn't FF.net, I know that much... Here I only really remember one scene; it was Ron sneaking out to borrow Fred's toy broom and telling Baby Ginny that he was only doing it because Fred refused to share... and Baby Ginny responding by sucking her thumb.

Haven't found either of these fics again, but they were the first.

The first LONG fic was "The Very Secret Diary" by Arabella, on The Sugar Quill. The fic's been taken down from there now for some reason, but it's been reposted by other hands on FF.Net and AO3. linkao3(2345300)

I was more familiar with AO3 so I started there with a search and sort by kudos and this story had the most (and still does). Its a good one shot but upon further reading I discovered I don't like romantic involvement in my HP stories as I'd rather have Harry too busy saving the world than feeling squishy about someone.

However, the first exposure I had to HP fanfic was a crossover from the Sherlock Holmes universe linkAO3(466922) You are a Paradigm. I loved Sherlock Holmes/hp crossovers because the interplay between illogical magical Britain and Sherlock's kind of intellect was amusing.

I am a voracious reader so I have blown through hundreds of hp stories since then.

** I think it was A Cadmean Victory however, if I remember correctly at one point in the story I got tired of the Harry/Fleur romance and stopped reading it. I did finish it but not until awhile later.

** The first "fics" I read were those Quizilla quizzes that would give you long-winded descriptions of your appearance and what boy from Hogwarts you would end up marrying, along with what /all/ your friends thought and how many kids you'd have.

** The Good Morrow. But I have no idea if it was on ffn or some other site. One of the best Marauder era fanfics that I have ever read. If you can find it, I highly recommend it.

** I think the first one that made an impact on me and the first one that I really remember reading was BajaB's Fugitives of Azkaban. Either that, or Niger Aquila's Friend or Foe series.

BajaB is really a wonderful writer, his fics all aged really well (I go back to Fugitives from time to time and has since read more of his other works), and he's so prolific and creative.
