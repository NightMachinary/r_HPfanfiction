A month back or so I read this fanfic posted by an author but later realized that he/she was plagiarizing fanfics that haven't been updated in a long time. One of the fanfic he/she plagiarized was about how Ginny died during the war and Harry was depressed and wished upon a shooting star either Ginny would be alive or have a different life. Later he wakes up in a cemetery where he is in a whole new dimension where James, Lily, Sirius (married to a Veela with children), and Remus is alive (Nevile is the Boy-Who-Lived and the Longbottoms are arrogant). Harry later finds out that he is bonded with Sirius' daughter and Fleur.


** You are talking about Silveraegis' Harry potter & The New Life, which is kinda infamous for spawning 'fanfics' of its own. (Though they usually are copy paste with some minor changes.)

Anyway, the original is deleted but if you google that title you are going to get some off-shots of the story. I think I can dig up a couple as well so if you can't find them feel free to ask.
