** i'm currently writing one where multiple characters are trans, centered around Harry as a trans guy. very AU, features good!Petunia in flashbacks, mentor!Snape, a Dumbledore who tried to go after the Horcruxes on his own, and a Slytherin trio. currently on hiatus due to life stuff, won't be updated until around the 18th. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18572623/chapters/44025565]]

i'm also writing a series where a universe-hopping transmasc genderflux OC is sent to the HP universe to change canon and save lives, presumably by a government organization. will probably not be updated until early next month. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19790743/chapters/46853581]]

Unassuming Hufflepuff is a crossover with The Mummy, featuring an transmasc nonbinary OC. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17267996/chapters/40608752]]

The Wizarding World is a character study of Hermione coming out as a guy; this is a personal favorite of mine. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/259218]]

Session Transcripts includes Hermione as a trans boy struggling with his mental health. i have mixed feelings on this fic, but overall i like the representation. this fic does contain many common triggers, particularly talk of dysphoria, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and physical abuse. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/270848/chapters/427550]]

there was also one fic called "to rediscover the boy you lost" about trans!Draco but i can't find it rn. i think it might have been taken down, which is a shame bc i liked it- nearly all the characters were LGBT+ in one way or another, and it had a very realistic depiction of mental illness. to be fair, it was very obvious that the fic's version of Draco was a self-insert for the author to work through their own issues, but it was a good read.

in addition- although i don't have any bookmarked rn- there are quite a few fics out there with Remus and sometimes Sirius as transmasc. try going on AO3 and filter using the tag "Trans Male Character."

  For as long as he could remember, Ron had always been a boy. The problem was, he had the name and body of a girl. He knew that he wasn't Veronica Weasley, first girl and second youngest of the seven Weasley children. But how could he convince his family and his friends of that when, even when he tried to tell them, they always reassured him that he was, in fact, a girl?
