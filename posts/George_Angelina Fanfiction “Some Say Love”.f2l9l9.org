Alright, although I've had reddit for a while I'm new to actually using it...so please let me know if I should change/add something.

Does anyone know where I can find the George/Angelina fic called “Some Say Love” by Araminta Lupin? It was written probably around 10 years ago on fanfiction.net. Idk if the author removed the story or if the site did, but I haven't been able to find it for years.

Here's the kicker though - I fortunately saved it to my computer, EXCEPT for the epilogue chapter. It's killing me that I don't have the full story. It's my favourite fic I've ever read, especially for a less commonly written about pairing.

Any help would be so very appreciated. Thanks and mucho love Potterheads <3


** Was there an epilogue at all? If you have FF.net ID#, you can try [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]] it often caches things which were taken down.

*** There was an epilogue! I remember when I went to read the story again (when it was still online) only that chapter was missing. I downloaded what was left and eventually the whole story disappeared.

I gave the site a try but no luck :( But thank you so much for commenting!
