Like, Kreacher was Harry's house elf, why didn't he just call him to bring them food and supplies? It's already known that house elf's can Apparate through tough wards, they could have been dining like kings the whole time, but no! They starved instead ðŸ˜‚ I blame SPEW

**** Still, Kreacher lived and was born into a household Slytherin to the core. I wouldn't trust him for a second, there are ways to get around the fact that you can't disobey what someone says. Remember what happened with Sirius?

** 1. Harry under the Polyjuice Potion goes to Gringotts and pulls substantial amount of money converted to Pounds from his account.
2. They settle somewhere in the Muggle Britain (or outside of it, Channel Islands, Northern Ireland, or even elsewhere), and use some rented Muggle house as a base.
3. Profit!

** Of course it would have made more sense, but J.K. Rowling wanted a plot where Harry ended up wandering in the wilderness for a long time. Rowling is an amazing writer overall, but her plots are terrible. Generally the answer to "why didn't they just do the rational thing" is "because J.K. Rowling would have found that inconvenient." My advice is to not expect the book plots to make that much sense. Logical plots are for fanfiction.

*** Rowling is a story teller. A great one. The downside to that is she doesn't seem to have much (if any) interest in the world she creates beyond serving a purpose to the story she want's to tell. I feel like us on this subreddit are one of the few fandoms that have to actually fight the canon head-on simply to get it to make some sort of sense. And we still can't do it properly.

** Harry isn't exactly a smart person. He also tries to grab letters from the air, runs headlong into danger the moment McGonagall ignores him, gets Lockhart to help instead of a teacher he actually knows is competent, forgets that simply pulling up Malfoy's sleeve could've saved him so much bother in fifth year, chains an animagus who he knows can turn into a far smaller thing, ignores and forgets about Sirius' mirror, etc etc. The kid is an utter moron most of the time who only survived because of luck, stubbornness, passive suicidal ideation, and other people leaping in front of the metaphorical bullets that come at him throughout the series.

I have no explanation for Ron and Hermione. But Harry is an idiot throughout. Not thinking of Kreacher and Dobby is just another fuck-up on a long, long list.

*** That is what makes Harry relateable. It is the big difference between Harry being a Harry Stue (very annoying to read about) and a normal teenager. Normal teenagers do plenty of dumb shit and Harry is no exception. He has his bright moments, but like the rest of us mortals he flounders through life more often than not.

In hindsight it is easy to look at the books and say "this is stupid", but I am sure most people can think about dumb shit that they did a while back and would do differently given the chance.

**** I mean, I wasn't saying he wasn't relatable or realistic or whatever. Just an idiot. Whether that's a good or bad thing is relative to each reader. I think it's a bad thing, you think it's a good thing. We're both right, and we're both wrong. There's canon and fanon alike to support and criticise both points.

Personally, I prefer my heroes to be better than me, not worse. I want them to be people I want to be like, not people I'd abhor being like.

But either way, my point was Harry being an idiot doing nonsensical things and making things harder for himself and others is not an out of character thing. No explanation needed, it's just who he is. Fools rush in, and he is a Gryffindor through and through.

**** I disagree about him being relateable. He is relateable if you look at him in a void, sure. Average teenager and all that. But once you factor in everything that's thrust on him, his life, his upbringing, literally everything going on in his life, he is ridiculously unrelateable. There is a reason highly proactive indy Harry fics are so popular in the fandom even though they are all essentially the same, trope filled story.

** My explanation would be that they feared some death eater would grab Kreacher as he tried to disapparate. But Dobby was still available. But then, they saw Ted Tonks use accio to get salmon and never tried it themselves. It's so frustrating when it's obvious that something is done just for the sake of more drama.And I suppose the excuse is that it's a kids' book. But then again, I read CoS at the age of 12 and Harry's choice to go to Lockhart made no sense to me even then.

** Would you trust him?

I mean, if someone who was forced to do your every command also +hated+ despised you, then he'd try to find the most loopholes he could!

It is extremely hard to say something that is loophole proof.

Did Harry say not to kill me anyone i love? Then talk to someone else, and give them the means to kill, but not actually kill.

Did Harry say not to help any person to try to kill me or anyone I love? Then get a troll to do it for you!

You can see what I mean, Kreacher will do anything in his power to kill, or at least give a horrible suffering to harry and freinds.
