** I saw this recommended a couple of days back and I ended up finishing the fic and its two sequels over the weekend (around 300k words total)

​

linkao3(The Changeling by annerb) has a great Slytherin Ginny. We don't see much of Ginny in canon but whatever we do see of canon's Ginny applies to annerb's Ginny. I'd say the Changeling is a kind of Bildungsroman and we see a lot of complex characters. The story is subtle but also light, if that makes sense. It's a great read if you want to read about a well rounded Ginny. The author tackles complex topics with sensitivity. I absolutely loved it. Mild bit of romance involved.

​

Also, Shifts and Shades by Fernwithy are great fics. Shifts focuses on Remus during OoTP and Shades on Tonks during HBP. Fern uses canon to create a compelling story, and they're almost canon compliant as well. The stories are generally light, even though some serious topics are dealt with and some very flat canon characters come to life.

​

Edit: The more I think about it, Shifts and shades are gems which aren't recommended enough.

** Fanfic authors who /are/ published exist. At least one of the individuals (astolat) who started AO3 is both. Some authors evidently enjoy writing fanfic in order to practice aspects of the craft such as characterization, mood, or what have you. Or they're fans and just enjoy it. That said, I can think of several “masterpiece”-level fanfics, of which several are outside the HP fandom, or are slashfics.

These masterfics are incredible given the payoff for the fanfic writers, aren't they? I have lately been perusing gen fic in HP because I can't stand most canon pairings, and I want to read about Harry, and magic.

A few recs---forgive any formatting errors, please! Not my forté.

1. I recently finished reading this fic, which is gen, and which I thought was amazing. A ritual is performed prior to leaving 15-month old Harry with the Dursleys:

souls touch and the future changes by sunmoon&stars- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736]]

1. Beautifully written, Weasley-centric- The Invisible Son by RaeWhit [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23260]]

2. The Skitterleap by enembee [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap]] AU. In a world run by Grindlewald, Harry Potter seems to fit in, perfectly. Novel length, reads like a spy story.

3. You Can Leave This House, Leave This Town by sciathan file (at LiveJournal)

[[https://sciathan-file.livejournal.com/69180.html]] Canon-compliant, post DH deathfic ; lovely.

1. By the author FalconLux, WIPs worth reading:

   The Many Faces of Harry Potter [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5924716/chapters/13626331]]

   The Power of a Well-Organized Mind [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5924716/chapters/13626331]]

**This author is incredible. Her ideas, her writing, is exemplary and wonderful. She never seems to finish anything, but what she's written is terrific and unique.

Finally, this fic has a huge following, though I haven't read much of it---So it's not my personal rec, but more a fandom rec:

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]

I could rec so many more! These are examples of stories that I consider to be as well-written as published fiction.

** I've recc'd these a few times on here but currently re-reading If Spring Ever comes for the dozenth time. I'm copying my post from [[/r/HPRomione][r/HPRomione]] so my descriptions are a little biased towards their relationship. Enjoy!

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=191950][After the Summer Ended]] was published pre-Deathly Hallows. The story centers around Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they Horcrux Hunt. For a story written before Deathly Hallows was published, I am amazed at how accurate the author's predictions are. Honestly, it's the Deathly Hallows I always wanted because it featured my favorite ship +rather than so many pages on wand lore+. Spoilerin this story Ron and Hermione get married super fast which is 100% my headcanon and what I wanted in DH anyway

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=207276][Winter of the Dark Witch]] is the sequel to After the Summer Ended and features the gang all grown up with AU!children heading off to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione running a pub all the while getting up to the same shenanigans with Auror Potter. Ron and Hermione's son is a major character to this story and he is written like a proper child while adding value to the plot. This story only makes sense if you've read After the Summer Ended and is the most cannon deviant, but an absolute delight.

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] takes place after the Battle of Hogwarts and the year following as Harry, Ron, and Hermione start jobs at the Ministry. Admittedly this is my least favorite of all of the stories. I love all of the Ron/Hermione parts, but the plot feels secondary to the relationship development and honestly, the main plot gets downright confusing at times. There's also time travel which I think is my, personal biggest gripe and caused some timeline issues making the story longer than it strictly needed to be. It does have a proper, well written, in character Draco redemption arc (if you're into that kind of thing).

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=261260][If Spring Ever Comes]] is by far *my favorite piece of fan fiction of all time*. If you read nothing else, then take the time to read this one. In this story, Ron has to go away on a secret undercover mission and of course, Hermione figures it all out. It features an overprotective Ron (and Hermione) who miss each other desperately. Bonus, the Weasley family keeps trying to get them back together (with almost no one thinking they're broken up).

It is a sequel to The Onset of Autumn but it's not strictly necessary to read Autumn first understand the plot. The essential points would be that Ron/Hermione got married less than six months after the battle, Draco had a girlfriend who died and therefore became his motivation to assist Harry, and Hermione worked at the ministry for a year before finishing her NEWTS.

​

Aside from Winter of the Dark Witch, every story can all be read independently.

*** Is it really worth the read? It seems such a big AU at first glance. Also both Cho and Cedric are a bit meh in the canon, so are they better fleshed out here? I'm assuming they're simply replacing the trio, somehow. Is Voldemort alive? Is he the antagonist ? Convice me to read this, please. I'm in need of something good.

**** I'll be honest: it's pretty dead at this point, but it's worth the read and there's a slightly better version of it on DLP.

It's not that big of an AU and what's in the summary doesn't drag out. Canon characters are pretty similar to what they are in the series. The Harry here is what he'd be if he'd been raised by people who cared and/or had friends who weren't misfits. Essentially, he's curious, proactive, and confident.

Yes, Cedric and Cho are fleshed out and the twins get a little more shine. I can't remember Neville here, but Luna, Hermione, Ron, and Draco aren't left out.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

****** What's wrong with being kid's books? It's what they are, and it's what they do well. Nobody faults the Hobbit for the lack of detailed breakdown of economy of the Shire, but JKR is often blamed for being not adult enough, and I just don't understand it. There are many adult books that deal with very adult issues, some of them even written by JKR herself. But it's not what Harry Potter is about. And fanfiction is not automatically better for adding more realism, sex and violence.

******* There's no problem that Harry Potter franchise being a children's series. In fact, that's what makes Harry Potter so popular. The problem is with later books when JK Rowling tried to turn her children's books into young adult novels while still trying to stick to a children's tale. I mean as I grow up, the later parts of Harry Potter leaves a lot to be desired. JK Rowling tried to make the last few books more adult, but it just wasn't adult enough.

You can dislike it personally, but it's not the books' shortcoming that JKR didn't go with more realistic perspective. HP books are not without their faults, but it's definitely not one of them for me.

*********** I think it's mostly marketing. Coming of age means they have to be open about killing their enemies so no crap about Harry using expelliarmus on Stan (specially since Harry killed Quirrel by the age of 11) or the Hogwarts defenders seemingly using stunners in battle.

It also means the older teenagers are starting to have sex (at least some of them) and discussing it openly. But how many parents would buy their 9 years old girl "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" if it includes scenes of Hermione asking Harry advice as to whether have sex with Krum or not?

******** It's not great as a children's series either, to be honest. It's beloved bc it was part of most of our childhoods and the worldbuilding is fantastic, but it's not a good piece of literature.

Character development ranges from minimal to nonexistent. It's a study in the importance of showing vs telling. Characters are either woefully incompetent or unbearably stupid. And it really is unrealistic in terms of character actions because she chose to stick with her plot.

**** Is that how you feel about all hobbies? People can be talented at something but not want to make a career of it. "Making money off it" isn't the point for a lot of people, including the good writers. The idea that selling your fiction is the measure of your talent has really taken hold since the monetary success of craptastic bestsellers like 50 Shades of Grey, or Cassandra Clare's career as a YA author. But for decades, fandom's been a place for amateurs to share their work without angling for a publishing contract, and yes, some of those fic writers are so good I do actually wish they'd write professionally.

But a lot of them do this for the fun of it and for love of the source material. You could say they lack ambition, but it doesn't reflect on their abilities at all.
