:END:
I've read Accidental Animagus (and gave up part way through Animagus at War), and the one where Harry becomes and grows up as a kneazle.

I may have read others that I don't remember, but any recommendations would be most welcome! Thanks.

Edit: I apologise for posting this request so many times, it kept saying "response is null" so I tried again, and then it posted them all at once! Sorry, I'm not very adept at using Reddit, I just want fic recommendations üòÖ


** The Accidental Animagus was created as a reaction to older linkffn(The Natural Animagus by wsbenge), because White_Squirrel thought the idea is great but the execution poor (series of podcast episodes about The Accidental animagus starts at [[https://potterficweekly.com/archives/1785]]). I tend to agree.

  Harry is sent to the Dursleys, but due to a natural proclivity for cat animagus transformations, goes to live with the kneazles at Mrs. Figg's a few weeks before he is 2 years old. He spends years as a kneazle, before his association with Ginny Weasley h

**** I think the animagus story is really incredibly difficult to write. Animals are not humans, and you as the author are balancing on the side of very unpleasant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley][uncanny valley]]. You make the hero to much animal-like and the result is just weird (which happened to The Natural Animagus in my opinion). The same problem happens to many Remus-centric stories, where his werewolf nature makes him too much wolfish and the result is strange.

White_Squirrel seemed to keep Harry intentionally mostly unaffected in his personality (and he had him in his animal form just for few months in his early childhood, perhaps because of this), and the result is a way more persuasive.
