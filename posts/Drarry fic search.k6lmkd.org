Hi I'm looking for 2 Drarry fics I read a long time ago. The first one was where Harry lost his memories and was admitted to St Mungo's. He saw Draco and thought they were dating. Draco went along with it and Harry remembered but pretended he didn't. Draco got angry and then Blaise tricked him so he and Harry ended up together.

The second fic is where Draco and Harry where in a relationship in their 6the year but with the war Draco cast a memory charm on Harry so that he wouldn't remember. Ron and Hermione knew though. Also Harry hooked up with Ginny but they broke up. Drarry is the end pairing. Thanks.
