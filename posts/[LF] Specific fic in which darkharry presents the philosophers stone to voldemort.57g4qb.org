Hey there,

I'm looking for this dark!Harry fic I read a while ago, and I just can't remember the name. I think it was the typical 'Voldemort is Harry's guardian' formula with lots of bashing in between. Anyway, he gets the stone at the end of year 1 and manages to pull wool over Dumbledore's eyes saying it was destroyed. He then later presents it to his 'father' Voldemort at a Death Eater gathering or banquet or something like that.

Thanks in advance!


** IIRC the story you're thinking of is Linkffn(A Dark Lords Rising)

  The Dark Lord made a very different choice on Halloween of 1981, and with it he may have brought the very destruction to the light that they so rightfully feared. Now Harry is growing under the training of Lord Voldemort in order to avenge his parents deaths to the proclaimed leader of the light...Albus Dumbeldore. HarryXDaphne
