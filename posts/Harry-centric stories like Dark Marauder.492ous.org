So, I just finished reading linkffn(4586362). Loved the story and its premise.

I was wondering if there are any fics with a Dark!Harry which could be considered sequels (obviously there wasn't a sequel to it) but sequels in the sense that the Marauders were also Dark and he was raised by them instead of the Dursleys. Or even if he ends up similarly Dark the way the Marauders are in that story.

Essentially, I liked the idea of it, and would have loved the read a sequel to it, but since there's nothing like that, I'm looking for the next closest thing.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
