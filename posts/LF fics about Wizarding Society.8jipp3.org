I would love a new fix to read that focuses on Wizarding society, especial responsibilities of Noble Houses or religion.

I like long and prefer completed but short and sweet is fine.

I have a soft spot for Dumbledore bashing but it's not required and it doesn't have to be Harry-centric at all.

I do not enjoy time travel or gender bent character but no hang ups on pairings or slash as long as it's well written.

Thank you guys!

(First time posting here, I hope i did it right)

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
