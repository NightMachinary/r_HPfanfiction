Honestly, I really don't get the 'Umbridge gets gangraped by centaurs' thing. First of all, centaurs see themselves as superior to humans. Why would they lower themselves by having sex with one they see as below them? Second of all, if anything *Grawp* would be a better candidate for the act, simply because he's too dumb to think otherwise. He's too dumb to think, period.

Actually, maybe that was a bad thing to type out loud. Please don't link any Grawp/Umbridge fics. Please don't /write/ any Grawp/Umbrige fics.

Anyways, I have another headcanon where a pigeon eats the Resurrection Stone.


** My favourite headcanon is that the reason Knockturn Alley has such a dark almost perpetual twilight such as depicted in the movies (and to a lesser extent the books), is to help accommodate nocturnal and light-sensitive Sentients such as vampires and hags. While this part isn't strictly offscreen per say as it is drawn from onscreen visuals, my secondary theory in the same vein is.

The White Wyvern Pub (as found in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, at Universal Orlando Resort) is a headcanon location for me as it ties into my previous headcanon by serving as a floo hub and entry point for such species in a similar vein as The Leaky Cauldron does Diagon Alley.

Additionally, a popular service offered that is unique to Knockturn is "Day Couriers", people who will wander out into Diagon Alley to shop on such species behalf for a commission allowing such species to never risk leaving the comfort of the shadows.

*EDIT:* Figured I may as well throw a few more into the mix. So I subscribe to the fanon/headcanon of there being a Horizont Alley that intersects Diagon Alley at certain points but my personal headcanon takes it a step further.

In my mind there used to be a Vertic Alley which was a warren of underground caves and passages snaking downwards from Diagon Alley that once catered to the Light Sensitive Sentients, unfortunately the Goblins took it as a base camps during one of their rebellions and in the subsequent peace treaty the Ministry was forced to cede the territory. The Goblin Nation used this base camp, known as Gringotts in their tongue as a starting point and then further expanded it into the warren that currently houses the vaults of Gringotts Bank.

Incidentally, the bank was named Gringotts as a subtle reminder and threat as well as a slap in the face of the Ministry at the time. Knockturn Alley was founded to replace the lost services of Vertic Alley and the rest was history.

*2^{nd} EDIT* This Thread hasn't stopped ticking over in the back of my mind so here's another couple I wanted to get out of my head so it'd stop bugging me when I'm meant to be doing a Psychology Paper:

'House Elves' aren't actually 'Elves' and were never previously named as such, rather they are what the myths of Brownies and other similar household spirits are based on and used to be called such. It is actually the muggle-borns who brought the misconception of them being "Elves" over from the muggle world into wizarding culture after many a young child likened them to "Santa's Elves".

Additionally, many of the older pureblood lineages from the continent actually look down on the British Purebloods for there adoption of muggle vernacular in regards to things that traditionally had a wizarding name and significance: House Elves (as opposed to Brownies etc.), Halloween and Christmas (instead of Samhain And Yuletide), etc, etc.

** One theory of mine is that the three Hallows are similar to the One Ring from LOTR in that they are always ~trying~ to reunite. So even though Harry dropped it in the Forbidden Forest, some other student or traveler will stumble upon it, and it will gradually find it's way back to society. The Elder Wand does the same thing, but more directly - its very power causes it to constantly change hands. The cloak does this differently - it doesn't want to leave the Peverell line, as Death has recognized the youngest brother as wise. Thus, it merely protects the Peverell line, and waits for the other two Hallows to come to it.

** I have a headcanon that there are two breeds of merpeople and that there are salt water and fresh water merpeople (like crocodiles) the fresh water breed is the ones in the lake and the salt water are more like the ones we usually think of when we think of mermaids. I think this because of the stained glass window in the prefects bathroom, I never understood why you would have art of a pretty mermaid if they knew what they already looked like, especially when they haven't been shown to take artistic license with anything else, so it just seemed out of place to me.

*** As far as I know this is totally canon except there is more than just 2 species (Three confirmed subspecies with vague reference to the possibility of more existing); the ones that inhabit the black lake are in fact the Selkie subspecies which are a Scottish merpeople subspecies, generally considered less beautiful than their warmer-water counterparts, and comparable to the Merrows of Ireland (who while also generally considered less beautiful than their warmer-water counterparts look different). The beautiful merpeople as shown in the stained glass windows are of the Siren subspecies and native to Greece.

** Some Black Sister Headcanon from my post a couple months ago

1.) The sisters used to love each other unconditionally. Narcissa as the youngest was watched over by two slightly unhinged and overprotective sisters. In a family where love was not given freely the three of them grew up relying on each other.

2.) Andromeda's marriage caused a chain of events which eventually lead to the creation of the infamous Bellatrix Lestrange. After Andi got hitched her sisters were rushed into contracted marriages to "upstanding members of the society". Bella was not born a sadistic bitch. I don't even see her as a supporter of Voldemort before her marriage. All of the Black sisters were raised to believe in the superiority of purebloods, something they all agreed on to a certain extent because having magic would not stop them from using the "achievements of the Muggles". Muggles were second-class people who had their uses, not vermin to be exterminated. Ideologically that puts them closer to Grindelwald than to Voldemort. Andromeda shed that believe over the years thanks to her muggle in-laws. Narcissa kept the attitude she was raised with while the Lestranges drove Bella into the militant extension of that belief. After Andromeda eloped her sisters were contracted to Lestrange and Malfoy. Malfoy was happy with his trophy wife while the Lestranges broke the rebellious Bella and turned her into the monster she became through conditioning (torture those muggles or get tortured yourself), not through some loyalty potion bullshit. Andi blames herself for that since without her marriage the contracts would not have been signed.

3.) Andromeda and Narcissa are on friendly terms. They have secret meetings once every couple months (or at least no one on Narcissa's side knows about them). Both miss their sister whom they lost two decades ago due to the Lestranges and both feel guilty about it because they feel like they failed Bella (Andromeda) or could have done more to help her (Narcissa).

4.) Andromeda is not the embodiment of the "Light side". Andromeda is a pragmatist, someone who would kill to protect her family. She makes decisions based on her family's welfare (Edward, Nymphadora, Edward's parents, Narcissa), not "looking at the bigger picture". If she had the choice between saving her husband/daughter/sister or saving five hundred others she would sacrifice the whole lot without remorse. She could live under Voldemort if her family was safe. She stayed out of the first war because that conflict did not concern her. Andromeda is not a patriot (unlike her husband and daughter), running away is a valid choice for her. She would rather hop aboard British Airways Flight 15 to Sydney via Singapore than stay in Britain and fight the war.

As someone who is a firm supporter of that headcanon, let me point you at the sexual terrors inflicted upon China by the Japanese between 1937 and 1945, with the Rape of Nanjing and "Comfort Women" being the most prominent ones. The Japanese believed themselves superior and yet raped MILLIONS of Chinese, Korean and Phillipean and Indonesian Women. If anything, a sense of superiority enables that sort of behaviour. And that is just one example from World War Two, the Eastern Front has plenty more examples from all sides raping those they consider "beneath" them.

*** Honestly I just think that it's more probable that the centaurs just beat her up, really really badly. I mean, I can't see the Ministry just letting the rape of a high-level employee going unpunished, but claimed self-defense because invasion reasons could be grounds for no punishment. Granted, we only see the centaurs next in DH after OotP with no mention of punishment, but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

Side note: my Chinese History textbooks mentioned Japanese actions to be commited to break Chinese morale. That, in my opinion, makes the situations different. The centaurs were probably doing it for revenge, instead of actually trying to mentally scar her being the main objective. As I live in a part of China, I'd think my textbooks would be more against Japanese actions, really.

** - I've always headcanoned the Blacks as Anglo-Indian. Note that this is not QUITE the same thing as “British Indian” - so they're not like the Patils! - but something about them SCREAMS British Raj to me.

- James Potter's parents met in either Singapore or Shanghai. His mother's name before her marriage was Euphemia Lau.

(...okay, so these two are trying to link up the magical world with the real world a bit. The British Empire was HUGE at its peak, and plenty of wealthy Muggle families sent their sons on colonial service - governor of this, commander of that, wealthy businessman selling the other. Why would wizarding families not do the same? Just imagine a wizard during the Fall of Singapore!)

- Petunia and Lily's father was named Harry. There's a Harry in James' family as well if you go back a few generations, but it's really Harry Evans that *our* Harry is named for. Lily loved her Dad very much.

(Petunia calls it a “nasty, common name”...but the thing about Petunia is that she hides a *lot* of where she came from to fit in with Little Whinging. Like Snape, she's put quite a lot of work into softening/hiding her natural accent, which I think may be a slightly northern one - the way Spinner's End is described, that's a northern mill town - and speaking more “properly”; she's acutely aware of money and status because Vernon's family is a lot wealthier than her own was. She married up a bit, and she knows it.)

A House elf is not capable of the power of most wizard magic, but they can weave in and around wizard magic with sheer versatility, and even copy it to a degree.

*Silver Trio*

- Ginny, while friendly with Luna, didn't become her /friend/ properly until their fourth year. The clincher was when Umbridge began giving lessons on the dangers of "propaganda" and tore into /The Quibbler,/ with veiled threats towards Luna and her father. Their friendship was further solidified when they had to pass in essays on the material. Luna's was stolen from her bag by her classmates. For her detention, Luna had to rewrite the essay in class with the Blood Quill, which fueled Ginny's protective instincts.

- Luna's opinions on Hagrid's abilities as a teacher softened dramatically when her class studied thestrals under him. She was the only one in the class who could see them.

- The Lovegoods took care of the Burrow during the Christmas holidays while Arthur was in St. Mungo's. None of the Weasleys know this.

- Neville had a very brief crush on Ginny that died instantly when he double-checked his family tree and realized they were too closely related for his comfort.

- The "detention" that Neville, Luna and Ginny served for stealing the Sword of Gryffindor consisted of helping Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest--Hagrid took them twenty steps into the Forest and pointed to various branches he wanted them to collect for his firewood.

** I wrote out my headcanon for Hogwarts during the DH year.

But I have a few others too, naturally. One is that Diagon Alley is actually a few streets and flats around the main high street, but the only reason it isn't an all magical settlement like hogsmead is because of all the muggles that have married into wizarding families and decided to live there, like many other almost wizarding settlements.

Another that popped into my head the other day (probably royal wedding induced) is that the Queen is well aware and is kept more or less up to date with the wizarding world, though she is thankful that they mostly keep to themselves. When there is a new prime minister, she asks them whether they have met the other minister yet, and when they say yes she responds "good. Let's hope we do not have to discuss them again."

Oh! Also that lots of Wireless programmes and chatshows are recorded in front of a live studio audience, but the news programmes still have that old "this is the BBC" voice.
