Looking for two fanfics. In one, the twins had potioned Ron a lot as pranks, with intelligence damping potions. Snape identifies the problem and gives him purging potion. When Ron is on purging potion, he becomes smarter.

Second fanfic, Dumbledore bashing. In one scene, Harry polyjuices as Dumbledore, pretending to be in Goblin custody. Minister sends a few aurors to take him in ministry custody. Goblins bring him outside all chained up. When they release him, he thanks the minister for freeing him, pushes the aurors back and apparate out, all pretending to be Dumbledore. The goblins are in on it.
