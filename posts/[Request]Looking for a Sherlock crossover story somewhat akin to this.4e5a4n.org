** I'll admit I've only read some of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, but as far as I was aware, before living at 10 Baker Street with Sherlock, Watson was a Doctor. He was a combat medic sure, but I don't think Auror would be the magical counterpart.

*** Watson - both the original and the one in the new BBC series - was in the war in Afghanistan. Aurors are the closest the British Ministry has to soldiers, and a number of them might be trained in healing spells, to help in the field.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9681294/1/Like-a-Phoenix][Like a Phoenix!]] and its sequel is somewhat similar to what you're looking for with a John that was classmates with Harry and co.
