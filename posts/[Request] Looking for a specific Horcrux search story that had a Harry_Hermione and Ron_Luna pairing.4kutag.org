I cannot for the life of me find the damn story.

It has Harry/Hermione and Ron/Luna as a pairing. I believe it was set in Hogwarts after the 6th year. Harry and Hermione end up attempting to find Horcrux locations via sex magic (as opposed to camping and searching for Horcruxes) and make a book of the sex spells they create towards the middle/end of a story. I believe it was a longer one, certainly 10+ chapters if I'm not mistaken.

Sounds stupid, kind of is, but I can't find it again. Any help or suggestions to a similar style is appreciated.


** Ah Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor...where Luna has a massive rack and Hermione gets magically bum fucked by an invisible penis because Harry has bad aim...

** They find a book in the Black Library and Ron refuses to take part because it's dark magic (or just he's too nervous to be naked in front of Hermione) and then gets pissed because Harry and Hermione do the ritual without him?

*** No, that is a different one. The length and girth isn't even comparable and the activity has a different tone entirely.

Destroying Horcruxes vs finding them. I'm talking about the story you sicks fucks.
