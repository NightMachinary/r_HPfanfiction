  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

  The day starts out like any other. He eats breakfast alone. He draws no unnecessary attention in his classes. He keeps his head down because he has no reason not to. He isn't special.  He isn't the Boy-Who-Lived or one of his Gryffindor friends. No one comes to him for help, and he has no help to offer, anyway. And then he does.   In which Harry Potter is not the Boy-Who-Lived.
