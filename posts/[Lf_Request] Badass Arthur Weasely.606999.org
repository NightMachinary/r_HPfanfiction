(hypothetically)Where did william learn all about cursebreaking? Where did percy learn all about laws and decree? Where did the various enchantments that scatter the weasely house come from? I am looking where Arthur Weasely is the ultimate badass but not the main character.


** I actually think the canon Arthur Weasley was quite the bad ass, who generally used self-deprecating humors to appear harmless:

- He raised 7 powerful and competent children, despite meager economic resources.
- He managed to pass the Muggle Protection Act against significant opposition in the Wizengamot, and despite himself ranking not high on Ministry hierarchy.
- He, in his spare time, managed to charm a flying invisible car, who also had developed its own sentience.
- He and Molly actively ENCOURAGED his children to befriend Harry and Hermione, after they displayed significant potentials. (my headcanon)
- Although Molly was loud and domineering, he seemed to be in control of ALL major family decisions.
- He and Bill could both cast the Fidelius Charm with ease.
- He fought in the Final Battle and didn't seem to have been injured at all.
- In the end, Weasleys had suffered the fewest losses relatively, while most other major families were pretty much depleted. They further brought the two strongest of the next generation into the family, and built an alliance with the French powerhouse Delacours.

How was canon Arthur not a bad-ass?

--------------

Among fanfictions, I have yet to read a story where Arthur is the main or a major character, although he mostly escapes bashing.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** u/KarelJanovic:
#+begin_quote
  Gratitude-tinged awe filled Harry at Arthur's adroit information gathering. Bold didn't even come close to what he was doing, but the hen-pecked, bumbling husband routine put him above suspicion. Exactly how deep under cover had Arthur Weasley lived for the Order? Harry knew then without a doubt that Arthur knew exactly how to use plugs and batteries.
#+end_quote

That's a quote from Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand, I'm not sure how "badass" Arthur is but he's definitely obfuscating stupidity (in TVTropes parlance) and possibly badassery.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.
