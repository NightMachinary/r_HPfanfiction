I just read an article on [[/r/baseball][r/baseball]] that linked an article where JK Rowling says that the Sorting Hat would "arbitrarily sort a kid onto the New York Mets."

Now, while this article was certainly satire, it made me think two things:

1. This was a brilliant piece of comedy.
2. How amazing would it be if there was a fic where a student /actually/ got sorted onto the Mets?!

So, if anybody wants to take a stab at it and - subsequently - become my new favorite person, that would be awesome. In fact, I might even give it a shot...

** The fuck is the Mets..? I assume from the name it might be some sportsteam perhaps..? Edit: checked link, yes Rowling had an anurism and decided the magical BRITISH sorting hat would randomly sort british kids into an AMERICAN baseball club/team for no reason at all..

Yes, I know. That's why I said it was satire.

*** They're an American baseball team in New York City who are not known for winning. If you're looking for a Harry Potter equivalent, think of the Chudley Cannons in quidditch.

**** No way. They won the world series in 1969 amd 1985. They also went to the world series in 2005 and 2015. They have periods of losing but they're not the Chudley Canons.

The Chudley Canons true equivalent are the Cleveland Browns.

****** I remember staying up to watch that game when I was in high school. My English teacher was a huge Red Sox fan and we had no end of fun with it Buckner's muffed fielding that Monday morning. We were discussing /The Tempest:/

  Too light winning, make the prize light.

"So you see, Prospero was worried that Ferdinand's love for Miranda was too easy, so he took actions to make his life harder. Sort of like how Buckner decided that winning game 6 would cheapen the series, so he took it on himself to spot the Mets a game."
