“What you Leave Behind” by Newcomb has some of the most exquisite descriptions of magical theory I've ever read in fanfiction. It delves into topics and discussions that I consider a master class in the form.

For example, the description of a “generalist” of magic, shown through the overwhelming ability of Albus Dumbledore taking on Snape and Sirius in a mock duel, is still something that sits with me a year after reading (and will influence the portrayal of magic in any HP fanfic I write, assuming I can get my lazy ass to type).

For the curious few who have yet to stumble upon this fic, it is my all time favorite unfinished story. That said, I would hesitate to recommend it to the uninitiated because it leaves such a hole of longing to know how it would have finished!

I'm curious on others opinions of what other fics present the theory behind magic in a similarly engaging fashion?


** That fic indeed has some beautiful depictions of magic - even though I don't /really/ agree with the idea behind it (the generalist one on display for Dumbledore doesn't exactly sit right with me from that duel), but it's absolutely top notch.

I'm also quite partial to AngelaStarCat's descriptions of magic in "Blindness" and "With Strength of Steel Wings".

** Haven't read it recently, but I remember this one as having a logical progression to how Occlumency works.

** By magical theory, do you mean how magic works?

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][link]]

There's no magical cores. There's two units of measurement: The Flamel and the Merlin. The former is how fast you can channel magic, and the latter is a unit of measure. I guess in order to nerf magic (IE not making people have unlimited reserves of spamming power), there's something called toxins. You use your magic, convert magic from the atmosphere to your magic, which introduces toxins. These have to fade, otherwise the conversion goes all wonky or something. Ritual are heavy duty involved too. Historically, Divination wasn't as useless as it is now.

Severe AU. It goes heavy into politics, pureblood stuff (traditions, family magics, etc), and what being a Light/Dark/Gray Lord actually mean.

ALSO! WBWL. Dumbledore may be an antagonist, but he has his own reasons to do it. Those reasons aren't shown for a while, but they are. And they are believable.

The major downside to this fic is that they are still in the second year...

*** Yeah, I'm reading this and love it as well, though I share your concerns with how much has been written and how much is still left.

I'm not so much talking about explaining how someone is magical, but more the diving into how magic works in regards to usage, spell casting, knowledge, etc.

*** I disagree, on both the quality of the fic and the quality of the magical system depicted within the fic.

On the topic of the magic, I think the quantification of magic detracts from the experience. The wonder of magic is both in its logic and in its illogic. Magic has to make sense for a story to succeed but part of the wonder of the magic in Harry Potter is the illogical aspects, the mystical haze around its workings, and the awe of those who can use it skillfully. The pseudo-science detracts rather than adds to the fic. It doesn't even work for the fic. The "energy" of magic clashes with conceptual based magic used elsewhere throughout the fic. The most powerful wizard, Voldemort, is said to only be able to take on five aurors before losing (having gone through many powerboosting rituals). This makes no sense for the world in the story. It shows wizards like Voldemort, Dumbledore, and "Lord Slytherin" having the ability to defy the ministry and the masses without any ability to back it up.

Other downsides to the story other than a magical system that does not even work for the story? The grooming. A good summary of what happens with Ginny is "Man manipulates child into loving him and also turns said child into a weapon while portraying the parent's concerns as irrational because...wrong boy who lived". It's been a while, but didn't she even drink a potion to make her hate the other twin?

**** - Eh, I like there to be some explanation on how the magic works instead of author fiat. It's a good way to show growth instead of "I practiced a spell." It's a great equalizer. People have different starting points, but with enough work, anyone can be powerful.
- The Voldemort and five auror thing gets to me too. It makes a weird bit of sense that a properly geared and trained group of people can overcome one person instead of them being a god-like entity. It doesn't mesh well with Harry Potter though, even though the god-like entity part irritates me there.
- The Ginny thing is complex-ish.

  - She wanted to go combat, since she didn't have a niche when everyone else did.
  - There was grooming, but more for being chesspiece useful sort(he switches back and forth between jaded old man and kid that never lived).
  - Her parents concerns /at first/ were irrational. "On the say so of a child, we're going to mind-rape and veritaserum our daughter."
  - She was getting mad at the mixed feelings for the other brother and asked for the potion herself.
  - If you want grooming, look at Hermione. That was straight up grooming there.

​

I'm mainly reading this story for the political machinations and drama. The manipulative Dumbledore with believable reasons for the whole schtick instead of "Because I'm an evil arsehole" is icing on the cake.
