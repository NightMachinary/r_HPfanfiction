Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Fantastic story, I absolutely love the worldbuilding you do with it; the world feels like a much larger and stranger place then it ever did in canon.

** Fantastic I love Tom Riddle as a character and always want to read stories focused on him. I will start this tonight.

If you have any other Tom Riddle stories you can recommend please do. I am starting my own Tom Riddle AU story and hope to start publishing it later this year so I want to read other author's POV of his character. I don't think that I am a physcopath like him so some more inspiration would nice to flesh out his character

** Just caught up on the latter third of the chapters and am very excited for the next one with the bombshell you dropped at the end!

** I just read the whole thing - it's great! The world building, Tom's characterisation - the way he interacts with a Dumbledore that doesn't take any shit is marvellous.

The cliffhanger at the end of chapter 30 was very rude.
