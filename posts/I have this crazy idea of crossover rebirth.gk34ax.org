I was wondering how it will turn out if Robert Baratheon(ASOIAF) is reborn as Harry Potter.

** A lot of people have tried to do the opposite. For instance, linkffn(11098283). I don't think I've ever seen Robert going to Hogwarts though! He'd be the quintessential Gyrffindor. (Though I suppose I could see the hat deliberating... "Brave. Recklessly so. But you want to be king, eh? Better be...")

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned
