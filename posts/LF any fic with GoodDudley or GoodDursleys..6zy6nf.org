  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** off the top of my head, linkffn(3 Slytherin Marauders), which someone else beat me to, linkffn(Petunia's Boys), which show a good Vernon trying to raise Dudley and Harry after Petunia passes, (by the same author as the fic above).

linkffn(An Aunt's Love) After the events of 5th Year Petunia finally figures out that all is not well with her nephew and sends him off to get proper help.

Linkffn(A Better Man) is teeechincally a time travel fic. We start at Vernon's funeral, and amongst Harry's final words to Pet and Dudley, telling them off for the years of abuse, he wishes Vernon had been a better man. Lo and Behold, Fates are changed, the axis has shifted, yada yada yada, Vernon gets a chance at a do-over and we're taken back to Vernon and Petunia's wedding, which also happens to be his first meeting with Lily and her fiance, James, a witch and wizard. (don't worry. all that happens in the first chapter. The rest of it's perfectly..uh...normal *coughs*)

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
