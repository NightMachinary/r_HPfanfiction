Why was the Unbreakable Vow not used strategically by the Order?

For instance, every member must swear an unbreakable vow to keep the identity of the order members a secret and to not betray the order. This could've stopped Peter Pettigrew from betraying the order, so why didn't Dumbledore or anyone think of this?

And the unbreakable vow is not dark magic, so that excuse of the order avoiding it because it's dark magic doesn't fit.

Or interrogate everyone with Legilimency or Veritaserum. But no, let's assume it must be the werewolf. Shows the baleful effects of prejudice.

My head-canon would be that it's incredibly risky to swear an unbreakable vow to an abstract entity (like the Order) because who decides what its purposes are, to know what constitutes betrayal of them. Even if you trust the current leadership, could that change in future. Could Pettigrew convince himself that the Order's purpose is to save lives and helping Voldemort will achieve this by shortening a war he is guaranteed to win.

There's a Greg Egan [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine_(Egan_novel)][novel]] with a very similar plot point.

#+begin_quote
  Investigation in New Hong Kong leads Nick to the group responsible, the Ensemble, but causes him to be captured. Nick is implanted by an illegal 'Loyalty Mod', which causes him to earnestly and truly believe in the goals of the Ensemble.

  [...]

  Nick eventually meets a group of Ensemble members who like him are under the control of the Loyalty mod. They explain to him that the loyalty mod only specifies their loyalty to Ensemble, but fails to specify what the ensemble actually is. Therefore, via logical argument, the group (calling itself the Canon) decides that as by definition the most loyal members of the ensemble, what the ensemble is is up to their personal interpretations.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/itso72/why_arent_unbreakable_oaths_more_used_in_the/g5gng0n/][My opinion on unbreakable vows]]. Unbreakable vows are either easy to get around, or can be used to kill/demagic/enslave anyone who uses them---or possibly /both/. Death Eaters like Bellatrix might be willing to throw unbreakable vows around, but Dumbledore would know how bad they are.

** Unbreakable Vow is one of the most infuriating additions that came with the later books in the series. There is basically no good reason why it was introduced. It does nothing but sour the taste of previous books in hindsight.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword) had a pretty good explanation for this, when Ron & Harry have an argument about why wizards shouldn't swear on a portion of their magic (20% or smthn) to never harm someone intentionally. The author explains that wizards can't stand the thought of their magic being bound by something - it's why magical oaths are never bandied around.

** Why would they think they'd need one? Dumbledore probably had to at least informally approve of everyone in the Order for them to stick around, and the vast majority of them (as I understand it) had known each other for years. They trusted each other - and friends don't generally make friends sign contracts (especially since making an Unbreakable Vow would basically be the ultimate way of saying 'we don't trust each other').

If you'd've asked James and Sirius and Remus if they thought Peter would ever betray them, I imagine they'd either be pissed or baffled at the idea of it. Why would you need a vow for your best friend not to betray your secret vigilante group to fight against a racist terrorist? Especially if your trusted headmaster vouches for all the people you might know less well? So, yeah. They didn't use it because they didn't think they'd need it, I'd imagine.

*** The Order was not only made up of Marauders. It consisted of other people the Marauders had never met, people they weren't friends with.

It seems like the blindly trusted Dumbledore. In the case that he would bring in trusted people.

**** Sure, but each clump of people probably knew each other. eg. The Marauder's knew each other, Frank and Alice knew each other, Dumbledore's friends knew each other, The Weasleys/Prewetts knew each other, etc. That's what I meant, not that everyone knew every other member of the group. Each little group brought into the Order trusted the other members of their group, then trusted Dumbledore to only bring in people he trusted too.

And sure, they probably did blindly trust Dumbledore, but you didn't ask whether they made a smart choice, only why they made the choice they did. Whether trusting Dumbledore was a good idea or not wasn't what you asked, but the idea that they did trust Dumbledore was my best-guess answer to your question of why they wouldn't use Unbreakable Vows.
