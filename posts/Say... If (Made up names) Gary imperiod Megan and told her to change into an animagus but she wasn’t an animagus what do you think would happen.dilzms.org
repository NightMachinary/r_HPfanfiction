** I say probably nothing. If her mind knows she can't change into an animagus then she wouldn't, she would try to learn. Just like if he asked her to fly she wouldn't go jumping out of a window like a bird, she would try to find a broom. I guess if he ordered to change *now*, her mind would either break under a stronger will and become catatonic or free itself.

That's my headcanon at least.

** She would find polyjuice and the most accessible animagus and turn into an animagus

** I'm guessing she'd try and fail. Possibly with horrible consequences depending on her knowledge of the magical theory.

** Let's take it a step further, what if Megan took an Unbreakable vow to change into an animagus in the next 5 minutes and she isn't one. Would she drop dead after 5 mins?

*** Unbreakable Vows do not have any form of geas, nor do they endow a person with any sort of extra ability so yes Megan would die after 5 minutes.

OPs question is more directed at how the Imperious Curse effected the 4th years in GoF, can't remember the exact wording but Neville performed complex acrobatics that he would not have normally been able to do (from Harry's perspective) and so OP is wondering if that would extend to magical feats. In this case, probably not, due to the canonical ritual nature of the method to become an animagus.

** Maybe Megan would look up the way to become an animagus and train to become an animagus? So basically forced learning to become an animagus because its a whole process that takes time and effort.

** Nothing.. if you were to curse Draco Malfoy and order him to give birth, a fetus wouldn't spontanously appear and blow his cock off..
