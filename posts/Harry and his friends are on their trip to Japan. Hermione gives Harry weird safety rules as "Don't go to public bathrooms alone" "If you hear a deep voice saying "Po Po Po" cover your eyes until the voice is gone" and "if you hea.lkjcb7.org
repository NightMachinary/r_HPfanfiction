#+TITLE: Harry and his friends are on their trip to Japan. Hermione gives Harry weird safety rules as "Don't go to public bathrooms alone" "If you hear a deep voice saying "Po Po Po" cover your eyes until the voice is gone" and "if you hear a sound going "teke teke" Disapparate immediately".

"and if you hear or read local news reports of a slit-mouthed woman attacking people, stay indoors until everything's clear," said Hermione. Harry looks at her in confusion. "Ok so why those strange rules?" asked Harry which Ron who was snacking on rice balls then says "Well mate, let's just say...they found my uncle in halves at the train tracks 20 years ago and 4 years after that my cousin is banned from this country for seeing that tall lady...".

I've been reading a lot of Japanese Urban legends and I can imagine Harry freaking out that some of those urban legends are real and sometimes the ministries are unable to detain them.


** The only reason I know of these urban legends are because of the Scared to Death podcast by Dan Cummings. He researches topics like a bored Ravenclaw and tells them on his podcasts(Time Suck being his main), the Scared to Death podcast is my favorite of his. You should listen to it.

The story of The Woman with the Long Neck (po po po) is terrifying. Follows a boy who saw her, and what the grandparents had to do to keep him safe from her that same night while trying to escape her and the village, kid was barred from ever going back to that town and even was a bit haunted years later. It's a good story, very scary, so I don't want to spoil it, but damn it's a good listen.

Dan has told some of these other japanese urban legends too. I would totally read a harry potter story in japan where he encounters one of these scary beings.

** Plot Twist: because of the unusual side-effects of his dying and then returning through one of the most obscure, convoluted loopholes believed possible (and the energies of the Stone, not the others Hallows), Harry has a relatively uneventful trip.

Why? Because to supernatural entities, he scares the shit out of them: from their perspective, it's like seeing something that's paradoxically alive but dead walking around mixed in with a bit of Lovecraftian Elder horror.

Harry blinked at Hermione, who had frozen stiff. "Why did that woman just shove her head in that toilet?"

"...It's fine, Harry. Everything's fine."

He frowned: that had become her new mantra this trip. Every time they saw a stranger acting... well, /strange/, she'd repeat it over and over while trying not to hysterically laugh.

It was even weirder when that nice lady with the scarred cheek took one look into his eyes and then threw herself off the balcony -- when he looked over, he presumed she'd disapparated or took a portkey or something, as there were no signs of her.

Japan really was a strange place.

** Plot twist.

As soon as Harry steps out of the Japanese Ministry of Magic he crashes into a girl with dark green hair and huge tits. Somehow his hands land on her breasts.

** Another story that scared me straight as a kid (why was that website named scarystories4kids, it SHOULD NOT be for kids) was the Japanese lady with a medical mask one.

‚ÄúIf you see a Japanese lady with a medical mask over a scarred mouth and she asks ‚Äúdo I look pretty?‚Äù you have to give a neutral answer. If you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù then she gives you a matching smile, if you say ‚Äúno‚Äù then she kills you for disrespect.‚Äù

I never figured out what a neutral answer could be.

**** Or the Head of the group heard that /the/ Harry Potter, Vanquisher of Dark Wizards came to Japan and ordered a preemptive strike. Harry is just like "I just wanted to go on vacation! I had no intention to fight anymore dark wizards!" and then he does it anyway, because that's how he is.

Edit: In general, Dark Wizards reactions to Harry being either frightened panic or /I'll prove myself better by besting you!/ is pretty hilarious to me.
