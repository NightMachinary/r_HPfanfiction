** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]]. One of my all time favorites. Bill and Fleur are also main characters. It covers their experiences during Deathly Hallows, giving a good look at what the Order was doing during the war. It talks about Percy's abandonment of the family and why. Oliver Wood is also a major character and it shows how Percy and Audrey met. The characters are really well done and it gives a good perspective of the events of Deathly Hallows from people who aren't Ron, Hermione, or Harry.

  "People change, you know, and then you find you have less in common with old friends and more in common with the strangest people." Percy had built a tall wall around himself - a stronghold - and the only way it was going to come down was by crashing into someone else's soaring fortress. Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
