So I am talking no Voldemort (but perhaps still Tom), no golden trio (as we know it anyway), and so on and so forth. The history of the original series is wiped away and while canon content can still exist, it exists in a completely different scenario or context. So canon characters can still exist, and the Wizarding world obviously exists, but I am looking for original content fics that simply exist within the Wizarding world.

So for example, it could be a fic where Harry is raised a Potter allied with the Blacks, looking to expand the Potter-Black empire and dominate Wizarding politics. It could be a Fleur who grew up fighting in a French resistance against Wizarding oppression, who allies with a British girl Luna against the growing threat that is Dumbledore. I could be Daphne Greengrass who grows up at Hogwarts, daughter to a teacher, but with a condition that allows her the use of magic but an inability to use a focus like a wand, and her friendship with a girl named Hermione who struggles to perform basic spells.

These examples are just random provided ones pulled out of my head to point out that the Wizarding history of the series should be thrown out.

So looking for the best HP Fanfiction that fits that. And sorry if its a bit of an abstract request.


** It's not /exactly/ what you requested, but it's amazing and awesome, so I'm recommending it anyway. It's a crossover, but the first ..many chapters take place solely in the HP universe, but pretty AU and has been since before 1981.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Linkao3(8494264) fem!Harry that isn't actually Harry at all. You could consider it to be an OC but I still like thinking of her as Harry just for familiarity. She's never mentioned as Harry at all (I think). I would definitely read it for the excellent worldbuilding, if nothing else. The story is incredibly deep, which I found really refreshing. Also available on ffn. It's abandoned, but I often find myself rereading it for the setting.

**** Th√© MC has a completely different upbringing, is a sociopath, has siblings, lives in a no-Voldemort world, has living parents, shows none of Harry's personality traits (surprisingly that's not an exaggeration. None at all.)

Personally, I started this at chapter 20 and read in a non-linear fashion because I got bored often. However, in the end I read it start to end (skipping a few uncomfortable scenes) because the world building was just too interesting. This is one of the few stories I have actually saved (downloaded). It definitely isn't for everyone though, so if you think you won't like it, don't waste your time.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

Malfoy is a dictator ruling wizarding Britain, Dumbledore is in exile, Harry and the Weasleys grew up in France, Hermione is one of Malfoy's brainwashed mudblood soldiers, nobody knows on which side Snape really is and Voldemort is a half-naga.

That should be AU enough.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

It was abandoned but I love the historical accuracy of Helga,Not just Hufflepuff at it's other part many names of Rowena and Bold Gryffindor.

It's a bit out there but it's a short story about the founders. It's based on the description of sorting hat where they came from and a historical approximation on their lives based on the era. It's still for me, the best founders era fic.

** I'm curious, do you want complete AU or recent-history AU? I have some examples that might fit, but you could approve or disapprove them to help future commenters.

linkffn(8629685) The Firebird Trilogy has a more alien Wizarding World that's matriarchal. It's kind of a deconstruction of the Harem fic genre. Wizards are referred to as Witch-born, men /must/ take multiple wives in order to maintain the population, and women make all the real decisions.

And HPMOR. Appears similar on the surface, but the deeper you go the more different it gets. (Personally, am not recommending you read this as an AU fic, as the AU info doesn't become clear until 50-75% of the way through, but if you've already read it you can use it as an example of whether it fulfills your request or not.)

*** Either to be honest. But in my head I simply want a cool AU that ignores entirely the history within the book series themselves. So canon characters can remain, the wizarding world exists in its basic design (twists are fine) as JK wrote it, but history itself is completely AU and as such, it changes the stories of the characters entirely for obvious reasons and certain other things develop differently as well (politics being a big one).

I've read HPMOR, but while I have Fthe Firebird trilogy downloaded, I don't think I have read it yet so I will take a look.

  Harry has been hiding something ever since the end of his 5th year. What that something turns out to be is going to rock the wizarding world and a few members of the Order to their knees. You didn't think the Death Eaters were the only marked supporters of Voldemort, did you? SLASH, MPREG, mild character bashing, Sirius alive. MAJOR AU. Rabastan/Harry. COMPLETE! 10/23

  7th Year Gryffs learn why it is never a good idea to piss off their favorite victim, shy Ravenclaw Hadrian Morgan. The orphan's payback during Professor Slytherin's class is BEAUTIFUL & piques the interest & libido of the Lord Marvolo Slytherin, who courts him with the aid of most of the School. But just how naive is Hadrian Morgan, really? TMR/HP Slash OOC AU

  Harem!Fic Harry inherits a creature "thing" from both sides of his parents and somehow that leads to weird sleeping habits, conversations with Theodore Nott and finding himself caught up in a world of Dragons, elemental powers and new creatures he's never heard of before. Dragons? Mates? Very AU. Contains all kinds of slash.
