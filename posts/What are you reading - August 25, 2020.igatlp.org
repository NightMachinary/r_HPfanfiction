Not the first time I've read it and certainly won't be the last. I keep coming back to it and I think it's because Annerb's writing just draws me, I keep falling in live with anything she writes. But also I love how she portrays people in general in that fic. She portrays her characters as complicated and she just adds so many layers that something new always catches my attention every time I read it. And the different shades of grey that she views everything in and ‚Äúeverything looks different from the other side‚Äù mindset just makes me want to keep reading even when I finish.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** Title: A Second Chance

Author: Breanie

Rating: M

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12924292/1/A-Second-Chance]]

Comments:

I've bitten the bullet and finally started on the 2M words in 243 chapters of this behemoth. The basic premise is that Minerva McGonagall actively lobbies to get Sirius a trial, and that as a result he's released after only four years in Azkaban. He then becomes Harry's primary parent. I'm 32 chapters in so far, which might sound a lot but they've all been fairly short, and given that there are 243 it's hardly that far in.

The Good:

The writing is pretty good. At the moment it's perhaps a little on the simple side but that can be explained with Harry's age, meaning much of the dialogue is at a 6yo level.

It hasn't descended into the sort of Sirius-as-a-panacea that some stories create, in which once they get together there are no more problems and Harry sails through the rest of his life. Instead there's been a reasonable description of child-raising with problems and conflict in good measure.

I'm glad to see that Sirius is living his life for once. Often in Sirius-as-parent stories, his entire life is based around Harry and presumably he goes into stasis when Harry is off at school. Here we've got him out shagging a nurse within a few chapters, and I get the feeling he's going to be an all-round more realistic character in this story.

The Bad:

The author hasn't done much, if any, research into British-isms. It's not at immersion-destroying levels, but it's strayed dangerously close on a few occasions. I suspect this will become less of an issue when we move out of the current domestic setting into a Hogwarts one, but time will tell.

It's slow-paced. Chapter 32 and not a huge amount has happened. I'm only 32 chapters in but that's still 13% of what's been written so far, and if things continue at the same pace I doubt he'll even be at Hogwarts by chapter 243.

Even though the home life is more realistic than some versions I've seen, it still comes over as a little bit twee. Scenes of Harry in his tree house playing with his adorable new puppy are lovely, but half the idea of the original books was that magic was an escape for Harry. Making it all too nice and fluffy at the start kind of takes away from that idea.

Conclusion:

It's difficult to reach a conclusion at this stage given that there's so much left to read. The story has kept my attention, which is the important thing. I'll see if that holds for the next 200+ chapters...

*** 1) the writing IS on the simple side at the beginning, but as you read more, you will see how her writing keeps getting better the more she does it. It's one of my favorite things about reading it.

2) right now in chapter 243 it's sixth year, so the pace will get faster. I guess there are a few things that the author wanted to happen before she starts time jumping.

3) leave her reviews she really loves getting them.

Hope you enjoy‚ù§Ô∏è

**** I've reached chapter 70 and that's where I'm stopping.

The writing has got worse, not better. The frequency of basic grammar errors has increased, Americanisms are coming regularly now and the story is glacial.

I get that the author wants to give a decent account of the difficulties Sirius faces in bringing up a young child that isn't his own, but the sheer number of side-tracks presented is distracting. Page after page of Pensieve memories, for instance. Then we even get Sirius retelling the story of James and Lily to Ginny as a love story. There's setting a scene and there's navel-gazing.

You could play a decent drinking game while reading the story: one shot for every time either Sirius or Remus places a kiss on the top of Harry's head would have you drunk as a sailor.

And there's scarcely any magic.

I don't know what the point of the story is now. The premise was fine but it's got bogged down in the same stuff again and again. I really can't be bothered trudging through another 160 chapters of this.

It is a long read. Hermione, Ron and Harry get sent back to Hogwarts at the time of the founders from the chaos of the Department of Mysteries. The founders learn whence they are from and set about helping them and the three of them help defend early Hogwarts.

I found it got a little slow as the the three settled into ancient Hogwarts but fairly full of action for the last third. Nice exploration of the founders, their background and relationships.

This is a work in progress I think, but the current last chapter does wrap up a few things.

I love Keira's writing in her HP AU World. Even her CrossOvers. (I actually normally avoid CO's) I love it when we can tear Harry away from Dumbledore.

** The HarryAndGinny discord server pointed me in the direction of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1857763][Off-Kilter]], which is short but a decent look at Harry and Ginny reestablishing their relationship after the Battle of Hogwarts - especially dealing with her feelings about the past year, having been left alone "for her safety" in a school led and operated by Death Eaters. The writing is in first person from Harry's perspective, which is different. Reasonable prose quality, Ron and Hermione's relationship is a bit cute (they're joined at the hip...or somewhere close to that, anyway. Harry doesn't begrudge them their happiness, just tries not to be envious of how things are smoother sailing for them).

  Two years after the war, and Harry's content with his life. OK, so it's a little annoying that he keeps winning Witch Weekly's Most Eligible Bachelor award, and he's really not looking forward to the unveiling of an enormous gold statue of himself, but he loves his friends, and he loves being an Auror. And if he yearns for something more, something he can barely bring himself to think about, well, he'll probably get over it. No one's happy all the time, are they?But then everything changes, and Harry's thrown into a new and dazzling world he's not sure he can actually escape from. And as time goes on, he starts to wonder: does he actually want to?
