** The funny part is that I had this chapter ready about 6 months ago, but I wanted to wait to release it with the rest of the chapters ending Book 2.

Unfortunately, life got in the way and I haven't had the chance to finish the rest of Book 2 until now. So as I got closer to finishing Book 2 and sending it to my beta, I posted this update to apologize for the hiatus. Hopefully everything is back on schedule.

*** If it helps, the reading can be broken into the natural arcs of the story. Book 1 can be broken up into three sections, Chapters 1-8, Chapters 9-17, Chapters 18-24. Book 2 can also be broken up into three arcs - Chapters 27-36, Chapters 37-45, Chapters 46-end of Book 2.

Book 2, especially, sprawls a bit more than Book 1 so breaking them up into chunks helps if you want stop reading for a while without forgetting the major plot points.
