** Maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones][Digging for the Bones]]. It follows the ramifications of Neville's death following abuse by his uncle at the beginning of 3rd year. Mostly looks at the relationship between Harry and Snape, and Harry's depression and the impact of the abuse he suffered from the Dursley's.

** And I'll shamelessly self-promote my own fic here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13648904/1/To-Be-Loyal][To Be Loyal]] by Eriadu on Fanfiction.net. It's the first of a planned AU series about how the first war changed the Marauders, and how the Marauders changed the war. Add a couple interestingly placed OC's, my (hopefully) good interpretation of these beloved characters, a dash of 70s craziness, and stir.

** Yes, another chance for me to promote my all time fave fic: linkao3(the secret language of mistletoe by Endrina). The working title was Harry is depressed and Draco is a Communist or something to that effect. (Takes a gooooood while to get there.) Writing is top-notch and the series is complete.

Another one I read recently that I enjoyed is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1104020#main]]). This one is pretty smutty, but it is also about working through trauma. This is the author of the fantastic and popular "Away Childish Things."

Both of these are slash, btw. Happy reading!

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Potter has fame and fortune and posh clothes and all he wants is a simple life. Draco has a flat and a cat and a steady job and all he wants is a complicated life. Which makes you think this story has something exciting like body-swapping, but it doesn't. Instead it has Indian takeaway and a blue jumper and people wanting a whole lot of what they can't have, discovering themselves as they discover each other.

  He's never been as clumsy with anything as he is with his affection for Deku. It's one of the only things that has ever truly left him speechless. When it gets really bad, Katsuki finds himself in bed, replaying their fights like a movie on the ceiling. He sees Deku's mangled body in his nightmares, jolts awake with saltwater vision and a lead tongue. He can never sleep after. On those nights, he spends hours upon hours fighting in the trenches of his self-induced mental warfare---what could I have done differently, how could I have protected him better, how do I pretend that I'd be able to live in a life that's not in Deku's shape.
