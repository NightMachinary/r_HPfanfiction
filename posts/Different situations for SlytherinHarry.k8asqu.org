:END:
In the fic the author writes different situations handled differently by a Slytherin Harry, the first chapter was Umbridge finding out about the defence club. And Harry gets out of any punishment because it the wordings state that any 'Organised' club is illegal, but the defence club was random so, not 'Organised' and therefore acceptable.

Would really like to read something like this too.

#+begin_quote
  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
