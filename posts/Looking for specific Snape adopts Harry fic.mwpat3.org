:END:
It is an old fic where Snape is kinder to young Harry, invites him to his country house, has a lot of Muggle stuff and listenes to Muggle music. He has a garden with plants and teaches Harry about potions and herbology. I pretty sure he also wears jeans outside of school, too.


** That sounds really nice

** Digging for the Bones by paganaidd has all these elements - except maybe “country” house. It's Spinner's End.

There is also Harry's New Home by kbinnz
