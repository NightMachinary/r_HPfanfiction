A couple of years back i read a fanfic where harry was left behind by ron and hermoine on the run looking for horcruxes. Harry gets in the lake with the sword of gryffindor, but gets saved by snape. Snape brings harry to his home where his goddaughter daphne greengrass is. They help harry destroy the horcruxes and harry and daphne fall in love. After harry defeats voldemort in hogsmeade, he and daphne fake their deaths.

I enjoyed that fic, but i dont remember the title and all other searches have come up with nothing. So if you can help me out, i'd be gratefull.
