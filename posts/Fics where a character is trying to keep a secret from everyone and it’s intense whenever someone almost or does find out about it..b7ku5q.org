It could be anything from secret power, secret identity, addiction, secret/embarrassing hobby, forbidden love, affair, secret pet, secret knowledge, secret past, etc. Anything secret!

Some fics I particularly liked are: - A Curse of Truth - Living Dangerously - Grow Young With Me


** I've got a wizard trying to make it in the muggle world here, keeping secrets from the POV character:

And here's someone whose career as a spy adds just one more layer to the multiple levels of secrets that comprise his life. He's lying to everyone, including himself:

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.

*** yeah, but i'm not a big fan of snape unfortunately. i don't really have much of a preference as long as the characters aren't too different from the books. i can hardly imagine canon!snape getting it on with hermione granger, or anyone for that matter.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
