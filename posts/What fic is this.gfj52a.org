I'm looking for the fic where Dark Lord Harry conducts a ritual to travel back in time to be with Hermione who had died. He goes back to the beginning of his fourth year and gives her a glass rose and asks her to be his girlfriend and the international quidditch competition. Thanks for any help ðŸ˜Š
