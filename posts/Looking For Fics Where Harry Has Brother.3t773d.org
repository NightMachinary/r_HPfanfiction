Yup, that's it. That's the only thing i'm asking. I don't care if it's NBWL, WBWL, alternate-dimension, time-travel, slash, bashing, Dramonie, H/HR, Dobby/Sock, Ron/Hedwig etc.

Ones i recall reading; linkffn(c'est la vie; Harry Potter and the boy who lived; the darkness within). I know i read a few more but i can't remember them atm.

P.S: I will read anything invariably, but i prefer fics with 70k words and i have no upper limit. It can be 700k words for all i care.


** Harry has a brother in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes I am Harry's Brother]] I think. It's been a while since I've read it though, so I'm not 100% on that.

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Also, basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
