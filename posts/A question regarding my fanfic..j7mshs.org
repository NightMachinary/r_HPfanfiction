I'm working on a fanfiction right now, and would like a second opinion on something.

I have an OC who becomes friends with Harry during their first year. This OC of mine has a famous parent and as such is used dealing with fame, so it would make sense for the OC to come to Harry's aid and help him deal with his one fame.

The thing is, I am not famous. I might have a general idea how to go about it, but would like to hear from you guys as well. What are some things I should keep in mind when the time for my OC to help Harry face his fame comes?


** I'm also not famous but I think the way the OC helps Harry deal with the fame will be determined on the kind of person the OC is. Is he like Gilderoy Lockhart and embraces the fame and likes to be center of attention? Is he more private and goes out of his way to make sure he stays out if the spotlight to the best of his abilities?

*** It's a bit more complicated than that because, while the OC prefers not to be put in the spotlight, he also takes a great pride in it. He looks up to his father a lot, and inspires to be like him in the future. If someone comes up to him and talks praises of his father, he doesn't feel uncomfortable at all. On the other hand, he doesn't flaunt his fame around. He wants to work hard and become a well known wizard through hard work just like his father did before him. He has to earn it in a sense.

**** In that case I think maybe the OC would tell Harry to embrace the fame because it's not going anywhere but to stay true to himself and focus on his own goals and not try to live up to what people say he should be. Maybe OC would give Harry tips on how to avoid any publicity if he really wants to be left alone sometimes. Or maybe if Harry is shy and unsure of himself when people come up to him and ask him questions about Voldemort, the OC would kind of step in and take over if he notices Harry isn't doing too well. Idk if that helps at all
