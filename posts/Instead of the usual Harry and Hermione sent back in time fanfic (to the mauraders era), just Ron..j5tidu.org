He doesn't get any clear help during the entire fanfic.

Imagine Lucius Malfoy like "red hair, hand me down clothes, must be a Weasley." Ron, who's just sweating on the spot says "No... my last name is Jenkins." "Oh! My apologises..."

Possible pairing.


** I could imagine that as funny.\\
Ron in his head "Bloody ... shit ... bloody ... fuck", you already know with his stage fright.\\
He tumbles from one faux pas to the next, sweating bullets all the time.\\
Was Jenkins not a colleague / friend of Arthur Weasley's, Ron accidentally gives Jenkins as his name and then sticks with it ... hehe.\\
Then he remembers his greatest strength ... the Cannons and all the games they lost and then he remembers other results and gets rich.\\
Just to finally understand how Harry feels all the gold in the world, just not his family with whom he can share his life, because he has live the lie too long.

** "Right, so welcome to Defence Against the Dark Arts. I'm Ronald McKentucky and I am here to teach you all how to stay alive in the face of incredible danger. Today, we will be learning about the many different highly illegal items that can be used to stay alive, learn how they could be used to stay alive and go through every step of making them in detail so you know when one of your mates is making something illegal so you can tell them to stop doing that."

"Umm..."

"Yes, Miss Prewett?"

"Isn't that... Illegal sir?"

"Surprisingly not. Anyway, gather around everybody so I can show you how to make this highly illegal magic carpet for the purpose of identifying when a magic carpet is being made. Ideal for escaping death eaters, but highly illegal. Now first, you need a carpet!"

"Alright people, gather around and present your reports. Ravenclaw, any luck on the Tom Riddle front?"

"He was a prefect and Head Boy, but he just vanishes after taking a job in Knockturn Alley."

"Yeah, fair enough. Slytherin, clues on the whereabouts of the chamber of secrets?"

"Maggie found something about piping? We still haven't figured out the relationship between that and 'bloode moste pure', but we think it's probably indicative that blood vessels are involved somehow."

"Ha, no. You're on the right track, though. I suggest you go ask Myrtle."

"What, Moaning Myrtle? What would she know about the Chamber of Secrets?"

"After decades just listening to bathroom gossip? Your guess is as good as mine. Now, Gryffindors. "Operation: keep the nerds alive! Status?"

"They're still alive, just a bit injured."

"That's the spirit. Don't coddle them or they start to think that running a resistance movement is a good idea. It isn't, by the way, so no trying that. Any concerns?"

"Lily keeps running potions experiments with that Snape kid!"

"It's alright. I'll talk to Sev about it, make sure he follows safety rules and stuff okay? Just stay out of it. Baby Gryffindors need space to grow. Now, Hufflepuff!"

"Sir!"

"Mapped out Hogwarts as I asked?"

"Here!"

"Great work, you win this week's round and get 10 points! Now, next challenge is for 20, so here goes:"

"Yeah?"

"Learn how to drive a car!"

"A what?"

"A car, sort of muggle broom... Thing. Can't fly though. I will give some lessons over the weekend, you'll get it in no time! Dead easy."

** Not sure if this fits, but it is time travel involving Ron without Harry or Hermione.

Auror Ron travels back in time. This is Ron/Voldemort. I usually avoid such parings, but this one is actually okay. Mostly it is just Tom ... having a crush. And no worries, Ron is not a pedophile.

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.
