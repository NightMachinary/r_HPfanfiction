Marriage Law Contract

And any other kind of tropes that you'd like to see different takes on?


** Ruthless spymaster Amelia Bones.

Amelia is used often to exonerate Sirius and get Harry away from the Dursleys and evil mustache twirling Dumbledore and deals with Harry's problems. I wanna see an Amanda Waller-esque Amelia where she agrees to help Harry, but sees him as an expendable asset in the fight against Voldemort. A cold spymaster willing to do whatever it takes.

** - Manipulative Dumbledore: What if the manipulation was actually for Harry's good? Dumbledore understands that the prophecy means Harry will have to die for Voldemort to truly be gone, so he decides to make the boy's life the best it can possibly be. Instead of some evil scheming mastermind, Dumbledore is doing things behind the scenes to help Harry make lots of friends, create happy memories, and maybe play wingman in his love life.
- Marriage Law Contract: Some sort of Home Economics-style class is taught (either required or an elective like Ancient Runes or Arithmancy) where students are paired off by the professor/randomly and have to play through being married for the duration of the year.
- Slytherin Harry: What if instead of some dark lord in training, or miniature politician, Harry gets sorted into Slytherin because of his cunning and potential as an outstanding future con man?

** Manipulative Dumbledore: Except he's not nearly as clever he thinks he is, and he's actually being manipulated by somebody even smarter, more cunning, and much more ruthless than he is, making him just a pawn in somebody's long game. Like Sybill Trelawney.

Weasley's using Harry for his money and fame.: Harry does everything in his power to become infamous, in a bad way, so while he's rich as fuck, the Weasleys end up getting dragged into the mud with him.

Marriage Law Contract: It's got all sorts of loopholes, so you end up with people marrying concepts, non-sapient creatures, and inanimate objects, including somebody who marries the very contract on which the marriage law contract is written.

Slytherin Harry: Slytherin Harry thinks going into Slytherin means everybody will know he's cunning and ambitious, but in reality, he's neither. All the really cunning and ambitious people end up in every other house, because who that is cunning and ambitious would want people to know they're cunning and ambitious?

Wrong Boy Who Lived: Harry's the Wrong Boy Who Lived in the sense that there's something incredibly unnatural about him that just feels like he's not even really a person at all.

It has a manipulative Dumbledore whom Harry hates up until chapter 23 where Dumbledore explains his actions. They have a fairly good relation after that.

Fics like these were Dumbledore isn't perfect, but he isn't an outright evil or Greater Good obsessed maniac. Rather, he makes misguided decisions which he thinks are for Harry's good.

** Harry inherits great & powerful artifacts...but so does everyone else. Some of the other kids' stuff is a lot better. (Slightly inspired by how all the kids get given a 'useful' item at the start of Battle Royale)

1st year Ginny co-opts Riddle onto her side & uses his experience & ingenuity to enrich the Weasleys and disenfranchise former Death Eaters. Ultimately she helps him gain a new body. Even better if its done without dark!Ginny & with a somewhat rehabilitated Riddle.

Competent!Lockhart befriends Harry & actually becomes an ally against Dumbledore &/ the corrupt Ministry.

Instead of having an obsessive interest in his dad, its his mom who Harry is fascinated by. Turns out that she herself made some interesting artifacts a la the Marauders map & had her own circle of interesting friends like Moony, Wormtail and Padfoot. (Stands to reason if the latter 4 had secret activities that no-one knew about)

Instead of Harry being famous for being The-Boy-Who-Lived, the credit goes to Lily - and by extension, her surviving family members. The Dursleys overnight become wizarding royalty and it becomes fashionable to have muggle relatives and a mixed family, leading to a total reversion of the wizarding world from what we know in canon.

He faces a coalition of all of his neighbours, smashes Denmark within months and utterly destroys the Russian Army at age 18, spends the next decade wiping the floor with Saxony and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia, fails to make favourable peace before overcommitting into a Russian campaign, loses almost everything, has to spend years in exile, rides across Europe in 15 days, picks up his birthright again, then dies and 300 years later a band makes an album about his exploits?
