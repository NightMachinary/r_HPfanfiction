Has anyone else here read so much fan fiction that when they come across an authors name they immediately know it will be a good one? I definitely have favourite authors even if I haven't read all their work.


** There are two kinds of authors that I take notice of:

- Authors who consistently have story premises that are memorable, executed with engaging characters and writing style, and ultimately deliver on the idea they promised. The first author that comes to mind is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]]. When I see HP crossover works by them, I don't hesitate or skip over as I usually would.

- Authors who consistently finish stories. They may not have story premises that are memorable and draw me in, but the writing and characterization is competent, but follow a complete arc/plotline, even if I don't like the subject matter. The first author that comes to mind for this one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lomonaaeren/pseuds/Lomonaaeren][Lomonaaeren.]]. Some interesting stories, and also some explicit porny stuff that I'm not interested in.

** For me, there are a few authors whose fics I've enjoyed so much that I would now read anything by them, even if the story is in a fandom I care nothing about or revolves arround tropes that are normally not to my taste. I trust them to take any premise imaginable and turn it into a good story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Carnivorous_Muffin/series][The Carnivorous Muffin]] is the best example for me since she has written so many crazy crossovers. In my experience, regardless of how absurd the summaries look at first glance, her fics always turn out to be stellar. Her SI fics are the only SI fics I've enjoyed reading, because she always deconstructs the usual tropes ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499401/chapters/35981172][example]]), and she even manages to make something great out of a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20331721/chapters/48207466][Harry Potter/Little Mermaid crossover]].

In other fandoms, there are a few authors for whom I would read anything they write and know it's going to be excellent without even glancing at the summary. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Shadowlurker13/pseuds/Shadowlurker13][Shadowlurker13]] is one of those for her unusual /Labyrinth/ fanfics, including a surprisingly excellent [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11120619/][Chronicles of Amber/Labyrinth]] crossover. (I haven't even read any of the /Chronicles of Amber/ novels, but I still loved the fic.) Another of my favorite authors is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4078374/ninepen][ninepen]], because she has written so many excellent Loki focused fics in the Avengers fandom. In particular, her main fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8293519/1/Beneath][Beneath]], is a behemoth clocking in at over 1.5 million words long and still nowhere close to completion. The author stretches the idea of "slow burn" to previously unseen lengths, but the fic still managed to hold my fascination even when entire chapters focus on conversations between characters with moments of action spaced few and far between.

** Kinda alternatively, you see an author's name (e.g. JackPotr back in the day) and already know the progression of events, the characters and the basic plotline because they are reused again and again in all of their works.

** And then you have authors (I look at your direction, Northumbrian) who deliver always first class stories, but over half of their stories are unfinished and never to be finished. Oh well.

** No, and I'd rather read something without any a priori knowledge anyway.

There are some authors whose works I'm quite certain I won't like before even reading it tho, does that count ?

** I know anything by Ebenbild will have an interesting premise and a fairly executed plot.

Ebenbild might have a quite a bit of bashing in her longer stories but the one shots she make are very good. I think she is very marvelous because she manages to always capture a real feeling of mystery in her works

You might not like her longer stories but her short stories are definetly awesome!

** VonPelt mostly publishes one-shots, and all of them are delightful with solid takes on the characters. I check out any of his stories as soon as I see he published something.

*** Going by your flair, you are the author of Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting and Departure from the Diary, right?

If you are then, I just wanted to let you know that you're one of those writers that I drop whatever I am doing to read your work. You honestly got me into Harry and fem-voldemort fanfics because I just enjoyed the dynamic of the two from Departure from the Diary.

*** I have two longer fics as well, one just shy ^{of} ^{^{100k}} ^{^{^{words...}}}

Oh who am I kidding, the cracky premises done somewhat seriously in under 10k are my trademark thing. And it's not helping that I have a lot of WiP oneshots which will be finished eventually simply because I write them when I'm annoyed at the way a fic (or canon) handles something.

**** While the oneshots are what you're known for, your longer fics are both very good. I love how /No Longer Alone/ builds with the idea of Harry becoming closer friends with Katie and Leanne, who are both underused characters in fanfiction.

** Sometimes, I'll come across a work and recognise the author as someone whose work is usually good. More often, I'll check the author of a story with a brilliant summary/blurb, and it'll be one of the ones that I know to avoid like the plague.

** White Squirrel and Temporal Knight are definitely a few of them for me.

Then there are those authors who always have a lot of interesting story ideas but I avoid like the plague because they seem completely unable to pick a story and actually finish it. /cough DZ2 cough/

** See, that's not always the case. My favorite author is Robst (Harry crow) and he has some other fics that I really like, but there are some that are just overly cringy. He has a few that I've tried multiple times to read, but just can't.
