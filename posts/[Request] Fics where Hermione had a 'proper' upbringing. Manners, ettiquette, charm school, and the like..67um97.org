Looking for fics where Hermione really is prim and proper. She doesn't have to be aghast at rude behavior in her peers because she knows that not everyone was raised like she was.

Romance is a plus.

It doesn't have to be the focus of the fic, in fact I welcome it being a quirk of hers. However, it could be something that catches the notice of those around her.

Almost any pairing is fine but NO Hermione/Ron. I just... don't like them together.

Recent examples I've come across include:

A Dog's Loyalty - HG/TN - linkffn(11091364)

True Gentlemen - Gen. - linkffn(7024588)

One-shots, multi-chapter fics, and epics are welcome. Completed fics are preferred.


** Sorry I don't have a recommendation for you but I just had to say thank you for introducing me to this interpretation of Hermione. I didn't know I wanted to read more stories like these until I tried your examples.

It's been a while since I've found something I haven't come across in the fandom before so it was a real treat. Thank you!

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 'Purebloods' in this story were actually British aristocrats. Ron (Wellesley) was the grandson of Duke of Wellington, and Arthur was the Marquis of Douro. Hogwarts taught all kinds of classes about deception and infiltration, so Hermione had no problems fitting in the posh aristocratic circle after a few months.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Magical Britain was a highly feudal society with a caste system. After the Troll incident, Hermione owed Harry a life debt and became his retainer. In the public, she had to behave in a deferential and subservient manner, which she greatly resented.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny][Roundabout Destiny]], linkffn(8311387): Hermione reincarnated as James Potter's twin sister.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Grangers adopted Harry early, and Dumbledore brought Tonks in touch with them, who then taught them about rules and etiquettes in magical Britain. It also turned out that Hermione descended from a squib line of the former Minister of Magic Fawley. As a result, both Harry and Hermione behaved significantly more diplomatic and social at the School.

*** I've got to second Roundabout Destiny. It's got Hermione raised as a pureblood, and an interesting take on the war with Voldemort. The pairing is Hermione/Sirius.

**** I liked the story overall, but there wasn't really much of Hermione left there. None of her drive for muggle values and ideals. The fixation on entering marriage as a pure virgin was the most obvious example of that.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I think this one works? Hermione was taken from her actual family when she was young and grew up as a Malfoy at their Manor. There she was taught how to act like a good mannered pure blood. She isn't a main character though.
