I'm looking for fics that could pass for published novels, or very close to that level of quality.

It's really hard to read "normal" fics after reading fics like linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle), which raise the bar so high that most other fics feel "meh" a few paragraphs in.

So - what are the most well-written fics you've ever read? I suppose I'm coming at this from more of a "writing quality" angle than a "creative plot" angle, but from what I've noticed, the latter tends to follow from the former.


** Sesc's stuff is publishable-quality writing, especially for the genre he's writing in. There are bits of Sister, Mine that are easily publishable quality.

Phantom Limb has large swaths of publishable quality writing, though the pace/plot has some issues.

Forging the Sword comes pretty close, as does A Long Journey Home. Purely on a writing level, if you compare it to actual published stuff it wouldn't... stand out, necessarily, but it's easily in the ballpark.

An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley comes very, very close, especially with the little canon-esque touches and the parsimony of detail.

The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks, especially some of the later sections.

Obviously Inverarity's other HP thing Hogwarts Houses Divided would be up there.

**** Sesc:

linkffn(Sister, Mine by SeriousScribble)

linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) an excellent detective type novel by Sesc

linkffn(A Beautiful World by SeriousScribble) and linkffn(Black and White by SeriousScribble) are two very well written shorts about some side characters during the HP series.

I don't really know anything about Phantom Limb.

linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow)

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

linkffn(An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley) and linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks) are both favorites of mine that most people like regardless of ship/genre.

And last, but not least, linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity)

** Another one, i feel is *Arabella's Very Secret Diary,* which i find could have been sold as a companion short story to CoS. Exploring CoS! from Ginny's perspectives through her diary entries and conversations with Tom Riddle, it is a horror story about the gradual loss of one's will and one that still holds up 15 years later. The only quibble, of course is that it predicted Ginny's full name as Virginia and not Ginerva. This is one fic that will make you even more furious at Tom Riddle and does show a little of his charisma that many fics don't quite explore.

** Linkffn(The Black Prince) My favourite GoT/HP fanfic so far. I'm not a big fan of the whole making Harry a son of Robert or a Stark, and yet the writing style hooked me right in.

I'm afraid many of the fics I really like are either discontinued or they are not quite where I want them to be in terms of writing quality. I generally weigh both writing quality and plot highly, but with a good enough plot I can overlook certain things in the writing.

Ember_Rising recommended Steelbadger's LotR/HP crossover, and I have to agree on that. He really knows his lore in terms of the Lord of the Rings.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

**** I agree that pureblood pretense could use an editor (every fic could, including the others mentioned in this thread), "too many words" is a very, very common failing in the fantasy world. Personally, I don't find murkybluematter's overabundance of words any worse than a number of published fantasy authors like Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, Steven Erickson or Terry Goodkind. As with any opinion, YMMV.

**** I do think that 250k words is a lot, but I don't think anything that is added doesn't do it justice. I believe that it helps develop the characters and minor details are usually important later on in the series.

I do think she might end up changing small things though - I remember her mentioning in book 3 that she was going to edit 1 and 2 to match her newer quality/ writing style.

** linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) and linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) both seem well written to me. They're clever H/Hr slow-burn romances.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) and linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) are two Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossovers that are very well written. The author has a very strong grasp of Tolkien's style and world. Shadow is WIP but Power is complete.

linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match) gets points for its unique format and cleverly set-up humor.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) is a tearjerker that has some excellent parts which flow almost like poetry.

** I read a ton of HP fanfiction on fanfiction.net and very rarely favourite them. This is my most recent favourite. I thought the writing was great and I really loved the way the author kept it canon for the most part and followed the book, but changed things enough to take it the direction they wanted to. Even events that the author had changed the general idea of them still happened just in a different way. It was so cool! I was very excited to find this one, I recommend it

*** Because HPMOR isn't really publishable. The way it's written, whilst very compelling, wouldn't work published.

For instance, there's no real structure (especially for the first 15ish chapters), it moves too slowly, is too long (and would be difficult to break up because of the way it's written), and focuses too much on non-story aspects that are fine when you're using e-ink, which costs almost nothing, but would need extensive cutting when each page adds to the cost/intimidation factor of people picking it up.

If it could be published, it might well succeed - but that would be because it has already built an audience which could then market it. To get it to "publishable" would require endless cuts. (I've steered away from quality because that's an argument I'd rather not get into.)

Comparing that to AQ, Unatoned, What Lies Beneath, or Forging the Sword, which could be published with minimal edits if not for the pesky existence of Rowlings work, and the difference is immense.
