Fanfiction.net has a horrible problem with a plagiarist in the HP section! I am appalled that they are doing nothing and making money off of this thief. I know I and several others have been reporting this problem for weeks. Only one account has been removed. And that was because of threatening and obscene emails this person sent from one account. By his poor spelling and grammer in emails, it is the same plagiarist. He copies and pastes the originals, posting and updating at the same times daily. Please contact the site. The next story he steals may be yours. He has hit FFN, AO3 and many other sites. Help me stop this thief. And make FFN accountable to follow their own rules and guidelines. Again, the stolen stories might be yours! The thief goes by: Roger23, TheRooster23, Wizard97, ThePotterRuler, HallowsSeeker2, Avengers3443, Scm3543, Justin52, Arian2423, Hadrian325, Mythrocker, Edit: Rapier124 also

Please forgive my formating. Noob here. The rules for the correct way to report is in their guidelines. Please check this out and report! The stories he has stolen or might steal next might be yours!


** It does no good. There's next to no moderation on FFN. You can report the same story 100 times, and he will be back posting within 10 minutes. Or he will just make a new account and do it again.

*** The worst part about it is that half of the comments (the one's that aren't accusations of plagiarism) are 'great story keep it up'. And these aren't unpopular fics. I've seen Runemaster, To Shape and Change, etc. all reposted word for word.
