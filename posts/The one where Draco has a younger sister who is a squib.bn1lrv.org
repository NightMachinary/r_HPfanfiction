Need some help re-finding a story.

​

The main things / scene I remember are as follows:

- I feel like it was a either a Ravenclaw or Slytherin Harry
- Harry kinda championed the cause of the Squibs as still being able to contribute to Wizarding Society with things like carving runes and brewing potions not requiring 'active magic' the same way as Charms or something.
- As the title says, the Malfoy's had a second child who was a squib and was pretty much hidden away at home
- The Elder Malfoy's may have been/become redeemed... though Draco was still his juvenile prattish self
- ​

​

The one scene I remember takes place in the Great Hall. Harry invites the Malfoy's to bring their daughter so he can prove his "Squibs can do some magic too" theory; he assists her in drawing some runes and brewing a potion. Harry only uses his magic to 'activate' them.

​

Sound familiar to anyone?

“How did I help Isabelle create a potion and a runic shield?” Harry asked to clarify.

*** Aha! Thank you!

​

I had vaguely thought of this one, as I also kinda thought I remembered Harry having a study club thing and Astoria having a potion-off against Draco (leading to my comment about him being a juvenile prat) but I had convinced myself I was mashing two stories together.

**** I wish there was a continuation to this story, or just an expanded story line to this. Found and read it on .fanficauthors.net last month and its one of my favorites off all the author sites there, outside of Bobmin's work, who sadly passed away.

  We've been led to believe that Draco Malfoy is an only child, but that may not be entirely true. If so, then where is his sibling?
