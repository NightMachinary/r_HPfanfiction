Hey, I'm looking for some fics where Snape has a family but he has to take Harry in for whatever reason. I've read a few (one stands out where Snape isn't very nice to Harry but his children and wife are nice) but I can't seem to find any of them! Thanks


** This sounds like a neat idea! :o I've never read any fics like this! :)

** While not completely on point Reboot by Kallanit has Snape, Harry, and Hermione all go back in time. While Snape does not "raise" Harry he is a favorite uncle and has a lot of interaction with Harry and Hermione as they grow up. So Snape returns just before his attendance at Hogwarts and then Harry and Hermione return at their birth but full awareness/memories follow a bit later.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** There's one on Potions & Snitches where Snape has a son and takes in Harry. I read it a long time ago so I can't really vouch for quality, but I enjoyed it at the time. [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2948&textsize=0&chapter=1][Here it is]].
