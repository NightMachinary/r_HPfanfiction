As the title says. I am relatively new to the fandom... I mean i've been reading and re reading the books since the first one's first edition came out in my country, Italy (and every time a sequel came out me and my twin wrestled for the right to reread first the previous books, while our older sister had the birthright to first read the new one xD ) , and I've been sporadically reading fanfics for about a decade, but until very recently I've never involved myself in forums or sites where it is discussed so a lot of tags and lingo go over my head. Seeing the tag here in reddit some weeks ago, and the fics that were linked in one of those posts i thought the indy meant a Harry that exhibits Indiana Jones traits, like exploring jungles ans ruins to gather artifacts, knowing ancient runes and stuff.

What about you? What did you think the indy meant the first time you saw the words "Indy!Harry"?

*** 'Independent', as in he follows no factions, neither accepting Dumbledore nor Voldemort. Sort of a grey Harry, between light and dark magics. Often helped by goblins or other creatures and with lots of bashing of major canon characters.

**** when I first saw the tag, I didn't know what it meant until I clicked into it and began reading the story and in the beginning it described harry as being Indian since the Potter last name comes from India. It made sense and that interpretation of it has stuck with me ever since. I think that's what indy!harry usually means.

**** There's one I have that I'll try find it the morning - It's near-midnight here in the UK and I'm a tad tipsy atm, so my google-fu is sadly lacking - where Bill and Amelia Bones get together (after Amelia gets custody of Harry and he moves into Bones Manor) and raise Harry that way. Bill talks about how he would've tried to get custody of the kid if it'd been anyone else but Amelia.

Harry mentions having met Bill in Diagon Alley early on and them developing a mentor-ish relationship that way. The kid was semi-involved with Susan, IIRC.

** I thought it meant Indian- like from the country India. Though I've seen it used more often with indie games when the developers are independent. English is not my first language and I've come to seriously despise any and all forms of abbreviations and initials. It only takes a moment to write out whole words. Every fandom has different slang. And those japanese cartoons and comics are often left half untranslated so you need a dictionary. GG, ez.

Oh, and another one- AK stands for Avtomat Kalashnikova. I was really, really confused when I read a sentence along the lines of "Voldemort threw an AK"- I imagined Voldemort physically throwing the muggle gun. For the love of all that is holy please, please do not use abbreviations or short hand or initials in fics. I can understand using them in the summary or personal messages or in forums like here. But please not in the actual text.

*** To be fair, there are a ton of considerations that go into translating a Japanese comic, from common issues like terms without equivalent translations (this is especially crucial for character driven stories, where nuance can be critical to understanding what's going on) to medium-specific issues like spacing (Japanese text in text bubbles are usually written vertically, so translators need to be hyper-aware of their word choice in order to maintain readability). There may be any number of reasons why a term may be left untranslated. That being said, in a good translation, an explanatory translator's note will be in a nearby margin (/not at the end of each volume,/ /^{<cough, cough>}/ /translators of the Evangelion manga!/).

Yeah, that's how the Harry Potter books were translated in Bulgarian- the names of characters, places, spells were spelled out the way they sound and their meaning was explained in footnotes. Russian on the other hand is a mess. I tried reading a crack fic about a manipulative Dumbledore once, but the names are just... crazy. Harry is Garry, Hermione is Germiona, Ravenclaw is Kogtevran, Hufflepuff is Puffendui, Slytherin is Slyzerin. I think only Gryffindor was recognizable.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
