I've gotten into the mood for some good stories with a werewolf Ron. Not really with him being the main focus of the story but being prominent in the story. Sort of like those alternate year seven fic's where the trio are searching for the horcruxes and Ron get's bitten sometime during the story.


** If you haven't already read Seventh Horcrux, Ron being a Werewolf is one of the running gags. It's not too important to the story, but I would so recommend it anyways.

**** Off the top of my head, I'd say no because it has accurate horcruxes in it (I think). It might have been editted heavily though, or have the same name as another fic written before the 7th and 8th books.

** I've only seen two fics with a werewolf Ron. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11167912/1/Power-Of-The-Wolf]]) has this but since I haven't read it myself I can't comment on quality or how much the perspective focuses on him.

The only other one I recall was smut. Unless you'd be interested in that I'll go trawling livejournal for it.

Bitten and marked my life took a turn I never had expected. And it was pretty wicked. New powers and weapons. New friends, more like family at this point. My adventure begins.
