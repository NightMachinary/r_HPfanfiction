Hello there! I don't know if this is the right place but I'm gonna ask anyway :)

I've been searching for a fic for a bit but I can't seem to find it. It's a HPDM in which Harry is an Auror and Draco is placed in his custody. They live together in Harry's apartment because of this and, although at first they don't get along, they end up getting together. There are some darker tones, it's not a happy/comic fic. It's not new, I must have read it at least 3 years ago, but I don't remember whether it was new at the time or not.

Thank you in advance if you'll remember about anything that sounds like this :)
