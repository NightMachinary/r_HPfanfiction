Just read this while in the hospital and absolutely LOVED its start. Sadly it appears to have been abandoned. The independent (and somewhat powerful) Harry working under the noses of many and attempting to alter his destiny, combined with a Honks setup that looks like it was going to be very believable and not silly.

Does anyone have any suggestions for similar stories? Believable Honks stories with either a more independent, powerful, or smart Harry? Would prefer mature fics, and open to multi relationships (so like a Fleur/Tonks/Harry), although would prefer just Honks.

Thanks!
