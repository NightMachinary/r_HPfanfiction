Re-reading the Philosopher's Stone and I read the quote from Dumbledore, "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally the whole school knows."

It made me think. just how much of Harry's adventures are common knowledge. Do they know that Quirrell was possessed by Voldemort's soul. Would they know about the Horcrux that Lucius allowed into the school through the diary. Did it become public knowledge that Pettigrew betrayed the Potters while SIrius was Harry's godfather.

What was actually known by students and what remained a secret?


** In chapter 16 of Order of the Phoenix, Neville knows that they saved the stone from Voldemort (though I don't know if he knew about the possession specifically). If Neville knows, then the rest of the school would know.

** Harry had to clarify with the DA members on what was actually fact during Ootf. I imagine everyone heard the true story, along with dozens of others. It seemed to be very impactful when Harry clarified that it had been Voldemort on the back of Quirrel's head, so it's likely that even if people had heard it, most didn't actually believe it.

** Year 1, probably everything Ron and Hermione witnessed was common knowledge, which means the students had a pretty good idea of what was in the obstacle course. (Percy was openly talking about "McGonagall's giant chess set.")

They had to know Quirrell was involved because he's the one who died/disappeared. As [[/u/Lord-Potter-Black][u/Lord-Potter-Black]], mentioned, Neville knew the Philosopher's Stone was involved (even though that seems one of the least likely things to get out). And Ron and Hermione could have told people their suspicion that Voldemort was involved, so it could have been everything except for Quirrell being possessed.

Year 2, I suspect a lot less, or at least a highly distorted story to protect Ginny. The students were probably told that the monster was a basilisk and that Harry killed it (and that Hagrid was innocent). I'm not sure what Dumbledore would have said publicly about the Heir/Heir's agent that would have satisfied the students, though. He probably wouldn't have mentioned the diary; yet, people could do a headcount and determine that no one was expelled.

Year 3, Harry would have told everyone who would listen the truth about Sirius and Peter. Unfortunately, very few people listened, and he didn't actually get much opportunity. But everything before the time turner was probably there for people who wanted to know.
