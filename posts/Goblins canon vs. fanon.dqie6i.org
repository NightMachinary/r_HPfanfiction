So I was curious why in most fanfics featuring goblins they are portrayed as a warrior race? When as far as I remember they were not in the actual books. My own personal opinion was that they were blacksmiths and craftsmen, due to the whole goblin forged swords and such.


** The first time the goblins are introduced, it's with a threat written on the Gringott's front door:

#+begin_quote
  "Enter, stranger, but take heed

  Of what awaits the sin of greed,

  For those who take, but do not earn,

  Must pay most dearly in their turn"
#+end_quote

The ominous effect keeps going when Harry sees how protective the goblins are about their treasure. They're not just harmless tiny craftsmen, they have a cruel streak. They're not warriors of the "Noble Warrior" mould like centaurs are, but they have no problem with violence.

#+begin_quote
  Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

  Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. "If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.

  "How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.

  "About once every ten years," said Griphook, *with a rather nasty grin.*
#+end_quote

Fanon takes hold of this makes it so that goblins have an elaborate culture with long, drawn-out greetings that people have to get right if they want to make friends. "May your axes stay sharp and your vaults flow with gold!" and other dumb lines... /That/ isn't part of the books. But the goblins having a culture different from wizards /is/ canon.

** To be honest, when one says goblins I normally think of the Uruk Hai of Tolkien. That and crafting and weapon smithing goes hand in hand. A part of me thinks of them as similar to the ferengi. Therefore my fanon tend to be a mixture of that. Greedy warrior race.

Further more goblins exist is many different cultures in myths, that and that fantasy tend to portray them a lot. Most would view Hp goblins as either a civilised version. Most depictions are grotesque mischievous greedy gold hoarding creatures, most fantasy settings use them a enemy fodder thus warrior.

Hobgoblins and brownies mixed together become houseelf so that British European depiction is out of the window. So that traditional version is out.

Redcaps is also called a Goblin by mythology but in Hp they are a magical creature so not that depiction.

Erl-king in germanic version in myth is a goblin king along the lines of Jareth from labyrinth who is a high fae. But the fae, elves and goblin are often catergorized different in Hp fics.

In wizards of coast version tend to be a tribal creatures or some neutral creatures motivated by gold. A term loot goblin came out on stuff like these (dnd player who want all the loot). They tend to be starter enemies.

But all in all most depictions are they are not good nor belevolent creature, so a prevalent depiction of tribal and greedy nature of goblins is quite hard to overcome especially when the description of Hp canon goblin is reminiscent of a modern depiction of fantasy Dwarves/dwarrows with the exception of the links to money. Thus, it is easy to think them as greedy version of dwarves since they are called goblins definitely not dwarves. Dwarves are the go to mythical craftsmen and is a warrior race (Norse myth), Hp goblins tend to get the same treatment just removing the noble, honour and more brutish version like dwarves more reminiscent of darker tales about goblins.

** That's, I think, derived from the constant mentions of "Goblin rebellions" and Goblins' bad tempers; people theorize that they are a warrior race /at heart/ who were forced into menial services by the Wizards, but long to go back to their old ways. It's not canon, but it fits the evidence.

*** Goblins in the book/Rowling's supplemental material seem rather cruel and duplicitous.

You could make the argument that it's not representative of them, but reneging on deals and negotiating property deals despite having different definitions of ownership seems suspect to me.

I refuse to read helpful goblin fics because it's a terrible plot device and it denotes a poor understanding of canon, but while Rowling's books are filled with allegories to historical oppression, I don't think Goblins belong to the category.

't any rate, the best reading of the Goblins' immoral actions is in my opinion that /they/ are the horribly specist blighters, even moreso than the wizards. Not inherently evil, but culturally every bit as prejudiced against humans as Death Eaters are against muggle-borns. More broad-minded Goblins exist, but they get fired from Gringotts because it's institutionalized. (See: the emigrant Goblins in /Fantastic Beasts/.)

***** Oh no I got what you were saying, I just /love/ debating and discussing canon. As for them being warriors, I'm not sure. We really don't have much knowledge of them except as bankers and smiths. I suppose you could use medieval folklore, but that would make them even worse.

I think fantastic beasts actually did some things well, although the half elf woman implies dubious consent.

For instance magical america being more against muggle-wizard marriages was a well-thought plot point.

It's not impossible for one to imagine a sweet romance between a free Elf and a wizard. I once dabbled with a completely wacky fic idea where instead of a Muggle(born), Andromeda falls in love with Kreacher's grandson, and things happen.

Either way, though, while dark, the idea of wizard-on-house-elf /droit du seigneur/ is also sadly plausible.

********** I can't imagine where someone as sheltered and from as oppressive a household as Andromeda would even meet a Muggle. At least Ted being a muggleborn would mean they'd have relative freedom to interact at Hogwarts. I think people who grow up in predominantly liberal (as in the actual meaning and not politically) atmospheres underestimate how difficult it is to break the mold when you come from a background like this, particularly when you don't have legal and financial freedom.

***** I wasn't referring to Tolkien's goblins specifically. I was speaking in a broader sense. The most obvious examples I would mention:

- Orcs are a race of bad guys that are irredeemable. Killing them is morally okay in just about any situation.
- All the "bad guy" humans are vaguely Middle-Eastern or Asian.
- Numenoreans are a literal master race of humans, and their blood being diluted with "lesser" humans is seen as a tragedy.

Debatable. They are certainly seen as such by the characters in-story though.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think if it ever happened that Orcs went to meet humans/elves under truce it wouldn't be okay. Or if humans/elves went to Mordor and happened upon an Orc family peacefully tending to their fields (Do they have fields? Or families?). It just so happens that pretty much every Orc we ever hear about is an enemy combatant doing combat things in a war. There's no reason why killing them would not be morally justified. Just like (assuming our morals and not Orc morals) it is morally justified for the Orcs to kill human or elven soldiers who they fight in battle but it is not morally justified for Orcs to kill human/elven civilians.

I agree on the other parts, they are quite unfortunate. And while I might usually point out that in that time racism was rather common and perfectly acceptable, Tolkien was pretty explicitly against any concept of race or racial superiority.

***** Movies yes, but in the books less so. They're cruel money hoarders, which is more of a banker stereotype.

Although you could argue that jewish stereotypes originate from pre-secrecy goblin stereotypes that just moved to other bankers as a result of whatever magical confusion that made all the muggles forget about magic.

** I am not sure about this but I have always thought that the trope of helpful!badass! Goblins came about before Deathly Hallows. Until then we didn't really know much about Goblins except for that great verse in the first book, that they seemed to rebel all the time, and the fact that they made amazing swords like the Sword of Gryffindor (which was also seen as much more important and relevant than it actually turned out to be.) They are also one of the most important aspects of Wizarding history, like when Hermione mentions some facts about Hogsmeade. So there can be a lot of reasons for that sort of portrayal.

Goblins are definitely badass, though. I mean, they enslave dragons and (possibly, dunno if fanon and Canon are messed up for me here) trolls. They turned out to be very different As Bill says, their way of thinking is entirely dissimilar to human beings. But even then I think with the right set up Goblins can be very interesting as a warrior race.

*** There are a lot of things that I disagree with in Harry Potter. The portrayal of the goblins is one of them. I don't think the Sword of Gryffindor was all that amazing, just particularly famous in Britain. Another thing is goblin steel is made out to be kinda O.P. It takes in only that which makes it stronger? There is a lot of ways that can be abused.

I think my problem is that it goes against the common belief about goblins. In main stream media, goblins are vicious, greedy creatures who have a tendency to rape human woman. They are not particularly skilled in anything in specific.

In Harry Potter, however, they are relatively civilized, if sadistic, people that are exceptionally skilled in banking and smithing.
