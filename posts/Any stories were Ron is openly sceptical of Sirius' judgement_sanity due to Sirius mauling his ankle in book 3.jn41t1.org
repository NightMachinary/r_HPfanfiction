It would be an interesting tension to play with. Harry's desire for a family. Rons place as his best friend. Sirius being dismissive of the whole incident. The double standard in who gets second chances and so on.


** I could see Ron teasing Sirius with this incident whenever they see him

â€˜Ya sure you don't want a bone to gnaw on Padfoot?'

Send him bones for Christmas

*** True. But the point is, that Sirius in his animagus form, literally mauled Ron's ankle. Whether you're from a magical or non-magical household, you're gonna remember that for life.

**** Man, what story was it where part of the reason the magical world was so insane was because they basically had medical obliviations to deal with instances of pain, thus forgetting the consequences of their actions.

Anyway, on topic, I think you're right that he'd be traumatized by it, but I wonder how much of that could be mitigated by finding out the person/dog who mailed your ankle was also trying to get rid of the serial killer/terrorist that slept in your bed for 3 years. Honestly, that was just a really shitty day for Ron.

***** I think that despite the affects of the obliviate charm, the human brain has a really funny way of remembering them. Honestly, I think obliviate is really over powered and instead of erasing it completely, the effect of the spell should be suppressing the memory really deep into one's subconscious, but the risk is that in a Deja Vu scenario the memory will bounce back with full force.

I can only imagine the confusion (and horror) of Fred and George every time they saw a fellow called Peter Pettigrew sleeping with Ron in his bed. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

** I've never heard of any story like this that isn't straight out bashing, but it would be interesting to play with. One concern I have is that it might be a bit OOC for Ron. Seems more like something Molly or Arthur (as concerned parents) or Hermione (skeptical of the rationality of Sirius' actions) would do to me. Ron has a unique position though.

** I always feel that Ron's apparent lack of anger towards Sirius is a bit unrealistic. Not just for attacking him as a dog and breaking his leg, but also for breaking into the dorm and standing over him with a knife. I don't think Sirius apologised for either of those things in canon?

Who was not getting a second chance here?

For the record, I haven't seen this beforehand, but I'm intrigued by the idea. But yeah, as said elsewhere, I'd prefer it without bashing, which just renders the entire character study pointless.

*** In canon, Harry has strong reaction to finding out about Dumbledore's seedy past as seen below.

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Oh, yeah,' said Ron at once, â€˜people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were different, it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really young when they --' (/DH CH:20/)

  â€˜Our age,' said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.
#+end_quote

Here Harry isn't willing to excuse people for their past choices. It's something he's had to deal with in regards to his father's bullying too.

But Harry has a double standard where Sirius is concerned. Harry never confronted the fact that Sirius chose revenge over protecting Harry. He never criticised Sirius for his ridiculous dramatics in third year:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜Did you hear me?' Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. â€˜You'll have to kill all three of us!'

  â€˜There'll only be one murder here tonight,' said Black, and his grin widened. (/POA CH:17/)
#+end_quote

Hell, Harry had to be talked into understanding the Sirius was a shit to Kreacher.

But Ron no doubt thought he was being dragged to a messy death that night and I don't care how long it took Madam Pomfrey to heal him, he still spent hours with a broken and bleeding leg, after being dragged the best part of a miles by that very same leg!

That's more than enough to traumatise a 13 year old. To colour a young teens impression of a person going forward. So it's Harry's double standards that Ron would be revealing.

**** it's true that harry /does/ have a double standard, but this boy also doesn't really have any (sort of) functional adults that also deeply care about him. he's pretty much going to accept anything from them because he wants and also needs that type of adult in his life, regardless of his mistrust of authority figures.
