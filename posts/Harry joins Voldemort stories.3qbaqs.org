Give me the best stories in which Harry joins Voldemort or is a pureblood supremacist kind. Preferably not slash, but I'll take those too.


** I recall a story where Harry goes back in time from a dystopian future where muggles discovered the wizarding world and either terminated or enslaved them (don't recall which). I believe that technology had a similarly disruptive effect on magic use as magic did on technology (such as at Hogwarts).

He goes back in time to the Marauder's era to help Voldemort kill muggles before they can destroy the wizarding world/magic. I remember that the Slytherins still attending school stopped picking fights and stopped hating muggleborns, focusing on their planned extermination of muggles instead, causing people to get suspicious of the sudden turnaround.

I also recall that Harry was implanted with a tracker that disrupted Apparition and got it removed at St. Mungos. He was unable to speak due to torture/maiming so used Voldemort's fire trick to write letters. I believe it was planned to be slash, but am not 100% sure about that.

I do recall it being well-written and an interesting enough premise for me to overcome my distaste for a HP/LV pairing, but don't remember the name of the fic or whether it had been abandoned or not.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7099890/3/Eden][This]] is the fic you mentionned, where he has some muggle tech in his body that dicrupts magic and he goes to St Mungo's.

  Slash. Dumbledore could go hang. Even if all the magical world were to hate and revile him, he would go back and help Voldemort destroy Muggle-kind, before they destroyed the world, again. VERY DARK.

**** That's the one. Like I said, it's a pity it's abandoned. Also, despite the author's predilection for writing slash, they're good enough at writing for me to enjoy their fics regardless.

This is the one that comes to mind. I know there are others, most of which have the word "Darkness" in the title, or slash, so I can't really recommend most of them.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
