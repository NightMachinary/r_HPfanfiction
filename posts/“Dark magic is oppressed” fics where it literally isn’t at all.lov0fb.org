“All of our culture and dark magic has been made illegal by Dumbledore, who is evil,” complains Lord Lucius Malfoy.

“Yes,” agrees Lord Theodore Nott Sr. “We, the rich pureblood elite who can get away with literally anything, are the oppressed ones.”

Behind them, Lord Greengrass, Lady Zabini, Lord Flint, Lord Prince (who is a suddenly sexy Snape), Lord Jugson, and literally everyone in the Wizengamot except for the, like, three Dumbledore supporters, nod in agreement.

Lord Slytherin, at the very front, smirks. “You should join us, Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverell. It will only take, like, a few newspaper articles and maybe a few manipulations to Fudge to dismantle Dumbledore's manipulative regime. I have decided to take my powerful Wizengamot seats now, with no explanation on why I didn't take them before, even though it would've avoided decades of effort, war and death. Don't question it.”

“Let's not focus on the actual oppressed dark people like werewolves or the impoverished Knockturn Alley residents or anything, but I will gladly go to all your illegal, yet extremely public, Yule Balls,” Harry agrees happily.

---

Ever read this fic? Me too. Many, many times. I would love a story that goes kinda like this, but on the actual oppressed peeps. Instead they always focus on, like, the Malfoys. Why? Lucius is probably the richest person in Britain, who can bribe his way out of everything, yet he's the oppressed one?

The stories always end up contradicting themselves by saying “the people in charge made our culture illegal”, yet having every person in power as a dark pureblood. It just don't make no sense.

Has anyone else noticed the same? What are your thoughts?


** It's interesting how authors can unintentionally replicate fascist worldviews, right? Irl ideologues like that also pretend to be oppressed whenever it serves to grant a little sympathy - one just has to look at how conservative christians in the US have been trying to make "the war on christmas" a thing for decades. More hardline conservatives and neonazis do the exact same thing, too.

It's easier to draw supporters into your elitist (and also objectively evil) movement if it appears to be fighting for a right to exist from an underdog position, even though it actually has its claws in every institution of the country. Textbook doublethink.

I wonder if there's any fics where Harry realizes he's being radicalized and puts a stop to it.

** the trope requires significant redefining of what "the dark arts" are, which is why it never works. canon never gives a strict definition, but the dark arts seem to be any magic that is purposed for violence

for instance, the full body-bind curse is a /curse/. it is dark magic. this may seem overkill, since it's never explicitly treated with the "THAT'S DARK MAGIC!" stigma, but isnt tying people up without their consent considered violent in the real world? isnt drugging someone so they cant move violent?

dark magic isnt oppressed. it is violence. never understood why the fandom makes excuses for it.

if anything, canon is sometimes too soft on dark magic. why is hexing someone with pimples that leave permanent scars considered okay? why is using the oppugno jinx to set birds on someone over nothing just glossed over? (i know why; it's a case of designated protagonist)

admittedly i can see situations where this trope could work, though. what if the ministry put someone in azkaban for using dark magic as self-defense? (i can only see this happening in some cases, such as to a minority group or a political dissident, never to someone in a position of power like the pureblood elite.) there's the canonical oppression of werewolves and vampires, who are the /victims/ of dark magic, but we all know the "dark arts are oppressed" fics arent talking about the oppression of creatures. theyre just making excuses for pureblood and wizarding supremacy

*** I always figured dark magic was about how hard it is to fix, the few times it really gets mentioned is stuff like being unable to just reattach or regrow an ear cut off with Sectumsempra.

If fits with the way most dangers are just sort of ignored, sure you might break a few bones playing quidditch and kids hex each other in school (though that one is technically against the rule of casting spells in the corridors), but at most you're looking at a day or two to fix everything, often more like minutes.

So naturally a society used to being able to just magic injuries away is really against the sort of magic that can't.

***** Indeed, there is a serious debate to be had whether the Unforgivables (all) are Dark Magic. They aren't explicitly called that in the book scenes that I recall, e.g. with fake!Moody. They are obviously illegal, but those two needn't be the same things. Something could be Dark Magic without being illegal, and illegal without being Dark Magic.

Basically, it goes back to the unclear definition. The "magically impossible to heal" aspect is the only formal criterion we got, but everyone in the books tosses around "Dark Magic" as some vague synonym for "powerful", "dangerous", "doing impossible things" or all of that around all the time. Harry wonders if Sirius used Dark Magic to escape the (thought to be impossible to break) prison of Azkaban. Parvati thinks one might need Dark Magic to open the CoS. Of course people think Parseltongue is Dark Magic. Rowling says Inferi are animated by Dark Magic. Voldemort says his rebirth potion is Dark Magic. Sometimes the synonym even is explicit, when in PS, Harry knows that restriced books "were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts."

So the contradictions you are running into are baked into Canon -- they aren't due to wrong definitions or reading of the material, it's the material itself which is contradicting. In some sense, this is pretty much fine, since this is the case with lots of things IRL, even though it would have been nice to have /the Ministry's/ definition, if only to figure out whether they are genuine or slapping the Dark label on everything they dislike.

*** Another thing it does is make dark magic strictly defined, with a set cut off-point where magic ceases to be normal and is instead dark, which is then somehow used as a basis for the legal system. The actual means or criteria of this are never addressed, because they're impossible.

I think it might be a lot less totalitarian than some people keep writing into their fics. I'd say there's probably a lengthy list of extremely dark curses and rituals and whatever the hell - stuff like the unforgivables, the withering curse that kills dumbledore, dark magic that can petrify, fiendfyre etc, that is universally agreed upon as /dark/ - if you cast these spells, you're dark. No buts about it. These spells do nothing an upstanding citizen needs to do that can't be accomplished with a less violent spell (you light your stove with the incendio charm, not fiendfyre. You slaughter animals with a gouging spell to the head, not the killing curse. etc)

Then, there'd be a flavor to magic as well - all spells are on the spectrum of light and dark. Something like a cutting curse is darker than a summoning charm, but these distinctions can only be drawn in relation to other spells, not universally, and also not quantifiably. It's a matter of instinct at best. People can just tell, maybe even just subjectively, if magic is dark or not. Maybe it's a defense mechanism from humanity's past, when magic was still wilder and more chaotic.

And then, there's the corrupting aspect. Dark magic corrupts, that's seen plainly in canon - the aura of a dementor drives you insane, using the killing curse splits your soul, the dark mark burns and hurts. Dark magic damages the caster's and victim's soul, mind and body. The degree and extent of this corruption is likely part of the mindset of the caster - a sadist would be corrupted more easily than a trained secret agent, for example. One's mind influences magic, and magic influences the mind, causing a spiral of dark corruption that breeds more and more dark within the caster, making it easier to use darker magics, but also more difficult to empathize with fellow humans, be altruistic and generous, feel emotions like happiness and love.

And that's where these fics go wrong. Dark magic isn't, and should not be, cleanly separated from other magic - just as every human has a grain of evil inside of them, so does every piece of magic have a grain of dark. Inconsequential, of course, unless it is fed by the caster - which becomes easier with spells where the dark is more apparent.

*** I really like the definition of Dark Magic as magic used in that particular case to cause harm. It applies to anything, including things like levitating rocks at people.

Dark Arts is the study of magic designed for combat in particular. Use of that can increase legal penalties, since it's a lot easier to prove intent. They aren't completely illegal, however: the first responder amputation spell to stop withering curses is technically Dark Arts.

Since there's no safe way to strip a criminal of their ability to harm without taking away all their magic, the government imposes harsher restrictions on people studying those magics. The old families want to keep their books on combat magic, but don't want the increased legal scrutiny it requires to maintain their collections. After all, they're more responsible than those uppity mudbl-muggleborns.

There we go, another dimension to societal conflict that isn't "we're evil and racist just because lol".

*** You say the Dark Arts aren't defined, and then give examples of what is Dark Magic?

I'd agree with the first -- and also with the idea that one needs a (re)definition, if the OP's kind of story is to be written. However, I don't see the problem there. As far as Canon goes, indeed the best idea of what is Dark Magic we've got is "destructive magic that resists countering or healing". This is why Moody's got a peg leg, why George can't regrow an ear, and why Snape can't stop the curse from Peverell's ring. In turn, that's how we know those spells would be classified as Dark Magic.

Obviously, this is also why the body-bind curse isn't Dark Magic. No one ever calls it that, either.

However, all of this is also irrelevant. FF can make up any random definition for Dark Magic it wants. Why would you then measure it by what is Dark Magic in Canon? One common trope is having the Ministry declare Dark Magic anything it doesn't want people to use. Another is re-inventing magic wholesale, by splitting it into "Light Magic" (doesn't exist in Canon), "Dark Magic" and "Neutral Magic". Yet another deals with addiction due to casting Dark Magic (also not a thing in Canon). Etc.pp.

Some of those attempts are silly, others more interesting, generally, though, they are by and large coherent (i.e., the Ministry forbids X, a faction of people is dedicated to X, hence they feel oppressed), if often a bit unmotivated -- exactly /why/ is the Ministry outlawing "blood magic"? The biggest issue in those stories isn't wonky definitions, it's a lack of motivation; the "Dark Side" appears utterly reasonable in protesting the ban of whatever has been defined "Dark", while the other side/the Ministry objectively look like morons going "it's Dark, so there".

There are better ways to create such conflict, IMO. One way I've been using is the topic of protection on homes, for instance -- there is a dilemma when people can protect their homes such that not even the Ministry can enter, so the Ministry would be inclined to regulate that, while the inhabitants would thank them very much to keep their noses out of their ancient protections. What's more, the split between who has such homes and who doesn't neatly falls along Purebloods/Muggleborns, since the prerequisite is a family home that has been around for generations, so it's also a class issue.

And like that, you have a nice conflict to work with, where all sides have a motivation that makes sense from /their/ POV. This is harder to achieve using Dark Magic as it is typically depicted, even if not quite impossible. But yeah, inasmuch as you're happy to handwave /why/ Dark Magic is oppressed, the rest works just fine in those stories. Whether it's to your or my taste or not is a different point.

**** if "crush target with a rock" is the actual function of the spell, then yes. there's a difference between the oppugno jinx (which directs objects to attack the target) and the locomotion charm (which is simply levitating something). you /can/ theoretically hurt someone with the locomotion charm, but that isnt the intent of the spell itself.

it's why guns are (read: should be) regulated more strictly than cars. both can aid in violence, but only one of them is created with the /function/ of harming others

as for the full body-bind, there are exceptions to everything, just life in real life. aurors are allowed to use dark magic, to a certain extent, in order to capture dark wizards. patients may get strapped down to the table during surgery, for their own safety.

** *Edit:* Wording and grammar.

Lucius wasn't finished. "Hogwarts has truly gone downhill as well. From what Draco tells me, Dumbledore is becoming oppressive towards Slytherins. They can't even say the so-called---", he sneered, "---'M-word' anymore, just because someone might have their feelings hurt! This political correctness has gone too far!"

"And the supposed prejudice against the Muggleborns?" Lady Zabini drawled, "Why, if a Muggleborn were deemed worthy of being sorted into our house, we would accept her as one of our own---and it would be the other houses throwing the M-word around!^{1} We cannot be blamed for the Muggleborns being simple, boorish, ignorant of our culture, weak of magic, and therefore unfit for our house!

"Now, if only Dumbledore didn't resist introducing mandatory wizard culture and etiquette classes---"

"Indeed, how dare he say on the very floor of Wizengamot that our etiquette and mores are copied from the late-nineteenth-century Muggle aristocracy and that we should get over ourselves! How would he even know?"^{2} Lord Flint interrupted.

"Hear-hear! How dare he insult our culture like that! It's ridiculous that everyone just assumes that all Slytherins are untrustworthy, selfish, and bigoted. They shouldn't generalise like that!" Lady Zabini concluded.

"Draco also tells me that two years running, they spent the whole year provoking Gryffindors in front of Lord Prince---and Lord Prince spent hours each week finding opportunities to award House Points---only for Dumbledore to just... cancel everything out at the last minute!

"He broke such a beautiful, and completely merited, seven-year streak!"

"Ah, well, that might have been my fault..." Harry began apologetically.

"Nonsense, Lord Potter! You were but a pawn in Dumbledore's manipulations---he gave you praise and validation for enacting his anti-Slytherin agenda," Lord Greengrass reassured him.

"Indeed, Lord Potter, isn't it awfully convenient that he had you kill one of Salazar Slytherin's few remaining legacies using the Sword of /Gryffindor/, of Goblin make?" Lord Slytherin added.

"Not to mention use the whole incident as leverage to force me off the Hogwarts Board of Governors over a mere misplacing of an artefact," concluded Lord Malfoy.

Harry nodded. It /was/ awfully convenient. He was so happy to finally have people on his side who could help him see through Dumbledore's manipulations.

** It's called the Slytherin Persecution Complex, and it's been the ruin of many a good fic.

I've lost count of Slytherin-protagonist fics in which Dumbledore is this vaguely hostile figure who is obviously very prejudiced against Slytherins and always looks side-eye at the protagonist, but who never actually does anything to meaningfully impede them.

As others have discussed, it's not actually an unrealistic scenario: as the saying goes, when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression. And, that could make for a very compelling story, perhaps a tragedy featuring Slytherin!Harry as an unreliable narrator who falls under Draco's influence. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k0wojm/dursleys_treat_harry_same_as_dudley_and_spoil_him/gdlh1yl/][I've outlined a possible story along these lines here.]])

However, I think that the vast, vast majority of fic writers are using this trope without any amount of self-awareness. In their minds, the poor aristocrats who are merely trying to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words][secure the existence of their people and a future for magical children]] /are/ being oppressed, and their way of life is being undermined by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia][Mugglebornds not learning their place]] being coddled by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#Conspiracy_theories_and_threats][Dumbledore]].

And, let's not forget the ever-neutral Greengrasses---as if neutrality in the face of a genocidal tyrant is something to be proud of---but again, it's very tempting and realistic to stay on the sidelines when /you/ aren't the one being targeted. (This, by the way, is what makes Ron a *hero*: Harry had Voldemort after him due to the prophecy; Hermione had Voldemort after her by virtue of her birth; but Ron could have walked away any time and sat out the conflict.) Unfortunately, too many writers treat "neutrality" as a virtue.

And that's the real tragedy.

*** I mean, this is a value judgement, surely?

Like, all of what you say is coherent and consistent and gets you from the start of the post the end in a logical manner. But it also presupposes the notions you laid out: Xenophobia (or more charitably, insisting on cultural hegemony) is bad. Being a hero is good. Neutrality is bad.

The way I take those stories is a thought experiment, an exploration of a world founded on opposite notions: Cultural hegemony is good. Being a hero is stupid. Neutrality/keeping to yourself is good. And if that were the case, then what would the people look like, living based on that? What would their world look like? And what happens if those two opposing notions of what is good clash?

As a literary approach, I can see the merits. If nothing else, I find it interesting, because it's different from the usual approaches. And while I'm not going to claim every FF author out there put that kind of thought into it, the /effect/ is the same -- just, perhaps, that the author is genuinely believing what he writes instead (which would be a bit worriesome, but then again, I'm not meeting them IRL). And especially so in the light of the value devide we /know/ exists in Canon: The House system lends itself to this kind of setup rather splendidly, because it maps onto just those differences.

Look at your own post -- everything you wrote could work as a motivational speech for Gryffindors verbatim. What you lament, in turn, is what Slytherin is told /and shown/ to represent. That is /fascinating/. I could think about those differences and what makes people tick all day. And ultimately, it helps that I know myself, and know that I wouldn't be Ron, but the Greengrasses. So in that sense, it can also be an issue of better being able to relate.

But yes, that as a perspective of what might make such plots appealing, perhaps. I just disagree with dismissing them wholesale, as a few commenters here propose. That a story might simply be written terribly isn't affected by this, of course.

**** I stand by my value judgement that in-universe, keeping the Slytherin House around after Salazar quit the project was a mistake, and the sooner they abolish it and resort its students to the other houses, the better. (Really, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l6zo3h/being_a_slytherin/gl5itcm/][what do you expect from this social dynamic]]?) Hogwarts would do fine with 3 houses: Ravenclaw for those who want to /know/, Gryffindor for those who want to /do/, and Hufflepuff for those who want to /be/.

Also, the truth is most people in most situations behave more like the memetic Greengrasses than like Ron. One of the benefits of democracy and similar institutions is that if you set things up so that opposing evil and achieving justice /doesn't/ require heroism, you get a lot less evil and a lot more justice. If you do need a hero, then something has already gone horribly wrong.

Anyway, it's one thing to explore "Slytherin" values and their consequences, and, like many including myself wrote, it's not unrealistic for Slytherins to sincerely believe that they are being oppressed, whether or not they actually are. The problem is that both in canon and in the sort of fanfic that the OP describes, they are not, in fact, meaningfully oppressed, and so what they consider /resistance/ to oppression and Muggle encroachment is actually /aggression/---in short, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU][they are the baddies]].

And, again, it could work amazingly well if the author is aware that they are actually writing unreliable or downright villainous protagonists. Unfortunately, they rarely are.

*** ​

To be fair, isn't there a time when the narrative seems biased against the Slytherins? A good example is when Hagrid implies that all dark wizards outside Slytherin, although he thought Sirius Black was a traitor (later, we found out it was Peter, but she is also a Gryffindor).

Or when an 11-year-old is selected for Slytherin, three-fourths of the school will go against them.

Or when Slytherin would win the first two years, but Dumbledore gave Gryffindor a lot of points for doing things that have nothing to do with school activity. He even placed Slytherin flags and then changed them later as if he were mocking them.

Or when Minerva locked a bunch of Slytherin children in the dungeons just because Pansy wanted to deliver Harry Potter. Basically in the middle of the battlefield. That was only in the movies, but still.

And I know people don't like to talk about that certain book, but apparently even Harry Potter disparages his own son for being in Slytherin and for making friends with an 11-year-old boy for the crime of being the son of the boy who mistreated him at school.

And it's not like I'm a big Slytherin fan, but I can see why some people see it as underdogs who are treated badly by people who expect the worst of them and then complain when it happens.

Not that it justifies fanaticism, I'm talking about the house in general, also known as Slytherin students who are not Draco, Crabble, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise.

**** Rowling's biggest crime against Slytherin was creating Slytherin. As I've argued many times, including in the link from my earlier post, between its founder and its stated values, there is pretty much no way for it not to result in a toxic social environment that brings out the worst in people---people who weren't inclined to be all that good in the first place. (For that matter, Dumbledore's greatest crime against Slytherin was putting Snape in charge.)

Hagrid is just one (not very bright) character expressing his opinions. There was nothing in the words and actions of actual Slytherins we see that would cause anyone to question the general accuracy of Hagrid's assessment.

Inter-house rivalry is ever-present and encouraged by the House Point system. But yes, the status-obsessed Slytherins probably take it a lot more seriously than the other houses, and the other houses respond in kind.

Oh, and before Harry started Hogwarts, Slytherins had won the House Cup for 7 years straight---an amazing winning streak that began a few short years after Snape became a Professor. The way I see it, at worst Dumbledore was merely compensating for someone else having his thumb on the proverbial scale.

You are right about McGonagall doing the wrong thing to Slytherins before the Battle of Hogwarts. What she should have done is realised that many of them were children of Death Eaters, Snatchers, and others who came to storm Hogwarts---and therefore excellent hostages and human shields. She could have saved so many innocent lives!

But seriously, they were about to engage in what may well have been the biggest wizard battle in centuries. Over the prior several years, Slytherin students ranged between enthusiastic support of Voldemort and silence. /Not one/ Slytherin student gave any indication, either at that point in the story, or in the years prior, that they disagreed with Pansy's proposal or that they wouldn't stab the defenders of Hogwarts in the back the moment they had the chance to to curry flavour with the new regime.

I shouldn't psychoanalyse groups of other people, but when has that stopped me? People see Slytherins as underdogs because:

1. Tom Felton was/is hot, so he couldn't possibly be a bad guy.
2. Alan Rickman was an amazing actor who played Snape with far more charisma and dignity than the character had in the books, so he couldn't possibly be both a victim and a perpetuator of the toxic environment that took a brilliant half-Muggle kid and turned him into a blood purist terrorist.
3. In stories with a Slytherin protagonist and/or main romantic interest, Slytherin house couldn't /possibly/ be the source of the adversity or a corrupting influence; so it must be some else's fault, and Slytherins are just misunderstood.
4. People who are into some sort of pseudo-Victorian aristocratic romantic and political intrigue project that sort of culture onto Slytherins. But, aristocrats tend to oppress people, and they can't /possibly/ be the baddies in the story, so they must just be defending themselves, right?
5. Some people like their edgy and ruthless protagonists, but they know that an actually evil character would deter readers, so they make up reasons why whomever their protagonist hurts are even worse.

The Common Rooms can serve as an echo chamber for fanatics, but it's not as if they are prevented from interacting with the other three houses, which possibly rejects Slytherin as a whole by default (James even insulted Sirius because his entire family is in Slytherin before even stepping on Hogwarts).

But how to explain people like Andromeda Black (married to a muggle), Cedrella Black (married to a Weasley), Iola Black (married to a muggle), Phineas Black (support for Muggle rights)? They were Slytherin, but if no Slytherin student at the time of Harry supported him, then what happened? The only logical explanation I can think of is that goodwill came from outside Slytherin, which none of the three houses in Harry's time have shown...On screen at least.

Dumbledore should have made Slughorn the head of Slytherin from the start. He may be a little elitist and show some favoritism, but he does not discriminate Muggleborns or house. His club would be a good way to bring the houses together for something in common.

Yes, but the film version was a bit loose and didn't take the situation seriously. I don't know if you saw the deleted scenes, but Argus (who has no magic power) is shown somehow being able to trap Slytherins in the dungeons while they just scream without using magic themselves. And then Draco just appears and simply blows up the gate, while Argus just watches as the Slytherins run away instead of apparating. It seemed more like Minerva being mean and capricious rather than considering them a series threat.

In addition, movie Minerva forgot to evacuate 11-16 year olds outside Hogwarts, even those from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.

In fact, 80% of Hogwarts are "silent" about Voldemort. We only saw much of Gryffindor because it is Harry's house, while we saw more of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff when Army Dumbledore was formed. And why was there no Slytherin? Simple, none of them took the trouble to form a bond with any Slytherin student.

​

Pansy wanted to turn Harry over after Voldemort promised not to hurt anyone if they turned Harry over. In fact, although she was probably being selfish, she did bring an interesting moral dilemma.

If you had to choose between sacrificing just one person to prevent multiple people from dying, what would be better? Sure, we know that Harry is very important in defeating Voldemort, but how would most students know that? On the other hand, if Harry were killed, he could end up being a kind of martyr. In fact, he dying turned out to be the option he chose anyway.

Sure, Pansy herself might just be thinking about herself, but the fact that we don't see any nameless Slytherin student supporting Pansy makes me think that they were more concerned with their own safety than who will win.

Do you really think that a 12-year-old Slytherin child who was selected because he wants to prove himself/herself (ambition) and cautious (evasive, prefers to avoid problems directly) deserves to be locked in a dungeon because last year, he did not defend Harry (a 16-year-old boy) against Draco, Crabble and Goyle (16-year-old bullies who would most likely hit that same child in Common Room)?

Anyway, I'm not saying that all Slytherins are secretly misunderstood, but talking about the OP saying that dark magic is oppressed. The narrative in the movie is so loose in relation to Slytherins that if you look carefully, you will see Slytherin students studying with Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw even outside of classes.

So it's easy to see what kind of thing someone could say to discredit Dumbledore, like the fact that Harry was allowed to play Quidditch at the age of 11 without any testing.

But at the same time, "Lord Malfoy" couldn't use that for bashing Dumbledore since Lucius simply insisted that Draco could play Quidditch in the second year, so he would be a hypocrite. But Dumbledore, Minerva, Snape and Lucius don't care that another Gryffindor and Slytherin student misses the chance to play Quidditch because of this.

I am sure that Ravenclaw families joke about becoming a Gryffindor meathead, Gryffindors laugh about the duffers in Hufflepuff, and Hufflepuffs think that each of other houses is nutty in its own way.

Some people manage to defy their toxic social environment. Maybe someone reached out to them. Maybe they were the first to reach out. Maybe they ostracised from their own house. Maybe they kept their heads down and gave no indication of their beliefs until after they graduated. Some of them are not actually stated to have been Slytherin in canon sources. In any case, you seem to be shifting the burden of "redeeming" Slytherins on to someone else, which is in itself toxic. It's not Hermione's job to support Draco in growing past his bigotry. Particularly during Harry's time, deciding whom to trust was literally a mater of life and death.

#+end_quote

Slughorn was old and wanted to retire; Dumbledore had to dangle Harry and security of Hogwarts to get him back. And even as a professor, Slughorn was a corrupt wheeler-and-dealer, who took advantage of his position to obtain favours from students. His club was, first and foremost, a way for him to get future leaders of the wizarding world in his debt and make sure that those in his debt would become the future leaders of the wizarding world.

No, she really didn't. /Everyone/ knew about Voldemort's offer, so she provided no new information. What she did was /advocate/ for it.

I mean, one possible headcanon is that it was a brilliant Slytherin move to get herself and her house evacuated from Hogwarts just before it would become a battlefield. The logic:

1. If Voldemort wins, she can say that she was loyal to him even when outnumbered 3 to 1.
2. If Voldemort loses, the Order is probably not going to imprison her just for bringing up the possibility.

Maybe the rest were silent because they were outnumbered 3 to 1 and Pansy was the only one reckless enough to say what everyone was thinking. If one is willing to use a big enough a shoehorn, any action can have any explanation. For example, I've seen a Dramionist argue, with a straight face (metaphorically speaking), that during the Death Eater attack at the Quiddich championship, Draco wasn't taunting the trio. He was /warning/ them to get to safety.

No, and that's why I keep saying that the Slytherin house environment is toxic and should be abolished, its students resorted into other houses. If you weren't bad when you were sorted there, you will be by the time you graduate, with a tiny handful of exceptions. Nobody deserves to be exposed to that.

AFAIK, there was no rule against trying out in your first year; just against having your own broom. Maybe Draco just wasn't able to make Seeker in his first year, so Lucius had to bribe the team captain with new brooms the year after. (Or maybe Draco didn't really care until Harry became a seeker, and then it was too late to try out.)

** There are two aspects that come to mind.

For one, as the other comment noted, it's a very real thing that people who on paper have all the opportunities in the world claim (and often, actually feel) they are disadvantaged. One reason for this can be a relative change: They used to be heavily favoured, but in recent years, those that were disadvantaged have gotten more opportunities. As this is in some sense a zero-sum game, it feels for the former group as though they are now getting discriminated against (when actually, they're just losing some privileges).

Of course, this requires a reasonably mature writer to make that point; I won't doubt that often, it's actually straight-face'd "the richest man in wizarding Britain is oppressed".

But the second aspect is that you appear to be mixing Canon and whatever story you are reading, and that is naturally creating contradictions. In Canon, there is no indication that e.g. Malfoy (prior to his arrest) is anything but a powerful figure with connections to get done whatever he wants to get done. He naturally vaguely laments about Mudbloods and no proper wizards, but as the group in question is kept away from influence, he hasn't got much to complain about -- and consequently, /he doesn't/.

On the other hand, if the story revamps the wizarding world such that no Dark Magic and holidays and etc. everything you noted, then he legitimately /has/ a reason to complain. The most common setup I've encountered is a reformist block lead by Dumbledore, who gained the needed influence on the back of his victory against Grindelwald and/or after Voldemort's fall. The purebloods you cited aren't in power: They are a minority faction in a Fanon-Wizengamot and /can't/ get things done the way they want to. This setup also may involve a powerful Ministry that can ignore the Wizengamot altogether, and Dumbledore's influence there surpassing the one of Malfoy & co.

.

Of course, without knowing which story in particular you read, it's hard to say whether it makes sense. My experience is that probably most of the time, it does make sense, if feeling a bit artificial, wooden, one-dimensional or simplistic.

I was thinking of being a shoe-in for a job because you're <Attribute>, and now it's changed, other people also can apply, and since there's only a finite number of open positions, you're now less likely to get in.

Or, if you wanted to create such conflict in a HP AU, making Hogwarts expensive, making (some) old Purebloods house rich, cash poor (i.e., they have a nice manor and land, but no cash, a common thing in Britain back in the days), and having a finite number of scholarship grants: And now it used to be the case those purebloods got in based on "pure blood", but since Hogwarts began admitting more and more Muggleborns, the grants got diverted that way, leaving the purebloods stranded and unable to attend. Naturally, this creates resentment.

But yes, I agree that it's less of a zero-sum game for cultural issues. But of course, there are plenty of ways under the sun to get offended about being forced (not to) celebrate "Christmas" without that being the case. If there's one thing in the world people are good at, it's feeling aggrieved.
