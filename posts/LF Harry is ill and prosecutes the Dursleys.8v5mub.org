I don't remember much as it's a while ago when I read this fic.

I think this fic plays in year five and McGonagall or Severus detect that Harry is ill so they take him into Minervas quarters. They try to hide it from Umbridge (and at first from the Headmaster?). There is some discussion of abuse. I think Harry retreats inside his head a few times and is coerced through Minerva or Severus to "come back". They sue the Dursley family for child abuse. I think during the case Dumbledore convinces Vernon Dursley to drink Veritaserum.

I'm pretty sure it was on ffnet and in english but I could me wrong. I appreciate all help.

Thanks.
