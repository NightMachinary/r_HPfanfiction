I though it might be an interesting topic, having Harry attend somewhere that isn't under Dumbledore's watchful eye.

The minister expels Harry during his second year in order to be seen "doing something" and to remove a potential future political rival before he becomes a threat.

  "The Ministry must be seen to do something", and with that, Harry Potter's wand is snapped. Expelled in his second year, he is invited to a new school famous for being the home of one of the Eight Great Repositories of Knowledge. But with Voldemort alive and the Chamber of Secrets still open, he will need every resource his new school possesses to stay alive in the coming years.
