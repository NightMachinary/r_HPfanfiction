Would also be cool if the Harry's traded places.


** Silence reigns as Dumbledore reads the singed slip of paper. His voice is grave as he reads Harry's name as the unexpected fourth champion of the Triwizard Tournament. Suddenly, a bright flash of red light blinds everyone in the hall.

Once they blink the spots out of their eyes, they look to see a teenager standing in front of the Goblet. While the newcomer looks eerily familiar, it is clear that he is still a stranger to them.

Someone incredulously shouts into the quiet. ‚ÄúWho the bloody hell is that?!‚Äù

The boy slowly turns to face the hall and stares out into the crowd. Then smiles before bursting into song and dance.

‚ÄúI'm Harry freaking Potter!! I'll do what I can if what you say I am is true. I can't be bothered By my awful past I've found at last Something I can do. So it's time you knew Exactly who I am... I'm Harry freaking Potter.‚Äù

Meanwhile at the Gryffindor table, Harry facepalms so hard, he knocks himself unconscious.

*** A very Potter Musical, it's basically a crack version of the seven books clobbered together in in one play, including Quirrell/Voldemort, Draco boasting to everyone that he will transfer to a school in Mars run by a talking lion, Harry and Ron pushing literally all work on Hermione to lazy around (and I mean ALL work) Dumbledore having a crush on Snape and both being crazy... It is really something, highly recommend for all the laughs.

**** I tried watching AVPM, but just couldn't get through it. At least 10-20 minutes in (was watching with friends, including the one that /very/ enthusiastically recommended it) I'd laughed at maybe one joke (Dumbledore complaining that his new sandwich won't be ticking). Much of it just had me going "WTF?", like Draco randomly rolling around on the ground while talking to Harry about Pigfarts - I understand that someone intended that to be funny, but I have to wonder how high they were at the time.

*** If he survives time enough after trying to get Hermione to do all his work, acting the way Snape expect from his fathers times a hundred, acting in the ‚Äúno one [besides Granger] studies at Hogwarts‚Äù maxim that he is used to, taking Malfoy as seriously as he would his own... chances are that Voldy would end giving it up as a lost cause letting him get eaten by the dragon to try again the next tournament. On the positive side after the experience even Snape would appreciate much more their Harry.

** Instead of hating Cedric, AVPM Harry would probably be like ‚Äúman I hate that guy‚Äù whenever Canon Harry walks into the room. Or maybe he would have trouble getting everyone to go with the flow and be a bro, could be interesting considering half the school would be against him because of the Cedric Diggory badges Malfoy made. It would be basically AVPM Harry by himself against a bunch of normal people, against Canon Harry, against Cedric Diggory, and against Malfoy. Canon Hermione probably wouldn't want to do AVPM Harry's work but might feel bad for him- and AVPM Harry could end up getting eaten by the dragon. They'd probably put his guitar in the middle of the lake because he has no attachments to his new classmates. I feel like he'd soon end up a pariah like Harry in AVPSY. Maybe he'd have to prove himself by charming everyone instead of being a massive arse all the time. Canon Harry could end up developing beef with him because he could be blamed for AVPM Harry's actions, while also secretly thinking AVPM Harry is (infinitely more) awesome and wishing he could be that groovy, lol
