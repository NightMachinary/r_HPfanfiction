In search of a Harry potter fanfic, but the Protagonist should be evil. If that's too much then at-least an anti-hero.

I don't want a stupid & idiotic MC like Harry.

I especially hate Ron so it'd be cool if the MC doesn't try to befriend him.

The MC doesn't need to be Harry himself, he could be a reincarnater or some other character but he should have a few screws loose.

EDIT 1 - No Yaoi please.

A cracky FemHarry story where she becomes the sort of iconic dark figure which isn't entirely evil, like Darth Vader. The first few chapters are rather dark and badly written (the protagonist is mute, so there is very little dialogue and a lot of narrating, it gets better once notepads and sign language get involved).

Harry isn't outright evil, but is definitely a psychopath who shows no mercy to enemies and violence is used liberally. Friends are treated well, however.

It is an OPHarry story which avoids a lot of pitfalls of these stories. Harry/Cassandra does not act cringeworthy as you'd expect in this type of story.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

Neither is a masterpiece but both are readable and Harry is indeed evil and certainly not repentant of his actions. The first is complete, the second is updated very frequently and is currently in year 6.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]] is pretty decent. Not amazing, but okay.

​

There's another I'm thinking of but can't quite remember, where Harry is abused and starts embracing the Darker side of things and eventually ascends to demi-godhood as a sort of fey-nature-rot-shadow type of low level deity.

*** Is it Yaoi? I'm sorry but the summery says that the pairing is between Harry and Voldemort? And What is SLASH, TMR HP/LV ?

**** Yes, it's a Voldemort/Harry pairing.

Slash = yaoi/boyxboy

TMR = Tom Marvolo Riddle.

HP/LV = Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort.

​

It's not everyone's cup of tea, and I'd actually argue that in Xerosis, Harry isn't really evil anyway. It's rare to see a completely evil character in fanfiction - most authors tend to justify their characters' actions with some faux logic that's actually just eugenics, or end up making Harry so edgy he blinds you with every edgy word out of his mouth.
