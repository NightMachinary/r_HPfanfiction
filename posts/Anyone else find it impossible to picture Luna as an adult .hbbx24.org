Like with the rest of Harry's generation,I can picture them with greying hair and a few wrinkles but Luna is perpetually a tiny girl in my mind

** I have met one person who was a serious contender for a Luna that was around 30. She was a well regarded ceramics artist and nude model who's house was absolutely filled with found-treasures and plants with apparent healing properties (Wicca), and honestly? A really lovely woman. When I met her, within 5 minutes we were sitting in a window bay in her home both sharing how our fathers had passed on while we were girls growing up. She gave me home made tea and seemed to have an air about her that everything was alright in the world.

Her mother was an artist and wealthy, and I think that's a part of why it worked, because being that lovely and a bit out of it would normally have the world chew you up and spit you out.

She was really, really nice, made exceptionally good scones and was gay. I could absolutely have seen Luna be a bit that way.

*** Know a woman like that who wasn't from wealth. Sadly, the bit about the world chewing on such people is true, at least in her case. In and out of psychiatric hospital, an abusive marriage, and sundry other misfortunes. Still manages to be singularly pleasant company.

**** Yeah, I think a girl like Luna is inherently very vulnerable because of a sense of self-assured naïveté that isn't entirely anchored in reality. Luna at a university party, Luna buying a second-hand car, Luna in a job interview... all these situations have the potential to turn south without a sense of worldliness.

** I don't and I know about at least very good (and one not so bad) pictures of her. I think with finding true friends and the life partner and having kids, she could settle down a bit, and so her in linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) works for me quite well. Or she could stay single and be as awesomely crazy as ever, and then her as the Professor of DADA in the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] (starting with linkao3(1048010)) is pretty awesome one. That not so bad portrait of her is Luna by Northumbrian for example in her chapter in linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian), linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), or in linkffn(7801923). However, her main story by him in linkao3(Yggdrasil by Northumbrian) is kind of meh.

I think she a victim of her opposite position to the character development than the rest of the stories (as [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][I have described it about Ginny]]): Luna doesn't have any character development in the canon, because the story is not about her, but about our relationship with her. We started reading about her cynical and jadded (as Hermione did), but eventually we find out how faithful and self-sacrificing friend she is, etc. Exactly the same development Harry and other characters went through. And that is very possible and right (contrary to what I complain about Ginny), however it doesn't make any space for her to show who she really is. You know all those awesome lines like “It would be like having friends”? They are actually a way more serious than they look: Luna is never real friend to anybody in the books, because she never reveals to anybody who she really is. We know she was bullied, but we have never seen her crying, or even being otherwise affected by it. She is completely poker faced about loosing her mum, she just dances through the Battle in the Department of Mysteries, she never let us know who she really is. Which works perfectly well for JKR, because Luna is never in any serious relationship (not only with boys, but we never really see her friendship with Ginny, we just hear about it; and there is no follow-up on her evening with Harry).

However, it doesn't work for fanfiction stories where she should be real character, and it doesn't especially work for any romantic stories. Authors have to mostly create her from scratch which they do sometimes with good results (linkao3(Protection From Nargles by Arpad_Hrunta), linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)), sometimes otherwise.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

***** Funny, I was thinking about my Luna as I was looking at this thread, but I'm kind of surprised to see I Know Not linked here since she's definitely a child in that. (I actually made a new reddit account to reply since I like keeping my non-billows presences a bit separate, but I updated my Twitter for verification/proof.)

But thank you [[/u/wave-or-particle][u/wave-or-particle]] for the recommendations. I'm so glad that the story resonated with you and that you feel moved to share it with other people. (Also thank you [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] and [[/u/elemonated][u/elemonated]] for the kind words.)

I'm actually resuming work on an AU sequel, so I've been thinking a lot about Luna as an adult--not only because this is something that Snape needs to come to terms with for himself, but also because this story will follow Luna as she comes into her own as a young woman, a witch, an academic, a daughter, a survivor, a friend, and so on. The challenge is to balance that dreaminess that makes her Luna while still taking into account the profoundly traumatic events of Deathly Hallows, as well as her trajectory towards finding healthy ways of coming to terms with those experiences. In other words, though the ways in which a post-war Snape needs to grow and heal are pretty obvious, Luna also starts the story as a deeply wounded individual who is equally in need of support and care.

(I'll admit that it's rather slow going, though. This mental health thread is just one of several--I'm also taking on the issue of representation in Harry Potter and the social oppressiveness of British wizarding society, as well as developing frameworks for American forms of magic and--in conjunction--rounding out some new characters who need to be as complex and deeply human as Snape and Luna, but in a way that enriches and guides their journey, rather than distracts from it. It's...a lot. But seeing that folks are still reading and thinking about I Know Not motivates me to keep chipping away at it. So thank you again.)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** Actually, one of the many good things on unfairly neglected linkffn(Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers) is how good Lovegoods are well written. They are more overgrown hobbits than elves, but they are really good. The story has not been finished, which is unfortunate on one side (I know that Padma/George shipping is a cliché, but I would love to see it), on the other hand the author planned to make Marvel films crossover, so it is probably right she didn't.

** I have always pictured adult Luna Kind of like the head zookeeper at the animal rescue by my house are very chill older lady will streaked of purple in her hair. that can tell you pretty much almost anything About the exotic animal trade on every continent she Is a whirl published biologist and actually helped hunt down a few frog species in South America in the 1990s . She always has kind of a dreamy expression but she is sharp as a tack. That kind of person is how I kind of picture an adult Luna, Very perceptive good at reading people and aware of everything around her and most of what's going on in the world. Adult Luna at the helm of the Quibbler would be a very interesting idea for a story.

** When I think of a young Luna (first four years of Hogwarts) as I imagine stories in my head as I read them, I think of Evanna Lynch when she was in OotP, when the character was supposed to be 14 and the actress herself 15?

When Luna's 16 or 17? I think of Miss. Lynch when she was in her late teens (18/19 or even 20), wrapping up on DHp2, because she still looked like she was 13/14 when she was supposed to be 16/17 and it just looked strange to me.

Older than that? I think of her when she did things like Dancing With the Stars.

Partly, I think it's because when she had an unfortunate eating disorder when she was younger, it affected her growth in her early teenage years -- hence why she physically looked like she was 12, maybe, when she was supposed to be 15? So, there's a bit of a dissonance and it explains why she looked years younger than what she was supposed to look like, I guess?

Thankfully, time and her own willpower meant she overcame her problems, but it's left mental, visual images in my mind that Evanna Lynch's older, physical appearance is what Luna looked like in her final Hogwarts years and her later life, but her OotP appearance is her when she was younger, like her first few years.

Strangely enough, Emma Watson and the other cast-members had similar yet opposite problems: as the films went on (time during films/production compared to in-universe years), it ultimately had them at 20, 21 portraying 17 year olds, even though the series started with the actors/actresses being 9 and 10 respectively to portray 11/near 12 year olds, heh.

So, that's what my brain does to give more 'realistic' mental images of the characters (even Malfoy, since Tom Felton physically matured rapidly in his late teens: it's like the guy drank Miracle Grow for Humans, hah).

Funnily enough, I always though Karen Gilliam (who played the lovely Amelia Pond in Doctor Who, before it went to crap) would've made a fantastic Ginny Weasley, had she been born in a different time.

** loose conection here, but this reminded me of tiny tina from borderlands 2, she's older in 3 ands its a weird transition

they made the character more "normal" in that shes matured and knows how to talk to people better while still maintaining some the craziness from her youth.

something like that might serve luna's character well. it would sacrifice that ethereal bizzarness she has a little, but make her more real.some of her floatyness feels like what i imagine a child who was raised alone, went through a traumatic event, and also had a father who blurs the line between whats magical and real and whats magical and fictional. her making friends and growing up could easily allow her to grow more socially skilled without drastically reinventing her character.

** Why of course! Luna is part of the 'Gang' from Hogwarts, but she's rather regarded as the baby, and everything she says is taken with a grain of salt....but Harry always knows that there is truth to what she says, but her mind doesn't know how to express the things she wants to say in ways that typical wizards know. So when a 35 ish Luna, divination professor at Hogwarts, informs harry that Sirius, Remus, James, and Severus seem to be having a Wrackspurt infestation and need an objective eye, Harry knows that someone is going to die soon. Someone who knows them all.
