:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that it's not Power is Control and in fact had an author's note saying they'd been told about the name being used before and hadn't read that fic. Wanted to re-read it and realize I'd forgot to favorite it.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
