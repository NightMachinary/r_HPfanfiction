In the whole 7 book series the word "ward/s" were only used to mean as a room (janus thickey ward) or as a verb to protect (ward off dementor). Protective spells are called jinx, charm, or curse.


** It's more accurate to say that "ward" is not a canon term, because wards as we understand them are absolutely canon. They just get called by other names.

It's like using "teleportation" and "transformation" instead of "apparition" and "transfiguration." It's not inaccurate, it's just not the normal word to use.

*** ^{^{^}} This. The series never uses the term 'ward', but wards, as per the definition, exists.

They're just called other things. Anti-Disapparition Jinx, for instance. Or the blood protection on 4 Privet.

I have to disagree with that on technical terms. "Wards" imply certain assumed mechanics to the magic that performs them. You can see that assumption at work in fanfics that use wards freely. By not using the term JKR doesn't merely gives a different name to the magic, she actively disassociates the spells' workings from those assumptions.

**** Can you explain those assumptions? I only ever knew of wards as like long term protective enchantments on an area which matches quite a lot of things in canon.

** I mean, I think "Anti-Apparition wards" are a thing? Correct me if I'm wrong. But yeah they're generally non-entities in canon otherwise.

**** That's extra dumb... Everywhere else "jinx" is like a weak curse, I'd expect an anti apparition jinx to be something you cast on an individual that only lasts a minute or two

** The most common example of 'wards' in fanfiction is the use of permanently inscribed enchantments using ancient runes and/or arithmancy in some more complicated ritual to protect a location. Even at the final battle of Hogwarts when we see all the teachers in the courtyard reinforcing the protections, they're just casting very powerful charms; nobody is Wheeling a large array of runestones into the courtyard and activating them with a keyword.

It all depends on whether or not you're trying to make the protections seem permanent - Hermione casts powerful protective charms when they're on the run, but they're not meant to last. Having powerful magic associated with something permanent like stones or inscriptions combined with the effort it takes to produce something like that makes them seem stronger.
