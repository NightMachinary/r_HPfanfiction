So, I'm looking for a story where magic is widely used to enrich lives and defeat death. Maybe with a misunderstood, scared of dying, shades-of-grey Voldemort as a protagonist.

Basically, I'm looking for a fanfiction where reaching for immortality is portrayed as a noble goal, not a horrible mark of a dark wizard. Any suggestions?


** Besides [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]]? I imagine you've already read that...

I don't think there is a general negativity towards immortality itself. Hence all stories where Harry is the Master of Death. What is frowned upon is the negative actions people must commit to gain certain forms of immortality. People don't hate horcruxes because they have a philosophical opposition to immortality, but because of the murder issue. Same thing with unicorn blood. Some might be opposed to immortality due to population sustainability but wizards don't seem to think about that sort of thing.

 

*EDIT* I think there are some oneshots out there dealing with the immortality issue, where muggle/magical society join and realize a utopia. Hopefully some other users have links, none come to mind now

*** Yeah, I've read it already. Still, with all those stories, I have yet to find one where Harry readily shares his power with the world. Even worse is where he/Dumbledore/etc. are all accepting of death.

Admittedly, I haven't read very many, so I may be missing a lot. What I'm looking for doesn't necessarily have to be immortality-centric, but about making people better, literally, through magic.

  Follow Harry through a journey of epic proportions as a bit of extra ambition influences the rest of his life. There are men, and then, there are titans. Will become VERY AU. (Looking for beta) (Non-slash, no pairings)

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) definitely has magic used to enrich lives, but immortality is still viewed negatively, but mostly because it will likely cause a disconnect from reality.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
