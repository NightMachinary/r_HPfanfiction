:END:
I've been looking for this fanfiction I read a while back about Bellatrix and Sirius' family relationship and it's all about how Bellatrix always keeps her promises to Sirius. It's a oneshot (I think?), and the last scene is when Bellatrix comes up to Sirius and promises him that the next time they meet she'll kill him and he knows she will because Bellatrix always keeps her promises to him.
