I recognize that fanfics, by their nature, do not have to hold to the lines of canon. But for some characters are written differently too often, and to such a degree that they don't even feel like their actual, canonical selves (Hermione and Luna being the two I notice most).

So, what are some fics that have the characters acting most like their canon selves?


** linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love) I believe this fic really captures both Luna's and Snape's characters.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I don't think the request is as simple as you think. I guess most writers try to give the characters 'canonical characterisation', but everything is subjective and we are all likely to have a slightly different take. I once had a reader tell me I'd made a character too grumpy when I thought I was simply developing the character we see in canon. It's all in the eye of the beholder, so to speak.

*** Hmmm...that's a good point. I hadn't considered that.

** linkffn(3093741) Is a young Harry-happens-to-be-shipped-off-to-Snape kind of fanfic. I came across this story about two months ago and I loved it. I thought the way it was told was quite interesting (switching between Snape's and Harry's POV) and the way Snape is acting seemed quite cannon to me :)

  Eight year old Harry was cursed with rotten guardians. Snape is a wizard with an unusually cold disposition, which he has for a reason. Can Severus give the childhood he was never privileged enough to have to the little one?
