** I don't ignore it, but I do find the people in them annoying. I find Hermione incredibly frustrating, especially, with her constant dismissing of important things Harry says or thinks. And Harry really should have tried a little harder to get better at magic.

And the whole Elder Wand ending was dumb. Had Dumbledore's plan worked, and the wand died with him, Harry would have likely been squashed by Voldemort. It felt like a cop out. It felt like JK Rowling went out of her way to make Harry as normal as a prophecized child could be.

I just really didn't care much for the last 2 books.

Which admittedly we don't have a lot of evidence that it's any more than just an esoteric spell that doesn't have much call so no one bothers to learn it. Harry managed to teach a few of the DA to cast it in fifth year in just two weeks, and it only took him a couple sessions over the course of several months to learn it in the first place.

I always took it to be the equivalent of a geometry student learning the basics of calculus, such as a few derivatives and integrals, rather than the equivalent of a sixth grader learning to design and launch a rocket.

Sure, it's impressive, and most people don't do it, but that's likely more related to the fact that it's a highly specialized charm that the average wizard is very rarely going to need than any particular difficulty.

Furthermore, Rowling never really showed Harry as being particularly adept in books 1 and 2...he struggled in exams and on homework, Hermione was always the one with esoteric spell knowledge, and at the end of the day he was always shown as just kind of a average student with a big heart and a lot of reckless bravery.

  ‘It has nothing to do with weakness,' said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. ‘The Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.'

Again, PoA, have you read that book at all?

#+begin_quote
  ‘So ...' Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. ‘The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.'
#+end_quote

*Harry managed to teach a few of the DA to cast it in fifth year in just two weeks, and it only took him a couple sessions over the course of several months to learn it in the first place.*

The quote above shows why Harry could so easily teach the DA. It's the effect dementors have on people that makes it so difficult to succesfully cast the patronus charm. In the DA, he taught them the spell without any dementors present. But learning it in a classroom and casting it against actual dementors are two very different things. And people who have experienced more trauma have more difficulty casting the charm, which is why it's so impressive that Harry can. He is more affected, yet his patronus is incredibly strong.

Harry was also taught without the presence of dementers, though the boggart gave him some sort of dementer practice. He still learned in a classroom without the threat.

"Highly advanced and difficult magic...well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level"

Right, so like Calculus. OWLs are taken at 15, wizards live to be 100+. The end all be all of advanced magic is not simply "beyond Ordinary Wizard Level"

******* Come on, if you're even remotely familiar with the Harry Potter books you know perfectly well how the spell works. Harry still experienced the horrible effects from the precence of a dementor when faced with the boggart. So he was learning the spell while fighting the effects.

It's mainly this effect that causes the spell to be so difficult to cast, as I clearly explained in my last comment. You must be capable of imagining that focusing on a happy memory is a whole lot easier to do in a normal situation than when a dementor or a boggart pretending to be a dementor is sucking all the happy memories out of you.

Harry definitely learned the spell and practiced without the boggart. He also practiced with it, but none of those speak to the overall difficulty of the spell, just the conditions of casting.

Also, when he cast it at the end of PoA, he even says that the only reason he cast it was because he knew he already could since it had already happened--a boost of confidence that helps a lot with intent based magic.

Harry was always meant to be the everyman thrust into a magic world....not a magical prodigy. Rowling wrote a prodigy, it was Riddle, or Dumbledore. Harry was clearly nothing like them. I know, its disappointing. But that's what fanfiction is for.

#+end_quote

I meant Harry defending himself, but actually now I think on it, it might attack Voldemort too. It did attack him with golden flames that one time... I just looked up where Dumbledore explains this to better understand, and this is what he says,

#+begin_quote
  Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.

  “I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?”

  “But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?” asked Harry.

  “My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.
#+end_quote

He's only talking about Harry's wand destroying Lucius's though, and not about killing Voldemort, but still interesting. I suppose it's possible Dumbledore was depending on Harry's wand more or less doing the exact same thing the Elder Wand ended up doing, and from what actually happened, I think that's a reasonable assumption for Dumbledore to have made.

But despite this, I do not necessarily think Dumbledore even expected Harry to be the one to kill Voldemort at all. I don't get the sense Dumbledore cares all that much about what the prophecy says, or for things like fate or destiny. He works off of facts and trusted magical theory, and he does not seem to trust Divination. From the living Dumbledore's perspective, anyone can strike the final blow so long as Voldemort is mortal. Harry is the only one who can make him mortal, but anyone can do the actual killing bit. I think that's what the Order was supposed to be for, but things just worked out differently because of that "flaw in the plan". Anyway, I don't really think there was enough for Dumbledore to plan the moment of Voldemort's death. Only after he's dead do I think Dumbledore's perspective changes about who can kill Voldemort; in King's Cross chapter both he and Harry are now aware that Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, and Dumbledore explains things to Harry with the new circumstances in mind, that Harry /can/ kill Voldemort. Not that he has to, but that he is capable of it:

#+begin_quote
  “I've got to go back, haven't I?”

  “That is up to you.”

  “I've got a choice?”
#+end_quote

He asked Dumbeldore about the afterlife, and after getting a vague answers, says,

#+begin_quote
  “Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.”
#+end_quote

And Dumbledore responds,

#+begin_quote
  “True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”
#+end_quote

And I think they both know what that means.

*** First of all, I think you're confusing Harry with Umbridge. She's the one who said exams are what school is all about.

The book made it perfectly clear that the main purpose of the DA was to learn to defend themselves in the real world. Passing their O.W.L.s was a small part of it, but certainly not the main part.

It's mentioned several times. First when Hermione asks Harry to be their teacher. They want him specifically because he's had real life experience fighting Voldemort, and that's the most important thing to learn.

Then in the Hog's Head they're discussing it and Macmillan says something along the lines of 'Surely you wabt to pass your exams as well?' And Hermione says something along the lines of 'Of course, but most of all, we beed to be able to defend ourselves against Voldemort.'

As for the second part of your comment, this comes down to personal opinion. It was never about Harry being as magically powerful as Voldemort as the books made very clear, and I personally like that. It sets Harry Potter apart from your standard hero.

He didn't win because he was overpowered, he won because he had a good heart and was a good leader who inslired people to follow him. That's what makes him a hero. When Voldemort lost, the Death Eaters fled. But everyone stood up to protect Harry and kept fighting when they thought he was dead. Because he had inspired people to stand up to evil.

For the second part, yes he won because he was good, that's fine for a children's story but the series grew up. Its what made it so great when I was growing up, the series aged and changed as I did. By the time of the Seventh book it was very much young adult territory rather than children. At that point people want a real solution. Power of friendship etc doesn't cut it. People wanted to see Harry grow and take on the mantle of the chosen one, to leave his childish delusions of normality behind and become every bit as great as Ollivander predicted. Obviously greatness has different definitions but the ending was underwhelming for a lot of people. It was contrived and outlandish but not magical. Harry accepting his death might have been emotional but at the same time it felt like giving up. With regards to people standing up, they stood up to Voldemort before Harry, he might have been a figurehead but they were doing it long before he was born.

I challenge you to find anything in the book that backs up a single word you said. Like I said, passing their exams played a part, but by far the most important reason was to learn to defend themselves, as is made perfectly clear in the book. What you said was inaccurate, simple as that. Those examples I mentioned can all be found in the book, and there are more.

There also is (but I admit I may possibly be wrong about this) no mention that Harry chose spells because they were likely to come up on OWL exams. For instance, the examinor asked Harry to cast the patronus charm as a bonus, showing it wasn't part of the exam. Harry chose spells that he thought would be useful for them to know. He makes this clear with the disarming spell and I believe several others.

I also didn't claim that Harry's experience was vast. Just that it was the main reason Hermione asked him to be their teacher.

****** You're asking me to prove a interpretation. 'I'm sure some members cared more about their exams' I'm not claiming that they openly said it. Comparing what is written vs what is in line with the characters of a story is silly. Character as people have their own motives. We experience the books from Harry's point of view, we don't get insight on every character's motives for joining the DA. Heck, Michael Corner joins because of Ginny. His friends that came a long might care more about their exams. We don't get told every member's reasoning for joining, there isn't an in depth interview stage. It is reasonable to suggest, given the scepticism surrounding Harry's claims that some might have just wanted to practice magic that wasn't allowed in the class room. Me thinking its reasonable enough I'm willing to suggest at least one of the members saw their exams as a priority is me saying I'm sure. They aren't all convinced Harry is telling the truth, the chapter at the Hogs Head shows that. The fact that plenty sign up without full confidence in Harry's story is enough to suggest potential ulterior motives. You're taking my thoughts as a personal attack.

Harry isn't teaching them the spells that Dumbledore and Voldemort throw around at the Ministry at the end. He doesn't know them. What he has is Hermione, the books Lupin and Sirius gave him and his textbooks. Taking the resources he had available and his motives its highly likely that the spells he taught were part of the course and the spells he learnt at the end of the last year for the third task that he thought were useful. Harry thinking they're useful isn't mutually exclusive to them being tested. You look at where he found the spells and you draw conclusions.

So why were they learning disarming and stunning, and not let's say stuff like sectumsempra? Most of the Dark Arts seems like "1001 ways to kill people painfully", but a few of them seem like the superior choice for combat.

***** Harry explains why he chooses to teach them the disarming spell, when Smith scoffs at it. And the stunning spell proves itself to be useful. As for things like Sectumsempra; that's dark magic. I find it unlikely that Harry would choose to learn and teach curses like that.

As for why the books only show quite a limited amount of spells and tend to use the same few several times, I don't know. They have learned a lot of spells that we don't know about, as they studied in school for 6 years and we only see a few classes. Just like we only see a few DA meetings. We don't see Harry really deliberately using dark magic until DH when they were desperate, or in anger, which is due to Harry's main character flaw; to act rashly out of anger. It doesn't seem very in character for him to deliberately teach other students dark magic.

And again in DH, Harry makes it clear that he doesn't like using stronger spells than those like stunning and disarming, when Lupin berates him for disarming Stan Shunpike. It's consistent in his character. Maybe you imagine 15 year olds in the ministry to be maiming and killing people left and right, but that doesn't fit with their characters. Even in GoF, Crouch Sr.'s decision to fight fire with fire was seen as very harsh and controversial. Moody was considered a great auror by at least Sirius for never stooping to the level of Death Eaters, never killing unless he really had to, and we're talking about an adult and an auror who is trained to do that. Even he doesn't like to go that far.

It is also explicitly mentioned several times that learning to defend themselves was the main reason they chose to start up the DA. If you want to scoff at me saying that, just look up the proof for yourself.

I'm not saying Harry was right, I'm saying that the spell being useful for him was his reasoning for saying it was a useful spell and for teaching it to the DA. I explained it from Harry's point of view, not my own.

But personally, I do agree with Harry, regardless of the twin cores effect. A wand is a wizard's main weapon. Very few wizards are capable of deliberate wandless magic, and most Death Eaters are unlikely to be among those. That makes the disarming spell a very useful one.

#+begin_quote

Again, I'm not talking about killing people in the terms of whether it is a good or bad choice. I'm saying that it's not consistent with the characters' personalities and decisions and the way the use of dark magic is viewed by those characters.

As for the stunning spell, there are several scenes in which the use of spell proves succesful. Luna stunning Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room for instance.

Again, personally I think incapacitating people is better than killing. I believe in a justice system that doesn't involve the death penalty, let alone people acting as judge and jury themselves. While it's understandable that in a war they make choices they wouldn't otherwise have, catching and prosecuting Death Eaters sounds better to me than killing them. But that is my personal opinion, as straight up murder being better is your personal opinion. Don't confuse your own opinion with those of the characters in the books.

Their deaths were totally avoidable, but because the "light" side chose to hold the moral high ground instead of making use of their fortified one, fifty people died.

I doubt it. Harry usually responds to Hermione's nagging (usually in this order) by 1 ignoring, 2 deceiving/avoiding, 3 as a last resort bursting out in anger. He finds her nagging annoying and turns away from it.

But yes, Hermione is usually the one who makes the more morally ambiguous decisions. Though the centaur thing is not confirmed, it's just the assumption people make on the real world myths on centaurs.

Also, this is just fantasy, but blaming the victims for the bad guys' actions is very harmful. I think I've had a discussion with you on guns in the wizarding world before and we're never going to agree on that. So I have no wish to start that endless discussion again. I get your view though.

We know what the intention was of starting the DA by the people who actually started it. I completely agree that other students have had their own reasons, like Macmillan who considered the DA to be important to pass his OWLs.

However you say that the DA was made to pas standardised tests, but it's Harry, Ron and especially Hermione who made the DA and they make it perfectly clear why.

And this comes down to my interpretation of your comment, but 'that is made to pass their standardized test' sounds more to me like 'that is the whole point of starting the DA', rather than 'a few students among the DA were in it to pass their tests'.

I also accidentally quoted this line: 'I'm sure some members cared more about their exams than Voldemort since at that point all they had was Harry's word backed up by Dumbledore.' which made it look like I was disagreeing with this. But for the record, that was a mistake and I'm not disagreeing with that part.

****** > Harry explains why he chooses to teach them the disarming spell, when Smith scoffs at it. And the stunning spell proves itself to be useful.

whenever i read or listen to this passage, i feel the urge to strangle Harry. Yes, the Disarming Spell PROTECTED Harry, but ONLY Because of the Special Connection with the Core. Would he had any other Spell, the Avada had killed him. Harry is spreading false information, that the Disarming might be work and Protect against the unforgivables (the avada in particular). Harry could also have stated "hey, if someone casts the Killing, just simply counter with the Disarming spell." (really, why hasnt anybody thinking about this genius idea?!. The only good Point i see in his statement is that it silenced Zacharias, whos suprise was totally right, because...like i said, any other would be killed. But Harry seems (as so often) forget about what he learned in the Years. He seems to think, that the Disarming is the natural Protection against the Unvorgivables and totally forget that Dumbles mentioned that it was only because of the Cores...if he was aware of it, than it was dangerous to be quiet about it, as this was a necessary information to keep alive. Now that i think about, Harry seems to be a little like dumbles ("I dont care if Lives of faceless people would die in the Future, as long as you are alive"). But again, i give him this Point against Zacharias.

But this is a Fiction and Fantasy World. Realistically, the DE would only (or mostly) use the Unforgivables to make things easier, unless of course, Voldemort wants a Victim alive, than its captured (it it stay unharmed is another thing).

> Just like we only see a few DA meetings

actually we witness all of the DA meetings, but not all of them are as detailed as the First meeting. Mostly we get a summary from Harry about the teaching progress.

> Even in GoF, Crouch Sr.'s decision to fight fire with fire was seen as very harsh and controversial.

But it was reasonable. cruel, yes. But personally, i tend to Judge Bad action by its causes. If someone kills your Family right in front of your eyes, would you kill this Person in an act of Rage and Revenge or would you let him kill you, because your "morals" forbid you to kill this attacker? If someones does hurt other People and enjoys it, everyone has the right (in my eyes) to attack this Person, ESPECIALLY those, who are harmed by him. The Victims never asked for their Pain, but the Person was WILLINGLY causing the Pain and rejoiced by the Pain and Fear that he caused. I didnt came in such a situation yes, thank God

Imagine you meet a new Person, but this Person punchs you everyday, when your Paths are Crossed (on work). You know this Person is an evil Person and likes to hurt others. After an encounter, you say "stop hitting me, or i hit you back!". HE will be WARNED, he can adapt to your encounters and prepare for possible counters. If you keep silent and wait for the next time, YOU hit First or immediately after he hits you. You take him off-guard and throw all your anger in this Punch (and possibly more punches) and he has no time to defend or adapt to your attacks....i think, Bartys way was a plausible one to get out of the "Darkness", a cruel one, yes, but how many People did support him? Many, because they were desperate and wanted to be free again, free from the Pain and fear.

> Moody was considered a great auror by at least Sirius for never stooping to the level of Death Eaters, never killing unless he really had to, and we're talking about an adult and an auror who is trained to do that. Even he doesn't like to go that far." Nope, sorry, but now you are interpretating something in others actions and Behavior. We only have Sirius report about Moody. But how did he really thought? Remember the Pensieve scene with the DE in front of the Wizengarmot? Moody: "Lets take the information out of him and send him back to the Dementors". What does that say? Moody didnt want to execute the DE, no, he wanted them to suffer, if possible, untill they die. And i dont think he made a Joke about it, considering he was talking to dumbles about the latter not liking the Dementors. moody acts like one of the DEs, but im not blaming him. Hunting down the Trash of the Society must cause a rub off on someone.

> The good guys did win the wars, regardless of what you think of it

you mentioned it before: its a fantasy world..and if i may say so, a childbook series (Rowling even stated that she didnt saw the Books as Childhood series, but she wrote them for her "children" to read. Yes, it implies that her Children might not be physical children anymore, but can an Adult still have Fun with the Book 1-5? And the Good Guys won the War, because they were supossed to. The Evil is defeated, the Good wins, all are happy and the Mainchars marry and have Family.

> Apparently holding the moral highground did work; the proof of it is in DH

again, its a Fantasy World, a childbook series (who are supossed to teach morals) and most importantly, a Fiction, that Connects (or tries to) with the Real world. So the moral worked, because it was supossed to work. Why did Harry not Murder Voldemort? Because it would be bad, if Harry would became a Murderer. He had to be "pure" and innocent. The Children were teached that Murder by the Protagonist is bad, despite all the Problems and complications they would suffer through it.

> Again, personally I think incapacitating people is better than killing. I believe in a justice system that doesn't involve the death penalty, let alone people acting as judge and jury themselves.

Im split about it. But the "Justice system" is also built by Humans, and Humans might be corrupted by their Power, so they can kill innocents just because they dont like them or threatening them. Or it can set free Dangerous People, because of a "formality" or bribe. Incapacitating People contains the all-time Possibility that said person can Escape and Vanish without any traces, nowhere to be found, continuing the Killing Spree, but in other Countries.

People acting as Judge and Jury themselves......if the Justice System clearly has failed because a Letter or a Date was incorrect in the Culprits case, and he is set free and continues in killing People, the Government will say, that the Cases have Fault, because someone was editing them wrong. But what excuse do they have if the Culprit vanishes without a Trace? Or if all Evidences speak for the Cuprits fault, but the System sets him free, because its corrupted? As im said, im Split, but considering the Circumstances. Vigilantism isnt always that bad. The Gouvernment just tells its People that its bad, because they dont want the Citizens to kill each other and so make a lot of Paperwork or to reserve its right to "kill someone legally" (death penallty IS STILL a Murder, a Kill, but its Legal)

I don't really get the hate against the disarming spell though, even if I understand why people don't like Harry's reasoning.

A wand is a wizard's main weapon. Disarming them of that weapon is a great idea. It's an excellent spell to use in a fight.

I doubt Harry would advise people to use the spell is useful against unforgivables, he knows perfectly well what the spell is for. It's a bit silly to think that. He just tells Smith that the spell came in useful for him and it did, as it was the first spell he could think of when faced with Voldemort. And no spell can block the avada kedavra anyway. And Harry is aware of the twin cores thing.

But he also knows that it's a useful spell and I think that it was a great first spell to teach the DA.

this were just my Opinion and initial Thoughts about Criminals, that werent dealt ordinary with. And WE can only imagine, via Sirius Report, how the World was. Everyone could be a Spy for the Dark Side. Going the "Soft" way, would only slow down the Process, be more morally, yes, but also giving the DE the possibility to adept to this "typical light side" tactic and eliminating its cause with preventiv measure. "the way to hell is paved with good intentions", i can easily imagine that Crouch was just wanting to end the misery, but over time, he got corrupted by his own Intentions and the fact about his Son. Thoughts are free and you cant tell me, that you wasnt driven once in your life so far, that you imagined, you would go violant against another Citizen.

> I don't really get the hate against the disarming spell

you say it yourself: its not the hate, but Harrys Reason for it being useful, atleast for me. But we see Harrys reasoning and it might be considered Naive.

> I doubt Harry would advise people to use the spell is useful against unforgivables, he knows perfectly well what the spell is for

he more or less indirectly, confessed this by making Smith silent with his Statement. Keep in mind, that No one knows, why Harry survived through the Killing Curse. Maybe all might think, that the Disarming might be especially powerful in his hands. Smith could have countered "come on, you want to tell me that the disarming would work against the Unforgivables?" and Harry would been defeated. i guess we can all assume that Voldemort only used the Unforgivables, maybe not against Dumbles, because for him he needed a Bigger Arsenal of Spells. Well, atleast it sounds to me, that Harry is submiting, that the Disarming would work against the Unforgivables.

> And Harry is aware of the twin cores thing.

the thing, that we cant Witness Harrys thoughts right after he makes Smith mouth shut, refuse me to believe that. As i said, Harry forgets a lot of Things during the Years. Think about that even Hermione didnt believed Harry in Book 7, as he mentioned that the Cores did this. HELL, even Dumbles believed Harry and even explained this to him, but the so called "know-it-all", refused to believe what Dumbles said -.-

> But he also knows that it's a useful spell and I think that it was a great first spell to teach the DA.

Sure, the thing is, the he made a state, that the Spell might be useful in defending against the Unforgivables and we never see him denying this fact. Of course, there are other More adult and more experienced Wizards, but as multiple times proven: Harry is a powerful Wizard. So the fact that he can defend with a Disarming against the pure Evil, might give a lead, that its possible, but the other Wizard are not talented enough. Too bad for them.

** In my opinion, the characters - all of them - were pretty much holding the idiot balls for most of those books, and acting wildly out of character just so the plot wouldn't get derailed. That was a tendency of the earlier books as well, but it became blatantly obvious when the tone shifted from children's books to more serious YA novels. The idea that Hermione and Ron (and everyone else from the Order) would dismiss Draco as harmless is so shitty it beggars belief. The "flight of the seven Potters" is a plan a six year old would have dropped as stupid. The revelation that you can be your own secret keeper, as Arthur and Bill demonstrated, suddenly revealed Lily and James (and Dumbledore) as idiots who missed such an obvious security measure. Capturing murderous Death Eaters, yet not killing them, or at least obliviating them down to children, beggars belief. The whole camping trip is a farce that has "I don't care about logic, they have to be hungry and cold, even though they're wizards and witches, and could easily avoid that" written over it. And Dumbledore wasting his last year on shit he could have taught Harry in an afternoon and somehow not telling the trio all they needed for the hunt in advance (as well as handing them the items he had prepared for them well ebfore his death, so the Ministry couldn't mess with it) takes the cake. Once more the supposedly most powerful and intelligent wizard of Britain is reduced to some useless plot device, instead of actually acting out his experience and smarts.

Either the books should have kept the children's book tone and be more whimsical and less bloody, or the bodies of Death Eaters should have started to hit the floor starting in sixth year as the Order and the Ministry went to town on Voldemort's supporters, using everything Dumbledore could bring to the table. At the very least, Dubmeldore should have used his restored influence and power to get rid of scum like Umbridge, and pretty much everyone else supporting blood bigotry int he wake of Voldemort's return being revealed. By the time he died - if he has to die, even - the Ministry should have been remarkably free of open bigots, and much stronger, and Malfoy should have been dead.

.

Personnally, I don't like them because I felt that the bad guys were dumbed down to provide a feasible challenge to the good guys so that it doesn't look like a nundu vs a bowtruckle like it would have been if the power levels weren't changed.

Obviously the correct path would have been, IMO, to make the trio /good/ in a area of magic, or even a special perk like an animagus transformation. Anything, really, that made them something more than school dropouts that doesn't know more than the curriculum.

The pairings should have been different. If not at the Battle of Hogwarts than the Epilogue should not have H/G or not as a happy couple but as one that would stay together because of convenience. Hr/R I personally think they would have separated/divorced fairly quickly.

The inventivity of magic is missing, if at eleven they thought of levitating their enemy's weapon to beat him with it rather than just battering it with a spell, why don't they do the same thing later? Like, I don't know, transfigurating some tables into wolves when the snatchers arrives. Especially since IMO the TWT was in part to showcase what HP&co would be able to do by 17.

The ideologies: why is Voldemort and his followers fighting for besides ethnic cleansing? Why is Dumbledore? Shouldn't there be disagreements within both parties? As in: "the Dark Lord is wrong, it's not a parentage issue, it's a culture issue, that is why we should kill the parent's of muggleborn when they are babies and raise them in proper society" or "the Death Eaters are way too extreme but it is fascinating how they do not bar werewolves from leadership position".

Of course, I would have preferred more exposure of my house, Ravenclaw (along with a pairing HP/LL but that's another debate altogether).

And finally (for now at least) would be that there are too many Deus Ex Machina and incoherences in the magic. I usually don't mind a Deus Ex Machina or two but I like to have a Chekhov Gun to go with it.

Show us the changes the war caused - for the kids who fought, for the muggleborns who faced a genocide, for the scum who supported Voldemort with words but not deeds, for the establishment who saw their country taken over by Death Eaters and then freed by a bunch of kids, revealing how hollow and weak the entire Ministry was. Show us Hermione leveraging her and her friends' power to push through radical changes to creature rights and other reforms - it's not as if anyone would oppose the people who just killed Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

Whatever you do, don't end the book with that shitty "we all fought and so many died so we could return to the status quo" epilogue.

**** Well, I already have the end game planned out, so let me know if you'd like the build-up to it:

Harry/Daphne (she's a blank slate, so I have an easier time dealing with her). He works with the Aurors for a few years, but becomes the DADA professor after his son is born.

Draco serves five years. When he gets out, he meets Astoria. Lucius dies in prison while serving his sentence. Narcissa at first vacations and then pretty much lives with Andromeda.

Hermione revolutionizes the Ministry. Then she becomes the youngest Headmistress in Hogwarts history. Neville is her deputy because Harry doesn't want to draw anymore attention to himself.

Haven't decided what to do with Ginny, other than she remains a background character.

The existence of Albus Severus is nary a thought in anyone's mind.

  All purebloods are evil. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of +men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor and on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth+ Potter and House Greengrass, the only /grey/ house, who never had anything to do with Voldemort, well besides uncle Aldrin, but we aren't talking about him anymore, resisted Voldemort and fought valiantly on the grounds of Hogwarts, they shall fight on the beaches, they shall fight on the landing grounds, they shall fight in the fields and in the streets, they shall fight in the hills; they shall never surrender.

I love using the name only characters because you can write them any way you want. Have them interact with the known characters. In both of my stories, Penelope Clearwater plays a far larger role than in canon. Both have background characters as love interest (Lisa Turpin and Nymphadora Tonks respectively). If you show more than just the main cast, you add life to your world. Sure, it doesn't matter that two background characters are together, but mentioning that there is something going on in Hogwarts besides the main plot makes a better narrative IMO.

Canon is lacking in the regard of using the reserve bench. Harry spent 6 years on the Quidditch team. He ought to be more affected by Katie getting cursed than "oh well, just another Saturday. Or in GoF, where Harry is desperate for a date, would it have been that difficult to ask Alicia after Fred asked Angelina? Instead of spending a few weeks making a fool out of yourself, why not ask your friend. It was a social obligation because Harry got shafted by the staff and Ministry, not a marriage.

Oh, but it gave us "Stages of Hope" and Harry's manic Luck Potion addiction in it. So I can't really feel that bad about it's addition to canon.

To be totally fair a lot of stuff is stupidly overpowered and introduced as a plot device without thinking through the consequences: Polyjuice, Veritaserum, Unbreakable Vows, Fidelius, Apparition, Time Turners... etc. A potion that makes you a bit more lucky seems the least of your worries if you're concerned about things that should or could have been used to better effect. Time Turners just for the fact alone that you can exist twice at the same time are completely ridiculous. Not to mention that you can use them to spy on events after you hear about them. Oh and add Invisibility/Metamorphagi/Polyjuice to the mix and suddenly you can save people from death by replacing them with a polyjuiced and confounded Death Eater.

** A lot of good points have already been made here so I won't repeat them. However, I wanted to slap Harry around in Half-Blood Prince. His character was so bloody infuriating and quite honestly, I can't even tell you why. To me, he just was and grew increasingly unlikeable as the book progressed. I know he hates the titles he's been given in his life, like /The Chosen One/, but in Half-Blood Prince, it's like he uses this whenever he sees fit. He becomes a hypocrite, really.

As for The Deathly Hallows, much of how the story unfolded was utter rubbish. More in like it wasn't plausible by any sense of those who had functioning brains. I mean, come on, would it have killed Dumbledore (and by extension, Harry, Ron, and Hermione) to tell other trustworthy members of the Order about Horcruxes? That's something that I never understood. I think Lupin could've been a real asset on that hunt. And again, Harry acts like a little prissy brat in the book. I mean, people complain about Ron leaving Harry and Hermione but if you look at it from his point of view, it makes one wonder how he stayed that long with them (namely Harry) and why on earth he decided to return.

** What do I remember of DH? It drags pretty much, a few good ideas and a lot of boredom during their camping holidays. What bugs me more, however, is, how the average student Potter became the super!Auror overnight.

The most annoying part of HBP was the idiotic break-up.

** Most of the books fault were that they were written in Harry's POV, at Hogwarts or out camping, cut off from the rest of the world, where all the interesting stuff happened, and not only that...

I mean, Harry mastered apparition, something that the author only saw fit to mention as barely an afterthought. And come on, why wouldn't Hermione, or even Ron think that Malfoy was up to something? And Albus Severus Potter. You'd think Ginny would have had a thing or two to say about that middle name, having suffered under Snape's regime at Hogwarts...

** Not that GoF or OotP are less egregious, but....after GoF it seems like JKR ceased having an editor and it shows the most in HBP and DH. They could use a lot of revising, honestly.

** I liked the implied promise of OotP abouy Harry becoming more independent and making his own way. Most indie!Harry fics sadly take that way over the top, but JKR took the story in the exact opposite direction and made Harry more into a puppet than I could have ever imagined.

The themes in HBP and DH are somewhat interesting too, but not at all what I would have liked.

On top of that there's a huge amount of very specific issues I have with things that happen in those books:

Hermione acting like a thot and getting mad over Harry doing good in potions; the non-romance between Ginny and Harry, killing off Hedwig, saying that a totally non-compatible and awful couple like Ron/Hermione is good to impressionable children and teenagers, shitty camping trips, Ron being a deserter again and welcomed back with open arms again, awful plot contrivances (very convenient timing for coming back there Ron), the "plan" to defeat Voldemort is utter shit, implying that being on the side of Dumbledore somehow redeems Snape, imitating Parseltongue by making hissing noises, Molly killing Bellatrix (yeah yeah I get it HP is about protection not revenge, but if Molly-Wobbles is such an awesome duelist maybe make use of those skills earlier? Totally should have been Hermione/Neville/Harry), a stupidly convoluted plot introducing new wand-loyalties and weird blood magic protection mechanics so that Harry can survive, Harry naming any of his children Albus Severus...

Book 1-5 have their flaws too, but I could never just write such a huge list off the top of my head for any of them. Also I can totally ignore some flaws when the pay-off is good enough. In HBP and DH the pay-off is awful. "All was well" still sounds more like a taunt to me than anything else.

** I can't stand the epilogue, it's too cliche of everyone marries their high school sweetheart even though they have horribly clashing personalities that would make for some miserable marriages.
