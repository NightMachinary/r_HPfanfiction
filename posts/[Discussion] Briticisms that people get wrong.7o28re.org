Several fics I've read recently involve Vernon Dursley "was starkers" and locked Harry in a cupboard or describing how Sirius Black "went starkers" before killing all the Muggles. In British English, this means they were naked, not crazy, and that's not an image I want. Are there any other briticisms that people can think of that fanfic authors unknowingly misuse?


** Most of the stuff that gets on my nerves is when people pick up those idiotic lists of "British" words and then just shove them in wherever it seems right. Like, there's a lot of variation in "British" accents, and you have to consider you have people from all over going to Hogwarts - Hagrid's from the West Country, Harry's from Surrey, the Weasleys are from Devon, and then you have people from other /countries/, like Seamus, where a lot more than just accent is different, even though he's an English speaker.

Molly Weasley isn't going to be using miner's slang from Swansea. Harry isn't going to be talking like a Cockney. And the Malfoys probably aren't going to use slang of /any/ kind.

The only character I'm a little more forgiving over is Severus Snape, 'cause I know people do occasionally try to show he's from the North, but based on the way Snape speaks, it's very likely he trained himself out of his accent, and would avoid any slang or word usage that would betray him. Occasionally, it's great to see when someone has stuff from his POV, though, where inside his own head, you see the sort of language he uses.

** I think there's a real misunderstanding of the British class system and how much it impacts day to day life. Much of the 'Lord Potter', type stuff is a symptom of that. I feel like Americans feel that they need to take it to such an extreme because they view it as Downton vs normal people, but actually it's way more complex than that. It's heavily associated not just with wealth, but accent, education, occupation of yourself and of your parents, your hobbies, the clothes you wear, where you live down to specific streets... Even people that are wealthy may not be regarded as upper class, and there are more levels than simply working class, middle class and upper class. There are nuances to it that I can't explain.

It's a running theme in the books, but plenty of writers miss it entirely, so you get odd moments in fics that don't quite gel. It's easy to see that Justin is upper class, as he was down to go to Eton, but it's not so easy to see that the Dursley's are aspiring middle class at the most.

This sort of thing will affect the way characters behave. Middle/upper class characters won't be using as much slang, but when they do, it will be a certain type of slang. Working class characters are more likely to have a stronger accent. They may even feel intimidated in places like Hogwarts initially - they might try and hide their background, but it's more likely that they will defensively play up their working class roots. The way working class kids and middle class kids nickname each other is different. The way they act out and misbehave is different. The way they talk to authority figures is different.

*** Absolutely, I mean I always find it jarring when you find fanfics that just describe everything as being velvet, marble or silk, because that's what rich people have I guess. Then there's the people that just use synonyms for words in an attempt to make their characters sound more 'refined' and it always just comes out so awkward and clunky and unnatural.

Most of the time you see none of the impact a character's upbringing has on them and any introduction to 'upper-class society' is just flawless after you flip through a thesaurus and get yourself some new robes

******** For example, a girl I know went to my last school just for sixth form after having been at state schools for the rest of her life. The differences were cery clear in the way she thought about things (such as terms like mufti, about politics, about authority figures, etc), the way she spoke (her accent was far less refined, she generally use a narrower and more corse vocabulary, and so on. Indeed, I founs it difficult to understand her at times because it was so different to what I was used to hearing). Then there are things like the houses tou live in, the state schoolers usually (though by no means always) lived in smaller houses in less well off areas to my my more middle and upper class school chums. One big thing was how a lot of us referred to years as forms while they would jse the years. Persoanlly, I used both sometimes because many of my school (out of eight) were international schools outside of the uk. There are other things as well.

They want to be middle class and probably consider themselves as such. But I imagine the parents of Dudley's classmates at the private school probably consider them dreadfully common.

*** Well I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case with muggleborns, etc. Class doesn't really seem to come into play in the wizarding world like blood does (or at least this is the substitute for class). The Malfoys are ‚Äúposh‚Äù and upper class more than anything because of their pure blood status and wealth. The Weasleys are seen as ‚Äúblood traitors‚Äù because they are poor and sympathetic to muggles/muggleborns- not because of where they are from. What wouldn't surprise me is if half-bloods in Slytherin downplayed that they weren't pureblooded in the same way someone from a working class background (or say the north) would hypothetically downplay their accent in an Eton like environment. Seamus is an example of someone who is from Ireland, doesn't seem particularly well-off (this is never alluded to if I recall), a half-blood but nonetheless he doesn't hide who he is and Malfoy never seems to take issue with him (as far as we know). So unless you're muggleborn or a blood traitor or a pure blood from a distinguished family (we know there's the sacred 28) there's not much class ‚Äútensions‚Äù as there is family feuds or views on muggles.

**** On the contrary, I think class comes into play a lot in the wizarding world. The Malfoys and the Weasleys are both pure bloods, but the Weasley's are looked down upon. You might regard that as connected to their 'muggle loving', but that is the same as the way middle class people might look down on their friends if they hung out with people that lived on a council estate. The fact that the Malfoys relentlessly mock the Weasleys regarding the wealth, and the fact that Malfoy seems to view Remus Lupin and Hagrid with the same disdain, points to Rowling making class prejudice a strong theme in her book, which would make sense considering her background.

We can't say anything about Seamus's background, but his mother was clearly able to afford world cup tickets, by the 90s there was not as much prejudice against the Irish as people tend to think.

***** But were aware that in previous generations the Weasleys did have wealth (Ron's great aunt owns a goblin tiara - passed down clearly, but still indicative of wealth) and considering how large of a family they are continuously mentioned to be, I always assumed that the Weasley ‚Äúfortune‚Äù was just stretched too thin and never made a difference from generation to generation- your parents dies you might get ¬£40 after a few large generations. And clearly Weasleys were good enough to marry off to some high falluten families in certain lines - in some Rowling drawn family tree I think a Weasley married a Black or something of the sort. And you can mostly certainly be upper-class and poor (in a way look at the Gaunts, squandered their fortune, into dark arts, heavy inbreeding, but they're descendants of Slytherin himself - by all means they'd be considered wizarding ‚Äúroyalty‚Äù in a fair world). And I think Arthur is seen some what as a joke in his job - he's obsessed with muggles beyond simply sympathising. And perhaps this is harsh, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arthur could've had a better paying job had he not been so in love with what he did for a living and making his family more comfortable by working in a different field. Lucius and Arthur clearly have some issues with each other that don't boil down to class. I think the Weasley/Malfoy examples are piss poor if you think about it, because they hate each other personally more than anything. But we don't know enough about other feuds/family relations in the wizarding world. The Malfoys look down on Hagrid and Lupin not because of their wealth (though they mock them for it) but because they aren't fully human or shown as being 1. Buyable by Lucius like Fudge and 2. Don't conform to standard wizarding dress codes/standards. I don't see it as class prejudice, I see it as blood and prejudice against ‚Äúlesser beings.‚Äù Malfoy probably sees Lupin and Hagrid on the same plane as Dobby, perhaps lower, because they can't be controlled. When I mentioned Seamus being from Ireland I wasn't meaning it as an Irish-English clash, more as a person that we know where they're from. I can't remember mention of where Neville or Dean are from in the series... and so was trying to find an example of someone who didn't have any obvious tensions with Malfoy (aside from being a Gryffindor) and was from a rather middling background (not super wealthy, not super poor).

****** Muriel is on the Prewett side, not the Weasley side. I completely agree you can be upper class and poor (as was my point earlier), but wealth is a large part of it and the Weasleys don't show any other signifiers of being upper class - they don't have a grand home, they have many children, the points you made about Arthur's job - they're all about class. Calling it a piss poor example is pretty rude, just because you disagree, when JK Rowling feels very strongly about class and makes it a theme throughout her writing.

Malfoy didn't know Lupin wasn't fully human. All the things you mention about blood are just allegories for class, which tends to be a stronger issue of prejudice in the UK than race, but is undoubtedly mixed. I think on this matter we will have to agree to disagree.

** "Bloody buggering fuck/shite."

Am British, literally /nobody/ I know swears like this.

Swear words - in my experience - tend to be used in a singular moment to punctuate someone's displeasure, like this: "Fuck" "Shit" - notice people don't tend to say "Shite" anymore (at least where I'm from) - "Bugger" "Arse" (although I say "ass") "Wanker" "Bloody Hell" "Cock" "Bastard".

There're worse, of course, and some people who grow up in certain strata of society feel the need to add "Fucking" before and after literally as many words as possible, or deploy cruder insults when they're swearing at someone in particular, rather than just voicing surprise/shock/pain/irritation/etc.

Yankee authors need to stop leaving "street" or "road" off a road name. It's Privet Drive, not Privet. It's Charing Cross Road, not Charing Cross.

People need to at least glance at a damned map before writing about places. Too often Harry goes from Little Whinging to Surrey and then gets the tube to somewhere. This is impossible. You can't go from Little Whinging to Surrey, because if you're in Little Whinging you're already in Surrey, and the tube network doesn't go to Surrey. It's like saying that he went from San Francisco to California and then got the Q train to Times Square.

Oh, and it's Surrey, not Surrey county.

*** Alright, I have a question which I failed to find any decent results for through google. How were the opening hours of stores, pubs, cinemas and so on in the mid-90s? I found some info on the Licensing Act 2003 but very little on the time before. I know that pubs closed before midnight but what about the other stores? How late could you watch a movie? How long did young adults (18-22) stay out at night and what did they do back then?

**** This is only my personal experience and someone with a better memory will correct me on details I'm sure, but to the best of my recollection:

I was with a heavy party crowd between those ages so what we did may not be average, I really couldn't say, but my friends went to gigs, pubs, fairs, clubs, parties, raves. I'm pretty sure raves were fairly common? We had wood parties where we'd light a bonfire and party out in the woods hidden somewhere. Some nice weather days we went to beauty spots and wandered around or sat in open spaces, free spaces or parks, drinking and smoking and socialising. None of us had mobile phones so it was word of mouth to find out where everyone was hanging that day. You might take a while to track everyone down.

We'd hang at someone's house all night, watching videos and playing on games systems. You could hire video games and CDs from the library. There were free festivals and parties in squats. There were a huge range of clubs from the small hippie clubs to giant dance clubs. The large clubs were expensive night's out and drinks were costly so we didn't do that often. We were pretty skint so we went to smaller clubs and gigs usually. There was often a house party to be found if you knew enough people. Most people I knew used intoxicants of one sort or another but how common that was I couldn't say either.

We sometimes went to the cinema especially if it was a huge film or a special showing. We went out to eat in boisterous places where we shared the food. I do remember going to the ballet once with my friends, seats in the gods.

How late you stayed out depended on if you still lived with your parents, were a student at uni, or were a party animal.

We stayed out till the club's or pubs shut, then we'd all pile back to someone's house. Sometimes you ended up going back with strangers or friends of a friend that you'd met while out as long as there were a few of you. Safety in numbers.

Some pubs had late night opening licences. Sometimes you'd get an after hours lock in but only if you knew the bar owners. I think last orders were at about 11. Do they still ring a bell and call 'last orders'? Pubs would shut in the afternoon then reopen in the evening but I can't remember if this was just on Sundays.

Clubs were open until the early hours, after midnight I'm pretty sure. Illegal raves and parties went on all night. I seem to remember we were more restricted by the trains stopping than the clubs closing. The night busses were our other way home.

I think the late showing at the cinema was about 10pm start.

Shops closed at 5 or 6pm except the corner shops. The Sunday trading act was 1994 and that really changed things. You couldn't shop on a Sunday until then. I remember late night opening at the shopping centre mid 90s was extended to 8pm on a Thursday. Supermarkets started to stay open until 10 on a Saturday night and at some point after that 24 hour supermarkets started.

As I said, my memory might be a bit off as it was a fair while ago, but I hope that helps a bit, or points you in the right direction anyway.

Yes. Or at least, very often. Some pubs will just start cleaning up and hope you take the hint and piss off but those are usually best avoided. Pub closing times vary from place to place and day by day but 11pm is pretty standard. Most places stay open longer on Fridays and Saturdays.

**** OK, that's another thing that bugs me. They're shops, not stores :-)

Opening hours for shops and cinemas varied widely, just like they do today. 24 hour opening would be rare even in city centres, but 6am to midnight would be expected for a few small shops in any significant built-up area. Typical cinemas would have the first showing at around 9am for large modern cinemas, or mid-afternoon for the awful local flea-pit, and the last would be unlikely to start after 10pm. Pub opening hours were 11 to 11, or 12 to 10 on Sundays and public holidays for no particular reason. A few specific pubs near wholesale markets opened earlier all the time, and very occasional variations for opening earlier or later were allowed for special events.

This 'ere young adult (well, I was back then) left the pub at closing time and went home. Some of my various flatmates had no taste and so enjoyed nightclubs, which had late booze licences under the pretence of being private clubs.

So when Luna says "I hope there's pudding" I choose to interpret it as her hoping there's dessert of some kind (which there pretty much always is at dinner, so the weird/nonsensical statement fits perfectly with the way she normally behaves), not that there's one specific thing called "pudding" at the feast for her. Even if that /were/ the case, to which pudding would she be amenable? Black pudding? Christmas pudding? /Yorkshire pudding?/

As another user said earlier, in the UK there are lots of "puddings" that encompass many flavours, textures and seasonal themes, so to say you want "pudding" in this country without specifying more closely what you mean much more strongly implies you mean the course rather than any individual dish that could be described as a pudding, or have pudding in the name.

My problem is like where authors get attached to Snape using "Dunderhead", in that they see a word used in one specific instance, and either overuse it as-is or (as the case seems to be here - to me at least) misconstrue the context of someone's statement.

Given that we can expect there to always be dessert (otherwise known as the pudding course even if pudding isn't served), it is clear that Luna is expressing a preference for particular dishes, not just hoping that there will be something sweet to eat.

** Usually, Americanisms is a much bigger problem in the HP fandom than misused Britishisms... at least the misused Britishisms show that the author is trying, even if they don't succeed.

At the VERY least have the characters say "Mum," or alternately "Mam," if they're from North East or similar... but not /"Mom."/ It's not that hard to remember.

*** Well people do say mom in the U.K... it's just unlikely that a canon character in HP would use it. No one from the middle class would say mom- and I can't think of many characters that would refer to their mother as anything other than mum (i.e. most of the children are at least middle class). Also mummy is much more common for a much older British (English, lets be real) person to say. Whereas I'm pretty positive you'd be shamed in the states for saying mommy above the age of 6 (it was hard not to shudder every time my ex called his mother mummy),

***** Depends. In the second half of the 90s US hip-hop music was definitely gaining traction in continental Europe - so this might have influenced it.

Also, in canon Dudley is "Big D" for a while. But maybe this never happened in the UK?

** As I grew up reading the books as an American child and have lived over in the U.K. for many years, I have to say I really began to appreciate a lot of details from the books by getting to know Britain (and the little itty bitty details one must live in a country to see) a lot more. A particular one is spellotape. What in the states it's just tape or scotch tape (like 1% of the time), in the U.K. is sellotape. And that revelation floored me! So while some Britishisms are stupid, irritating, and take a minutia of common sense -others are things I'd never have thought of until living full time in England.

** I think many things are regional - being from the west country, I swear we see so much older slang than the rest of England. Bloody, bugger, using a curse word every other word, are in frequent use in certain areas here though they're hardly universal. Northern Ireland, particularly where I grew up, everyone swore every other word and said shite and other random slang that probably doesn't look real at all. It's just a matter of perspective.

Personally, I only get jarred if everyone sounds the same or someone from Camden sounds like someone from Birmingham.
