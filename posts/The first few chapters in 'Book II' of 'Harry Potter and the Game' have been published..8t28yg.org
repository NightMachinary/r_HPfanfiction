I know not everyone is a fan of the "MC but if they were in a Game" genre of Fanfiction, but the author, Concept101 pulls if off fairly well.

I recommend giving it a chance. :)


** As an aside, with Gamer-style fics, it bothers me when they write stats as *WIS-2* because I don't know whether that's intended as *WIS: 2* (crap, but you're just starting out) or *WIS: -2* (a rock exhibits better decision-making skills than you).

** Guys, I've been waiting for you to publish more chapters to start my reading of this fic, but before starting I'd like to ask. Does this fanfic have romance? or will he have in the future? If so, who will be the love interest?

*** Harry will soon be entering his second year at Hogwarts so, no, there is not currently a love interest. The story also hasn't been giving any hints if a future love interest may exist or not. So this story will likely be gen. /shrug
