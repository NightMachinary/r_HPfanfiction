Many fanfics depict Ravenclaws as boring swots who spend all their time in the library. Yet diligently doing homework always struck me as more of a Hufflepuff thing - I imagine a Ravenclaw would be apt to get so engrossed in reading something unrelated to the lesson that they forget to do their homework entirely.

There's also the idea that getting into Ravenclaw automatically means you're smart (often seen in Ravenclaw!Harry fics which make him a genius). If they were the smartest, there would be no contest for the house cup, and that doesn't happen. We also see very bright students in other houses in canon.

I think it has more to do with character rather than intellect. The archetypal Ravenclaw in my mind is someone with a singular obsession that has nothing to do with personal gain. Think the magical equivalent of a Trekkie who speaks fluent Klingon, or a hardcore conspiracy theorist determined to learn "the truth". We have fine specimens like Luna Lovegood and [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Uric_the_Oddball][Uric the Oddball]] for illustration.

Of course, oddballs wouldn't make up the majority of the house (or they wouldn't be oddballs at that point), but I imagine there would be some in most years.


** I think this is stated in the Pottermore page for Ravenclaw if you end up in that house. They use an example of helping a friend find a new form of Divination by cracking raw eggs or something

  Another cool thing about Ravenclaw is that our people are the most individual -- some might even call them eccentrics. But geniuses are often out of step with ordinary folk, and unlike some other houses we could mention, we think you've got the right to wear what you like, believe what you want, and say what you feel. We aren't put off by people who march to a different tune; on the contrary, we value them!

  Gryffindors are much less tolerant than we are of people who are different; in fact, they've been known to make jokes about Ravenclaws who have developed an interest in levitation, or the possible magical uses of troll bogies, or ovomancy, which (as you probably know) is a method of divination using eggs.whereas we've got no problem if you want to spend your days and nights cracking eggs in a corner of the common room and writing down your predictions according to the way the yolks fall. In fact, you'll probably find a few people to help you.

**** Or maybe she's really annoying outside of odd academic pursuits. Or maybe she's got her odd academic interest and mentions it all the time, but doesn't actually do anything about it, driving everyone nuts.

Not saying treating her poorly is justified, but you can hardly use her as solid proof that Ravenclaw isn't like that.

****** Off the top of my head...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] mentions the difference between Ravenclaw and the other houses. Ravenclaws desire knowledge for its own sake and are likely to pursue any topic that interests them, no matter how impractical. Slytherins think knowledge is power. Hufflepuffs study because they value hard work, etc.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] mentions that Ravenclaw students have a reputation for getting sidetracked by obscure personal projects and academic debates whenever they aren't frantically cramming during exam season.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] Ravenclaw house has a betting pool that is won by whoever can come up with the best answer to a certain mystery - not for any practical reason, but just for the bragging rights of uncovering obscure knowledge.

******* Those are only 3 people mentioned. How many Ravenclaws do we even know?

Besides, we don't know what those two were like with their study habits. We know hardly anything about them. Maybe they did have some really weird interests, but they also socialize normally.

Saying that Ravenclaw welcomes the kind of students who will obsess over egg based divination isn't the same as saying that they like people who are strange overall and all the time. That egg student probably interacts with people normally and at a first meeting nobody would guess at their eccentricity.

** I don't know about a /singular/ obsession- I think they pretty much state what it is in the books, someone who loves knowledge. Your obsession could change, or you could have multiple, and some people could even profit off theirs. But the main thing is, yeah, that they love something beyond what most people do. It's the house of geeking out, for sure.

** Hey I'm either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw and really need some help sorting myself what do you think? I've tried it all: every Test Pottermore, myer briggs (I'm most likely an enfp), four temperaments (sanguine)...you name it. Yet I can not figure my house out, something always doesn't feel quite right. So I really need some help, since most of my friends aren't Harry Potter nerds unlike me. So here some Things about my Persona:

I'm very ambitious and hard working, i stick to my goal until i reached it. But i wouldnt cross my morals in order to do so, since I'm all about honesty, fair play and doing the right Thing. I prefer to work alone and wouldnt let someone copy my work/Idea, tho i help people if i think the Basis isnt fair. I talk too much and will literally debate or stand up to you for my beliefes (doesnt matter wether its a friend or enemy), in which i pride myself. I love to learn new things and music, poetry and Art in general, i value my Originality, Artsyness,Openess and Individuality But also my Empathy,Fairniss/doing whats right, Dedication,Honesty,Emotional intelligence and Social skills. I try to plan everything and weight my options, but If my gut doesnt feel right, i probably won't do it. I hate to make decisions and take risks. I always try to be fair but sometimes think of myself First, tho i am a fiercely loyal Person and would do anything for the ones I Love. I'm not blindly loyal, and If you cross me my Empathy for you is gone. My goal in Life is living happily with my close ones and doing the things i love (Art,poetry,publishing a book,travel) and having a positive Impact on people's lives

I Hope someone can figure the mess out that is me🙈

** Ravenclaw is a house for nerds. And by that I don't mean intelligent clever witty people who hunger for knowledge and the secrets of the universe.

Not that they cant be intelligent, clever or witty. But their defining trait I think is obsessive passion about learning and exploring specific things.

These thing can have practical application but don't have to. But more importantly they don't care if it does. Science is more practical in our world than reading comic books. But the nerds that like one over the other don't prefer it because of its use they just think its cool.

That's my headcanon anyway.

I think it lines up with canon. Many Ravenclaws you get to know like Lockheart Luna Trelawney Ollivander

Wouldnt be considered the most competent wizard or witch of all time. But they would very passionate and likely knowledgeable on particular subjects and may even be very skilled in those particular subjects.

So someone like Hermione I actually think might not fit so well in Ravenclaw but be better suited to Slytherin if she wasn't in Griffindor. The Weasely Twins on the other hand would do i think really well in Ravenclaw.
