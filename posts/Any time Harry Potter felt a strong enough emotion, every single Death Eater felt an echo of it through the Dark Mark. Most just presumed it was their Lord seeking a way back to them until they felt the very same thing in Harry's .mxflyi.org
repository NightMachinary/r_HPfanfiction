***** I can't remember the title and couldn't find it with the tags on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] (I guess the author didn't "pair" them).

Here's what I remember of the plot if someone has an epiphany :

During OotP, Daphne Greengrass ambush Harry and ask him to tutor her in a subject (Defense I think?) because she needs to get at least 3 OWL. Without them, her father could legaly take her from Hogwarts and sell her to a brother. Daphne is bad at school because she has a lot of trouble memorizing things (her father beat her up too much as a child or tucked her too close to a wall). In exchange from the tutoring, she would act as Harry's girlfriend to make the girl he is interested in jealous.

With time, Harry falls for Daphne (who is always grateful for the lessons compared to the members of the DA who take him for granted) and spend more time tutoring her. But Snape stopped giving her special tutoring in potion which means she still won't be able to validate 3 OWLs. So Harry ask her to marry her (Sirius went to negotiate with her father and got a very good price for his blessing).

At the end, Voldemort get themselves killed by the Aurors when he appareted in the middle of Diagon Alley. Harry and Daphne leaves school avec the OWLs (he gets private tutoring for the NEWTs) and they end up happy with way too much children.

PS: I think there is also a moment where Harry "legally" kill Snape in self defense but I could confuse it with another fic.

**** Right but that's more sex-based-ritual-excorsing-Horcrux like in “Banking on Her” by RobSt linkffn(7392700) not that much torturing-Voldemort-through-sexual-pleasure, which is what I was after. Actually, thinking about it this torture (without stepping to the level of eliminating Horcrux) happens in “Reign O'er Me” by cts linksiye(3555), where I think even “torturing Voldemort” or something like that is an euphemism for Harry snogging with Ginny (by the way, a great story even without this element).
