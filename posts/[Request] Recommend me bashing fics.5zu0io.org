With prefferably bashing of Dumbledore, the Order, the Weasleys, the Dursleys, Voldemort, you get the idea.

Story should be good and well written.

Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): IMO the ultimate bash fic, since even usually benign characters such as Arthur, Sprout, and Tonks got mercilessly bashed.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Someone recommended [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/][The Girl Who Loved]] to me a few days ago and it's one of the greatest things I've ever read. Only Snape and Dumbledore are bashed hard but here's a small excerpt from the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  "He doesn't hate you Harry. Far from it in fact. I dare say that he sees some of your mother in you."

  'I dare say you are mentally handicapped.' Harry knelt forward and stared at the ground. He didn't want to open himself up to legilimency... if that is indeed what had clouded his mind just a minute before.

  "You see, Harry, I have taken it upon myself as your Magical Guardian to prepare a betrothal contract. It will be through marriage that you learn to love and finally bring Voldemort to heel."

  "Married! You picked my wife for me?" Through his shock, Harry briefly wondered which witch had been chosen by the Headmaster for this sacrifice. If it were Ginny or even Hermione then maybe this could work. Or Susan... even Luna... but wasn't dating and courtship and free will supposed to be part of marriage? This contract better not be for Pansy Parkinson.

  "Not quite, Harry. I believe Tom has been intimate with Mrs. Lestrange, perhaps with the wives of a few of his more loyal followers as well." The old man paused and scratched at his beard for a moment. "As the prophesy states, Harry, we are to employ the power he knows not meaning that love between a man and a woman may not qualify. You, Harry, are to bond with Severus. You shall take his name as the subordinate member of the union. We have been brewing a rare and rather remarkable potion which will allow you to bear an heir to the Snape line. Yes, I'm quite sure that Tom has done nothing remotely like this."

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
