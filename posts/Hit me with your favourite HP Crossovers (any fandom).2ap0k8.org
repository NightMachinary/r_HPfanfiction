** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]: Crossover with Firefly/Serenity, set after the movie's end. So well written it changed my headcanon of Firefly after I finished it to 'of course this is what came after'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2862528/2/Elijah-s-Cup][Elijah's Cup]]: Narnia. Has more of the air of the Narnia books even though it's set in the Harry Potter world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][Harveste]]: Addams Family. Does a good job of mixing the creepiness of the Addams with the magic of Harry Potter. Start of a series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818454/1/Of-Veils-Gates-and-Magic][Of Veils, Gates, and Magic]]: Stargate SG1. Short, but amusing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389264/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Host-Club][Harry Potter and the Host Club]]: Ouran High School Host Club. Silly but fun. Includes slash, but not very graphic that I recall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380273/1/Meadows-of-Heaven][Meadows of Heaven]]: Narnia. Same as the other, has a Narnia air to it, but just a oneshot. Check the author's profile to find the sequel.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] - Avengers - The writing is absolutely top notch, having an older and more mature Harry entering the Avengers world is a nice change from most of the other fics in this particular crossover.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5379292/1/Bleached][Bleached]] - Bleach - I'm a big fan of bluminous8's writing and this one is no exception, warnings for a slightly sue Harry. The author has written several other HP crossover fics so if you like this one make sure to check those out.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: AU- It seems that even in Death Harry is never given a break. His soul ends up in Rokungai where his past prevents him from moving forward. Will he learn to let go?

#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] (and its two sequels) - Dresden Files - Shezza writes one hell of a badass Harry. The parts of the fic that are a crossover are usually explained well enough that you don't need prior knowlege with the Dresden Files.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4388682/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-that-Waits][Harry Potter and the World that Waits]] - X-men - It's been years since I've read this, I remember it being really good though.

#+begin_quote
  Summary: A shell shocked but triumphant Harry Potter decides to leave his world behind for another. Someone should have told him that AUs can be really, really different. HP/ X-Men crossover.

** [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Evil_Be_Thou_My_Good/Evil_Be_Thou_My_Good/][Evil Be Thou My Good]]. Harry Potter x Hellraiser, just a quickish one shot that keeps a good horror tone through out.

#+begin_quote
  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod][Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod]]. I don't know if you'd call it a crossover, put it's Harry Potter with Lovecraftian undertones.

#+begin_quote
  Every seventy years members of the Order of the Bath, a British order of chivalry, are being killed off. That is until Harry is brought in to hunt the killer or killers down. Harry/Padma. /Complete/

  After discovering that Cadence is not who she appears to be, Twilight is sent to another world entirely by the disguised Changeling Queen to avoid her plan being disrupted. When Twilight lands, she discovers that not only have Spike and their pets followed her, but that they've arrived in a world where the main sentient species is human. There's still a magic school, though.

** Metal Gear Solid crossover

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tactical-espionage-action-mgs-slytherin-eater.109024/][MGS: Slytherin Eater]]

Can't really say it is my favorite since I just stumbled upon it but the idea of a MGS Crossover and pretty good reception on darklordpotter has me adding it to my 'to read' list like the rest mentioned here. (abandoned)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10001746/1/The-Potter-of-Thedas][The Potter of Thedas]]: Dragon Age crossover. A very fun and awesome crossover of Harry stumbling into another universe - and meeting some /interesting/ people along the way.

This one is unique. It's a trilogy that is still being updated, I hope. The updates on the last one come very slowly, but they do come. It is a Bleach crossover found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1874144/Eradona][Eradona's]] page. It gets a little whacky in some parts but overall is a good story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1874144/Eradona][Wizard Runemaster]]: Warcraft crossover. A Harry/Harem story that is well written, kinda smutty, and universally funny. I really love this one but it updates infrequently.

I also second the nomination for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]. It is a really good read.
