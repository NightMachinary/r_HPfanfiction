** Nearly all of them: Teenagers

But seriously why does everyone forget that for parts of the story they are not even teenagers but expect them to act like adults. Remember in middle school when you were told to act your age and all you could think was "no shit i am acting like a 13 year old because i am a 13 year old"

** I always find it concerning how willing everyone is to overlook how much of a psychopath Hermione is. Now, I'm not saying what's right or not, but the least I want is an acknowledgement that the lengths she goes to isn't normal.

I think Seventh Horcrux, as always, has it right. She tends to follow the rules to the letter, but when she does break them, it's so extreme it's hilarious.

I mean, drugging two 12 year olds, stealing their clothes and leaving them unconscious in a closet for hours? That too so that you can break and enter into a place using an illegal potion that they'd stolen ingredients for, just because they had a hunch it was Malfoy? Tell me that isn't extreme.

She isn't really that much of a stickler for the rules too.

There's blackmailing Rita Skeeter. She should have reported her being an illegal animagus to the proper authorities, it would have been the correct thing to do. The only reason she didn't was so that she had a hold on her.

As others have already mentioned the DA cursed parchment, I think it's beside the point whether the curse was too harsh or not. What was the point of cursing the parchment when she didn't tell the others it was cursed? It wasn't a safety measure, it wasn't security, as no one knew it'd happen. It was just out of a desire for revenge.

Also, if you think there were extenuating circumstances for those, what about when she confunded McLaggen, ruining his chance to be on the quidditch team? That was a horrible thing to do no matter how you look at it.

*** I'm not sure if psychopathic is the correct term. Hermione is a very intelligent character, but also exceptionally naive. She doesn't realize what kind of damage she could do when she does things like that, at least in the first few books. If I was looking for a perfect word for Hermione, I would choose vindictive.

With McClaggen, I wouldn't say horrible. Was it a good thing? Nah. Was it the work of an evil mastermind? No.

I re-read that section a while ago but it turns out Harry and Ron only stole their shoes and Hermione got the robes from the laundry. Also unless they were being especially cruel theres no indication they would have knocked them out for more than two hours since polyjuice only lasts one hour. At worst you could class that as a prank since it's not like the two were co-erced into eating the cupcakes. I hate to victim blame but they're the ones who decided to eat random food lying around in a school where the Weasley Twins run rampant.

Also, magical people are so so much tougher than muggles. Iron bludgers coming at you full speed being a part of a game considered as harmless as Quidditch (it's no Quadpot anyway) should be enough proof of that, or maybe falling off broomsticks and not being too hurt, or getting slashed by Hippogriffs and getting just a cut should suffice.

****** GBH is not the term here - please stop talking about UK laws when it's clear you don't know enough about them. A man was stabbed on my road this year with an improvised weapon and the final charge was GBH Without Intent, which was then a just-under-three-year prison term, with parole options available.

Injury in an accidental or other context (McClaggen is a cunt, for sure, but not an actually malicious cunt) would not carry a six-year prison term, even if it fell under the GBH umbrella. Mitigating circumstances would occur.

Also, in your later comments regarding summary execution of illegal combatants, /we don't do that here/. I don't know how it is where you're from, but the death penalty was abolished in /all/ instances in 1998, and our last execution was in 1946.

Not qualified? What the hell are you talking about? There's no such thing as Quidditch qualifications for a school, it's like the wizard equivalent of the school football team. Please tell me where Fred/George/Crabbe/Goyle got /their/ Beaters' qualifications, because it seems like you have different info to me.

Also we have terrorists trying to do that now mate, and we /still/ won't execute them. Yes, execution was legal in the 1980s, but the UK government hadn't executed someone for 34 years at that time, and even then there was a long drawn out court process before executions would be decided as punishment.

-EDIT BELOW-

On the case of GBH in the UK, I've done some more research, and GBH is an amalgamation of several separate crimes, that fall into three section offences - sections 18 (GBH), 20 (Actual Bodily Harm or Wounding with Intent) and 47 (Common Assault). Section 18 is what most people understand to be "GBH", in that there is specific intent to cause GBH or an Unlawful Wounding proven. Many GBH offences fall under section 20 however, as many non-GBH woundings can fall under this even with intent. The vast majority of assault offences fall under section 47.

In the case of a section 47/20 offence, the /maximum prison term is 5 years/. The sentencing range of a section 18 offence is also anywhere between 3 and 16 years typically, so I have no idea where you got the "minimum 6 year" figure from. So once again, I will state that I don't believe you know enough about what you're talking about to accurately examine or dissect UK law.

It's one of my biggest gripes with arguments like this, is that in the end muggle law wouldn't even apply anyway given the entirely different circumstances.

No but a baseball player wouldn't be fired for picking up a bat for being unqualified to hold it. Once again, Quidditch at Hogwarts needs to be treated like any school sports team, and because - /you know/ - they're kids, there's always going to be people misusing the equipment and hurting themselves/others with it.

That may be so, but I still don't believe the UK government would execute them. The MoM might have them Kissed or thrown in Azkaban for life, but the muggle government still wouldn't execute them. Also we have a bit of a different opinion to Nazis than you evidently do, as whilst there are prohibited groups like National Action (of which being a member is an offence), we literally don't care if a person is a Nazi, only if they act on what they think by harrassing/assaulting/discriminating/insert /actual/ crime here.

If there are muggleborn serving the Queen, they /have to/ be under some form of legitimization from a magical government or governing institution, given that you can't just break the Statute at your leisure - not even to the Queen. Therefore they are probably in some way part of the Ministry itself. And if not, they are threats to the Statute and would probably be considered threats to the wizarding world as a whole. Not to mention that their training would probably fall short of what the Aurors or elite Death Eaters are capable of, given the lack of a magical institution behind them to educate and train them. Of course, this is so far removed from anything canon, an author may find solutions to it.

And to hang anyone, you need to catch him first and keep him caught. Meaning you first have to catch an extremely dangerous quasi-demigod who won't shy away from unleashing a brutal arsenal against you including such pearls as semi-conscious fire that you can't extinguish with normal means, a wide variety of deadly curse and an arsenal of curses that make you forget you ever wanted to catch someone. You also have to keep this individual within your cells against both his friends - who are also capable of all of the above - and magical authorities interested in the man themselves, who are /also/ capable of all that /AND/ have official authorization to erase your memory of ever having caught the criminal. Your only chance here is, again, to have your own quasi-demigods battling them, and I explained why I think thats unlikely and/or ineffective.

We had this discussion a thousand times in this sub and it always remains the same: If the muggles want to have even the slightest of chances, they /have/ to have support by wizards and witches themselves. And even then, you speak of /at best/ equal powers colliding - with it being far more likely that any force under magical supervision would be better trained and educated than the few muggleborns fighting for a muggle force.

Do you know how many people would see the Dark Mark if you cast it in central London? Oblivation at that scale isn't feasible. That's a plothole if there was ever one.

************** As a matter of fact, 18 year old Crabbe, was capable of conjuring Fiendfyre. There is literally nothing any muggle on the planet can do against this spell. /Nothing/. Water, sand, suffocation, does nothing to those flames. Even grown adult wizards and witches would be challenged to their limits against this spell. And why would a 16 year old Crabbe, Goyle or Malfoy ever be caught anywhere the muggles have access to? Why would the 16 year olds be part of an attack in which they could be caught? They haven't been in canon, until they were of age, with the exception of Malfoy /in Hogwarts/.

#+begin_quote
  They are not the ones running the show.
#+end_quote

Yes, they are. From what we see in canon, the Prime Minister is not informed of the situation because the Minister of Magic needed his approval. He was informed of already made decisions. He was informed of what his people would have to endure while the magical people fought it out. That was a courtesy. Before that they have /arranged/ for the President of the United States to /forget to call/. They have exchanged the closest assitant of the Prime Minister at their leisure because they realized a Death Eater controlled Prime could be a nuisance.

Mi5 or SAS agents/operators who wield magic would fall under the same laws governing all magical nations, written in the Statute. So if there /is/ such a unit, it would not be allowed to report to their muggle superiors about their means, only about their operations. Nobody would know what type of unit it is, without breaching the Statute. They'd be completely removed from any chain of command, if they want to keep the ICW off their case.

#+begin_quote
  given that some Royal had to sign the Statute or it wouldn't matter to them
#+end_quote

We have 0 information on who had to sign the Statute. For all we know, it could have been entirely by choice of the magical population.

And in some form Obliviation on this scale has to be feasible, otherwise the magical world would not have remained secretive so long. Its not a plothole, its simple conjecture. Wizards have made very open, very public shows of their magic in the past. The Statute of Secrecy is still in place. Therefore, there must be some form of reversal or corrective measure for very open, very public shows of magic to uphold the Statute.

#+begin_quote
  Muggelborn units of the Police or Army would work for catching low-level Death Eaters. Voldemort wouldn't give a fuck
#+end_quote

Yes, he would. That is a direct and open attack on his dogma. If he would let something like this unanswered (on several occasions), he would loose credibility. If the /muggle/ police, as in, the institution, would work against Voldemort, Voldemort would work against them. Simply because he /cannot/ let a challenge of his power go unanswered, out of pride first and out of an interest to uphold his credibility second.

If he saw muggles as equals to wizards, he'd be able to actually learn about and adapt to some muggle things.

lol. mate, you're not refuting anything i've said, instead opting to be rude. i'm not the one being immature here

if snape started talking shit about lily and women for dating 'jerks', and claimed he was a flawless, good person who did nothing wrong and deserved better, sure i'd agree with you. snape never claims he was a good person, and never resents lily. ergo: not a nice guy tm. the people we see him talk the most shit about are people who have wronged him personally.

- Doesn't show mercy to her enemies (Umbridge was deserved, but Marietta is controversial around here)

- Bad social skills (Lavender's bunny)

- Stubborn (Didn't believe Harry about Malfoy)

- Would cross pretty much every line when it comes to Harry (depending on your story, that can be an issue).

That was more of a turn with the idiot ball. In CoS, I believe she thought the Heir could be Malfoy, too. However, her refusal to even consider Crookshanks responsible in PoA shows her stubbornness and her belief that she is always right.

*** If I were to attribute one of the deadly sins to each character as their 'fatal flaw'...

Harry - Sloth; he never acts so much as reacts. His pride and wrath sometimes get him into trouble that could have been avoided, but overall his failing was in accepting the direction of others in all things.

Hermione, Albus - Pride; they want to be the one regarded as right

Voldemort - Greed; not for riches but to accumulate power and influence. He doesn't want the limelight as much as he wants to never be powerless against another, and wants to live longer than anyone else. He also collects trophies.

Snape - Envy; it isn't just that he wants what others have (or had), but he enjoys watching rivals suffer. His motivation is in how he compares to others.

Slughorn - Lust; you might think it would be gluttony, but he doesn't want to take more than others -- he just enjoys the feeling of being connected, influential. The opposite of Gluttony is temperance, whereas the opposite of Lust is Chastity/Loyalty. Slughorn is fine being allied with people in every side of a conflict, so long as he can continue seeking his pleasures.

*** How does Harry have 'wrath' as a character flaw?

If anything I would contend that one of Harry's flaws is his lack of wrath/vengeance. He lets Pettigrew live, he allows the Malfoys to escape punishment they very much deserve. Hell even after his godfather dies he can't bring himself to exact vengeance (/cruciatus/ fails) /because he doesn't mean it./ I can't think of a single time where Harry actually exacted any form of vengeance upon anyone.

** Harry- self-sacrifice (saving-people thing) and taking too much upon himself

Remus- Self-doubt and hatred of himself

Sirius- Temperamental and easily frustrated

Molly Weasley- Overbearing and unable to cope with the idea that her children are becoming adults

Dumbledore- He is the embodiment of the phrase, "the road to Hell is paved with good intentions" (meaning he's not some evil mastermind, he's just a good man who made some serious errors and paid the price for it)

Hermione- Vindictive and stubborn

Ron- Self-centered (although that one kind of ends at the end of the series) and can be a jealous idiot

Snape- Vindictive and petty

Hagrid- +How dare you think Hagrid has any major flaws he is amazing and great and god bless his descendants forever and ever because he is just the sweetest boy and was a seriously just awesome dude+ He sometimes lets things slip that helps forward the plot and is a little too trusting

** Hermione - respect and trust for authority and rules, and things written in books (at least at first) [a flaw I have to struggle against myself]. Her ruthlessness later on is commendable, but her eagerness to enact justice at times gets in the way of her aims (that contract really should have been cursed with something that would have prevented the information from being intentionally revealed, and any witnesses who merely left without signing could have turned them in. I mean, really, signing the contract should have been a prerequisite to being informed of anything).

Harry - passivity, not wanting to stand out, wanting to fit in.

Ron - jealousy, laziness, being a sportsperson, and not being worthy of Hermione.

Petunia, Vernon - Child abuse

Dumbledore - Hiding information, withholding information from children, not being ruthless

Voldemort - making no coherent sense beyond 'evil for the lulz', not seeking to use magitech to attain better forms of immortality, not being inventive enough with Horcruxes, etc.

***** I'd say its pretty clear from the few hints we gather in the books that "Life" in the HP universe is more than just a body slowly decaying over the span of decades. And there /are/ known methods to prevent the physical decay of your body. The Philosopher Stone, for example.

****** Yet from what Dumbledore tells us, instead of the normal physical decay picking up again once the influence of the Philosopher's Stone ends the decay is accelerated. So something keeps track of the aging you lost out on when halting it that way.

****** My preferred fantheorying there is as follows:

Transfiguration boils down to creating a temporary construct of matter and magic (kind of like mixing a 'magical resin' with the target, and shaping it into something else until the resin evaporates) that has different properties, but is not permanent, and will eventually revert to the original matter.

Broadly speaking, Alchemy is the use of magic to systematically rearrange matter - so a spell that freezes water by removing heat from it, holding the molecules still, etc. is an alchemic spell.

The more complex such spells rearrange atoms in molecules (for example, a theoretical spell that rearranges carbon dioxide and water into sugar).

The PS is an incredible work of magical engineering that (somehow) rearranges the molecules making up one's body to reverse the aging process.

Turning one element into another is yet another level of precision - rearranging protons and neutrons, breaking apart and forming atoms.

The PS only does the former - a rumor created by the Flamels because if your average wizard thought they could get rich by rearranging subatomic particles... you'd have a lot of accidental self-nukings, followed by weaponizations, and they're smart enough to obfuscate to prevent that.
