I'm not sure if this small piece will be turn into anything longer, but I was wondering if you wouldn't mind reading and giving your thoughts on it. Thanks.

** The paragraphs are a little too big so try to make them shorter to not tire the reader with so much information. Try to make one paragraph for each phrase of the dialogue so the reader doesn't get lost or confused of who is speaking. I think that's most it but I don't have so much experience so wait for someone's else opinion.

** I'd have to agree with everything that LHPF said. Cut it down, some times less description is better. You want the reader to be interested in what happens next, especially in the beginning. You can also explain things later. Have him just do the humming and explain later about where he learned it and what it does. It'll have the reader thinking "what just happened?" and curiosity will have them continue on to the next chapter. So far great start!
