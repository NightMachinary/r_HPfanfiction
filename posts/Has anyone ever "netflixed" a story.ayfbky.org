Meaning completed a novel length story and released it all at once.


** Some writers do this, but they get less reviews and favorites if they release long fics this way than if they stretch it out over weeks and months, so most avoid this method.

** If you complete it don't tell anyone and then release it consistently once a week. People will think your update schedule is amazing.

*** This is actually what I'm planning to do. I'm completing at least the first draft before I begin posting, because I tend to take on too much and get burnt out and I don't want to leave people waiting for months on end.

** I was going to do this, but as [[/u/zombieqatz][u/zombieqatz]] noted you get less reviews and favs this way, and I haven't made any of the changes my betas suggested so I'm going to release as I finish editing the chapters, after finishing the entire novel-length fic. I think the idea of finishing a novel-length story before posting is a foreign one to most fic authors.

** I've kinda done it. I've got a ton of abandoned stories on FFN (still adding to that count). So, for Euphoria, I told myself that I wouldn't post any of it until it's done, so that's exactly what I did. Wrote and edited about 120k words over the span of two months, and then released a chapter a day until it was all up. So it wasn't all on the same day, but there really wasn't a reason why I couldn't do that, I just tried to milk some extra reviews and such.

** It behooves a trickle-release author to make use of the myriad of free online backup services so that he doesn't get 20/40 chapters uploaded and, "my computer died so..."

** Nope, I don't have enough patience to deal with ff.nets posting hell for that long.

I usually post about a chapter a week of a finished fic. Spreading it out also gives me time to reread and edit for a 50th time.

** I remember the author for lucky harry did not do this. He completed the story and then released it over time to get maximum hype. He had the complete story for a good year or two before he "finished" it.

I remember being in a facebook group with him, he was like "Hey guys just completed lucky harry" and I was like "Great, link me to it and i'll read it." and then he acted like I was an asshole for wanting to read the story he just said he wrote????

** I read a story in a different fandom where the author had written the last chapter and the first chapter at the same time but the story ended up changing so much throughout the process of writing the middle that the ending was super jarring and out of character. Eventually they ended up having to release a sequel fix-it fic.
