She's just so unpredictable.


** I imagine her response would be something like:

"Thats nice. One question though: why are all of the other names you have for your kids of dead people except for me?

** I think she'd be pretty emotional. She definitely wouldn't be apathetic - Luna is shown to value her friends highly and to be quite lonely ('[The DA] is almost like having friends'). I imagine she'd be very touched to have her friends name their child after her.

**** I don't think so. Luna works in the abstract, imo. She's highly artistic and would likely appreciate the symbolism - if she could understand it. She functions on a different wavelength when it comes to seeing the world, but I think if she understands the weight of what she's been given, the symbolism, useful or not, would mean a lot to her.

#+end_quote

Luna values symbolism over use any day, every day. For her symbolic meaning is use in itself. She herself does things simply for the symbolic meaning of her actions and words.

Her going "Yeah, so?" would be so incredibly out of character for Luna, I probably wouldn't consider her canon Luna anymore after reading it in a fic.

** She would be incredibly touched by the gesture and love the little girl like it was her own. Luna is first and foremost a very emotional character that has to hide that behind an aloof veneer stemming from her loneliness. She may be reacting differently than, say, Hermione, but she'd react very positive and emotional.

**** Or hell, maybe they're all Ginny's. Maybe Ginny thought /Harry/ would be happy if she named them after important people of Harry's life, and /he/ finds it creepy that he has children named after his parents and stuff and is constantly telling her to quit.

**** I can definitely see Ginny vouching for “Severus”, considering it was very likely that Snape bailed her out of multiple tight spots beside the sword incident.

Compared to Ginny, Harry had suffered far greater losses within his family, so it was very reasonable for her to let Harry have more leeway in naming their children.

“Albus” is the only one I think she disagreed with, since Dumbledore had put Harry through so much crap.
