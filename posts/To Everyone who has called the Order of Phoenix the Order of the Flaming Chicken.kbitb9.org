I would like to point out one thing.

A rooster's cry is deadly to a basilisk.

If a rooster had arrived instead of Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets in Harry's second year, the fight would've been over in an instant.

Therefore, a rooster is more useful than a Phoenix.

Therefore, by calling it the Order of the Flaming Chicken, you are complimenting it.

Checkmate.

******* Agreed, I don't like creepy Snape. I got reeled in reading time travel fics where they're the same age and eventually branched out from there. Most of the well written ones will address it and have Hermione as the aggressor, if things aren't changed between them age wise. I've also read a few good variations on Hermione as Dumbledore's secretly time-travel trained assassin that eventually ends up with Snape.

** How is a rooster gonna teleport into the Chamber of Secrets? Especially after they were specifically targeted beforehand for that very reason? They'd have to come baaawk from the dead, up at least one flap of stairs (ordinarily a flight, but, rooster), feather-fall down the pipe, and by that time, Harry's goose might well be cooked.

*** Depending on the height of the stairs, they might still be a flight. One of my hens preferred flying over her 8' protective fence rather than walking/running out of the gate in the mornings with the rest when they were leaving to free range during the day. We called her Sprint because she was the fastest of our brood. The first to learn to fly, though, we called Mary Poppins. Amelia Airhart was suggested, but I didn't want her to fly off and never come back. Daredevil attempted to fly off human shoulders before she even had primary feathers, but refused to fly up higher than about 4' once she had the proper equipment to do so. Still, as an adult she'd fly up on my arm, climb to my shoulder, hang out a bit before feather falling down. Those 3 were my most memorable flyers.

***** Oh they can fly too. At least the mixed breeds I keep. They just aren't as much fun to talk about as those three hens. Domesticated turkeys and the bigger meat breed chickens can't (or have a lot of difficulty) because they were bred for generations to produce more meat. Some turkeys have been over bred so much they can't even reproduce naturally because the tom's genitals don't reach the hens' vents. I don't keep turkeys, but I have a friend who did and looked into it when none of her turkey eggs were ever fertilized.
