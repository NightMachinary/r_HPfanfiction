I am thinking on writing a fanfic where I will try to include ALL, yes I said it, ALL the most infamous tropes out there. Time travel, marriage law.... all tangled together. So throw everything at me as I have the intention of try my best with this.


** draco is a good guy who is just misunderstood

draco deserves the death penalty for his war crimes

every wizard is part of a noble and most ancient house if they're rich

harry becomes a vigilante who visits incredibly cool and unusual punishments on his enemies

dumbledore is an evil manipulator with a master plan

voldemort is incompetent

ron is a moron

hermione is literally so perfect that she solves the entire story

luna is a seer/sexually open.

harry has a harem

harry is actually the secret heir of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Peverell, Potter, Black, Emrys, Pendragon, Malfoy, Lestrange, Bones, White, Purple, Dumbledore, Scamander, Evans-Verres, Windsor, Windex, and Zeus.

friendly goblins.

** Wrong boy who lived (usually with a twin brother called Jim)

dark! Harry

Serious Weasley + Dumbledore bashing

Some sort of secret betrothal contract to xyz minor female character (usually Daphne Greengrass)

Very very abusive relatives (sexual/physical violence that becomes very graphic)

Parsel-magic that can heal 1. the Longbottoms 2. lycanthropy

Harry goes to Azkaban for some crime he didn't commit

Severitus

Becomes some lord of dark animals/creatures

Harry is a metamorphmagus

Life debts and soul bonds -> usually leads to random characters falling in love

Harry gets dumped somewhere by unloving relatives gets raised by vampires/snakes/goblins/Merlin/random-powerful-creature

Parents come back alive

Some of these overlap (ex very abusive relatives and being raised by dark creatures) but if you can include maybe even half... damn I'd want to read that

** 1. Hermione is evil and is faking being Harry's friend after taking money from Dumbledore to spy on him; she's also actually very bad at magic.

2. Hermione is good and perfect and Harry's soul-bonded one true love; she's also actually better than Dumbledore at magic.

Good luck.

*** While the simultaneously good and bad at magic is a sticking point, I actually quite like the rest. Hermione is a horrible schemer... who is Harry's soul mate... because Harry is an evil person too. They both spend most of the relationship trying to screw over the other.

** You can't have a fic with all the cliches without Harry being sent to Azkaban for a ridiculous reason. Then, Ron has to kill Hedwig and burn Harry's album of parent pictures. Dumbledore has to force Harry to return to Hogwarts, and Harry has to have this violent, frothing-at-the-mouth anger towards everyone who literally couldn't do shit about him going to Azkaban.

It also /has/ to be Harry/Daphne before devolving into a harem fic. Daphne is the epitome of all things cliche.

** Harry gets a blood test at Gringotts that shows an unnecessarily long list of family vaults/titles he's set to inherit and of course, all of his magical abilities as well.. (Why would a bank be responsible for this? this actually never made much sense to me, wouldn't the Ministry of Magic have an office or department for this?)

Harry's name is actually Hadrian.

Smart!Harry = asshole!Harry

Harry makes friends with everyone.

Snaps turns out to kind of a good guy. (even though he willingly joined the Death Eaters and most likely did some messed up before his obsession with Lily led to him betraying Voldemort.)

  Smart!Harry = asshole!Harry
#+end_quote

As someone who really loves the actual asshole!Harry trope, I really hate how right this is. Like I'd even go as far as saying that the average smart!Harry (f.ex. any robstfic) is more of an asshole then Denarian Renegade's "I switch between being sexist, racist and speciest every week" Harry who spends a lot of time insuinating that Dumbledore (good!Dumbledore) is a pedophile and extorting the people he rescues for money. It's just masked by a thick layer of self-righteousness and the author metaphorically sucking his dick.

** Harry has some sort of creature inheritance that kicks in at 15/16 because he was left in a forest by the Dursleys or someting

Not to forget the Lord/Heir rings with 1000 different powers

Call Hermione Mione make sure to mention everytime that her hair is bushy and how smart she is

Write a bad song for the sorting hat

Purebloods celebrate Samhain, Yule, Beltane and the other one

The other ones were already mentioned.

** Harry has multiple animagus forms, including either a phoenix or dragon

Using the Chamber of Secrets as a Sekrit Clubhouse with his friends

Pet snake that goes to all his classes with him.

Slytherins revere Parselmouths

Slytherin has an internal hierarchy ("royalty" and competing to be your class leader)

Love potions courtesy of Mum Weasley

Ginny is a bitch (not sure if this is a trope or canon, really)

Dumbledore is paying everybody with Harry's inheritance

This one is going to be fun: to have all the tropes you have to simultaneously make Snape a misunderstood softie who has to act tough, and an unmitigated bastard who suffers a cringe-worthy death.
