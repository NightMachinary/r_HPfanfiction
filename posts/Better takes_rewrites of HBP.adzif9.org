No Harry/Ginny, slash, or Death Eater-apologism, please. I'm okay with gen, but if there's a pairing, please no Mary-Sues.

Edit: /Preferably/ with an original plot.

Mostly a 'rewrite with Hermione,' with pretty much the same things happening.

*** Thank you! I like Harmony, so that's fine.

*** One of my favorites from Chem Prof. Still suffers from the dad-writing syndrome, but not as badly and uses an interesting story format. Nice ratio of canon compliance and deviation too.

*** Yeah, I gave up partway through fifth year because hardly anything was new. If you're a big Harmony fan, I guess it's a reasonable canon replacement. Myself, I don't mind Harmony if it's done well, but I have no great attachment to it either. So, I didn't continue.

Edit: I gave it another go, but gave up again after it started indignantly bashing canon for having Harry/Ginny.

Just how original are you looking for? Keeping some elements, keeping Hogwarts or going completely of the rails of canon?

*** Staying in Hogwarts is a must, if that's what you mean. Otherwise anything goes.
