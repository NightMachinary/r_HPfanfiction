A lot of fanfics of the Marauders Era start with them meeting and Sirius already actively rebelling against his parents or at least generally disliking their rules and beliefs.

I was wondering if there were any fics where he's still totally indoctrinated by them during his first year at Hogwarts and says and does a lot of stuff that the other characters perceive as ridiculously offensive but he sees as totally normal. He doesn't have to be a full on Death Eater in the making. Just Sirius parroting his parent's beliefs out of ignorance and gradually changing his mind through the influence of the other Marauders.

** It's something of a factor in The Lost Generation by Jennbob - which is an on going very long WIP - the early scenes have some conflict between him and James over it and his moving away from his family is a well written and more complex than most fics make it :)
