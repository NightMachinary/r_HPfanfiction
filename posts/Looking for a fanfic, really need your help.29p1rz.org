Hi lads, I'm in trouble. I've been reading a very well made fan fiction for som time but I had to stop for a long time and I lost the link to it.

I'm a born-reader and leaving something unfinished is getting me crazy, I really need some help.

Concerning the fan fiction: * It's set after the war at Hogwards mainly * It is clearly mature after a good dozen chapters, written in English * The main character is Hermione and a good deal of the fanfic is about romance/drama beetween Hermione , Draco and Neville forming a 3 people relationship * Draco is heavily mentally shaken, crying a lot and can't use magic at the start * Hermione hasn't found a way to restore her parents memory * Hermione is spending some time working on improving other species (especially werewolves and elves) condition on a secret group

Thank you all if you take a little time to help get back on my reading!
