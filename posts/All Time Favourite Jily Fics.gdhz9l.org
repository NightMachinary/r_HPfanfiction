Hello, all. In these trying times of quarantine I've resorted to re-reading my all time favourite Jily fic, and I suspect many others have done that too. The thing is, I havent read a ton of fanfiction in my life, just the ocasional one here and there. So in this time of need I reach out to you! What's your all time favourite Jily fanfiction? Tell me! Share just why that is! Make me suffer with Harry's parents!!! And crew!!

Oh, and my favourite one is The Life and Times, if you're wondering.

Granted I haven't read a lot of them, so that might change with your recommendations.

Thank you all and stay safe this quarantine. xx

ps.: I also would love other marauders era recommendations, except snily.


** My all time favorite Jily is Sunshine In My Eyes, by monroeslittle. It's fairly AU, but in the best ways. I hope you enjoy! Linkffn(sunshine in my eyes)

** I know this is thread is a tad old now, but Voyeur by scriibble is one the best Jily fics I've ever read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13607592/1/Voyeur]] It is rated M, though. But it's brill.
