It's been a very, very long time since I read this fic, and honestly, it might never have been finished.

The basic premise was that after Sirius's death Remus takes in Harry and they both go to live in Grimmauld Place and end up throwing a birthday party for Harry.

Random details I remember:

They remodel the everliving daylights out of Grimmauld. Like, legit put in a Quidditch pitch somewhere in there. I remember them going to some sort of art store and Harry buying some sort of charmed charcoal and discovering he's a really good artist.

Everyone -- and I do mean everyone -- shows up for the birthday party. Fred and George put up a bunch of banners, including one that says something like " So not the Heir of Slytherin! " and whatnot. Viktor Krum shows up. They all play quidditch together. Krum brings Harry the jersey he wore during the World Cup for him to hang on his wall near the Pitch.

Anyone have any ideas?


** It sounds wonderful, I hope someone knows!
