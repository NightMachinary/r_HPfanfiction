Okay, it's set in/around book 6.

All I can remember for sure is that when Dumbledore comes to collect Harry and bumps glasses of mead against the Dursley's heads, Harry calls him out for muggle baiting.

Also, when they go to visit Slughorn, Dumbledore gets annoyed because Harry didn't say anything to him to convince him to come to Hogwarts. Harry responds that if Dumbledore wanted him (harry) to do something he should have told him about it before hand.

I'm pretty sure these where both from the same fic, but there's definitely a possibility that they come from seperate fics. I'm also not sure if it's actually an Indy!Harry story, but it's pretty easy to assume based on what I remember.

So, should be a fairly simple request, no?
