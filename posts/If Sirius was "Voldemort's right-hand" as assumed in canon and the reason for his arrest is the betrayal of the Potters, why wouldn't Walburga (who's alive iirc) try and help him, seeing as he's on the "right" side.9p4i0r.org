** Bad blood? Walburga could have hated him so much at that point that it didn't matter whose side he's on.

Or Walburga could've been almost entirely insane at that point.

Anyway we're not even sure if she actually didn't. It's possible she could've tried but seeing as after the "fall" of Voldie the people are thirsty for Death Eater blood I'm not sure if she would've been able to do anything. Blacks are known as a dark family and if they did anything to help Sirius it would've been seen as further proof of his guilt.

** I'm not sure about Walburga, but I think I should point out that the reason for Sirius's arrest wasn't the betrayal of the Potters. It was the murder of Peter Pettigrew and the twelve muggles.

True, several Death Eaters were arrested for treason and espionage-related crimes, including Augustus Rookwood, but Sirius Black was sent to Azkaban for murder.

Such a crime would likely be harder to defend and rally a defense for--and even if a defense could be mounted, Walburga may well see Sirius as a martyr for the cause of blood purity. And what good is a martyr who is freed from his suffering?

  On Halloween night, 1981, Walburga Black learns just what her oldest son stands accused of. In a moment of blind action, she springs him from jail, his believed loyalty to the Dark Lord the perfect excuse to reinstate him...by force if she has to. And perhaps being stuck with Harry Potter as well isn't so bad as it sounds...

** There's a common fanon view that Sirius' imprisonment was in some sense legally irregular. There is no support for this. Bellatrix, Crouch Jr, Rodolfus and Rabastan didn't get to attend any kind of hearing either, as we saw in GOF -- the Council of Magical Law heard evidence in their absence, and then they were brought in only to see the vote of the jury and receive their sentence. We know this is standard because the same occurs with Bagman: when he comes into the court room it's explicitly stated that this is the first time he is brought before the court, and all the evidence has already been heard. He's just there to a) speak very briefly in his defence and b) witness the vote of the jury.

This is not so different to what occurred with Sirius. We know that evidence was heard, because Dumbledore says he gave evidence against Sirius. Following evidence given in Sirius' absence, he was then sentenced to Azkaban. The only difference with Sirus is that, unlike the others, he didn't get to attend the vote against him. We must also remember that Sirius had confessed to the crime, and was continuing to confess at this point. So perhaps it was considered unnecessary for him to make representations when he had already told everyone that he did it.

Of course, we know from OotP that the defendant /does/ get to make representations and bring evidence in a Wizengamot trial. I assume that the Council of Magical Law was an expedited process for Death Eaters, created during the war along with Crouch Sr's other authoritarian measures like authorising Aurors to use the Unforgiveables.

Canonically, Snape mentions that just three drops (the dose for average people), would be enough for “even the Dark Lord to spill his secrets.” Presumably if anyone would have the method for avoiding it, be it antidotes or occlumency, it would be Voldemort, but Snape seems fairly confident that it wouldn't matter.

But the very first thing they teach you in law school is to never, *ever* let your client do this. You don't allow it for the same reason you don't let your client speak with the police without legal representation present, and generally will only ever give a "no comment" interview. The Defendant's words can always be twisted against them, especially when under heavy cross-examination by a skilled advocate.

****** Per Mr Justice Leggatt:

#+begin_quote
  In the modern law of evidence relevance is the paramount consideration. The primary rule is that evidence is admissible only if it is relevant -- that is, if it tends to prove or disprove, in the sense of making more or less probable, any fact in issue in the proceeding: see Phipson on Evidence (17th Edn) at paras 7.08--7.09; DPP v Kilbourne [1973] AC 729, 756. Conversely, evidence that is relevant (or of more than minimal relevance) is generally admissible. In former days when facts in civil as well as criminal cases were found by juries and there was fear that more weight would be given to certain kinds of evidence than they deserved, rules were developed to exclude reliance on evidence notwithstanding its relevance. The rule against hearsay is the classic example. The tendency of the law has been and continues to be towards the abolition of such rules. The modern approach is that judges (and, increasingly, juries) can be trusted to evaluate evidence in a rational manner, and that the ability of tribunals to find the true facts will be hindered and not helped if they are prevented from taking relevant evidence into account by exclusionary rules.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/AIG/Database2Docs/Rogers%20v%20Hoyle%202013.pdf]]

Sounds pretty good to me.

In general, arbitrary technicalities which restrict evidence tend to hinder justice. Such rules are largely responsible for situations where a defendant's likelihood of conviction is directly proportional to their ability to pay expensive lawyers, rather than a function of the objective evidence against them.

As a rule, if something has probative value, it should be admitted. Judges and juries are perfectly capable of weighing up evidence -- that is their entire purpose. It's entirely within their capabilities to give indirect or hearsay evidence less weight than direct evidence.

** A different perspective: Walburga's allegiance in the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort war was never explicitly stated. We knew she was pro-dark magic and pro-blood purity. We don't know if she would follow Voldemort. Sure, Voldemort was going around killing muggles and muggleborns and Walburga probably would have supported that, but we were never told explicitly. After reading Wind Shear, I started thinking some "Dark" characters might not follow the Dark Lord. If she wasn't on the Dark Lord's side, for some unknown reason, then Sirius never really joined the "right" side to her.
