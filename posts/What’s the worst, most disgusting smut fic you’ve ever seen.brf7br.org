*** god i'm pretty sure i know exactly which one you're talking about. in freshman year, my class went on a camping trip and in our tent, my friend and i wanted to show our other 2 friends that horrible fan fic so i read it out loud. later the supervisor came to our tent for being loud and “using disgusting language loud enough for everyone to hear”.

** I read a Snape X Teletubbies fic where Snape fucks the Teletubbies. I think it was called "Snape: Professor and Lover" but it's been a while since I've read it.

** There is one that Harry is with Gabrielle, even though she's physically eight. She goes around naked, he ends up enslaving Fleur, Hermione and Ginny. It's... incredibly disturbing.

** I read one, actually read it a couple times because once you get past the first few very dark and cruel chapters, the story is interesting, where the trio is captured by death eaters who take turns raping harry and torturing him and he takes it all so Ron and Hermione are spared. Those first few chapters are hard to get through though. Bella, rodolophus, dolohov and Snape are the de's I remember having a go (or many) at him. Linkao3(what it comes down to)

*** Def not a smutfic though, it has a really good plot and gives a good indepth view of PTSD. But yeah, it was pretty graphical and fairly gory. Not the worst I've seen, but really dark.

For me, the worst smutfic is one where Harry is a Dark Lord and he breeds Veela to use as an ingredient for an immortality ritual. He impregnates his 6-yo veela daugthers and granddaughters to use their hearts, or something like that.
