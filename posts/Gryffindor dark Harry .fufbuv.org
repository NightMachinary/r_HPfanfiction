Hey guys, in most Dark Harry fics, we see an almolst 100% slytherin character, very cunning, very astute, cold and most of the time manipulative.

What im' searchin for is a Dark Harry fic where he is/or do things considered evil, but as a Gryffindor.\\
Y'now what im talking about, i want in the fic for people to be aware of Harry not because he is a sly son of a bitch, but because he is someone so reckless and impulsive that mades him impredictable and unstable.

Example: In a surge of rage he attacks someone in the front of everyone, not caring about the consequences. (He does't make plans).\\
This would be include, him being extremely hateful and blinded by rage, acting just by impulse.\\
I want to see a version of Harry so impulsive that would't think twice before killing or at least harming characters like Draco, Snape or Umbridge in front of the entire great hall.

No FemHarry\\
No Slash\\
Send me something at least a little long or completed.


** I dont know any from the top of my head, but your post did make me think how would a Dark Lord operate based on their house. Let me know what everyone thinks.

Slytherin Dark Lord - blend between Sith, Nietzche and a heavy dose of Machiavellism. Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle would be best examples. Voldemort, not so much imo. They seek power and they revel in it.

Hufflepuff Dark Lord - probably the misunderstood revolutionary or tragic anti-hero fighting for their family. Their soul is tortured by the decision they have to make, but they fully believe themselves the good guy. They might even be.

Ravenclaw Dark Lord - absolutely terrifying. Probably will rely more on arcane magics and various tricks to outwit their enemies. Most likely very few even know this person even /is/ the Dark Lord. Might as well give up, there is little chance of defeating this warlord.

Gryffindor Dark Lord - absolutely unfiltered rage. Will probably hop on a broom and rain down Fiyendifire from the sky. They're the Dark Lord, and they wand the world to know this. Grandeur and martial prowess plays a large role in their campaign. The only thing that matters is the next battle. Ironically, I'd say Voldie fits this quite well.

*** I totally agre with you !\\
Voldie in the end, i don't know if it was because of the Horcruxes or other things, but he became very impulsive, nothing like Tom Riddle was in his early years.

I think that a Ravenclaw Dark Lord would be something like a mad scientist kidnapping people for experiments, and creating dark creatures out of nothing, releasing magical plagues upon the world just for curiosity.

I would love to see some fics with these types of Dark Lords, and maybe with Harry being one of them, im really tired of him just being a cunning and manipulative in those dark harry fics, most of them are just the same. :/
