Both Harry and Fleur come back in time. They are in love with each other. It's not finished at least i dont think. Neither harry or fleur know that other is back. First half of the fic is from harry pov and then it retells it again from fleur pov. I searched for it for a while now but cannot find it... I have this itch that I cannot scratch now. Please help


** Is it this one maybe? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15951056]]
