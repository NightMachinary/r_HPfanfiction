** Enchanted doll fights - like the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5LC0rG6Zco][fighting robots]] in Big Hero 6, except with magic. There could be an underground league at Hogwarts, with betting and everything, and the professors would /officially/ be against it, but there would be rumors about Flitwick and even Dumbledore occasionally getting in on the action.

I wanted to add this to my story but never got around to doing it.

*** I put a quick bit like this in a recent chapter, but it barely scratched the surface of what could done for fun with animations; wacky creature races, paper plane acrobatics, (literal) puppet shows. There could also be transfiguration-based sculpting, or maybe marksmanship competitions based solely on Banishing charms.

**** That's got me thinking of those bubble shows from Star Wars. Like a wizarding version of Circe Du Soleil, but with actual enchanted happenings.

** Charms like Lily's fish for Prof. Slughorn. "Simple" magic, created for aesthetic reasons or bragging rights.

Cooking kinda comes up but they really never plumb the depths of possibilities for what and how cooking might happen magically. Maybe it would be really easy for something to either look good, or taste good, but be very difficult to do both.

Same for Herbology, it gets more love but I'm sure theres a lot that could be done. How do you cross breed magical plants? How do you make them more potent? Do they grow in magical areas or do areas become magical because of the plants?

I could imagine a world with some kind of face-off of magical skill. Not necessarily violent or antagonistic, but displays of one-up-manship like pyrotechnic displays but with magic.

A practical world would have kids games that build their magic, like blindfolded magic-sensing hide and seek. Or tag using magic paint balls to work on aiming.

I could imagine a story around amateur-built broom racing.

** In one of my fics, both Harry and Ron have a slight obsession with a adventure graphic novel series -- the pictures move, so all the fight scenes contain /epic/ animation

*** Woww, that's creative. Did you have to create a plot for the graphic novels too?

**** Kind of? The graphic novels revolve around a character named Auror Bartleby who fights Dark wizards to recover ancient artifacts -- ie /Auror Bartleby and the Ancient Tower/, /Auror Bartleby and the Tome of Merlin/. I occasionally include excerpts from the graphic novels, but not super often.

** There's also exploding snap. I actually looked up gobstones on the wiki the other day and it doesn't really explain what it is. For some reason, I imagine it being like a game of marbles.

Some other hobbies could include:

- music

- creating a wireless show

- writing (for the Quibbler or maybe Hogwarts has a school paper)

- theater (we know Hogwarts put on a play of the Fountain of Fair Fortune)

- raising magical pets

- drawing/painting/other visual media (which you can then enchant, like Dean's banner)

- knitting

*** all of them were high as hell. Remus Lupin was 100% stoned the entire time during PoA (Like really? Who the fuck just carries chocolate around like that, I used to do that shit in high school and I'd go through a bar a day because I was blasted to the high heavens), and no one can tell me otherwise. Both Sprout and Flitwick were also rolling up and hitting the blunt with Professor Moony, and even ol' uncle dumble came 'round for it once in a while (that dude was like the all dudes of Munchies).
