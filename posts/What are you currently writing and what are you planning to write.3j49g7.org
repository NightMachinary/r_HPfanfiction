** Right now I'm working on a series of one shots that will each be focused on one of the chapters in the books. The idea is to write about a background character in that particular chapter - maybe what they think and feel at that moment, how they got there, just something to bring them to the forefront. I'm finishing the first one, and planning the next ones. I hope that by the end of this week there'll be someone who can Britpick for me.

Once I'm ready to post, I'll put it on FF and probably AO3. I'll be sure to post a promotional topic here for the first two or three chapters, so just keep an eye out!

** Currently working on this:

linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises)

I'm planning on writing a extended-universe fic with Harry growing up in the Babylonian Empire as a priest to the "Old Religions".

I'm also planning on a OC fic with a brother returning to Harry and taking him under his wing. Said brother grew up in Middle-Earth (which is but a Fidelius charmed part of Earth,) due to Dumbledores machinations. Even though it sounds like Dumbles-bash it really isn't. Its also an AU-real world because I argue that earth is really heavier than it was calculated to be due to all the Fidelius charmed nations hiding from Muggles. Hence Atlantis, Babylon, Asgard,... are real places with Tolkiens stories just being the most recent tales of Hidden Regions.

I'm also currently preparing to start writing a fic where muggles found out about magic in the 19th century and grew on that knowledge, using magic to conquer the galaxy.

The last two are not really ongoing projects but more of "stupid-days-dumps" as one is a fic in which Rowling is a Harry-fangirl in Hogwarts who wrote an outrageous biography about him and the other is a crossover-oneshots-compilation.

I've been working on it for two years now and update the chapter weekly.(Yes, it's huge haha it's at 472,381 words) It's a Neville/OC fic and I love writing it. I one day hope to write my own original stories, I started writing this fan fic to improve my writing and I think that it's helped me a lot. Anyways, here it is if anyone feels like checking it out.

  No longer would Fred and George be identical, and it was though their very identity had been stolen from them. George's missing ear branded him as an individual...
#+end_quote

Sits a bit funny with me. Since it's through Ginny's perspective, then perhaps it makes more sense, since she's not one of the twin's herself. I know Fred and George play up their "twin-ness" a bit more than most real life twins, but I still don't think they neglect their individualness, if that makes sense. To them, I'm sure the feel like very different people, it's just everyone else that forgets it.

Not that you should change it or anything, just, as a twin, thought I could give some perspective! Enjoying the fic, can't wait to read more!

** I'm not writing anything /currently/, but I'm in the midst of planning for a new story.

The general idea of it is that Xenophilius Lovegood has been traveling the world searching for the "origin" of magic, and he thinks he's found it sometime during Harry's fifth year, somewhere in China. So naturally he plans a vacation there with Luna and a friend of his, and he invites Harry along. Without giving anything away, they find it, and it's a little more than just some old magical relic.

You can look at some of the stories by enembee, such as linkffn(5201703) and linkffn(7287278) as sources of inspiration. I really, /really/ hope I can manage to write it, because I feel very strongly about this concept of characters exploring an ancient world, I'm so tired of all the characters doing the same things all the time with minimal variation, and I really respect more unique stories like the ones by enembee. I only hope that I can do a good job of that.

** Honestly the last time I wrote anything was years ago, because unfortunately writing out the ideas of a story is a lot harder than thinking it in your head.

However, if I cured myself of laziness and actually started writing, it would probably be a Quidditch story because I enjoy those immensely, always have. They aren't overly popular, but that's why I'm entertaining the idea; there aren't enough so I'm making my own. The only decent one is BarneyXII's A Game of Style and Brutality. Hope by jeconais and another Harry/Gabrielle were not as good. Hope's writing and romance were full cringe and the bad cliches... don't let me get started on the bashing.

** Some of you might recognise me from the heaping dumpster-fire of a fic I've been writing, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]], which has been compared to "a Tarantino movie with Harry Potter characters"; "The Boondock Saints with two British brothers"; Archer; James Bond; and from one confused bloke (and possibly my favorite review of all these), "It's like if the guy who wrote The Notebook tried to write Band of Brothers". High praise, indeed.

I'm currently working on chapter 18 of Midnight Blues, chapter 2 of another fic I'm working on that plays with the idea of the trio going to different houses and never becoming friends, and a post-apocalyptic longshot in the vein of The Road Warrior, where Harry escorts Rose across the desolate wasteland of what was once central Europe fifteen years after the war with Voldemort destroys the world.

Something I'd really like to work on is a fantasy; a true-to-life swords and bows and staves sort of fantasy. Possibly one that explores what the world might be like if magic and magically-inclined were accepted by post-Roman Dark Ages societies directly after the fall of the empire. It seems a bit unrealistic when I just lay it out like that, but there's a lot of time to tinker with it.

He meets Sirius before his third year. Later on during third year Aurors catch him, Sirius and another friend and they escape and flee. Then there's also another faction (sort of an OotP but slightly different and morally a bit ambiguous) that is interested in Harry. Now, instead of just Harry vs Voldemort, it's a bit more complicated.

I've got great plans for it (multi-year, severely different from canon, I've got a couple of nicely fledged out OC's and Voldemort is a bit different from canon).

I've written twelve so far, over the last couple of years. I have five left to go, but I'm into the characters I haven't really figured out yet, so it's been slow going.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in 'subject to entanglement').

  #+begin_example
      If you've never heard of Holly Evans, here's the short version: In another world, Lily's protection went further, merging Lily with her son Harry to make Holly, except that she forgot everything Lily knew and had to grow up in Harry's place\. This was her first step on the road to becoming a Dark Lady in her own right\. The second step was shattering the Philosopher's Stone\. The third probably was falling in love with a quite heterosexual Hermione Granger\. Somewhere around step 37, Holly Marked Nymphadora Tonks as her vassal, using a Spiral Mark derived from Riddle's Dark Mark\. Between Tonks' shapeshifting and Holly's need for frequent orgasms to keep Riddle's splinter of soul in her head at bay, Holly became quite adventurous, sexually speaking\.

It's the beginning of a very long epic (is that the right word?) about Lily Evans and her life throughout Hogwarts. It's a lot of fun, but it will take a miracle to finish this.

** I've got a story in it's beginning stages at the moment.

The gist of it is that the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange is in their home when they are arrested and Kreacher collects her due to his undying loyalty to Bellatrix. So Vega (Lestrange Jr.) grows up in isolation at Grimmauld with a soft spot for elves. I intend to have this run through the whole seven years, and towards the beginning, she'll come into possession of Riddle's Diary (instead of Ginny) and they be quite the team. She'll seek immortality but Tom warns her not to use Horcruxes so she has to use other methods and I'm trying to have lots of items from mythology and folklore pop up (like the Necklace of Harmonia, which is in the possession of the basilisk).

Great fun.

But while I'm writing this, my mind is filling up with plot-bunnies. Here's one, feel free to build upon it:

It's a crossover between Harry Potter and Maximum Ride. The flock don't actually play a large part it it though. (SPOILERS ahead, in case you haven't read Maximum Ride) In the second MR book, the flock break a bunch of mutants out of their cages, right? well remember that one mutant in there who was part bird? She's my protagonist.

This is to be a Wrong-Child-Who-Lived, but without the Potters being neglectful and all that. Instead, the real Child Who Lived (who is a girl) is taken from Godric's Hollow by whitecoats (see where I'm going with this?). One cannot make her the Girl-Who-Lived if she is presumed dead. Her given name (the one her parents named her) is currently undecided but her self-given name shall be Grazer (shortened to Grace).

Lots of things to work out though.

** Late to the discussion, but I've recently began working on a one-shot detailing a kind of grudging-respect/friendship between Snape and McGonagall through Quidditch. It's basically just taking up the few times in the series that McGonagall mentions Snape flaunting Slytherin's victories ("I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks") and extrapolating from there.

I haven't really started writing this one, but I had an idea for a story following Muggleborns in a universe where both the Harry Potter series and the Wizarding World exist, but the story and characters of Harry Potter were fabricated by JKR for profit. It would detail these characters, who had grown up with and loved Harry Potter, deal with the elation that magic existed and the despair that their beloved characters did not--or, at least, not in the way the JKR portrayed them. Still working out this one a bit.

It's a mystery/ political thriller that takes places in the 1940s, during the chaos of the Grindelwald War. The main players are Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Tom, and Harry. Basically, it's a story where Harry's intervention alters the past in such a drastic way that it actually prolongs the war. Unlikely friendships and rivalries form between the four wizards and the future becomes an blank slate, open for the taking.
