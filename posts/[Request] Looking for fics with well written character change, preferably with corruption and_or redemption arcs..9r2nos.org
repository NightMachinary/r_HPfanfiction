Just want good fics that really delve into a character's state of mind and show change or growth over time. As stated in the title, redemption/corruption arcs would be amazing. Think like Harvey Dent in Batman: a hero that gets turned into a villain; or vice versa, a villain that grows to become a hero. Ideally, this should be either the focus of the fic or a major part -- not a minor plot point.

Pref not slash, although if you think the fic is written fantastically, then go ahead and recommend.

Thank you!


** linkffn(Exile) gives great insight into Dracos mind and shows how he discovers and even starts to appreciate the muggle world

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** Thank you for the recommendation! I've actually read Exile, and it's one of my favorites...it was also one of the fics I had in mind as an example to my query! Great story, introspective, and showed real character development!

**** I love how this fic really manages to portray how utterly lost Draco is with muggles. At the beginning he has no idea how thinks work while in reality a young child could use most of them at least

***** Exactly! The brilliance is how Draco is thrust into the muggle world not only still struggling with his biases, but how also completely and utterly lost he is. You said it well: he is like a child...or a foreigner that has no idea how anything works, and the fear, apprehension, self-doubt, and anxiety that comes from that is written so well. It was a joy to read how he slowly, oh-so-slowly, confronted his biases and adapted to his reality.

*** I've heard it recommended several times on this sub, have never read it though. Without a lot of spoilers, could you say if corruption/redemption arcs an inherent theme?

Regardless, thank you for the recommendation!

**** Not exactly corruption/redemption, more along the lines of struggling with internal conflict and the idea of "ends justify the means" and then later dealing with the affect such philosophies have on others. It is quite good, just not as clear cut as corruption/redemption. Although I'd say the slight ambiguousness enhances it somewhat.
