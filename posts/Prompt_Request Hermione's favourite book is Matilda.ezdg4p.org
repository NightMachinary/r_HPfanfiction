There are many fics in which Harry is a fan of Star Wars and tries to master the force. I think Hermione could do the same after reading Matilda. Bonus points if she becomes a prankster and pranks all of the terrible dada teachers.


** YES PLEASE. It's so popular to have pre-Hogwarts Harry, ignorant of magic, working to develop and master his powers, but having Hermione do it would be a nice twist on that trope. Also, Matilda seems like a spot-on /perfect/ inspiration for a gifted (mentally and magically) young British schoolgirl.

*** Plus, the book came out in 1988. Dahl was a well known author, everybody who knew Hermione would have known she liked to read, so somebody getting Dahl's newest book as a birthday or Christmas present for 9- year old Hermione would make a lot of sense.

** Search through my archive finds Hermione reading Matilda in linkao3(5124284), linkffn(9469064) (but it just mentioned, nothing important), linkao3(495672), and in Arithmancer (linkffn(10070079)).

  Minerva McGonagall takes her pastoral duties very seriously. She visits each and every Muggleborn student and their family personally, to inform them of their place at Hogwarts. But some young Muggleborns capture her interest more than others.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** I like this premise, though there is no particular reason Hermione couldn't be inspired by Star Wars. For example, that's pretty much what happens in linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/]]) .

*** Ofc she can be inspired by Star Wars. I was just giving the common "Harry is a Star Wars and uses the force" as an example. However, I just thinks it makes more sense for her to be inspired by; a) a book (because she's a bookworm) and b) a female character.

A little girl that gets bullied in school and loves books would just /love/ a story about a little girl in a terrible school that loves books. Just like a little orphan boy would love a story about an orphan boy that goes on adventures. I think that we're more inclined to be attracted to stories in which we can actually see ourselves and to which we can relate.

  Whitetigerwolfs Dark Lady challenge. Hermione watches Star Wars at age six and tries to connect with the force. Now watch how a game of pretend turns into a journey to the dark side filled with -friendship and love? Yes, Harry's responsible somehow...
