I think the titles got something to do with Felix Felicis, the plot is Severus can be released but only to a family member but he doesn't have any. So Hermione says shes his fiance, so she takes him home. Long story short she takes Felix Felicis so she has the nerve to consummate the marriage.

More Information: The Felix Felicis fixes some sort of damage in her so that she can have kids again, There's a bit where he says she looks like a water nymph. I remember the whole story but I cant find it anywhere.
