** This scene is so infuriating, Harry could have proven Umbridge wrong as long as he said anything else than Voldemort, he is still took the bait. A classic moment of character holding the idiot ball for plot reasons.

Seriously, other than Sirius, he could have said :

- I don't know but isn't being ready in case something happen the whole point of the Defense class professor.
- The whole Wizengamot acquited me for using the Patronus charm this summer, so either a dementor or a lethifold I guess.
- If half what the Prophet say is true, Dumbledore and I are one step away from snapping and cursing everyone in the Great Hall, shouldn't they be ready?
- Considering the 4 previous Defense teacher tried to attack me at one point, probably you.

â€‹

And that's just from the top of my head. 5th year could have been the best year for a sassy Harry, but he preferred to scream Voldemort.

*** I agree! Just saying criminals exist in general. She could not have argued with that. The Wizarding world has a prison, therefore they must have criminals and they will probably attack you at some point so you need to be able to defend yourself until the aurors arrive. Or just saying that most people need lots of practice to master a spell in order to pass the exam. Or that not everyone can learn from a book.

*** Harry yelling at Umbridge isn't a good decision, but he's not "holding the idiot ball." Harry is fifteen, under significant amounts of stress, and confronted with a teacher - someone who's supposed to educate and help - lying about a recent important and traumatic event. Snapping and taking the bait is a pretty realistic response.

** She'd probably just say something like "are you implying that you expect Sirius Black to start attacking you on Hogwarts grounds, Mister Potter?" And then give him detention anyway.

Umbridge isn't the sort of person who would be swayed by logical arguments. She's a nasty bully, and bullies in authority positions aren't going to concede that you have a point.... they're just going to come down hard on what they perceive as an attack on their authority and punish you anyway.

****** If it's the same fix as the one I'm thinking of, it has the same problem: Umbridge decided to play Harry's game and engage in the conversation instead of just immediately giving him detention for his insubordination.

With people like Umbridge, it doesn't matter how good your comeback is. They're not going to listen to you and begrudgingly admit you have a point. Even if what you say is true and logical and impossible to argue against, they won't care. All they care about is that you are speaking to them with disrespect and challenging their authority, and that's what they will punish you for.

** Honestly, if Harry had this kind of political acumen, he would have derailed the canon plot long time ago.

But let's assume things still ended roughly like in Books at this time, what happened next should be very AU territory. For example:

- This Harry would not take Umbridge's baiting at all and end up in her detention.
- If Umbridge managed to get him one time, he would not take the blood quill shit and do nothing about it.
- He would actively organize students, not wait for Hermione, if Umbridge's teaching caused students to worry about their defense OWL.
- He could know about Occlumency by this point, and should be far more motivated to learn it.
- If Harry had learnt some Occlumency, Arthur might have died in the Ministry, prompting a total radicalization of the Weasleys. Ron and Ginny would get some major character developments.
- He would not forget about Sirius's Mirror if that event ever happened again. But there was a good chance Sirius proposing a reverse trap for the Death Eaters. In that case, Sirius might still die though.

I don't think there's any indication in the books (or the movies) that her use of the quill is somehow unlawful... we know it was Dumbledore who banned corporal punishment at Hogwarts, which implies that the Ministry was fine with it.

**** Who says he would go through the official channel?

Stun Umbridge and plant a false memory charm ought to be enough. This is a significant AU Harry after all. If he can't do that spell, I'm sure this politically astute Harry has a few professors who really like him. And don't tell me Umbridge had his wand, anyone who had survived multiple assassination attempts like Harry should be paranoid enough to keep multiple weapons (wands) ready at all times.

*** I really don't see why he would know about occlumency, let alone be capable of it. That sort of magic seems pretty obscure and even if he knows of it, he's not going to have chance to learn until Dumbledore makes Snape teach him (and given his lack of teaching ability, even then it's not a given).

** I've thought of this kind of thing before, but it's not just "Sirius Black is a threat" but rather that Sirius Black is assuming the role of Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort is a title/position kind of thing, not just the original person. This is of course not true, but Harry/Order of the Pheonix play this up to get the ministry to act and investigate more, rather than bury their heads in the sand.
