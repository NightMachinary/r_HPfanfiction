...and squandering his talent (in order to goof around with Ron playing chess - seriously: Learning magic isn't a damn chore (ok: Potions might be, but charms? Transfiguration? Defense? - Sorry, it isn't (and I am quite lazy myself)) or getting encouraged (you can see it this way, too none of Harry's teachers did really encourage learning all that much (unless you were a teacher's pet like Hermione, who didn't need encouraging!) - especially in the subject Harry was best at: Defense! Where the education was spottiest: Quirrel, Lockhard and Umbridge were useless and Moody was half way decent, Remus was ok and Snape was pretty good...not a great track-record!)

Bonus points if it's another version of himself (from an alternate universe) or somebody he cares to listen to!

Note: Why this request? Because Harry (IMHO) has talent (his practical magic is second only to Hermione in most classes and better than her's in defense) and so did his parents (marauder's map, animagus transformation, pranking, talent for transfiguration (James) and potions/charms (Lily)) and I hate that he doesn't ever try to live up to them (he glorifies them, at least until Snape shows him that his dad was a mean bully, but is still lazy, despite having so much to live up to)

Extra Bonus: Other schools, mentors (for example Flitwick or McGonagall...or an OC if it's another school), politics and maybe an OC-girlfriend?

Note: No (major!) character slash (like say Harry/Draco)

ps: Stories like "Harry Potter and the Boy who lived" by The Santi (who sadly hasn't finished the story!)

*** A lot of people say this and I'm not how sure it is. It had been my dream to learn Japanese since I was five years old, and I actually started learning on my own before I finally began to take classes. And I was surprised because in the end, work is work, no matter how much you love the work you're doing. And it's been the same with other things I've perused. No matter how much I love piano, studying theory and practicing a song over and over and over again is hard work. So I think if I was told I was a witch, I'd be fascinated and would probably read up as much as I could...but then school work would pile up and the complicated mechanics of the world would just become my norm, so I would fall out of that drive. I'd still want to learn and would still be very interested and hard working, but I wouldn't be a Hermione. I'd definitely slack off at some points. That's how kids are.

**** Yeah, a lot of people say that they would be so excited to learn magic that they would work non-stop, but I think people underestimate how quickly people become used to quite extraordinary circumstances or privileges. You could say exactly the same about the huge potential new technology offers us to develop ourselves and learn, yet the majority of people will use the extraordinarily powerful smartphone in their hand to watch porn or send ugly snapchats to their friends. Like incredible technology, magic becomes everyday, almost mundane to the students of Hogwarts.

***** You really think you'd give up easily if learning what you are learning changes everything (chores, like cleaning? - "Scourgify!" - and that's just one example, all this magic makes life a lot more enjoyable and gives you lots more free-time!)?

I don't think so, even dummies would probably try their best!

Technology (or programming etc.) isn't a comparison, because for magic you don't need to know tons of basics (you don't need to know physics for a levitation-charm for example or how the human body functions for a stunner!), no you need to believe in yourself, visualize what you want to happen and intend to do something (I think wand motions and spoken words are just there to make it even easier!) and if you've concentrated enough it will happen! (you might not have total control at first, but that comes with practise IMHO)

****** No of course you wouldn't give it up, but it's a pretty well known reaction that people get used to new circumstances, good or bad, and adjust so they feel mundane and ordinary. Even lottery winners, once they've got over the initial thrill of winning, end up feeling just as happy/miserable as they did before. If you weren't a student that loved learning before you found out you were a wizard, you won't suddenly change your whole personality once you find out you are. Homework will still be homework, and anyone who's every done a dissertation can attest to the fact that nothing kills your passion for a subject more than being forced to write about it.

*** Yeah, I'd turn into Hermione 2.0 (and I am not even a girl) for the chance to force the universe (well: a small part of it) to obey my will and my will alone ;) (Transfiguration alone would get me a lot of designer furniture for example...not to mention being able to ward stuff (that would be one of my goals: Learn warding and curse-breaking) or make your own broom (or: A damned hover-board or something like that))

** I don't remember which story it is, but there is one where Moody calls him pathetic (maybe not in those exact words) and gives him a potion which removes his need to sleep. He goes somewhat insane and trains at a great cost to his health.

*** I think I read that story or a similar one...Harry had Moody use the Imperius Curse on him to remove distractions from his life and make him focus only on studying and practicing.
