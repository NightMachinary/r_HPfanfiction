*** Not really, I mean it more like the equivalent of going to college or traveling after high school. Plus, I always felt Harry needed a much wider social circle in canon than just Ron and Hermione. Making new friends isn't a bad thing you know.

Plus, I figured Harry needed to be more independent than canon. The way Rowling writes it makes him seem a little too co-dependent on his friends to achieve things. And sometimes in life, you need to do things alone to truly appreciate how far you've come. And after DH, I doubt either Ron and Hermione would've wanted to go wandering around the world. Ginny would be having her new relationship with Neville and school, etc. So this is Harry's equivalent of going on a journey to find out what he wants to do now that Voldemort is no longer hanging over him like a guillotine.

And during this journey he would see things like Wars, Famine, Corruption, etc that test his views and have him re-evaluate things. Plus, the discussions with Grindlewald's spirit could highlight how the dead can influence the living and the possible dangers of the Resurrection Stone's power.

I mean think about it from this angle, For Example, Harry sees people suffering due a war/terrorism and desires to use his powers to end the conflict and help the people. A lot of innocent people end up dying in one of these attacks and is prevented from intervening by the authorities when he could've helped them. Was it right for Wizards to withhold their help to those who needed it just to keep the status quo or was it simply easier? A moral question he begins asking himself throughout his journey.

And Harry would have a support network, I don't know how you came to that conclusion as I don't think he wouldn't make friends within his new organization or old friends couldn't join it.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

***** I respect you opinion but I doubt it's that simple, you seem to like to accept canon only characters but that's kind of useless if your trying to make an international movement if you only have british/irish/scottish base. You'd never get traction if you don't make connections outside your little corner of the world.

And there have been OCs that have been accepted before, but admittedly it is tricky to pull off. However, rejecting OCs outright just because you yourself are not comfortable moving outside of established characters doesn't mean its useless to make them. It just has to be done carefully.

Plus, those 'friends and followers' you mentioned would likely to not want to start a Wizarding Revolution right after having just fought a civil war and likely would be resistant to the idea of change when many are likely to want to simply return to the status quo from before the war rather than fight a new brand one. Plus, Voldemort was a psychotic dictator who was murdering people left and right that everyone needed gone so the choice to fight him would have been a whole lot simpler than taking part in a revolution.

****** Also, Harry in the fic Emperor is more OC than the OC characters. This prompt is about a Post-Hogwarts Harry seeing how bad the world outside his little corner of it is and asks himself a simple question.

Are Wizards right to be hiding away when they can do something to help solve many of the worlds problems Or are Wizards simply taking the easy way out? Even Hagrid in book one, says "Everyone be coming to wizards to solve all their problems" justification for why wizards hide.

Harry during his journey and experiences comes to question this belief the more he learns. And decides to do something about it. Harry would lead because he simply doesn't trust wizards not to go with what they've always done instead of whats right. And if you'd read the books, Wizards are highly resistant to change and thus need someone to lead them if they are to change. So Harry would becomes King to get things done, rather than out of a desire to be King.
