I personally have yet to read one that's any good. Usually they're just a plot device for Drarry or Dramione shippers to make their pairings happen using things like '8th year dorms' or 'head boy/head girl dorms.' Also they almost always include learning amortentia (which makes no sense since it's on the 6th year curriculum). The characters are always OOC as well. What do you think about these types of fics and have you ever read one that doesn't suck?


** I really love the idea. I read one where it started off fine with chapter one, but then it quickly jumped off of the cliff. If anyone has a recommendation though I'd love to read a good one.

** I've read several good, kinda of heavy fics that address what it's like after the war, and the healing process of a lot of characters. Those are kinda rare, but my favorite. There are a few that are silly but a fun read, but most of them suck.

** There's linkffn(the changeling) with Ginny in Slytherin, which I loved, and the author followed up with a series of sequels that take place after the war (including 8th year), still ongoing.

** I read one the other day that I liked, but for the life of me I don't remember anything about it. In general, I've found that they take very little time to consider the implications of what post-war life is like, or at least not enough to make me happy. Any fic where Ron and Harry don't talk to Hermione regularly seems ridiculous to me. Wizards can teleport and they're best friends. Avoiding canon relationships does not require acting like entire friendships don't exist.

** There are some canonical ones, and they are usually not that horrible (as usual, I am really not big fan of Draco Malfoy):

- linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian) ... light and fluffy, unfortunately WIP (and however much I like this author, it probably means it will never get finished)
- linkffn(The First Year, an Almost Happily Ever After story by JetLaBarge) ... first volume of four volume series, not bad.
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803]] (and its sequel [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207]] ) build rather nice story of both Hinny getting together and new Auror adventure.
- first part of linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) is the eight year and it is very angsty and PTSDish, but pretty good.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** I just had this idea the other day, that the 8th year makes sense story wise (there's a bunch of 7th years who need proper schooling) but putting them all back in hogwarts doesnt make much sense.

I have yet to see a single story about a wizard college, maybe a single year of school set up for all young witches and wizards who couldnt continue their schooling thanks to the war. This makes room for all sorts of extra characters from beubatons and durmstrang as well.

** Well the writing isn't very good at all, but the plot itself is quite clever and imaginative in linkffn(The Curious Case of Luna Lovegood). I managed to stomach my way through the honestly pretty awful narrative, just because I enjoyed the story it was telling, even if it sometimes hurt to read it. And even here, Harry's a teacher rather than a student.

As a whole, I find that eighth year fics are pretty terrible.
