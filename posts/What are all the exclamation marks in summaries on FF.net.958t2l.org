**** I may be wrong, but I'm fairly certain it started with bang paths in fanfiction mailing lists.

***** Yeah, it was for mailing lists. Like, if there were two Johns at your workplace and you wanted to mail one of them, you had to make sure you had the right one, so accounting!john and hr!john were used to do that.

In fanfiction, it's to identify facets of a character or to mark them as something they're usually not, such as, say manga!red (from pok√©mon) or tall!hinata (from Haikyuu)
