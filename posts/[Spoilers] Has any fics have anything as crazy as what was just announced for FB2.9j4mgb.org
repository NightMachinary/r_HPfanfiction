WTF, Nagini is a 'Maledictus'?? Its like JK Rowlings ideas are exclusively from bad fanfiction for something worse. I don't remember reading anything as crazy as Nagini being actual human.


** I find my biggest problem with Rowling is that literally every new idea she has *must* somehow be related to a boarding school in Scotland. Like every little thing has to somehow tie in to core cannon. It takes something relatively harmless (a generational curse that slowly turns people in to animals? cool) in to ridiculous retconed bs (I don't even want to start unpacking Nagini's and Voldemort's relationship because I garun-fucking-tee than Rowling didn't write it with a human perspective from Nagini in mind.)

I mean, the name Nagini comes from a being that's capable of turning into a large snake. And given that the name she gave for Lupin was basically Wolfy McWolf, I dare say she had the general idea from the very beginning.

**** I mean in hindsight the naming lines up, but I didn't see anyone predict it before hand. I mean it feels like she is messing with how I view the story of the main series. I mean it gets to the debate of fan vs. creator. I just feel like JKR is retconning and recharacterizing characters in the main series in seemingly bizarre ways. I mean Nagini being a magic-horcrux-snake and Nagini being a horcrux-cursed-person-snake is very different and changes the story years after she published the final book - without strong hints this was the case in the original series. I mean its the same thing with Voldemort having a baby with Bellatrix somehow?????

The Carlin brothers did predict this albeit with help from the first trailer. I don't see how Nagini being a maledictus is such an outrageous idea, it was established long ago that she's an unusually intelligent snake, much more so than other bonded magical creatures.

This was the one I meant and only the first official photo of the film was released by that time and it was basically just a confirmation. The majority of their hypothesis was backed by the content found in the book and the origin of the name itself. The point I'm trying to make is that the theory has been around for quite some time, you might have never heard of the concept but it isn't really THAT out there.

Well, the mechanics behind that one are quite simple. When a man and a woman are horny...

Seriously though, Bellatrix was 45/46 when Delphi was conceived, which isn't that far fetched. And men usually do not expire in that regard (although Viagra might have been involved to "tame the snake").

********** Some people have theorized that Voldemort lost a piece of his humanity for every Horcrux he made. He started making them when was 16, so he started losing his humanity and therefore his "human urges" before they were even fully developed.

I personally can't wrap my head around the idea of a Pornstar Voldemort or even true-to-canon Tom Riddle. Whenever I see him characterized like that in fanfic, it feels a little OOC. If he did have sex, it would only be to see what all the fuss is about from an academic standpoint, not because he was horny. I think he would find human urges like that unpleasant, and being dependent on other people to fulfill those urges as a sign of weakness. He's the type who would believe that needing food, drink, and sleep to live to be a weakness too.

Whether or not Voldemort is human, he certainly doesn't consider himself one. See: The Riddle House, GoF.

I agree fully. I think it's a great opportunity to enrich the world, but retroactively changing canon is a bad idea. I think it's one of the bigger reasons why the prequels were so badly received. Midichlorians aren't bad *per se*, they are just bad because they force people who imagined something else to change their head-canon completely and may alienate them.

I am still waiting for a plausible explanation of the geopolitical situation in Europe. The HRE disintegrated due to religious tensions (the 30-year war killed a third of its population, which is far worse than WWII) and those are irrelevant for the magical population. But that only creates more questions, like the rest of Europe. There isn't an Ottoman Empire because we have Bulgaria, but what about Prussia? The PLC? The Italian Merchant republics? Byzantium?

My point basically is that the snake has to be something special. There's no way any of Hagrid's non-sentient creatures would manage to do something like this, no matter how much LV danced around naked on a full moon night casting complex enchantments. So, maybe the human connection makes sense?

** I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Rowling has the idea for Nagini to be a maledictus from the very beginning, but it was never necessary or able to be fit in the plot.

Like all the backstory she had in her mind for Dumbledore and Grindlewald in their youth that was only touched upon in DH, or like how she had this elaborate side-plot in mind about Dean Thomas discovering that the dad who vanished when he was a baby was actually a wizard or something. She had the ideas for the world, but they weren't important to the plot so they got left by the wayside.

The Nagini thing is actually a fan theory I heard a while back, actually. I was just surprised it turned out to be real.

I am absolutely on board with disregarding everything from Cursed Child. Rowling didn't write it. I feel like she probably should have put her foot down on more things, and I don't pretend to know why she didn't - but Fantastic Beasts doesn't feel the same way to me.

Like the Obscurial/obscurus thing - I absolutely buy that Rowling had the idea for that when Ariana's ‘fits' were mentioned in DH.

With Nagini, I also totally buy that she was something special all along for Rowling. I mean, her being a maledictus makes the Bathilda Bagshot impersonation less bizarre and confusing. That was always a bit weird to me, but I imagine it'll be better explained now with some more backstory and context.

** In fanfic, Harry has fallen in love with Fawkes, Hedwig who is actually a cursed animagus, the Basilisk, and the personification of Hogwarts itself, not to mention becoming butt-monkey for every named Death Eater, and twice over for the ones named Malfoy.\\
What is remarkable here is that fanfiction doesn't have to pass editorial review or be marketed to an uptight public morality, whereas the films do, and they let this one go through. It's probably because the snake-woman is a villain, and enslaved to villains past and future. If it were Newt dumping his perfectly-acceptable, white, human love-interest to get funky with the girl, they'd put a stop to it.

****** Thanks for the data, that's interesting to know.

The outrage is certainly overblown, as it typically is for this kind of drama. Personally, I'm ambivalent about the matter.

I think that writing stereotypes is a poor aesthetic choice, regardless of whether it's done on purpose or unconsciously. At the same time, it's not like JKR is bound by a moral obligation to subvert stereotypes at every opportunity: it's her story and she can write her characters/plot however she likes.

The whole drama puts me in mind of a quote by Oscar Wilde:
