Hello! As I said in the title, I'm looking for fics that focus a lot on the friendship in Gryffindor. In canon, we mostly see Harry interact with The Ministry 5 and the Weasley siblings while at Hogwarts. We seldom see him speak to anyone else, which I find a little strange considering they live there at Hogwarts for seven years (except on the summer holidays). That's a large part of their childhood. He spends almost no time at all with Dean and Seamus, even though they share a dormitory. They get almost no mention except little comments until fifth year, where they are completely against Harry. The books gives us almost no character building at all for everyone that is not those mentioned before, even though Professor McGonagall told us in the first book that the house you were sorted in to would be like your home. I want fics where Gryffindor actually is like a home to Harry, fics that focus on the everyday life and friendships in Gryffindor house, and where Harry an the others I mentioned before interact with more then just eachother. I apologise in advance for my English as it is not my native language, and thank you for your time and help!


** It is unfinished, which is *really* unfortunate, but linkffn(8823783) focuses on a Gryffindor house that actually supports each other. I think it is exactly what you want.

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.

  Hermione Granger is the first person to meet Harry on the Hogwarts Express, not Ron Weasley. How does this change their dynamic? How does this change their relationship with Ron, with everyone? Just how much better could Harry Potter's life have been if a certain bushy-haired witch had wandered into his compartment just a few minutes earlier?

  After entering his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry catches a glimpse of a girl that will steal all of his attention. Wanting to have a secret of his own, he decides to keep this information to himself. At least, until everyone notices.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years
