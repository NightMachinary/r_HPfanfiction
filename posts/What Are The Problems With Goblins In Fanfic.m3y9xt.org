So, I'm working on a plot bunny involving the introduction of a Goblin Queen to the world of Harry Potter, albeit one more inspired by Jareth than the Goblins of HP (and yes, I was just talking about doing a 'Harry raised somewhere in Durmstrang territory' fic, I have too many ideas in my head). Media often portrays Goblin monarchs as being quite different from their subjects, either in the form of being much bigger and more fearsome or being all */SEXY/* and more fairy/elf/vampire like, so I'm drawing from that trope here.

At any rate, I do see a lot of posts on here poking fun at the way fic handles the Goblins, so I thought I'd pop in here and ask for general opinions on what the pitfalls and issues with them are.

I will state that I'm not /completely/ blind to what the issues are. Rest assured there will be no strangely helpful Goblins here (all helpfulness comes expressly from pragmatic reasons, namely 'the enemy of my enemy is my ally' and that if they're able to help bring down Voldemort it'll give them a better bargaining position for more rights and powers) and they're not going to be revealing secret vaults, bloodlines, or powers to Harry. But I want to know if there are other things that I might be missing overall.


** I think my major issue with how the Goblins and subsequently Gringotts is handled is that they somehow have a solution for everything. Horcrux? We can perform a removal ritual for 50 galleons. Emancipation? Sure thing. Collection of assets? Absolutely.

It's really weird the lack of limits that the Goblins seem to have, since the Ministry likely limits them a lot, especially with how many Goblin Rebellions there were and implied high tensions (as far as I remember, at least).

Regardless, I definitely think a better take on the Goblins would be nice to see! I look forward to spotting your fic somewhere!

** The goblins in Harry Potter follow a lot of antisemetic tropes. They are hook-nosed or big nosed, arrogant, and extremely greedy. These sorts of depictions are based on medieval goblins, which in turn are direct caricature of Jewish people.

As a Jewish medievalist myself, I would consider Goblin depictions better if you 1. Disregard the physical caricature features(particularly the noses) 2. Show them with more depth than just “greedy and hate everyone who isn't them”.

*** Oh, don't worry, I was planning on doing both of those things already. The first for the reasons you stated, and the second because that's just not good storytelling, particularly for a story where Goblins are at the forefront.

**** I know you're saying so in a well-intentioned way, but it's important to not just dismiss these things as “bad storytelling”. One dimensional characterization that reflects on a culture is an intentional tool to dehumanize. Technically, it's good storytelling in that it depicts exactly what the writer intends. If you want to subvert the bigoted origin of these ideas, you need to first accept and acknowledge that they are well crafted for their purpose and not just an accidental coincidence that can be chalked up to “bad storytelling”.

****** No problem. You asked so you could learn, after all. That's absolutely admirable and I'm glad you're clearly putting in an effort to do this right.

I think this fails Hanlon's razor. It's much more reasonable to conclude that writing is hard and most people are bad at it, than to conclude that an entire genre of authors are all secretly antisemitic. The origins of the trope certainly are, but most people who use the trope in their writing likely never made the connection.

****** There are several problems with what you've said. Apologies in advance for the long response.

Firstly, returning to the "bad writing" angle. This idea does not address the context of the writing. I think most people on this sub would agree that, overall, JKR is a pretty good writer. For all of her issues, I think she's a good writer. You probably think she's a good writer. The world likes JKRs writing, as evidenced by the commercial and critical success of the series. So the claim is that someone who is overall a pretty good writer, somehow hits pitfalls in a strange pattern, where it only ever comes up with one specific type of creature? And everything else is fine? I find that much harder to believe. The "bad writing" rhetoric also comes up often in discussions about diversity in media, and is both dismissive towards the party who brought up their concerns, and absolves the creator of responsibility. "It was a mistake" or "It can't be helped" is not an excuse. Writing is hard, yes, but writing a series of novels is also a long and arduous process, with extreme focus on editing and elevating the writing--it's not like a social media post, where its easy to miss something or accidentally say something you didn't mean. Each word is gone over with a fine toothed comb, and the end product has every single word polished to the best of both the writer *and* editors ability. (Which, of course, points out that the editor to HP has some responsibility to what was written as well. The reason this is often glossed over is because 1. Even if the editors name has been released, it is not as well known 2. the author holds final say over all edits in the editing process).

Secondly, nothing exists in a vacuum. If you study literature in higher education or through academic texts, this is numero uno that gets pounded into your head--*no work or author exists in a vacuum*. Context matters. JKR was involved in the literary world, both as a reader and on the industry side as an aspiring writer and a person familiar with critical writing and reading, long before she wrote HP. She was especially steeped in the world of fantasy. The issue of anti-semtism in fantasy, particularly in the depictions of goblins and witches, is not a new topic; perhaps someone who simply reads for fun may not have encountered it, but I find it difficult to believe someone who is involved in the industry and community never came across the idea, even in the 90s. Regardless, let's say she didn't encounter those ideas. She almost *definitely* would have after the first book was published, as it was immediately identified and pointed out by Jewish readers across the world. JKR, however--and indeed, most fans of Harry Potter--paid no mind. It would have been easy to tweak some details in later books, or even make one of those offhand twitter retcons JKR was so fond of for a while, but that did not happen. One thing that *did* happen was when JKR said that "There was *one* Jewish student at Hogwarts"--so, clearly, she was aware that the Jewish community was dissatisfied and trying to placate. But her goblins remained the same.

That is the choice, from the beginning of the first book to the current climate in the fandom, that I referred to as "intentional"--maybe not overt anti-semitism, but a marked effort to maintain the image of goblins she cultivated. Many people lean into these tropes unintentionally, sure. But it is also true that doing so perpetuates the harm they cause. JKR must have become aware of the anti-semetic tropes in her goblins, sometime before, during, or after she wrote HP, yet she dug in her heels and committed to preserving the anti-semitism despite growing awareness among fans and clumsy attempts to appeal to other minority populations. At least she didn't write a manifesto condemning our existence like she has to certain other groups who raised concerns about parts of her book. But make no mistake, both 1. continuing bigoted traditions and 2. refusal to acknowledge or apologize for past bigoted behaviors do, in fact, count as bigotry. It's plenty possible for people to make the goblin mistake by accident. But it's a pretty difficult mistake for someone with JKRs background to miss, and it's certainly not difficult to say that you made a mistake after the fact.

Finally, your use of Hanlon's razor. Sure, it's "easier" to believe in the best of people. But that's decidedly *not* the way literary analysis works--no vacuums--and is, again, a rhetoric that is often used as a tool of oppression. Maybe all of those football teams didn't *know* they were using slurs as team names, maybe those police departments didn't *realize* they were killing a disproportionately high amount of black men, maybe pastors were *unaware* that they were shaming LGBT populations into silence. The problem with Hanlon's razor is that it's incompatible with larger societal patterns--such as trends in literature--because there are patterns of malice that will be swept under the rug under the premise of plausible deniability. JKR is hardly the only modern fantasy writer to rely on these anti-semetic tropes, she's simply the most prolific. Most importantly, even if you COULD prove those things were unintentional, and truly a simple mistake that somehow blew up to a global scale of influence, *that doesn't make it less wrong*.

A refusal to fix a mistake after the fact is not ignorance, it is a decision, and it is one JKR has made it clear she intends to stand by.
