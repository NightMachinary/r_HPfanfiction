Does anyone know any fanfictions that have a bit of curse breaking in them? They don't have to be centred on it but any that involves it somehow. Something like The Archeologist by Racke and Cest La Vie by cywscross.

Bashing of any kind are a no go, and I'm not a big reader of romance but any suggestions you may have are welcome.

Thanks guys.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dance of Death by Wakefan)

And its sequel "casting shadow".

In the first one it doesn't seem to be a major plot point (minor spoiler: He is learning to be one ). In its sequel though, it becomes a major plot point.

** linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5) ... I have my issues with it, it is the Starfox5 after all, but the curse breaking is nice. And also, linkffn(More Than a Mug of Hot Chocolate by keeptheotherone;Hidden Chambers and Unseen Monsters by keeptheotherone).

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  What happened between Ginny and her curse-breaker brother when the Weasleys visited Bill after CoS? Because I never bought the idea that after a mug of hot chocolate, "Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again."

  The Weasleys' trip to Egypt after CoS. No one will tell Bill anything, and Ginny isn't talking at all. And if navigating the relationships with his six siblings isn't enough, Bill has one more. But he and Amy Green are just friends, right?

** One of my favorites is linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). Then there's the big ones like Cursed Summer and Bungle in the Jungle but I figure you've already read those.

Honestly, the easiest way to find cursebreaking fics is to just filter for Bill Weasley and sort by favorites, all the ones at the top are cursebreaking stories

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
