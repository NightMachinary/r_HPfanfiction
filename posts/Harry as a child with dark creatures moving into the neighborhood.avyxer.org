I read a story a while back that involved Harry as a small child emiting a dark aura that felt pleasing to a wide range of dark creatures. At first, this was discovered by a random werewolf that moved into the neighborhood and discovered that his wolf form did not treat Harry as prey. He then invited his werewolf friends to start moving onto Privet Drive as well. Over time, this snowballed until the whole neighborhood was various kinds of dark creatures protecting Harry like he was some sort of royalty.

For the life of me, I can't remember the name of it or even how I found it the first time. Such is the curse of reading too much fanfiction and having too many different places that I look for new stories.

*** I always search “harry potter fanfic “Bloody Nocturne Two” “ when I'm looking for this fic. I can never remember the real name, and that works just as well. Thankyou all the same though...

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
