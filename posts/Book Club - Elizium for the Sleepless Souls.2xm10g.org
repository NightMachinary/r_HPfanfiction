The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]

#+begin_quote
  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. COMPLETE!

I'll probably give at least a month for this one as it's over 300k words.

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]?

#+begin_quote
  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

** I thought it was quite well written. And had a plot that was fairly different from most of the stuff that I have read. Thoroughly enjoyable.

** Not much I can say about Elizium. A refreshingly original idea executed brilliantly. The writing, like in all of Voice of the Nephilim's fics, is an absolute joy to read in itself and the characters are appropriately abhorrent/interesting.

Easily one of my favourite fics. It's great to see this fic getting some recognition. Hope to see the sequel someday.

** It's not the right thread for it yet, but I just finished One Hundred and Sixty Nine, and it is a terrific fic. I really enjoyed it, so if anyone was put off by the length, don't be, it's worth it.

*** Agreed wholeheartedly.

Most fics I forget about quickly after reading them, but this is one I enjoyed far more than most.

** If the King's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers][Langoliers]] hasn't existed I would've thought that this story is just too good for a fanfiction. I cannot help but think of it as a cross-fic of Harry Potter and S. King's writing style---the feeling of desperation, the style of writing, the portrayal of characters' motives all reminded me of stories written by him. And it isn't too stretched out either --- the writer only tells what he wanted to tell and ends the story before it would start dropping in quality.

The story succeeds to deliver what it aimed to, and the only drawback about it, I think, is that it isn't very well known in the community.

*** There are so few well-written fics out there, and yet so many. The trouble is, most of them are not nearly as well-known as they should be, and some really crappily written ones are hugely popular...

** That was somewhat horrifying. More twists than I could have imagined, and as I read it, the descriptions were vivid enough that I had an image in my head the whole time.

** I've never read anything like this, at times I had no idea what was going on, but that was not a bad thing.

It was a short read but I really enjoyed it.

** I wish I hadn't read [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] comment before I read the story. While I was reading it, I couldn't help but think of King's particular style.

Regardless, I think it was a very well written fic. Engaging, great pacing, good characters. Did well with leaving the breadcrumbs to the revelation. All really good stuff.

*** Do you mean it was spoiling the story or forcing you to compare it to King's style? I can edit my comment if spoiling was the case.

**** Mostly King's style but the langoliers reference did prompt some ideas in my head as to how the fic would play out. I don't think you need to edit it though

** Elizium - what a fabulous little snippet.

I'll start in on 169. I'm always a fan of a Hermione fic.

** Due to a massive recent influx of flames and harassment both in reviews and in messages, the author has decided to pull 169 from ff.net. it will be removed at the end of the month. This was posted as an update to the story, so I've linked directly to it.
