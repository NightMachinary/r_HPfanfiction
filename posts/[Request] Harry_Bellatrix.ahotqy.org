Recently I got into the pairing and I want more of it. I have read delenda est, passageway, stepping back and only enemies. Can you recommend any more?


** There isn't really more to the pairing. There are a bunch of bad stories where the love interest(s) lack any actual character. A lot of Harry/Bellatrix/Narcissa of dubious quality.

The one story which kinda fits is "Wind Shear", but the romance is just hinted at during the epilogue. It is very Harry centric and pretty one-sided in its main conflict.

*** That's an odd assessment of Wind Shear. There's romance from the start, when Bellatrix sees Harry killing all her friends and family and is totally smitten. It's just a one-sided romance for most of the story, as her love is unrequited for a long time.

What do you mean by the “main conflict”? Harry is ridiculously overpowered against Voldie and his Death Eaters, but that's not the main conflict. It would be boring if it were. The main conflict is Bellatrix trying to win Harry's love, which is fun, because she's up against seemingly impossible odds.

**** There is no romance. Bella is obsessed with Harry, but she seems more interested in getting into his pants or finding a new master, not a romance among equals.

The main conflict is a stomp and there is not really a point at which Voldemort feels like a credible threat.

***** You're saying romance can't include obsession, sexual attraction, or hero-worship, and has to be among equals? That rules out most stories that are called romance by most people.

Harry's stomp of Voldemort isn't even a conflict, it's just a slaughter. The violence doesn't make it a conflict. The conflict in that story is Bellatrix's pursuit of Harry.

****** I don't mean that as in "everyone has to be the same", but for most of the fic, Bella might very well not exist in Harry's eyes and he does not see her as a potential partner. It is definitely not a romance. One-sided attraction maybe, but a romance needs at least two people to be more than pining.

********* People don't read Romeo and Juliet as an instruction manual for how to have a healthy relationship. It would be shit for that. They read it to enjoy the tragedy. It's a great tragedy.

I don't think anyone asking for romances about Bellatrix is looking for stories about healthy relationships.

I do. Harry/Bellatrix has more than a few stories which attempt just that. Admittedly, most fail horribly or are the usual harem powerwank, but Harry/Bellatrix stories usually try to avoid the complications by the means of time travel. Hermione/Bellatrix is where the wish for drama and tragedy is, at least if you ask the Bellamione community. They want the torture scene, the drama from her having killed Sirius.

******* I just reread the OP. It doesn't ask for romance, just this pairing. Pairings include a lot more types of stories than any narrow definition of romance.
