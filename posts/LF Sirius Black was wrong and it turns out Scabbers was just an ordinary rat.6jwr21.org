Bonus points if it doesn't diverge from canon until the scene in the Shrieking Shack


** This sounds good. This also means the map would have been wrong/ pettigrew not on it at all.

**** That would make a certain scene where Harry spots Crookshanks in Padfoot's company earlier take on a totally different meaning.

Instead of the clever and smart Crookshanks figuring it out and trying to get Sirius into Gryffindor Tower to finish off Peter, it's Peter himself (who somehow changed his animagus form) personally tricking Sirius into offing a random rat and thinking his quest was complete. Now that's chutzpah.

...The only question that leaves, what is Peter doing disguised as a cat that nobody wants to buy in a pet store?

***** Got himself caught on purpose, of course. He likes being a kept pet, otherwise he wouldn't have sat on his ass with the Weasleys for eleven years. Probably figured that if he was ugly enough he would stay in that store until either he died or something happened. Then Hermione "Root For The Undercat" Granger came in and wouldn't take no for an answer.

***** He transfigured himself into a cat, but because he was a rat animagus, he couldn't wandlessly transfigure himself back out. So he was stuck for a decade and a half, not just hangin' out.

****** Or, Voldemort purposefully transfigured Peter into a cat to keep him out of the way while he went to 'visit' the Potters; the 'Peter' that Sirius encountered was an Imperius'd doppelganger under Polyjuice who blew himself and the rest of the street up.

...I wonder if anyone's done that before? Having a Polyjuice'd impersonator of Peter frame him for framing Sirius?

***** maybe he ran afoul of a cursed bastet statue that turns people into kneazels. that would also mean he's sort of stuck as a kneazel.

** In the first one it is a very minor plot point. In the second it is very much not.
