So, we've got an interview from J.K. Rowling that says he was a Chaser, the movie shows that he was a Seeker, and then he's messing around with a Snitch in OotP. Do most people make him a Chaser, or what?


** He was a chaser. The movie got it wrong and the should feel bad.

******* That's just James stealing the Snitch to play around with, but let's say Fred caught the snitch in a game, it wouldn't count as a snitch catch

** I've mostly seen him as a Chaser. I've also seen him as both (that is, mostly played Chaser but one year was Seeker). Don't think I've ever seen just-Seeker though.
