I need a break from longer fics that I normally read. What are some one shots that you enjoy? I just read inspector 13 and could use some more. Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4271982][when in doubt, go to the library]] is incredible. It's got a really interesting writing style that I love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25404631][it ends in anarchy]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8981044][the monster beneath]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][business]] a have a darker Harry. They all lean to the humorous side as well.

** These are my favourites-

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12391806][where there is a will]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry writes the first draft of his will when he is fourteen.
#+end_quote

I really love the trio portrayal in this. It's pretty morbid, but pretty much highlights the danger in Harry's environment for the whole of canon.

2.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.
#+end_quote

My favourite Harry-Ron friendship fic.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
#+end_quote

(Be warned- this is pretty dark.) A unique twist to the peggy-sue time travel trope.

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying.
#+end_quote

Trio friendship fluff. Can be read as platonic, or Harry/Hermione/Ron.

5.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]:

#+begin_quote
  A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.
#+end_quote

Another trio-friendship oneshot.

6.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.
#+end_quote

This is a very popular oneshot. Post-war.

7.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]]:

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

My favourite Harry-becomes-a-dark-lord fic.

8.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400319][Eternal Return]]:

#+begin_quote
  "For the Greater Good. Harry understands this.
#+end_quote

A creepy time-loop fic. Read the first few sentences and you'll get the main plot.

9.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts you won't find in 'Hogwarts: A History']]:

What it says on the tin.

10.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23747881][Somebody that Nobody knows]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter is not the Boy-Who-Lived.
#+end_quote

11.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665][Slytherin Career Day]]:

#+begin_quote
  The student of Slytherin House were born with everything: wealth, prestige and pure wizarding blood. Now it's Severus Snape's job to help them find the one thing they don't have: careers.
#+end_quote

A bit crack-y.

12.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]]:

#+begin_quote
  With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.
#+end_quote

Harry/Ron/Hermione.
