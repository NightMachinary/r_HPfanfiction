I actually really like the sorta love hate relationship between Mad Eye and Tonks in Order of The Phoenix. Any fics (no slash or romance) with them bonding and/or Tonks being like an apprentice or student to Moody. I also find it weird how I've seen close to no fics on Sirius and Tonks relationship (especially since their cousins) so also requesting fics with them bonding too. Thank you in advance.

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?

This is a multi-story series and it's excellent!!! although it's harry&Sirius centric it's some seriously great writing and eventually has some great badass tones and moody bits. Some of the best writing I have ever read
