Hello! I had a question! What are the rules for disclaimers? Does one /have/ to use them? And is there a place where I can find more information about the use of disclaimers?


** No, you don't have you use them. They really don't do anything and from what I understand, won't actually protect your work should the creator of the work you're basing your story on want to do something about your fanfiction.

*** Some authors ^{hem} ^{^{hem}} ^{^{^{Less}}} ^{^{^{^{Wrong}}}} take "disclaimers" to the surreal and reduce the amount of sense they make from low all the way into the negatives.

**** At this point disclaimers are so common that 99% of people skim read or skip them entirely. As long as those lines of text at the start of a chapter contain the words "J.K.Rowling" then readers will intuitively know what it's for. The disclaimer is so ubiquitous in this fandom that it's become more about style/jokes than about the actual meaning.

*** u/Neptune20:
#+begin_quote
  Which is honestly probably true since, disclaimer or no disclaimer, you didn't really get permission from the copyright holder to use their works.
#+end_quote

The only disclaimer that could even possibly provide any kind of protection in the US is this:

#+begin_quote
  This work is created under the protections provided by 17 USC ยง 107 and is a free-user derivative work for non-commercial purposes that does not reproduce the original works referenced.
#+end_quote

But no, /surprisingly/, writing at the top that you're not responsible doesn't magically make you not responsible.

I don't put disclaimers in any of my fics because they are legally pointless and provide no real protection of any kind.

** This originates from before HP fanfiction. I believe it arose with Anne Rice and her lawyers suing fanfiction authors back in the early 2000s. Folks in other fandoms would write disclaimers in order to avoid law suits.

** Disclaimers are how you announce to the world that this is a piece of fanfiction. They have no legal standing, but rather exist solely to make the author and readers feel good. They're basically placebo lawsuit armor that everyone collectively agreed to wear as fashion.
