story of harry's life if Voldemort hadn't existed... don't know if it exists, i found ones where it gets to only the Harry-Ginny moments but I would like one of the full story

thanks@


** Mah, I was going to say that even with Voldemort out of the picture, the seed of hatred between the Pureblood, Ministry and the Muggleborns was already planted for decades or even maybe a century before Grindelwald War (meaning that movements like the Death Eater would still be happening), I was going to recommend *October* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321]]) that precisely shows this well, but you are obviously looking for wholesome fictions about Harry having a better life.

It shows that just reading a post's title can be misleading.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

** There's one focusing on all of the boys in Harry's year, and how they're all pursuing romance, but I forget the title.

**** Yeah, that was it. The Gryffindor boys were effectively five James Potters if I recall correctly.
