Hi, I've read thousands of Harry Potter fanfics (not exaggerating - I used to do it as part of my job) and there's something I've never once seen: a story where Harry kills Sirius before finding out he's innocent. It seems amazing to me that I've never seen this, since it's not a particularly innovative concept. So has anyone ever seen this? Thank you in advance.

*** Yeah, I'm thinking probably the reason I haven't found it is that it's too painful for anyone to write. Which really makes me want to write it lulz.

**** Its like, people joke about Harry being fates bitch, but in my opinion Sirius has had a WAAAY worse life.

His home life is as bad if not worse than the Dursleys, he spent twelve years in the most horrible place imaginable, was kept prisoner inside his childhood nightmare home, was on the run eatting rats for two years, then died.

Really, the only time he didn't hate his life was the 8-10 months out of the year when he was at Hogwarts, and the 3-4 years after graduation. But even THEN there was a war going on and he was fighting for his life and having his friends die during his time after Hogwarts too.

So /really/ only like, 70 months, or about six years of his life weren't total crap.

At least Harry got to live a relatively happy life after seventeen years of shit.

Poor Sirius.

***** I can't feel entirely sympathetic to Sirius. He did attempt murder while still in school. Didn't even think about the fact that his best friend would have been killed if he'd succeeded. And I guess that's the worst part about him - he doesn't think. Like, ever. Yeah, his life was terrible, I agree. I don't think his mistakes make him deserve such a crap life or anything. But I'd feel a lot sorrier for him if he weren't such a jerk.

Within the series, he was an okay character. Honestly, I knew [[/death%20was%20coming%20and%20was%20all%20worried%20about%20it,%20but%20when%20he%20died%20it%20took%20me%20a%20few%20pages%20to%20even%20realize,%20and%20then%20I%20just%20didn't%20care.][a]] But I realize he has the potential to be a really great, awesome character. There are so many fics I've read where Sirius is amazing. I love Lord Black Sirius. I love grows-up-and-realizes-he-should-get-along-with-Snape Sirius. I love so many incarnations of Sirius. So yeah, it would be super sad if Harry killed Sirius before realizing he was innocent.

But, well, I'd still more feel bad for Harry. The amount of grief and regret he'd feel would be more than he felt at any point during the series I think. I don't think I've read anything where he felt as bad (legitimately) as he would feel. (There are, of course, a million stories where Harry is suicidallly depressed because, I assume, incorrect neurotransmitter balances since the stories rarely give a good reason.)

****** Snaps is sort of the same way really. Lots of dumb mistakes made while he was younger, but its hard to give a crap because he's sort of a dick.

You're right as well, Harry would be completely wrecked if he found out he was innocent after killing him.

******* Yeah, Snape's another character I love, but only in fanfiction. Great potential, but low output within the series. (And could people stop pairing Harry with him without warnings? Jeez, I was partway through Blood Quill Consequences when, oh, btw, this is a slash fanfic. God damn it. It's not that I'm opposed to slash - Gundam Wing fanfics can attest to that - but you'd better have a damn good reason why a male character cannonically defined as straight is suddenly into guys.)

********* I can.... see Harry/Draco. You know, if someone put in some serious effort and wrote really really well. I'd give it a chance at least, if it looked like the work had been done. But yeah, i can't think of any way that Harry/Snape would work. Just because you like two characters does not mean they're soulmates.

********** I guess I'm not completely against Harry/Draco, its just 80% of them are male veela or creature fics, and the other 20% are angsty teen romance stories.

Post war Harry/Draco can actually be quite good really, they are just super rare.

*********** Yes. I sometimes start reading one just because I've found that slash fanfics sometimes have an aspect to the romance that I've never found in a het fic. They (the good ones) put more effort in because they know that we need a good reason to believe this relationship, while het writers can just say and then they liked each other and it's believable because the canon has said as much. I usually stop reading though because even though they put effort in, they don't put enough in for me to believe it. Honestly, I think it's Draco's character. I've only read like, three or four fanfics that I've believed that involved him in romance with a traditionally light character. And one was an AU Harry got transported to another universe where he and Draco were together fic, so it doesn't even count.

If he had his suspicions about Remus being a werewolf, it would be pretty dumb to go looking for him on the night of the full moon...

** I, too, have always wanted to see this! And I don't think it would be too far out of character for Harry to do this. It would have the most fascinating repercussions. Would anyone have found out the truth about Sirius? How would the rest of the novel's play out?

*** Harry Potter... Dexter? ... ... ... I completely get Harry Potter/Buffy xovers. I... don't like, but understand Harry Potter/Twilight xovers (ugh, it almost physically hurts me to admit that). And I can see why people want to do xovers of Harry Potter and Naruto (being very similar in the type of people they appeal too) but Dexter? What do they even have to do with each other? Still, any xover has the potential to be valid. Was it good, despite sucking?

*** I was an editor, and the company was in the process of phasing out editors (despite desperately needing more editors, silly people), so we didn't have a lot of actual work. We still had to look busy though, and fanfiction.net, with its lack of side banner ads, was perfect for looking busy. So I read through hundreds of Harry Potter fanfics while at work. And of course I read a ton of fanfics outside of work as well. Even now, almost a decade later, I read HP fanfics while on break at my current job, before work, after work, and on days that I don't work.

***** Sorry, I'm afraid I don't keep a list at all - I haven't even favorited a story since high school (and when I look back at that list I have to cringe lulz). Off the top of my head though I know I enjoy a lot of entries in the champions of lilith challenge (I really like harems though), and the... Firebird trilogy was it? On a more Severitus side, I think I remember liking Digging for the Bones, and... crap, I don't remember the title... It was a story where Harry's "power he knows not" was legillimency. Harry Potter and the Chained Souls. There we go. I think it's a sequel to another fic. And of course Methods of Rationality is always fun.
