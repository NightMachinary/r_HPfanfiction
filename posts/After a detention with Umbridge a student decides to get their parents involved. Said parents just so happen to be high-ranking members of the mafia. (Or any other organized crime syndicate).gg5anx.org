** Could be interesting exploring wizarding crime syndicates. I doubt they'd kill off a high ranking government official though. If it's a muggle crime organization, what are the muggles going to do? Search aimlessly for hogwarts or the ministry?

*** I doubt it would be a muggle one, the student would know that wouldn't they?

** Umbridge woke up, immediately noticing something wrong. She was standing in her office, on a chair, with a rope around her neck. Panicking, she got rid of the rope and stepped down from the chair only to find a letter on her desk. A letter written in her handwriting and with her magical signature confessing to multiple things, some of which she was even responsible for. Just as she got done reading it, the ink shifted and transformed into two words. "ONLY WARNING", before the letter vanished as if it had never existed in the first place.

An hour later, a freshly resigned and somewhat paranoid Madam Umbridge left Hogwarts.

** That morning, when Delores Umbridge awoke, it was in her own bed. Soaked with the blood dripping from the decapitated heads of her dozen cats.

**** Well the horse in /The Godfather/ was an innocent animal, too, but finding its severed head in his bed really motivated Jack Woltz to "do the right thing."

Still, though. :(
