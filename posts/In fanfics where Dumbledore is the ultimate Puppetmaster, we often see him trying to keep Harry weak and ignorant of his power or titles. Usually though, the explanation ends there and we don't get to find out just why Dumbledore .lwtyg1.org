#+TITLE: In fanfics where Dumbledore is the ultimate Puppetmaster, we often see him trying to keep Harry weak and ignorant of his power or titles. Usually though, the explanation ends there and we don't get to find out just why Dumbledore is doing it in the first place. What could be the reasons?

** Usually it's so he keeps control of Harry's 15 titles and their Wizengamot seats.

Which is silly because even in canon he had Harry so wrapped around his finger that he'd do anything Dumbledore told him. /One more summer with my abusive relatives even though I'm of age and you're dead now? Sure thing, Boss. Go on the run looking for things you never fully explained and didn't tell me how to destroy? You betcha./

** Well, if I were to write a story with that as an element, it would be because Dumbledore is a radical Meritocratist, and he's using the chaos created by Voldemort and his merry band of murderers to weaken (with the final goal of tearing down) the class, wealth, and blood purity based hierachical structure that Wizarding Britain currently operates in.

*** I could get behind a Dumbledore that wants Harry to work hard for everything he has and develop true compassion for every person rich or poor. Fighting tooth and nail to survive and then suddenly in his mid twenties he inherits loads of gold and political power. I want to see a Dumbledore that is forging his successor.

**** This Dumbledore really did arrange for the Weasleys to arrive at just the right time to help Harry onto the platform, to ensure he got a positive impression of the wizarding working class.

*** Can easily picture Harry confronting Dumbledore about why he is stealing his money. Dumbledore would say "simply this, my boy" as he dives into the gold pile and swims around.

** In Of a Linear Circle, Dumbledore does what he does because the Elder Wand basically burned out his free will as punishment for not murdering Grindelwald and exacerbated his negative traits. The Wand engineered the second war because it saw the prophecy and decided it wanted to be held by either the holder of the Stone or the Cloak.

** The thing that defines Dumbledore most as a character is regret. Regret for the things he's done, and the things he hasn't.

If you wanted to bring in the prophecy, you could have him essentially cling to the thing with gratitude and do everything he can to make it happen - after all, those actions are determined by the prophecy, not him, so they'll surely turn out better (in his head - his decisions killed Ariana, created Grindelwald and Voldemort, and lead many to ruin).

If you wanted to make him a good guy, have him basically be trying to give Harry the best childhood possible (ie. not having to be a Baby Politician) and just really, really fucking it up because he's a hundred year old bachelor and has literally no idea what kids are like these days. That whole "What? But when I was your age, I loved making breakfast for the family, and I was grateful for every scrap!" vibe.

Other good guy way - maybe Harry having those titles and powers has some consequences Dumbledore is trying to protect him from in that kind of "Ugh. Everyone keeps looking to me for answers and I'm the Chief Warlock. How in the heck did I end up Chief Warlock? Don't be like me, Harry. Be free and happy and go make cheese in the mountains somewhere" sort of way. I'm currently writing (haven't uploaded yet) a fic where Harry has some Indy Tendencies and ends up getting his inheritances early, only to find out there's some real shitty strings attached to them. (Consider real shitty underlined several times :D). Dumbledore is basically tired of everyone's shit and regularly muses on whether the guilt of abandoning it all to go start a farm and do magical research would be too much for him or not.

If you wanted to make him a villain, make him a Knight Templar who's utterly dedicated to not letting another mistake happen. Sure, Harry being isolated and low-powered might be less happy for him, but the consequences of being wrong there leads to one sad kid. If Harry is the new Voldemort and had all that power, the consequences are significantly worse and Dumbledore is basically three for three.

There's probably a tonne more (and a tonne of holes in the suggestions I made) but that's all I could come up with in five minutes and I've gotta go make dinner now so that's all I got. :D

** Harry, Voldemort, grindelwald and Dumbledore. All are extremely powerfull wizards, the type that has been documented in history. Dumbledore sees these people as agent of chaos and death, himself included.

When harry dies fighting Voldemort, both kill each other. If Dumbledore survives he keeps to being a headmaster and making as little waves as possible, because he believes the power he wields is unnatural/disruptive to the world.

Keeping harry as weak as possible is a way to make sure he doesn't survive or if he does then he will at least be an above average wizard at best and will not cause too much strife in the world.

Or something like that, I like the other explanations too, except the wizangamot one haha

** The most common explanation I've seen for this in fanfics is that Dumbledore kept Harry in his abusive home life and kept him clueless so that he would need to rely heavily on Dumbledore for guidance.

If he came from a background lacking love and had never experienced being valued by anyone he would be more desperate to have those things once he got a taste of it, and then in swoops Dumbledore, the kindly grandfather figure. That kind of person would have Harry's full, blind loyalty and trust.

** The popular explanations I've seen:-

- Harry would threaten Dumbledore's personal power e.g. Dumbledore is currently using Harry's Wizengamot seats as part of his voting block or Dumbledore is using Harry's money to fund Hogwarts scholarships polishing his public image or making the recipients his clients.
- Dumbledore needs Harry to have few ties to the wider world so he will sacrifice himself to stop Voldemort, as per the prophecy.
