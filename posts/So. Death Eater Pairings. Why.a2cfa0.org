Not here to kink shame. I just genuinely want to know why 95 percent of it is on every page of A03? Even when you filter out M/M you still get the same pairings, except Hermione now switches place with Harry (Or even better its Female Harry) It wasn't this prevelant before; at least I dont think it was and if anything it seems to be increasing rather than slowing down.

And by Death Eater pairings I mean F!Harry/Death Eater or Draco, Harry/Death Eater or Draco, and Hermione/Death Eater or Draco.

Do these pairings keep getting written because they are Popular and everyone is doing it?


** The two reasons I can come up with:

1) People love power dynamics and bad boys.

2) People love redemption arcs.

** So I'm a Dramione shipper. It's the only Death Eater x Hermione/Harry I ship/search out (Unless Drarry bromance counts, cause I'm all for some AU bromance). I dont pretend that its realistic. But if I had to explain why I'm into it, I have some explanations/tropes I like, and pre-reqs.

1. Enemies to Friends to Lovers is hands down my absolute favorite ship. One of the first ships I recall enjoying is Usagi/Mamoru. I have shipped Zutara (Zuko/Katara) since the original air of the pirate episode. It's probably why Jily is my favorite canon ship while Ronmione leaves me bleh. A well written Dramione fic scratches that itch so, so well.

2. Rich, Suave Male Lead who falls in love first with the Smart and/or Driven Female Lead is one favorite Shoujo and Josei romance tropes. Of the characters with any characterization, Viktor, maybe Bill and Draco fit that role, and Draco fits my Male romance lead archetype aesthetic best.

3. Smut. Look, I'm mostly reading Dramione to my jollies off, and honestly there is some top tier Harlequin Romance deliciously trashy smut and I am all about that shit. There's an inherent spiciness to the ship that keeps it just edgy enough to not be simpering.

4. AU, Adulthood, and EWE. Look. I'm grown. I very rarely, if ever, desire to read sexually charged fics about teenagers. I dont care about teens fucking. Luckily, the tropes I enjoy tend to be about them as adults navigating relationships. Honestly that is fascinating to me, in a way that canon just... isn't?

5. As a WOC, I just want to read stuff where the bad boy ain't so bad, and finds beauty in a woman reminds me of myself. Maybe those exes for whom my skin wasn't good enough for could be lovers worthy if my affection in another life. Like shit man, let me have some wish fulfillment in my ultimately harmless fanfics about racists not being racist and becoming better people because of pussy and love instead of harshing my vibe with the Nuremberg Trails man.

*** I can get Dramione/Drarry. As much as a shit as Draco is, he isn't completely irredeemable and one can slightly tweak canon to make him more palatable. It's also the classic type of pairing in a romance novel. I can even understand Narcissa/Harry or a slightly fanon version of Bellatrix/

I'll never understand Voldemort/Harry or Voldemort/Hermione or Snape/Harry. I can even 'get' Tom Riddle, as odd as it sounds, but not those pairing....LV is magic Hitler and killed Harry's parents, and unless it is drastically tweaking canon (and even then) it's just disturbing as fuck. Snape was not only Harry's teacher, but was canonically ugly as sin, played a role in his parents' death, emotionally abused Harry, treated his friends like shit, and was in love with his mother. Again, that pairing baffles me beyond belief---if it was one or two, okay, but when you add it all up together...bizarre.

**** You're assuming that Death Eater pairings take place after events of canon or that they don't change the events of canon. Besides, there are many ways to approach redemption, remorse, and forgiveness; and it can make for fascinating story-telling.

In addition, even just reading about morally bankrupt individuals can be a captivating experience. One of my favorite movies, for example, is Der Untergang, a german film which you might be familiar with, as it showcases Hitler's last days. And it is...fascinating. It explores a depth of human soul in a historical setting that is poignant to so many people. But it doesn't glorify Nazism to any extent; and, in the same fashion, a Death Eater pairing doesn't have to glorify Death Eaters.

**** The vast majority of war criminals in WW2 were not executed, and served under ten years in prison. A large number of them served under three years. And most of those of them who didn't find love earlier found it after the war. And if you're going to object to "the good guys" getting together with the bad, remember that senior officers and civil servants in the occupying forces thought that there was enough "fraternisation with the enemy" for it to be a very serious problem.

The Voldemort War being a civil war makes it even harder to be harsh to the losers - there were no armies or uniforms, and in a very small society there's just nowhere to put large numbers of prisoners. There is no canonical evidence for the use of capital punishment in magical Britain either.

Ehhh, having some people Kissed would amount to the same thing. Leaving a body a soulless husk at the command of the state is basically indistinguishable from killing capital punishment, and it was something the Ministry sometimes did.

********* There are plenty of Death Eaters (such as Lucius) who claimed that they were under the Imperius and got out of Azkaban. But that doesn't mean they were actually innocent. So let's look at the Death Eaters who actually regretted/defected as seen in canon.

-Snape during the first war (but only because Lily was in danger, he actually wanted Dumbledore to only protect her and not Harry or James) -Karkaroff after the first war (but only because he was captured and gave up names of other Death Eaters, so Voldemort would have killed him had he come back) -Regulus Black during the first war (but only because Voldemort almost killed his house elf) -Wormtail during the second war (he hesitated in alerting Voldemort to Harry's escape attempt at Malfoy Manor and his magical hand took that as a betrayal and killed him). He also might have regretted betraying Lily and James, but instead of redeeming himself or even staying in hiding he actively seeks out Voldemort and brings him back to a physical form. So ge clearly didn't regret it /that/ much. -Lucius and Draco at the end of the second war (literally at the end, after Harry saves Draco's life and Harry comes back to life, the family just kind of runs off. A betrayal towards Voldemort, sure, but they only run off because their family's been getting punished by Voldemort, not because they've suddenly changed their minds about blood purity and torturing/killing people. Draco, maybe, but I'm doubtful of Lucius. Narcissa wasn't a Death Eater as far as I remember.).

So that's six that we're shown throughout the series who betrayed Voldemort/abandoned their cause. And most were for fairly selfish reasons, because being Death Eaters no longer suited them, not because their views on the cause and methods suddenly changed. Regulus is probably the most sympathetic one out of all of them, but then again we don't know much about it. It's possible he kept his blood purity beliefs and was okay with murder and torture, but didn't want to follow Voldemort anymore because of what he did to Kreacher. Or maybe he saw how Voldemort treated Kreacher and realized that that's how they were treating Muggles and Muggle-borns and changed his views. I don't recall the books getting super detailed about that. In any case the vast majority of known Death Eaters were willing and if they regretted anything it'd be that they lost.

Heck, you refer to them as idealistic, but the ideals they held to were things like purebloods being inherently better. Sirius makes it clear that the initial support for Voldemort outside the Death Eaters (like Walburga) agreed with his beliefs. What turned some of them off (again, these are the non-Death Eaters) were the lengths Voldemort was willing to go to (wanton murder and genocide), not the supremacy. They weren't misled, every Death Eater shown to hold these views(even Snape apparently, until Lily was in the direct line of fire of Voldemort). As for direct stuff, Hagrid says it was mostly desire for power and people who were just as evil as Voldemort himself. That doesn't leave much wiggle room, especially since we don't see any real exceptions outside Snape in his later adult life (Draco fell in the Walburga camp).

  "Draco Malfoy stands accused of breaking the laws of warfare on 346 counts. He was found guilty of all charges. He plead guilty and provided names of other Death Eaters. Therefore capital punishment will not be applied and Mr Malfoy will spent his remaining days in Azkaban once the Dementors have been removed."

******* No. Any other outcome outside of that or maybe lining the Death Eaters up in front of a firing squad is an insult to their victims. Letting them live in prison is merciful.

The one plot I can see which works around them is the Death Eaters escape justice and Harry&co hunt them down, but even that leaves no room for romancing the DEs.

*** But that's the thing. These ARE the Same pairings OVER and OVER again?

Where's the Voldemort/Bellatrix? Lestrange/Bellatrix? Snape/Narscissa? Andromeda/Tonks? Tonks/Remus? Lucious/Narcissa?

All of these interesting dynamics have yet to be explored in comparison to the others, and yet none of it's even close to being written at the same frequency.

Hell, let's go to slash. Wheres the Lucious/Snape? Snape/Draco? OT3 of Lucious/Snape/Draco just to hit several fetishes at once? Voldemort/Lucious? Voldemort/Snape (With mindganes in between like he knows I know that he knows and that makes it hot interplay)?

I don't see any of these at all, or there's like 6 in existance. Not even to break up the monotany of seeing the same pairings over and over page after page.

**** And once you find a fic that actually explores a canon pairing, your next challenge is to find a fic that actually shows that these two people understand each other and that their relationship makes sense. At least that was my experience with Remus Tonks. It seems that death eater parings have the advantage of letting the author play a fairytale where the impossible is made possible while there aren't many such chances if you write a canon paring because those people, like Andromeda and Ted, did end up together. And since they did, nobody cares how this happened.

  Bellatrix
#+end_quote

Because after Hermione she is basically the most badass female character in the series. She was the only Death Eater who actually posed a threat and if you go with Dumbledore as an antagonist or beef Voldemort up, you need someone who has a fighting chance and Katie Bell just won't cut it.

Also, there is a short window between her breakout and the DoM Battle where a redemption is believable (no bad blood, Azkaban as the reason to defect) and has her punished for past crimes, something you don't have with the likes of Malfoy or Snape, who both dodged prison.

**** No matter which way you look at it, Bella is one of the most evil individuals in the series -- much more so that Malfoy, for example. Bellatrix is someone who /actively enjoyes torture/ and /relishes in people's suffering/. There is really almost no redemption for someone like that, and a ten-year stint in Azkaban is hardly punishment for (at least) driving two people insane by using the cruciatus over and over and over again, and /enjoying/ it.

Edit: Really, the best way to approach a pairing with her is something along the lines of Delenda Est: create an earlier version of her that is open to salvation.

***** The other option I've seen uses the idea of marriage contracts as almost a form of Imperio, where she was forced to behave a certain way in accordance to Rodolphus's, and thus Riddle's, wishes. The same is also used to make Harry/Pansy believable in some fics.

And yet you argued that Malfoy should not be punished for hundreds of counts of war crimes in several other threads and even questioned the wrongness of the Third Reich in the process of trying to mount a defence for Malfoy.

****** Yes, because, as I see it, Malfoy does not deserve prison. He is not a Bellatrix.

Here's the difference:

1) Malfoy is a kid at the times of the alleged crimes. Bellatrix was an adult.

2) Malfoy was ordered to commit crimes on the pain of death and torture of his family. Bella had no such threats hanging over her head; she eagerly jumped at the notion.

3) This is the most important one. /Malfoy was never a sadist./ Intent matters. Malfoy never wanted to torture or kill. In fact, when confronted by such scenes he was either disgusted or scared or both. Bella? Oh, Bella loved torture. She took pleasure in it. She is a sociopath; Malfoy, on the other hand, obviously possess empathy.

4) Oh, and there's that arguable notion that Malfoy helped the trio escape from the Manor when he refused to identify them, even though all he had to do was say the words 'that's Potter'.

So, yes, Bella deserves Azkaban in my opinion. Malfoy, for a number of mitigating circumstances, does not.
