The title says it all. I'm looking for fics where Harry uses a staff. Strangely specific request, I know, but I've read a few, liked them, and want to read more. But it's not something that easy to search like 'dark!harry' or 'slytherin!harry' or time travel, cross overs, etc. So yeah. Anything you got. Lay it on me. Thank you!


** The obvious one may be "Blindness" by AngelaStarCat, as its one of the favorite in progress fics on the sub

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** In the second book of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The Cupboard Under the Stairs series by Stargon1]] has Harry finding a staff [[/spoiler][that he uses to kill the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.]]

EDIT: Formatting.

EDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo: And if you're okay with fem!Harry, there is the popular WIP [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh]].

** I find these stories to be a bit insipid, the staff thing often being a stunt to identify Harry as super-ultra-mega, but a few come to mind:

linkffn(Do Not Meddle in the Affairs of Wizards by Corwalch) (the quintessential "Harry is an asshole with no redeeming features and I hope he gets struck down by a meteor" fic).

Another (staff-using Harry) is [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Parallels/Parallels/][Parallels]] by Bobmin.

The trope is lampshaded in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) (wizard staff fighting is one of the TWT tasks, but is deemed primitive and wholly inferior to wands).

*** I understand what you mean by a stunt like that. I still enjoy them anyway /shrug. I have read the first one tho (and that is a pretty accurate description of him in it as well).

I haven't read the other two tho. Thank you~

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

** Harry Potter and the guardians of power by teacherbev. It's very light, there aren't any glaring horrible writing issues, at least to my taste and expectations of fanfic. I have read this one multiple times when I need a break from the darker stuff I read sometimes.
