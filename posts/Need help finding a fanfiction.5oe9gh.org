So my pc melted down last summer and since then I have been looking for a story I was reading it was a wrong BWL one and what I remember is

when Tom attacked Harry eyes turned from brown to green and his brother got a scar and the title Lily got her mind messed with by James and Albus but remembers stuff later and reveals to Harry she was from a wizard family that died out and his eyes going green is a sign of him coming into the power of that family and being the real BWL

hope someone can help based on that


** i know of one where harry goes back in time and the green eyes are from his family on lilys side that got wiped out.

**** sorry to say its not there was no time travel in it I remember Lily was teaching at the school during the Fic if my memory is good she took the first 3 years in potions while snape took the other years

I also think its the same story where his brother who was said to the BWL by Albus might have lost an arm at one point but I could be mixing stories up with that
