He gives her mother expensive wine, and saves a little kid from dying in a pool, I think. It was my /favorite/ little short story, but I've lost it over the year.

*** I've read this a couple of times and each time I finish it all I think about for the next hour is stating a family so I can capture some of the moments in the story for myself.

LeQuinn always writes such indulgently wholesome stories.

***** That's what's so indulgent about it. Poor Ron is demonised to give Harry a stage to perform on. Every internal monologue praises Harry or points out some new virtue. The bit with the scars is peak melodrama. Indulgent.

****** I mean, they have a valid (albeit subjective) opinion. Did I enjoy reading it and were large swathes of it very wholesome? Yes. Were the parts with Ron aggressively non-wholesome, bashing, and somewhat uncomfortable to read? Also yes. For me.

You can't choose not to read something because you'll dislike it, before you've read enough to know you'll dislike it. There's a difference between providing a contradicting thought on a subjective assessment of a piece of art, and leaving an essay of shitty negative feedback on every chapter of a fanfic because the author is doing something you dislike with your favorite character.

I appreciated his statement because it set my expectations going in, which helped me get past the Ron bashing and fast forward to the wholesome.

******* No I meant what I said. The story clearly had a warning, at the top of the page, that said that it will have Ron bashing. If that was not to your liking, or not your cup of tea in general, you should have clicked the back button. Now, if you had constructive criticism, besides it had Ron bashing, which, once again, was clearly warned for, have at it. Let's hear constructive criticism.

******** Bash is a broad term. Someone can be prepared for a certain kind, or certain level of bashing, but not prepared for Ron the would-be abuser.

And futhermore, I don't like your tone. You're taking a very personal offence to the idea of someone else not liking this fic, and frankly it's bizarre. Why do you care so much if someone does or does not care for this one story?

**** But yes, I do agree, most of their stories tend to be of the self indulgent variety, and are generally wholesome. Which depending upon my mood, can be definitely my cup of tea/pick me up for that time.
