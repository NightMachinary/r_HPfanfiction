NO Time Travel stories where the time traveler is really stupid/acts really stupid about things that they should know.

No stories where they can't fix the past. No stories where things are pretty much the same with just a few things changed either.

I want characters to have a domino effect/butterfly effect with them trying to change the future. This changes because they do this, this then changes because they do this, etc.

No stories where technically an adult character goes back in time and starts having romantic feelings for someone younger than him.

I hate it when the same characters (or same-ish) characters still die even though you know you can save them. Save Cedric, Sirius, Remus, etc. Save them! I'm fine with characters dying, it'd be boring if it was 100% perfect, but it doesn't need to be the same characters.

I'd rather not have stories where the time traveler remembers every single question that a teacher asked, no one does that.

I hate when the time traveler tries to make it the same to preserve their advantage. You know about the Horcruxes, the Ministry, etc go destroy them beforehand. You have Order Members at your disposal, tell them that Crouch Jr is secretly alive and living at Crouch Sr's house, etc. Heck, kill Umbridge if you want, I don't care. Just change things around.

If it's Marauder Era, they know what the Horcruxes are, they know (roughly at the time travel part) where they are. Destroy them. Get someone or something to kill the ones that will be Death Eaters, like Lucius, Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers, etc. You know who will be Death Eaters before they become one, I know it's brutal. But destroy them or maim them or send them a warning, etc. Don't just let them become a Death Eater/Don't let them do things like destroying the Longbottom's minds when you can stop them!

Sorry for the rant there. That always annoys me that the author continuously lets them get away with stuff.

I'd rather not have any bashing. No Weasley Bashing where they're using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche

I don't want Dumbledore to be evil, he can still do wrong things if necessary, but I don't want him to be evil.

I'd actually rather them not be in ANY pairings, but if necessary. No one that is younger than them technically. No 30 technically year old Harry (but goes back as an 11-year-old) hitting on 11-year-old Ginny or 12 year old Hermione.

Same thing with Snape. If Snape goes to the Marauder Era no adult Snape going back in a younger body, trying to get with a young Lily Evans, just no.


** Following time travels should meet your criteria:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]]: This is technically a time travel as the Marauders take great advantage of Time Turners.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]: Harry is thrown back to 1975, without full knowledge about Voldemort's secrets. He has to team up Bellatrix, who is a very well written character in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]]: Wormtail gets a second chance. Very in character

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]]: Luna raises Tom Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]]: Hermione time travel from James Potter's POV. She's not paired with anyone in this unique time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]: Hermione's plan sounds simple, but what a twist!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]]: Dumbledore has to defend Tom Riddle from a time traveler named "James Bond".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan travel back 25 years and unleash hell on their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]]: The only fic in which Hermione kills Tom Riddle in his orphanage and many more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4487319/1/The-Greatest-Minister-of-Magic][The Greatest Minister of Magic]]: Fudge makes clever use of a Time Turner. Very in character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4061219/1/The-Time-Meddlers][The Time Meddlers]]: Harry and Hermione travel back to their Year 1. They fix things nicely, but cause a new villain to emerge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]]: Harry is thrown back to 1970 and very pissed. When a Death Eater raid disturbed his peace, he massacred most of them and thoroughly impressed Bellatrix.

** linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT)

This fits some but not all of your criteria, and is a great story IMO. Basically it's an AU where every time Harry dies he time travels back a little ways in the timeline and has a chance to do it again. So in essence it's a bunch of micro-time travel fics stitched together. Harry definitely changes things as soon as he knows to, but he doesn't know about Horcruxes or anything at the beginning of the story, but the story is complete, so the horcruxes are dealt with in the end.

On a similar vein, this is a time loop story where the MCs don't have to die to trigger the loop, though it does trigger if they die. Each loop they significantly improve and change things, though I think it's abandoned before they really get into horcrux stuff.

**** Absolutely agree. It's definitely one of those fics I would pay money to have completed. Too bad that would be illegal!

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** The exploration of the butterfly effect in The Bureaucratic Error is absolutely heart-wrenching. The most recent chapter ripped my heart out. From what you wrote, I think you'll like it. The main pairing is Remus/Tonks, but equal (if not more!) time is spent on the friendship between Remus and Sirius and their role as parental figures to Harry. It's one of my favorites!
