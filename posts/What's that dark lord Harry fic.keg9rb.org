I remember a while ago I read a fic where Harry was slowly becoming a dark lord during his Hogwarts years. All of his 'followers' were aware of this but Harry didn't realise. There was a list of requirements you had to meet before magic recognised you as a dark lord and one of them was that you had to declare yourself one. This was the last thing Harry did but with Voldemort etc it was basically the first thing they did. Is this ringing any bells? Sorry can't remember any details about pairings/ what website

I originally thought it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1182551][Shadow Magic]], but apparently it's from Potens, part two of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1852420][Princeps series]], both by Lomonaaeren. The former doesn't seem to have a list of requirements, and the latter takes place when he's an adult (yay time travelling teacher). So I'm linking both, cuz both are grand.

Potens:

  The potential lord---or lady---has to reach a specific level of magical power, demonstrated in front of a crowd of at least a hundred; claim the title; brand his or her followers to show that they actually have a group of people bound to them; and choose a magical affinity.

Edit - oh neat, Priceps has a part three WIP. That's new!

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.
