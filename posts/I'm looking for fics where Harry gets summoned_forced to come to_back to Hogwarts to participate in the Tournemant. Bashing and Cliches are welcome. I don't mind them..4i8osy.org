** Some of the stories by Arawn D. Draven have this premise.

Usually involves crossovers to another dimensions.

  After being abused by his relatives, Harry finally snaps, and wishes for someone to save him. With Magic sending him to someone that is as lonely as him but has power beyond his wildest dreams, what will happen? Rated M because of some gory content by the end of the story.

  When the Dursleys go to Japan, Dudley accidentally activates a security in MBI's locals that kill them. Now, what will MBI and Karasuba do with the child they found when they checked the Dursleys' car? Rated M for mention of torture and child abuse, and future language and gore. There will be some Dumbledore, Potters, and some Weasley bashing. You are warned. Alive!Potters
