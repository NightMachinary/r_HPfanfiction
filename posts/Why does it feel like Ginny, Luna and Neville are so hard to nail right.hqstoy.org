Just an observation, but fanon Ginny, Luna, and Neville never feel like they do justice (tbf neither did JKR for Ginny) to their characters, and I feel like they are too often just slapped into stories and have noticeably terrible dialogue and characterization compared to other cast members.

Thoughts? Why does it feel like authors make a lot of faux pases with these characters? im i off base?

Discuss.


** Not sure about Neville, but Ginny gets bashed by half the fandom because they ship Harry with someone else, and Luna tends to just get written as "the crazy girl", which is a really simplistic take on her character.

** They're characters with relatively little time spent on them in the story, leading to them having less dynamic characterization than a lot of other characters while at the same time having established character voice and traits that are difficult to nail.

** Luna and Neville as they are in canon aren't the type of people you'd want to be friends with. Luna is somebody who dresses weird, always talks about conspiracy theories and behaves odd in general. Neville is clumsy with low confidence and fails at most things because of it.

It took them fighting Death Eaters for Harry before he started considering them friends and wasn't embarrassed to be seen with them.

Ginny just has become warped through years of Weasley bashing.

*** Wow, that's true. Harry (and ron) really didn't consider Neville/Luna/Ginny to be actual friends until around the end of OOTP. There's even a scene, if I recall correctly, in one book where something happens on the train while with them, and Harry talks about how embarrassed he was to be seen with them. In the following book, his opinions have completely changed. That's kinda crappy of Harry, come to think of it, considering how important Neville, Luna, and Ginny all turn out to be. Still, teens ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** There are two scenes in the train one in OOTP and one in HBP which is to show his character Developement.

#+begin_quote
  At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.

   πOh... hello, Harry, π said a nervous voice.  πUrn... bad time? π

  Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor‚Äêfree hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.

   πOh... hi, π said Harry blankly.

   πUrn... ∫ said Cho.  πWell... just thought I πd say hello... bye then. π

  Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.

This one in OOTP

and this one in HBP

  Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.

  ‚ÄòYou ask him!'

  ‚ÄòNo, you!'

  ‚ÄòI'll do it!'

  And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin and long black hair, pushed her way through the door.

  ‚ÄòHi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,' she said loudly and confidently. ‚ÄòWhy don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with /them/,' she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicoloured owl.

  ‚ÄòThey're friends of mine,' said Harry coldly.

  ‚ÄòOh,' said the girl, looking very surprised. ‚ÄòOh. OK.'

  And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.

  ‚ÄòPeople expect you to have cooler friends than us,' said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.

  ‚ÄòYou are cool,' said Harry shortly. ‚ÄòNone of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.'

  "That's a very nice thing to say," beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler.

Though I wouldnt judge Harry to harshly for it, he couldn't really have known how supportive Luna and Neville would be.

**** Eh, he's actually pretty nice to Luna and Neville despite the occasional uncharitable thought. In fact, he's a major part of Neville's development starting from PS. IMO if you eliminate Harry you don't get DH Neville.

** -Ginny doesn't have much character other than being the perfect girlfriend for Harry.

-Luna is just a very tough character to write. She believes in complete nonsensical stuff, but she's also a ravenclaw. That's quite a contradiction.

-Neville's appeal is in his development. He was never supposed to be a very powerful or smart wizard. It's his growth from frankly a very subpar student to standing against Voldemort. Fans misunderstand this as him always secretly being a badass. I still believe that Ron would beat him in a straight duel.

-And last but not the least. All these three are secondary supporting characters. Most supporting characters work BECAUSE they're supporting characters. They're not meant to be the main focus. Throwing them in the forefront would make them lose their appeal.(It's also the reason why I think Hermione would be a terrible MC. Most of her fans don't realize that she really would be 'an insufferable know-it-all' if she were a protagonist.)

*** To be fair, standing up to Voldemort is badass. But yes, Ron would probably beat him in most of their duel. People seem to forget that Ron is probably the 2nd best student in (applied) Defense right after Harry.

In comparison, Neville had a lot of grow as a character, but his only "Martial" feat was more about swordmanship than Magical talent.

*** I'm gonna disagree with the Neville one. I think if he was given the motivation he'd be able to defeat Ron in a duel. Neville is essentially the nice, quiet guy until he becomes determined to do something, then he'll become stubborn and try and do his best to change things, that said, I agree that it doesn't make him a secret badass or sleeping dragon, he still fails occasionally when he's determined to do things but atleast it can be seen that he tried.

*** Yes! I loved this very much, and it made me go back and edit my work in progress to give Ginny a more prominent role and more personality. I didn't think twice about her before reading that fic tbh. Now I've kind of borrowed that author's characterisation a little bit!

Now I need to find fics that do the same for me with Neville and Luna. I have one nice little scene with Luna in my story but I don't really know what to do with either of them honestly.

** Because they have just enough character development and 'screen time' to have recognisable personality traits but not enough complexity to provide a solid foundation/template for authors.

It's easier to write a well rounded and coherent character from a blank slate (e.g. Daphne Greengrass) then it is to finish fleshing out a partial developed supporting character.

Turning Neville into Chad McFuckville is certainly the wrong way to write him though, as is protector of the "Potter-Longbottom alliance".

How many well written stories have you seen with gigachad Neville? I've never read one. Shit stories don't really count and are irrelevant to any real discussion imo

** Luna does not work as a main character because her quirks are annoying delusions at best and signs of mental illness at worst. Basically, to write Luna who is more than cute comic relief, you need to destroy her Lunaness or she would be a person no one could stand to be around (due to her "Nazi moonbase" level of conspiracies). She beliefs that the Minister eats Goblins, or at least seriously considers it. She is pretty insightful when it comes to emotions sometimes, but would you really want to hang out with someone who goes on about lizard people ruling the world all the time? And 5G Corona?

Neville is the Gary Stu of the fandom. 8/10 fics with him in it will turn him into a flawless version of Ron, maybe with some more badassery thrown into the mix. A "canon accurate" Neville would be a very boring character, hence you don't see it often.

Ginny is difficult because almost each book she was a different character, and some of it was rather shoehorned and badly written (especially with her romance). There are like 5 different Ginnys which are all canon.

** It's hard to get side-characters "just right" if you want to put more spotlight on them in a story. You kinda have to invent more character-traits than canon provides, /because/ of the fact that they're side-characters.

Beyond that, each character is hard-to-get-right for different reasons:

- Luna is a blend of strange beliefs and insightful observations. It's hard to get that seemingly-contradictory blend just right.
- Ginny is a love-interest written as a side character. There are a few character traits there, buried under a layer of "Love Interest" - which makes those traits hard to write correctly.
- Neville's character is defined by his journey from "runt of Gryffindor" to "kind of a badass" - pausing that journey or starting from a different point means you have to kind of re-write him.
