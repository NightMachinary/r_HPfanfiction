This trope seems to be a staple of almost every Slytherin fic. (Slytherins watch out for their own, etc etc). But I fail to see it in canon.

Snape didn't get a magical Slytherin rescue party when James was hanging him upside down by his ankles. Draco has some cronies, but they seem to be bought, rather than as a result of house unity.


** Well Pottermore (if you count it) says: "For instance, we Slytherins look after our own -- which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you'll be glad you've got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we're concerned, once you've become a snake, you're one of ours -- one of the elite."

I think this is evident in books as well. Ravenclaws treatment of Luna for example. Also we see that Ron wasn't overly fond of Hermione to begin with and I can't recall how much is canon vs fanon but I don't remember Hermione getting along all that well with her dorm mates. In quidditch there is the quote about 200 green scarfs or some such when the entire rest of the school is supporting the other team. Hufflepuffs are obviously loyal but I think you could at least argue that Slytherins show more solidarity than Ravenclaw and Gryffindor (weren't overly kind or unified during Harry's parselmouth episode or entirely during the tri-wizard tournament etc.). Slytherins all laugh at Harry and Neville in potions when Snape is getting on them which may not mean much, but I can't remember Slytherins going at one anothers throats. And while yes Crabbe and Goyle are seen as henchmen when they were polyjuiced Draco did try and make them laugh and talk with them etc. so I don't think you can just write them off. Ron and Hermione may very well look like nothing but hangers on to the BWL to others for all they know.

edited - Two more things. First "Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him,". Now granted this was Flint protecting his new seeker who got him a nice new broom but you might expect a 'snake' to let another sink or swim on their own. Secondly in the sorting hat song "perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends" which could be taken poorly as in 'you'll find those just as bigoted as you" but taken at face value you really will make friends. (I know the counter arguments but Snape and Voldemort can't be the norm. Also Lily's friends seem to hardly be named let alone featured so I don't know that it can be judged so neatly). Also for the sake of argument the Snape situation may have occurred in the absence of other Slytherins- he was a loner and I don't think a House can be faulted for the bullying incidents instigated by a different house (plus if James and Sirius' reputation preceded them then any Slytherins present would have to be of an age or older and/or backed up by numbers to do anything).

*** Also, maybe Slytherins weren't inclined to help Snape out, since he had broken House solidarity first by hanging out with a gryffindor muggleborn for 5 years?

*** I'd say the solidarity is more evident in what the Slytherins don't do. Namely, Malfoy is an obvious asshole, yet when he's mouthing off none of his house puts him in his place.

**** lol the default male pronoun rule applies.

When a person writes, he must generally use male terms to avoid awkward he/she brothers/sisters him/her his/her's moments.

** Of course! I'm sure if JKR had written the first night at Hogwarts from Draco's POV, we would have heard Snape's infamous house unity speech: "Limit your fights to the common room, to the rest of Hogwarts we must present a united front!"

no, but seriously, I don't think there was anything like it. At least I never saw any indication. They are just a house like any other.

It's been too long since I've read the books. Does canon Snape ever say anything along those lines? It seems to be said by him or a prefect whenever the PoV character gets sorted into Slytherin.

***** Thanks! It was nice to get an answer to a question. I wouldn't really care if it was one of my usual off hand comments, but I had been curious about this one.

It seems like a lot of authors use that trope.

****** Yeah, I haven't read many Slytherin!Protagonist fics, but that speech by Snape or older Slytherins seems damn near omnipresent in the ones I have read. It does make for some interesting plots though, at least in /On the Way to Greatness/ it did.

I don't suppose you have any good recs that involve this trope? I've been struggling hardcore to find any good fics lately.

******* Nothing that comes to mind, sorry. It does seem like it comes up a lot when the protagonist/POV character is sorted into Slytherin. I've seen it more with the prefects giving that speech rather than Snape.

** Hufflepuff is the only one mentioned as rallying around anyone specifically. This is fanon, designed to make Slytherin-centric fics more interesting and give Slytherins a collective redeeming feature.
