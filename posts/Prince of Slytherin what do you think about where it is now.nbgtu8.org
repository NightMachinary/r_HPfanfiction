THIS COULD HAVE SPOILERS FOR EVERYTHING UP TO THE LATEST CHAPTER BECAUSE IT IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE WHOLE STORY UP TO NOW AND CENSORING THEM ALL WOULD BE TOO MUCH EFFORT

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

TL;DR: I really like the ideas behind POS, but I have never read a story so desperately in need of an editor.

With that said, now I can start. When I first found POS, I thought it was amazing. I am a sucker for the political 11-year-olds trope and thought that the characters were fun, the story was going in interesting directions, and it was very well-written. For the most part, I still think that these statements are true: The Sinister Man, purely in terms of prose, is probably one of the best in the fanfic biz, the story is not a canon rehash, and the way that the story plays with common tropes, occasionally turning them on their head, is fun and done in a way I haven't really seen before. I think that the best example of this is the second year, with the Lockhart plot being a completely fresh story idea culminating in a marvellously moving flashback chapter. Something else that comes to mind is the attack at Hogsmeade, when Harry falls from his broom and pushes the limits of his mind to save himself, which is one of the best action scenes I have seen in a fanfic.

However, despite these elements that I love, I feel like the story is now collapsing under its own weight. There are too many subplots that are not woven together nicely enough to be memorable, and I feel like some of the new, 'darker' elements (like most parts with Pettigrew, especially his 'King of Rats' escape from the Ministry) do not come across as well on paper as I am sure that they do in TSM's head. This started in the third year, with that convoluted time travel plot, but it gets more and more obvious with each chapter, and now moves at so sluggish a pace due to all the plots (even when there is a big action set-piece), that I find myself less and less interested in where it goes, which is a shame, because there are some wonderful ideas in there.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or do other people agree?


** I agree as is. Would've dropped off Rookwood's corpse just to be sure because with him at large I foresee much angst and stupidity.

** So I guess my problem with it is that compared to the original canon it's already almost 20% longer by word count now, but it's only barely dragging into fourth year. If it's taken what 1.2 million words just to get where the story is now, I figure it'll probably be another 200-300 thousand more words before the author even begins the TWT, never mind actually finishing the story. I haven't read since around chapter 115-120 or so. I remember pretty much nothing about the plot other than the cliffhanger somewhere one of those chapters ended on, and if I'm gonna get caught back up to where it is now that's a whole lot of time investment for what frankly seems like a whole little of plot development.

** One of this issues I have is trying to read it as it updates. I've found that if I go back and read from scratch, I don't find it as convoluted as reading it piecemeal. I do feel like it's spun a bit out of TSM's control, but no worse than ASOIAF has for GRRM.

**** A Song of Ice and Fire - the Game of Thrones book series. There are lots of floundering plot lines in the books that didn't make it to the TV show, and at the last book published it feels like it's in a similar place to Prince of Slytherin

** IMO this fic is one of the best HP fanfic written in the fandom. There's a lot of amazing ideas in there, like for example the concept of Wild Magic, competent!Lockhart and likable WBWL. I do agree that the story suffers from bloat though. There's infodumps written in between proses which sometimes breaks my immersion in the story, i.e in TRG when Harry was in Paris talking to Justin's dad, suddenly in the middle of the paragraph, we're treated to a history lesson of magical France, how magical banks differ from muggle banks and how goblins are the equivalent of loan sharks in the wizarding world. It's a bit jarring. These type of worldbuilding fits more in a Wiki, which this fanfic does have, instead of in the middle of the story. This also happened in TSE when TSM was introducing Azkaban. We suddenly got introduced to Emeric, Ekrizdis and how Azkaban got built and then discovered by Britain. It's nice to know but would fit more in the Wiki.

That said, there's also infodumps which is plot relevant but would only pay off after about like 100K words or more later. TSM frequently uses this method when writing and it's a sign of how he has a clear goal ending which he is trying to get to so I wouldn't worry about the story collapsing on its own weight. The Time Travel plot, while convoluted, was needed to get Harry to become a Prince of Slytherin as dictated by the Prophecy. It also provided him both the memory and experience to cast the Patronus and Fiendfyre, which I admit sounds like the start of the Super!Harry trope that I despise but the fact that the villains are extremely competent makes up for it. All in all, I enjoy the fic but yeah it does need a bit trimming.

**** Yeah I think this particular fanfic caters to those with a specific taste for long fics or those who are fans of the Tolkien-style narrative where every tree branch has a backstory. I'm exaggerating but I did lose interest a lot of times when I was reading POS. I certainly gave up halfway in 1st year since that Harry was cringy af. I slogged through it since every one of my friends said it gets better in 2nd year but I still lost interest somewhere before the Lockhart reveal. In 3rd year, the flashbacks were excruciatingly boring so I put it down and didn't pick it up until a few months ago. By then, the slow parts were over and the action started and it was a blast reading it in one go.

I think the best way to enjoy this fic is to let it get to the climax of the arc then binge-reading. By then a lot of the infodumps that was a chore to get through every release makes sense and pays off quite well. As of right now, I'm holding off on reading the quidditch world cup arc. I'll get to it once TSM finishes this arc and hopefully I get to enjoy it more than if I read it every release.

** There are so many plotlines and characters that i dont give a shit about. Mostly just skim it and read when i get to parts with harry/his family. It also moves at a glacially slow pace and the oath things started as a cool idea now just seem so cumbersome and annoying.

Reminds me of the Ashes of Chaos fic a lot but one whose problems is multiplied by like 10.

** This is my favorite Harry Potter fanfiction story I enjoy the depth and complexity. Admittedly I have read the story through a number of times and I am on the discord server for the fic so it helps keep me caught up on this fic.

** I honestly have never read it, and don't really have an opinion about it. Though I do get the feel that the fic is intentionally going for like, literally the longest series in the fandom ever. I think the author literally has an odyssey and they want to put every single detail in it, to tie everything together, to just make a world that explores everyone and everything. Not my type of reading, not light reading either, but still, an absolute unit - definitely unrivalled by any other fanfictions that use any of the tropes Prince of Slytherin uses.
