So I read this cracky oneshot where James is punished for his presumed targeted bullying of Snape, who in this universe appears to be mostly blameless for everything, by being forced into permanently swapping bodies with him and then being Obliviated of his former James persona in favour of a copy of Snape's, with the idea that Snape has a far worse life overall than James, and he "deserves" James' life more than James does (which I personally strongly disagree with, but oh well).

Leaving aside whatever (mis)deeds those two have done and focusing on the punishment itself taking the claims of those two's deeds in the fic at face value, this is something I found incredibly disturbing -- Obliviating someone and then punishing them for something they have no idea they've done. But it raises an interesting question -- is it fair to punish someone for deeds they have no idea they've done? Someone else I was mentioning this to brought up an example -- would it be fair to punish someone for a crime they've done if they Obliviated themselves of the deed to fool Veritaserum or similar? What if someone who has clearly done some truly heinous deeds -- say, Barty Crouch Jr for example (participated in the torture of the Longbottoms), somehow ends up with their whole adult life wiped out of memory (practically deaged) because someone wanted to shield them from punishment (I could see Barty Crouch Sr do something like this), does he still deserve to be punished for the deed he has, to his memory, not committed? What if you turned Bellatrix into a toddler without any possibility of undoing it, with her previous existence removed?

Personally I think the punishment should stay in the first case, not in the Bellatrix case. I don't know how I feel about the case of Barty.

*** I think I need to reread +HBP+ OoTP if that's what happened. When was she obliviated?

(edit: Putting the correct book. I need to reread my comments before I post them.)

** This is probably the most controversial question you could ask. In the mind of the obliviated they have done nothing wrong but to the victim of the crime it would be horrifying that they walk free.

You could argue that to comit the crime once, despite bot knowing they did, they have proven to be capable of commiting the crime and wanting to do it. The problem here is that a lot of people think about, or have urges to, attack someone or do other illegal things but repress the urge. Therefore alot of people should be punished because they possibly could do it in the future.

But then you can apply this to real world where somebody does a crime whilst drunk and cannot remember doing it. Are they still responsible.

There's just too many ways to look at it and something best to be avoided
