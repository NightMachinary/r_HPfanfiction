Ok, so I am looking for a dark harry, but not one that is just a political bigot and knows the bone breaker curse or something. I am looking for a harry that uses necromancy, blood magic, soul magic, rituals.

Bonus points if harry uses the killing curse a lot. I really like that spell and even Dark!Evil!harry almost never uses it. I want a fanfic where he just spams that stuff.

Edit: even better if harry, while being a dark wizard, hates blood purists

*** I have read this one.

Spoilers

I actually dropped this one when harry started staying on grimaud place and getting along with people while planning to betray them. I don't mind evil characters, but at that part harry came up more as a cowardly sneaky little shit pettigrew style.

Does it get better after that or is harry still Voldemort's cowardly bottom bitch slave until the end?

End spoilers

I would recommend though, he does use the unforgivables a lot there.

**** He doesn't try to battle Voldemort in the end if that's what you mean by 'cowardly bottom bitch slave', and Harry's more like a spy than a coward since he was never on the Order's side like Pettigrew was in the first place.

** linkao3(The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer), really well written story though not quite as dark as what you're asking. Killing Curse only occurs once in it that I remember, but the story plays it effectively. Harry is a dark lord and after graduating Hogwarts, he goes after the old death eaters who are still around.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
