Now before you downvote, hear me out. I agree that CC is just a poorly written, non canon compliant piece of fever dream fanfic. But I would like to see if there is a fic where this works.

I once read a super creepy Harry/Delphini Riddle smutfic. I, uh, enjoyed it. Kind of.


** Getting Answers linkffn(Getting Answers): Time-travel back to summer of 5th year, mostly feel-good stuff.

Put Your Guns Away Its Tea Time linkao3(Put Your Guns Away Its Tea Time): Potter family focused story

If you want Delphini in the story but don't mind slightly bent canon: linkffn(The Augurey)

As a tangent, I would like to say the problem isn't that CC is poorly written (in my opinion). So are some fanfics that I enjoy. The problem is that the original seven books are a different type of story.

The original novels were, at the end of the day, boarding school mystery novels. All the magic and Harry Potter stuff was just garnish for this, even if it was probably the most interesting part of the books. Time-travel in 3rd year was a tightly contained plot device that never went anywhere else after that (except when they destroyed the time turners in OotP to prevent this BS in the first place).

So what is the problem with CC? Mainly, this is a *time-travel story that is masquerading as a Harry Potter story*. Much of it is specifically setup to press fan-buttons of "What If" questions, while simultaneously not really adding a significant amount of material to the world.

*** FWIW I quite enjoyed Put Your Guns Away and its sequel, which I just finished last week. I didn't (and don't intend to) read CC, so I can't speak to canon, but I thought they were entertaining.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  Time travel fic. Canon until Cursed Child. Lilly Potter sees something interesting during a boring discussion and decides to play. It's funny what a little bottle can do to time. Can Harry get the answers he needs form the people he's lost? Can they get back to their time before anything major happens?

** Might not be what you're really looking for, but this one is a blending of CC-compliance and AU. Keep in mind that it's mostly tongue-in-cheek, though.

linkffn(12824936)

As someone else mentioned, Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time is also popular. I'm not a fan of CC (except to mock it) but this story almost made me like the characters.

  The Potter children are about to learn what it means to really be a family. Maybe getting stuck in an alternate universe can actually be beneficial. (CC-compliant)

*** Yeah. Basically it was about Harry breaking into Malfoy Manor, beating up Narcissa and Astoria, and doing what amounts to raping Delphini. It was fucked up and disgusting... after the fact.

** As someone who has just completed (but not posted) a Cursed Child fic I'm both astonished to see someone asking for one and disappointed I can't link to mine. I didn't think anyone would ever be interested. But a couple of the linked fics are obviously very popular, so perhaps people will like it more than I expect.

Edit: actually I have got one. I forgot because no one reads it and I never look at it. It's a one-shot 'missing moment' and fits into the story I haven't yet posted. So possibly doesn't make complete sense . . . I know, I like to make life difficult for myself. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12151770/1/Transport-Medium]]
