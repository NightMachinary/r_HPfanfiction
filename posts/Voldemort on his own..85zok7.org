Are there any fics where, by the time Voldemort is resurrected he has no supporters. As in they've all either been caged up, killed, or have abandoned him. A story where we can see what happens if Voldemort has no supporters, or maybe one-two.

20k+, or complete are the preferable option.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** There was a one-shot where Dumbledore turned Voldemort's curse on the Defense position to wipe out the Death Eaters, as they were forced into two years "community service" as DADA teacher.

** I'm writing a story where he's down to Nagini and Barty Jr. Would that qualify? (Mind, that hasn't happened yet on-screen, just letting you know my plans.)

*** Yeah. As long as he doesn't have an army with him. In the books he was so powerful that he created his own powerful magic, including true flight. I mean when you have a magic user who is second only to the 'most powerful wizard in history', then you don't need an army, you know what I mean. He could create hocrux copies of himself, and with true flight, use fiendyfire on all of Hogwarts/ministry/whatever. He doesn't even really need the hocrux in that situation, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's made more powerful stuff.

P.s. I'm gonna copy&paste a lot of this in my next story request.

Thanks,

Warryn.
