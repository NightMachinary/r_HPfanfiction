Im not the biggest fan of Romione so I like reading other ships, lately I've been thinking that Neville/Hermione would have been good together, I don't know if he was the first person she talked to in the magical world, but she was the only one willing to help him find Trevor, so i imagine him having a little boy crush on her during the hogwarts years.

Anyway, could you recommend me fanfictions where they eventually get together?


** Here are some of my favorites:

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension.Beta Love: raviesnake, fncmullin, RavenclawMidwife, LadyParongsny

  The Golden Trio, along with the rest of the magical community is healing from the aftermath of the war. Ron is angry. Hermione is jumpy. Harry is just trying leave it all behind. This all culminates in Hermione clinging to Hogwarts for comfort. She's not alone however and the young witch finds friendship, comfort, and even love within the walls of the castle she helped rebuild.

  Neville Longbottom took in a deep, satisfying breath and looked down at his feet. His new shoes broke up the yellow warning lines at the edge of the platform, but he didn't move back. The pristine brogues made the mottled, old paint on the ground look worse and Neville wondered if he had ever looked better than any place he was before, but he still didn't move. He couldn't.

  It shouldn't be this good. More than any other thought, that was the one that kept drifting to the forefront of Hermione's mind. The sentence lit up behind her eyes like a blinking neon sign and washed out all the other noise in a scream of day-glow pink.

  He gave her the peppermint because of her toothpaste: muggle, minty, aromatic in a way that magical cleansing charms couldn't quite achieve. He never noticed it when they were in school, never got close enough to breathe the same air. But when she'd visited him in the Hogwarts greenhouses, several years later, closer to thirty than to twenty, she'd leaned over his shoulder, watching as he harvested dittany for her healing potions. A crop blight meant supply shortages at St. Mungo's, and being the extraordinary healer and problem solver that she was, she'd sought him out to assist.The mint surprised him, so he said something. Perfume? he'd asked.Her cheeks colored as she leaned away. Toothpaste, she'd said. A Muggle habit.
