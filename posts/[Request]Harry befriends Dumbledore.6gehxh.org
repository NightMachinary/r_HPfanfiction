  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
