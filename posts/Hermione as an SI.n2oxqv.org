I've had this idea... for awhile. I've written in a million times in my head, but I can't seem to get it to translate to paper.

An SI from our word is, for lack of a better term, inserted INTO Hermione at some point during the series and uses their knowledge to "fix" the series...

Are there any stories out there like this?


** Only one I've seen linkao3(Granger Chronicles). Can't actually recc it though.

  Granger?I knew that name. Why did I know that name?It really DID sound fami-... Oh.A mop of bushy, untameable hair. Books, everywhere one looked. The obvious lack of other interests.Oh, wonderful.I had always thought her a very flat character, with no more use than being the personal library and research assistant of her friends, and what I had seen of her life ‘till now emphasized that conviction.Bloody. Hell. I was Hermione fucking Granger.EDIT: Editing the story with more paragraphs for better legibility. So don't be surprised if you suddenly encounter a wall of text. ^_^°

** Truthfully there is a relative dearth of Hermione as a SI fics out there. Mostly because the character herself is already a JK Rowling self-insert. She is actually almost never used as a self insert from a fanfiction perspective with any quality writing.

** Look, I really hate it when people do this to me, it's condescending as fuck because no shit I already tried it before coming here and making a request, but did you seriously not find any fics when googling "Hermione SI fics"? Because word for word I put that into google and found plenty of recommendation threads for just this on the first page result.

Here is literally the first result; [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iooa3s/a_collection_of_oc_or_si_hermione_stories/]]

*** You're right I didn't, but could you be any more rude? There was no reason to reply that way. I was under the impression that unless it broke a rule I could post about it. Basically whatever the fuck I want.

And for your information, not that I need to justify anything to you, I wanted other peoples favorites. I like to read fics that other people love... to hear their reasons why it's their fav...

Be kind to ppl, man. It comes back on you when you don't.

**** The thread they linked isn't even for what you were asking for... since it's pairing Hermione with an OC or SI not as one.

I don't read a lot of hermione stories... but I'll check a let you know if I've read any good ones.
