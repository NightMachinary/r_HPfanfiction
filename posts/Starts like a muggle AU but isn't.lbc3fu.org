:END:
I only read the first chapter so I don't have much but it seemed like a typical muggle AU with Ron and Harry being MI5 agents and meeting Doctor Granger, who is said to have disappeared for 8 years in "traumatic captive". She is, obviously, a witch. I can't remember anything else

#+begin_quote
  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
