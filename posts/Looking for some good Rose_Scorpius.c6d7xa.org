This ship used to be my die-hard fave when I first started reading and I've just fallen back in love with it.

Any new fics you're loving? Preferably post-Hogwarts with some amazing dialogue. Complete fics and unfinished are welcome!


** Of course, linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox), there is nothing better in this department. linkffn(4403088;4412606) is (close? distant? not sure) second.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Pieces Universe. Two friends. Two families. One question. One fight. Three years of separation. When Rose and Scorpius are thrown together again, can they figure out what went wrong before it's too late to regain what they lost? And is that really what they want?

  Pieces Universe. It's been three years since Scorpius last saw Rose Weasley. When their jobs at the Ministry suddenly throw them into one another's paths again, will they be able to overcome their differences before it's too late? Companion to Among Thorns.
