Say a wizarding photo gets taken as someone gets killed and is forever acting out that sceane. Would someone then looking at the picture now be able to see them? Or a muggleborn watches a video on the news or online. Maybe the inherent magic in the photo would have difference. Just a thought. What do you think?


** I am feeling like it has to be in person because its less "real" on a screen or in a photo, than it is in real life. It doesn't have the same impact on someones psyche, and with how magic and the soul interact... it feels like seeing it "first hand" would be how it would work.

** I'd say no. There is a difference between seeing a /depiction/ or /recreation/ of death and actually /seeing death/. Don't really think there is a loophole.

*** The issue is, for many people, things are less real until they're actually ON tv. I read interviews about the cuban missile crisis where people said they hadn't been worried until jfk's speech, I believe. Been a decade plus since i read the paper.

**** I'm arguing that actually seeing a death in person and processing it has magical weight that representations of it don't.

Like, I've watched a lot of hunting shows growing up, but seeing my dad shoot a deer the first time he took me out to the deerstand (when I was... 5-ish?) had a weight to it none of the shows did. And that was nothing compared to my first deer.

** I think its more along the lines of needing to actually be in the presence of Death

** I think via a tv perhaps. Via a magical photo that cycles, less likely. I think, though, it would mainly require seeing it in person and understanding the death.

** I think that the completely invisible Death is what you have to witness, even if you don't see it for you to be able to see Thestrals. And Death probably doesn't get caught on photograph.
