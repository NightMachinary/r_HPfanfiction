** Oh man, I LOVE wolfstar and I have so many amazing recs for you! For long fics, these are some of my favorites:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivor's Guilt]] - this is a series of three (almost) canon-compliant remus/sirius fics with PoA and the years before that told from both of their POVs. Then after Remus realizes Sirius is innocent, the final fic in the series is of the summer they spend hiding together in the Caribbean. I really like fics that re-write events from canon in another character's POV and bring to it a whole other layer of complexity and depth - which this series does expertly. The only negatives for these is that they are pretty depressing - given the subject matter it isn't surprising but still - and that there is NEVER a mention of lube. Seems a little suspect to me, but I am not a gay guy so I will let it slide. This series is a definite favorite!

- [[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/3156196.html][It Was Only a Kiss]]- This 7th year "get-together" story for Remus and Sirius is one of the best - it is pretty much perfect with the dynamic of the Marauders, the angst of exploring their feelings for one another and the dialogue is amazing. The fic starts off with Sirius and Remus getting drunk and talking about what it would be like to kiss another guy and then just spirals from there.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] - This fic is so so good if you love fluff. Of gosh this is so good. It isn't plotty or action packed, but it is a really sweet and fluffy glimpse into how Sirius and Remus got together during 7th year. This author writes the Marauders SO well - I really recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1461919/freudian-fuckup][all of her(?) stuff]]. There are a few one-shots with James/Sirius in particular that are unusual and cool. I also liked "I Know" because it is a rarely seen relationship between Sirius and Remus, where Sirius is kinda just using him.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1145357/chapters/2318859][Teenaged Kicks]] - A really sweet and well-written sirius/remus where sirius finally tells remus how he feels on the train on the way home from 7th year. They start a romance right as Remus is going to join a werewolf pack for the Order. Their relationship is so cute and well-balanced, I LOVE how sirius was such a man-whore at hogwarts and remus was such a prude, but now that they are together, it is sirius who is the shy one. The biggest downside to this story is that it is not complete, even though it is listed as complete! It ends at a place that could be the ending, but really there is a lot more story to tell and the author did actually update really recently.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] - Maaaaybe my favorite Remus/Sirius of all, but I usually don't list it because it is a non-magical, modern AU and that is so far from HP it is barely fanfic imo. But this fic is SO SO GOOD. You will be grinning the whole time while you read it I promise because it is that great. It is super dialogue heavy (through the plot device of the texts) which is what made this fic so addicting. This is the perfect fic IMO to read after a breakup because it is so sweet and heartwarming and you will be so happy for the characters that it is hard to be sad yourself.

For shorter ones, check out these:

- [[http://wolfstarwarehouse.tumblr.com/post/98382218214/being-an-historical-record-etc][A Historical Record...]] - a cute get-together fic with a truth or dare game. Includes maybe the best James and Sirius convo in all of fic. Then the sequel to that [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120127055512/http://www.moonpants.org/txt/darkness.html][I See a Darkness]] is also really good but really different. Because it is by and large canon-compliant, it is gritty and sad.

- [[http://rs-games.dreamwidth.org/82564.html][Riding the Rails]] - I wouldn't have guessed that a non-magical AU about the Great Depression could be one of my favorite RL/SB until i read this. The writing is so so good. This is a must read for sure. The only problem is that this wasn't longer.

- [[http://rosie-writes.livejournal.com/1468.html][Bring me a boat]] - In this fic Remus does not believe that Sirius killed Peter or betrayed James and Lily. He doesn't have it figured out everything that happened, but he knows Sirius didn't do it and goes on an epic journey (a lot of it on foot) to break Sirius out of Azkaban and convince the world that he didn't do it. Not only was this so well written, but it is pretty much the ultimate fan service because this is the AU that everyone wishes really happened.

*** So, so many thanks for the recs (I think I also thanked you not too long ago for a bunch of Harry/Draco recs as well). I've been wanting to get into this ship for a while now and just didn't know where to jump in.

**** I think "Very Bad Things" and "It was only a kiss" are great fics to start with if you're new to the ship.

  The Marauders wind up playing Truth or Dare a lot. Remus Lupin has a strategy. RL/SB fluff.
