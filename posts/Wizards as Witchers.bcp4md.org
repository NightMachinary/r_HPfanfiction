So, I was thinking about how Hogwarts is supposed to be the premiere school of magic, and was feeling wistful about the Witcher series. (Witchers are orphans taken in by sorcerers and subjected to a wide array of trails and mutilations to create a superhuman, a monster to fight monsters.)

What if wizards were trained to become witcher-esque figures in the muggle world, I imagine the would be extremely valuable to the army. So the wizards are properly integrated into the muggle world.


** Magic as a whole would be extremely useful for the army. Cooling/warming charms, ammunition duplication, impervious charm, imperius curse, and that's just off the top of my head. A single wizard could easily be an overwhelming advantage in a single troop. There isn't really any need for training beyond the general Hogwarts.

Food and water duplication as well. You can't make food from nothing, but you can duplicate it. Let's just talk about that. Something from nothing or at least getting something without the hassle. That saves a massive amount of money on nuclear power plants as fission is expensive to get materials for. Dealing with those materials is an issue to. Duplication/Vanishing charms take care of that.

In fact, I would be highly, highly amazed if the HP universe already wasn't having magic manipulated by the governments. It would take a lot of apologetics to get around the reality of magic being discovered. It only takes one person going to the government for the entire secret to be out. You can obliviate a few people sure, but you can't obliviate computers and thousands of people you don't even know the names or location of.

*** Where do you think Voldemort would fit into this?

Would there be blood prejudice if wizards were trained to adapt and integrate into the muggle world?

I suppose those are questions to think about if anyone wanted to write such a story.

**** Depends like all things do. If it had happened hundreds of years ago, then it isn't as likely. Voldemort's childhood would gave been totally different which would lead to a totally different person. This hypothetical Voldemort has less in common with Voldemort than Sally-Anne has with Voldemort.
