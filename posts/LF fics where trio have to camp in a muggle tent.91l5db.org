Possibly something set in DH where the trio don't have the Perkin's Tent.


** Every fic that makes them whine about living in a magic tent with a bathroom and real beds and working kitchen makes me eyeroll hard. It's like hearing someone whine about roughing it in a fully equipped camper.

*** It's believable to me coming from purebloods like Ron. Unlike Muggleborn they just don't know that it could be much worse.

The 'travelling together as a couple' aspect of this fic is one of its better themes/subplots/whatever one would call it

*** Why not?

Also, why link a YouTube video for a GIF?

People downvote others way too much on this sub just from a request. ðŸ™„
