I really enjoyed this fic. I liked how the it was mostly non trope filled and was subtle about it. I think the worst there was was the phrase "taking control of my life" and overall, it was great. The training outside of the usual "harry trained for a couple hours and now is really good" sort of summery you usually get helped me to like it also. It is a shame that there was no sequel or anything that I've found or a completed remake that has a complete sequel. What I'm asking for is a few things really:

1) Good honks romance sort of thing, (Have already read a fair few honks and have never been able to get into the R series)

2) similar fics to those like summer of change (have read unspeakable things which I thoroughly enjoyed)

3) Some light hearted fics where most conflicts don't span too many chapters and aren't entirely soul crushing to read.


** Ooh I've always loved that fic! I can't pledge to fics with similarities, but you should check out the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/null/48832][Harry/Tonks Community]] on ffn.

**** I started out only using ffn, and am still getting used to ao3, so the whole tag system is actually very confusing for me.

  So this is a completely different AU, short thing something.Honks story. Lily and James flee to America, while Lily is pregnant with Harry, who then grows up in the States. Ilvermorny and becomes an Auror. He keeps feeling outside of the norm because he has copied his parents accent getting called the British kid.He ends up too good at being an Auror, because James and Lily are training Harry in case Voldemort comes after them. He doesn't and dies without the Potters.Harry has a confrontation with his boss which gets him fired, so he decides to go to Britain instead to help rebuilt a war-torn country. Sirius is still alive in this timeline. Let's go!

** I'm constantly amazed that people still like this fic. On a list of fics that have aged the worst, this is surely close to the top. And it already felt ancient when I first read it ages ago. Then again, it does explain when the Harry/Tonks pairing is so subpar when so many fics just try to copy this one.

*** I am not saying it aged well but bashing an entire pairing based on one story seems unfair. I am not saying that a lot of them don't follow the same idea.

It makes logical sense for a story between Harry and Tonks to start when they meet in canon.

I understand that to many people it is a problem with the age gap. I completely get that. Most stories with this pairing have that hurdle to overcome.

I personally like the pairing because their mental and maturity levels seem to be about the same. Sometimes Tonks even seems to be younger than Harry in canon.

I am not saying she actually is but that is the way she comes across.

Tonks brings a sense of playfulness and fun and expression of joy to life and Harry brings a seriousness and maturity beyond his years which "needs" saving and Tonks would see it as a challenge to do that. Tonks would want to bring joy to him and Harry would likely be attracted to her because she can bring him joy.
