I'm looking for stories where Harry buys/finds/is given some thing or multiple things that he actually uses. Like the Mr. Black stories. I hate when he buys all this amazing magical gadgetry and never uses any of it. I want some really cool stuff that actually gets used. I don't know if there are stories like this out there but thanks in advance for any and all help.


** Am I bad person for just wanting to post "hahahahahaha" and nothing else?

It will be hard to find anything like that. The good fics don't usually bother with a Diagon Alley scene, and the bad fics don't bother with setup.

This is why the response to this was rather lacking: A good fic fitting your criteria might not even exist.

** These are both classic fics but Linkffn(harry the Hufflepuff), linkffn(Harry potter and the methods of rationality)

Harry the Hufflepuff has harry making liberal use of what he has been given (and remembering he has said items). Harry even takes to carrying everything he owns on his person just in case.

Harry potter and the methods of rationality has several Chekov's not-guns in items that harry buys or is given including a pet rock.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** linkffn(Holly Evans)

The flute is used again in 3rd year to inspire the creation of a school radio station, which later narrates the Tournament tasks. An apology letter to the Flamels returns a guide to memory spells, which later is discovered to be a portable pensieve, used in several later scenes. Jade poison-detection rings provide several opportune evasions of tainted food. A letter from Lily leads to a special hideout that provides setting for later trouble. Let's not even discuss the thematic importance of ice cream.

I love weaving little details in to bring them up later.
