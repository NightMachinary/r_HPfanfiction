What are your favorite/the best marauder era fics? I'm not looking for time travel works, more just the marauders and Lily at school and up to the end of the first war. I usually prefer longer fics and canon-compliant fics, but I'm down for whatever, really.


** Floreat Castellum has the best marauder era fic that I've read, but it's unfinished and on semi-permanent hiatus.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.
