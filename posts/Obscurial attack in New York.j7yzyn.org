I was just watching Fantastic Beasts, and I had this thought that wizards were very lucky that the attacked happened in the 1940s. A time where information took time to travel.

If the incident had happened from the 2010 and onwards, the Wizarding community would be pretty much exposed and they would be war.


** Fantastic Beasts also had a rainstorm-wide obliviation, and mass obliviation or confunding changing the muggle records of the incident. In the books there was a giant attack and a destroyed bridge. There was satellite imagery back then. There were witnesses. The government had no idea the bridge didn't collapse or that it was a giant as opposed to the story of a hurricane.

It's pretty clear that there are ways to wipe electronic and paper records of incidents. I would say that exposure is not guaranteed, especially since the muggle governments are controlled by wizards.

  “Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen...It's not a very good time for me...I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see...from the President of ---” “That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that. “But I really was rather hoping to speak ---” “We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.” “I...oh...very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes, I'll see Fudge.”

Even in the unlikely scenario where wizards are exposed, there will certainly not be war. Not when the wizards control the muggle government to such an extent.

#+end_quote

the rainstorm-wide obliviation worked perfectly in that situation because at that time, only people in New York, mostly the ones who were present during Credence's attack, saw magic first hand and realised wizards are a thing.

If the information had travelled to other states, then they couldn't do anything to stop it.

If it had happened today, in which social media is widely in use, the statue of secrecy would be broken.

Saellites are not always hovering 24/7 over a city to record what's happening.

It's clear that wizards can alter newspapers, not that they can affect the internet.

They work together, and how is the government gonna stop a viral video of an obscurial attack in New York?

  It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge's visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy

  “Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We're importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it's down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we're bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.” “I --- what --- dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.

  “I'm very sorry,” he said finally. “If there's anything I can do?” “It's very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing.

  “Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can't just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me ---” “I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour coldly. “I am --- that's to say, I was ---” “Then there's no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour. “I...well, as long as Shacklebolt's work continues to be...er...excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.

They really do work together. I guess it's kind of like a working relationship, as in one entity tells the other what to do like a parent might tell a child.

Your thinking revolves around a single warrant which is that modern social media results in the sharing of information faster than it is possible for wizards to deal with and that you cannot change computer records using magic.

But it's pretty clear you can. Now, in 1996, the likelyhood that there /is/ a satellite taking images of Britain are fairly high. In the 2000s, wizards still haven't been revealed and there is no chance that satellites have not taken images of dragons or giants. In 1996, security cameras had already been implemented and were being used widely. The government had access to that footage. The government had no idea that it was a giant attack. And the government regulates access to security footage, it is not regulated by another entity like a user of social media would be. In 1996, information spread quickly. Perhaps it didn't spread fast enough that it would get around to the general public (though it probably would have). But the fact that it didn't get to the government and that modern day imaging has not detected giants or dragons makes it clear that wizards can deal with electronic records.

Even in an AU where electronic records cannot be wiped, social media can still be controlled by wizards. They just have to do the oversight by controlling the muggles in charge of social media.

On what basis. You are saying it does but not providing any evidence to back up your claim!

Do you even know when the UK launched it's first imaging satellite? Since it was mainly relying upon the US for such satellite and it only had communication ones in orbit in the 1990s and 80s. And yet again, your assuming.

You said Wizards control the muggle government, if that's the case then they could easily see via CCTV footage but the muggle government would cover it up.

You can wipe information from one electronic device, but you can't wipe information from the whole internet. The internet is a group of computers connected together, to remove a viral video you would need to simultaneously wipe from all computers.

And yet again, you're assuming the muggles control social media corporations when most of them don't even know what the internet is. When it is shown that they are mostly involved with the government only.

Here's a cool site where you can see imaging of Britain from 1996.

I've explained the conceptual nature of magic in a separate comment and how. Remember that magic is limited by internal rules, not physical laws. The size of the internet is no obstacle. You can with a single spell, hide a secret from everyone in someone's soul, create shooting stars, and set up a surveillance system that tracks the usage of a word.

#+end_quote

I'm unsure what point you're trying to make here. My point was that the muggle government would have seen the CCTV footage if it hadn't been wiped. The muggle government could cover it up for the wizard, yes, but that would require knowledge that it was a giant attack. And again, they had no knowledge.

Actually, I am assuming that most muggles know what the internet is. Most wizard wouldn't, however. But the wizards who deal with muggles do. Kingsley fit in perfectly as a muggle worker. There's a bureau dealing with misinforming muggles. And before you bring up Arthur as a counterargument, Arthur has no need to actually know what muggles do. All he needs to know is if something is a muggle object and whether it's been enchanted.

Magic is conceptual and overrides the mundane (scale of internet is no factor) --> muggle footage of magical events does not exist --> wizards can manipulate the internet. And really, when you can teleport and time travel, this isn't anything that special.

*** /Rainstorm/ being the key. You want them to try that somewhere where it hardly ever rains? Dubai, for example, where they now make it rain by artificial means.

Newspapers, yes, the Internet, no. We know that once something's on the internet, it's out there, somewhere, forever. And the server that has the data on it can be on the other side of the world from where it was first created, and gets there in a fraction of a second.

The only way the wizards could Obliviate the Internet would be to erase *all of it,* to make sure they got rid of what they wanted. And Muggles would notice if the entire Internet stopped working.

I recommend reading chapters 20 and 21 of Annals of Arithmancy by White Squirrel, in which Hermione gets basically put on trial by the ICW for writing a paper explaining that the Statute of Secrecy *will* fail, eventually.

**** I'd recommend studying how magic works in the books. It's conceptual. You can track every usage of a word anywhere because it's a taboo. You can hide a secret in one soul from the entire world. You can confund someone and you can confund an object. Magic overrules the mundane, per word of god. It won't be out there anymore when magic changes the nature of the world. This isn't Dresden, where magic is subject to the laws of physics.

Also, and I cannot stress this enough: *The rainstorm which you cite as key was literally brought about by a magical bird which changed the nature of the water in that rainstorm to have obliviatory powers. So yeah they could try that where it doesn't rain.*

So yeah, given that we know from JKR that muggles and wizards will never re-unite and that muggles have not discovered magic in the 2000s, wizards definitely have a way to wipe records from the internet.

I would not cite fanfiction for a discussion on canon.

And we can't really compare the 2000s to 2012 onwards. The internet is easily accessible and everyone has an electronic device that can capture high resolution pictures
