In case of successful torture for the prisoner the positive consequence of not getting tortured anymore outweigh the negative consequence of telling the secret. He thus willingly betrays the secret even though he would have been unwilling otherwise.

Like, where would you draw the boundary between willing and unwilling?

Imagine the following situation: The secret under Fidelius is some kind of powerful legendary weapon. Alice wants the weapon, Bob is the secret keeper and he normally wouldn't give it to her. However, in our case Bob is willing to give up the secret because:

1. Without the weapon Alice couldn't save Bob from a dragon that will otherwise definitively eat him.

2. Without the weapon Alice is unwilling to risk fighting the dragon even though she probably could to it without it.

3. Without the weapon Alice won't save Bob from the dragon even though she definitively could.

4. Without the weapon Alice couldn't save Bob and he'll definitively will get eaten, but Alice was the one let it loose in the first place for that very purpose.

5. Without the weapon Alice is unwilling to risk fighting the dragon even though she probably could to it without it, and she was the one who let it loose.

6. Without the weapon Alice won't save Bob from the dragon even though she definitively could, and she was the one who let it loose.

7. Without the weapon Alice will let the dragon loose to eat him.

I'd say that in (1.) the information was definitively given willingly and in (7.) definitively under duress and thus by your definition unwillingly. However, there isn't really any hard boundary between those two extremes because in the end in every case Bob always considers his survival to be worth more than keeping the weapon to himself.

#+end_quote

That is absolutely false and not how anyone defines what "willing" means. It refers to whether or not they performed some action under their own free will, that is, without coercion by some other person to force some act independent of what that person wanted otherwise. This is just a basic legal understanding, but even in colloquial speech this is how the term is used. No one sees a person who has another person pointing their gun at their head and says "The victim is acting completely under their own will" (although in law, duress does not allow one to act with impugnity). They would say that person is being coerced, they are not acting freely. Torture is of this sort but at the furthest extreme, it's pyschological harm or direct physical damage being done. People are unable to weigh consequences at that point as you mention in your definition of "willing", at that point they are just having snap reactions in an attempt to stop the pain, i.e. coerced.

It's pretty clear things go awry at 4. 3. is bad but it's not Alice directly doing some coercive action, so while it may be immoral it's not as immoral. And I think anyone looking for hard boundaries is usually missing the point anyway. Your definition of willingness doesn't make sense.

************** From a legal point of view the only difference between persuasion and coercion is that the latter is a form of persuasion that breaks the law.

If some big company legally buys up someone's debt and then legally uses it to put pressure on him until he is willing to sell his house to them that's not considered coercion even though pretty much everyone would agree that it's a shitty and morally wrong thing to do.

Unless you're suggesting the Fidelius can distinguish between moral and immoral actions, or read British Wizzarding Law, there is no way it could distinguish between persuasion and coercion.

And like, what if Bob really doesn't care that much about the weapon anyway (because to him it was mostly a collector's piece) and definitively isn't willing to die for it, do you really think the Fidelius would force him to die for the secret, even though he'd happily give it up to save his life?

*************** The colloquial understanding of persuasion is a non threatening attempt to convince someone of something. How you can compare this to coercion, where the threat or the act itself are definitionally present, is beyond me. This would be like credulously arguing "Legally speaking, the only difference between a legal action and an illegal one is that illegal actions are acts you can be punished for. Why does anyone think illegals acts are against the law?"

The example you gave is considered coercion. Whether or not that specific kind of coercion is illegal seems relevant. A buff guy can coerce people into walking away by getting up in their face, but that alone probably isn't going to get him into a courtroom. Torture is usually illegal for an obvious reason (ignoring its own apparent inefficacy): We don't want to government capturing people and using direct violence because those people haven't been put into a court of law, where good evidence is required as opposed to the tortured person saying anything to make the pain stop.

Take a real world example, Guantanamo Bay. Lots of torture used, with some individual people being tortured literally hundreds of times (Khalid Muhammed). Not only did he not succumb to it, but the information we did get turned out to be false. Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks on 9/11 despite some tortured people saying it. It even turned out that a substantial number of people there were innocent of even being in any terrorist group at all, because the government got these people directly from the hands of repressive Middle Eastern governments who were asked by the U.S. to be given Al Qaeda. Of course they ended up just handing over their political opponents. So we invaded a country that didn't attack us, with many innocent people tortured by the state, with the justification from coerced people... Like this is a textbook example of why torture is dumb. It's coercing people into saying whatever they think their captor wants to hear.

We know the Fidelius won't count the Secret as being given unless the Keeper willingly gives it up without duress being the cause. JKR says this on Pottermore, Cruciatus (hint hint, the Torture Curse) and the Imperius will completely fail to yield the secret from it's Keeper. So yes, the charm can tell if one has spoken freely or not.

I don't see how your example prevents Bob from willingly giving it up to someone who isn't coercing him. And even when coerced, he can say the information but it won't count as giving the secret. The magic only counts it if he chooses to and the person isn't making overt or obvious threats to force it out.

However, if the charm was able to tell the difference between a morally and an immorally given secret then Pettigrew would have never been able to betray the Potters.

The charm obviously doesn't know right from wrong and since by your definition the difference between coercion and persuasion is that one is morally wrong it thus has no basis to tell them apart either.

I always saw JKR's quote as a matter of the secret keeper needing to have a clear mind to give on the secret.

That way if someone currently is or very recently was under cruciatus he can't give on the secret because at that moment his judgment is clouded by the pain, however if he is left to recover and then decides the secret isn't worth getting tortured again it would be his own free will, even if the torturer was using illegal and immoral means to influence that opinion.

Yes coercion is immoral but what distinguishes coercion is the use of threats and violence to change the mind or the action. These terms are not defined morally, even if they happen to be possibly moral in one case and definitely immoral in the other.

I didn't say or imply the charm can tell moral acts from immoral ones, what it does -both according to the books and the author - is tell if the person willingly gave up the secret or performed an act that imply's willingness.

I mean let's just clear this up and quote JKR directly:

#+begin_quote
  The Fidelius Charm is not without its weaknesses. If the Secret Keeper wishes to do so, they may divulge the information at any time (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily). [...] In spite of the fact that the secret can only be given up voluntarily, many have been subjected to the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in an effort to make them share their information.

But the only distinction between a threat and an offer is defined morally. It's completely based upon the idea of what kind of behavior is considered normal and morally acceptable.

If Voldemort tries to torture some Fidelius secret out of you, that's definitively coercion, and thus you couldn't betray the secret, right?

Well, not exactly. For example Voldemort could argue that might makes right and since Voldemort is more powerful and you can't defend yourself it's only natural for him to torture you. Thus, he's not actually coercing you, he is just offering you the privilege of not being tortured anymore (despite being weaker) against the secret in a mutually beneficial business transaction.

Sounds fucked up? Well it is, but the chain of reasoning is completely valid unless you manage to refute "might makes right" at it's core and I seriously doubt a simple charm is smart enough to solve complex ethical dilemmas like that.

Besides, your quote doesn't contradict my interpretation and at no point states that the secret keeper cannot be coerced by any means.

That is literally a threat. All you're doing is saying Voldemort believes he has a justification for threatening a Secret Keeper. That doesn't make it not a threat, what are you talking about? It has nothing to do with solving an ethical dilemma because the charm isn't checking "Is this person good/doing a moral act?" It's checking "Did the keeper give the information voluntarily, i.e. not with the threat or use of force or violence, to the recipient?" None of this is relevant.

And yes, it did contradict what you said. Rowling said that the secret must be given entirely voluntarily, not as a result of removing free will or because of bodily harm.

******************** Someone lent you money. You signed a contract to pay it back within a month with your car as mortgage. Now the month is over but you can't pay him back. However, for a concession he is willing to wait another month.

Depending on your perspective you might argue that this person is threatening to take your car unless you do what he wants, or you might argue that it's not a threat since you agreed to this very thing a month back and that he is merely offering you a deal to extend your debt if you do something in return.

Threat is "If you do this I'll not do something bad", offer is "If you do this I'll do something good", however the difference between "doing something good" and "not doing something bad" can be fluid.

Remember my dragon example (4.)? Going by your Oxford definition that would not be a threat. Alice might have set the dragon loose on Bob, but she is not stating any intentions to hurt him unless he gives her the secret, she is just telling him she won't be able to save him without it.

I still think you're using a very loose definition of free will. Free will just means that your mind isn't influenced by any drugs, spells or other form of direct control, not that you necessarily have to like the decision you end up making.

If someone offers you money to tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's obviously a decision made in free will. You simply decide that the money is worth more than keeping the secret.

If someone offers you to save your kids from a third party if you tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's also free will. The situation is quite a bit more shitty but no one is affecting your mind and if you decide the secret is worth more than the lives of your kids that's your own decision.

If someone offers you to save your kids from a threat that he himself created if you tell the secret and you decide to accept, that's still free will. In this case you're clearly being blackmailed but just because you don't like the options you're being given doesn't mean the choice between those options is any less of your free will.
