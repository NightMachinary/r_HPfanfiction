I've read a few Slytherin Hermione fics and usually she's either pretending to be a half blood or the Slytherin's just accept her immediately because the sorting hat knows what it's doing.

Is there one where she's initially persona non grata but she's so awesome that a few break rank and sit with her, then slowly she's the defacto leader of Slytherin house?


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, demonologist)

While she doesn't pretend to be half/pure blood, she doesn't boast about being Muggleborn either. It eventually comes out though, and the few friends she'd made then ditch her.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete - updates with a new chapter every Tuesday.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
