***** More important question, was it 9 pin bowling in the British version? I'll have to check, but I'm pretty sure it was 10 pin in the American edition I read back in the day.

****** I don't have a British version to check, but the only relation between "dumbledore" and "ninepin bowling" that Google can find is a single tumblr blog that posted some HP chapters and has "ninepin bowling" instead of "ten-pin bowling". I believe that if the British version did say "ninepin bowling" then there would be some more evidence of that online.

***** *Nine-pin bowling*

Nine-pin bowling (also known as ninepin bowling, nine-pins, 9-pins, kegel, etc.) is a bowling game played primarily in Europe. European championships are held each year. Over 90,000 members are on teams in Germany, often playing in officially registered Bundeskegelbahnen (association bowling alleys) to be found in almost every sizable town. In Europe overall, there are some 130,000 players.
