I'm looking for fanfic recommendations about Draco Malfoy/ Self insert or /Original Character (even /hermione) where we get more of him just being a student in school. I wish we got more of student Draco, but I'd love to read something where we get to see his perspective with live potions, in class, at the dance. Just Draco being him at school with a lil romance you know? I'm a sucker for enemies to lovers as well, but any recommendations are appreciated.
