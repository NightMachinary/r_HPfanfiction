This part happening rather close to the beginning of the story, while he was still at Privet Drive.

Read it a long time ago, pretty certain he wasn't the only one to do so in the story. Remember something about undoing damage that being underfed and neglected did to his body.

I specifically know it wasn't slash, have a feeling it was Harry/ (more than one female)

Also certain that timetravel wasn't involved, and it wasn't a crossover. Pretty certain (about 85% or so) that there were definitely adult themes present


** Could it possibly be A Cadmean Victory? I never finished it the two times I tried to read it, so I'm not entirely sure.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** How did he learn that? Did he obtain the memories fro the horcrux? Does he have memories from his dad? His mother in his mind? Trunk in the attic? Is it a crossover?

So many possibilities... I'll link a crossover since I'm in the mood for some Stargate right now.

***** I gotta disagree. While i dislike these stories most of the time, this story, and others by him give off the impression that it knows how op he makes harry, but rolls with it anyway. I read from him when i'm in the mood for a curbstomp harry, and I don't want to think too much about it. I mean I might have forgotten, but for those of us who aren't strict about how we see harry potter we can enjoy the story. Yes it makes him OP, and yes it makes everyone else look inept, but at least I am not going into reading this, and expecting a good story. I'm just looking for mindless fun.

****** I certainly like some of the ideas and I can get lost in technobabble easily but the first two chapters alone made me want to kill myself with how he would refer to Harry in a different way every few sentences completely unnecessarily. That and there is almost no dialog at all in this story.

******* I will say this much with most of his storys they in some ways improve, and get bad the further in you get, but it's worth a read if you got nothing else to read, and want a wish-fullfillment type of story.

Trust me he could definetly improve on it majorly, but it's just his style, and a lot of people enjoy that.

*** I'm not entirely certain on how he learned to do it, but I do know it wasn't memories from a horcrux, or someone else in his head; I haven't read many of those. I do know it wasn't a crossover, especially of the stargate variety, I have never read any of them.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
