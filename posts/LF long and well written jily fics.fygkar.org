** So these are probably the most common ones in existence, but just in case:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]]
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9233100/1/White-Flags]]

And this author writes a whole lot of James/Lily, but mostly wild AU's. Very well done though: [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cgner/pseuds/cgner]] (I like the way she characterizes James Potter's mum).

*** cgner, ghostofbambi, and beedaily all write and cooperate on similar stories if OP ends up liking cgner's work.

  Potter was going to say that he wasn't my boyfriend. I couldn't let him do that. For the love of Merlin, I could not let him do that. I had to stop him. He couldn't tell her the truth. So I did the only conceivable thing I could think of. I kissed him.

** I know this is thread is a tad old now, but Voyeur by scriibble is one the best Jily fics I've ever read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13607592/1/Voyeur]] It is rated M, though. But it's brill.
