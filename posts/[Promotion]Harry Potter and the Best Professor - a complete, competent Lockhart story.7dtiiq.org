** This was a very sad story! Why did you kill all of the kids? Also yes you said Lockhart was competent but that is a lie because he did nothing and died? I don't understand why you made a fake story, please explain.

*** ...That fellow HeyThereSexyBoy is, quite simply, a troll. He gets a giggle out of momentarily tricking HP fans into thinking they've found a new interesting story only to find out the story's terrible.

** ok first of all how did Lockhart find the chamber, let alone release the basilisk? Did he find tom's diary? or was it a more proactive tom, after finding about harry from Lockhart?

Now that i think about it any other fics where tom posses Lockhart or someone else?
