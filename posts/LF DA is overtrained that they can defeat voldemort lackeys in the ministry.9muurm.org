Any fic with this premise?


** ...Huh, are there any 'Harry Potter the RPG' fanfics that do just that? The DA group grind their levels and skills up to the point that they can one-shot the Death Eaters at the end of the year?

Not the same premise you're looking for, but its very similar. Harry trains the DA using military tactics, where they are more of a force than the Aurors.
