It was a fic where lily & the marauders read a book full of fic about them plus some chapters from the books that mention them. It's been deleted from fictionhunt but I'm hoping somebody's saved it, because I used to reread it all the time. Thanks in advance.

  When Dumbledore drops a book on the floor, the proper thing to do is return it. But what if the person on the book looks vaguely familiar? James, Sirius, Remus and Lily read the first of the Harry Potters books in a hilarious twist of fate.(Originally posted on fanfiction.net)

*** Not this, but thank you. It was actually called The Marauders Companion, and Sirius found it in the library.
