I was just reading a few Haphne fics recently (and also some Harry/Pansy or indy!Harry) and I see the concept of being neutral so glorified but I think it's one of the most humiliating positions to be in. Basically you are too weak or scared to fight for something in the war.

For instance the Blacks were neutral, whom despite agreeing with Voldemort, ran away at the first sign that he was an unstable psychopath. Those people they talk about on Potterwatch that claim that it should be "wizards first" are also neutral. All the Ministry workers that allowed themselves to be flushed down the toilet by Voldemort's people were also neutral. Goblins tried to stay neutral and it worked out so well for them...

Anyways I was just ranting about the whole idea of glorifying being neutral. First, as a neutral party you just stand idle to atrocities going on around you and secondly, it's impossible to stay neutral because at some point one of the parties will sense your weakness and bully you until you either join them or you fight against them.

The only way a neutral side could really work was if they were somehow more powerful than either side in the war and decided not to get involved, but most of the "neutral" characters are hardly comparable to Dumbledore or Voldemort.

Any thoughts?


** Neutrality could be cowardice, or it could be the only way to survive when titans clash. It's hard to say until you yourself are in the middle of a war.

But that might not be a counterpoint to what you're saying: the Golden Mean fallacy is a fallacy, after all, or maybe it's just bad writing.

******* Absolutely. After all, the "good faction" supports:

•Institutionalized slavery.

•Torturing prisoners.

•A regime where politicians can execute or imprison people without trial.

•Propaganda as the only respected news source.

•Zero accountability with non-magical governments sharing the land.

•Fundamental disregard for the worth of non-magical people and their accomplishments.

•Erasing memories to the point of leaving people drooling shells of themselves for BEING IN THEIR WAY. (Campground manager in GoF). This is beyond offensive. Instead of following THEIR OWN LAWS, the solution is to destroy the psyche of some random person.

Really, the main difference between the two sides is in the approval of "Final Solution" methods. Most of the population just went along with the Death Eater takeover.

** I confess to a certain amount of trolling in this area: when I see a prompt or a request for a "neutral" Harry or generally neutral characters portrayed in good light, I reply with one or more of the following quotes:

- "We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented." --- Elie Wiesel
- "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality." --- Desmond Tutu
- "The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis." --- Dante Alighieri

I don't judge those who are cowed into passivity and are genuinely powerless. The only people not powerless before the likes of Voldemort are Dumbledore and Harry, and for the latter it's only because of prophecy/blood/wandlore; and only a handful of people are not powerless before a well-trained and organised Death Eater militia backed by the power of a Ministry.

But, for the fics that pretend that there is choice and dignity in this position connoted by the word "neutrality" (as opposed to, say, "compliance"), or, worse, that there is virtue in those who are /not/ powerless choosing to be neutral, there can be no mercy.

Someone should write a subversion of the idea, in which neutrality loses. Something along the lines of Harry dating Daphne, becoming proudly neutral, then through a series of conversations with Hermione and others being persuaded otherwise, ultimately dragging Daphne into the fray on the anti-Voldemort side.

** It's mostly about desperately pursuing of a reasonable side in the conflict. Since something like that does not exist in the canon, it would need to be an OC, or a group of them.

But how does the OC fit in with th narrative? We don't want another Enoby, do we!?

*Well, we can pretend they existed the whole time!* But what were they doing? Nothing, pretty much. They had no reason to be involved.

ALright, so why would they get involved now? Well, *maybe our MC has something they want?* (Early Daphne Greengrass shipping to get her little sister Astoria uncursed [long before the Cursed Sequel ever existed]).

*Or maybe, the Neutrals have something the two 'main' sides want!* If they barely managed to preserve their neutrality, and thus their comfortable lives that do not involve bowing down to either Tom Riddle or Albus Dumbledore, via the literal miracle of Boy Who Lived?

Naturally, they want to bolster their forces so that the pushy people would leave them alone, and an orphan with high magic power, but weak connections to anyone else and desperately wanting a family would be the perfect option! The very definition of low risk, high reward investment!

*Or maybe, the Neutral faction does not exist* - but by Merlin they want to. They are like independent representatives in a Parliament that has been dominated by a bi-partisan system for centuries. They have money, sure, but what they need is a unifying force! Representation! A figurehead they could rally around and make sure these pesky tariff laws do not get pushed through!

//////

There are plenty of ways these can come into being but for me, for example, the Neutrals are the answer to the conundrum of having a MC that doesn't just stand there and take it when the universe decides it's time they het shat on from great height, but also not signing up with or whitewashing the "Actually Evil" people of Dark faction.

The option to be selfish, but not evil. Not a Saint, but not a Monster either. To be a person and not the archetype.

  'Grey Jedi' is basically an excuse for someone to make their Mary Sue OC use Light- and Dark-Sided powers without suffering the consequences

My understanding of 'Grey' is that it's not about Light or Dark, it's about following the "Living Force" or indulging in personal freedoms (such as love, emotion, good food, the occasional drink, whatever) instead of the Jedi's strict adherence to its code. Guys like Qui-Gon weren't on the council because they preferred following the way of the Living Force over the Jedi creed.

In the games, "grey Jedi" became staying neutral in the Light / Dark bar, which means you have to juggle Light or Dark decisions. As presented in the movies, it's more like just being yourself and not becoming a robot like the Jedi. If Qui-Gon had lived and trained Anakin, he'd probably have turned out a lot better.

Windu actually pretty handily kicked Sidious' ass. His Vaapad form worked perfectly against him. His downfall came when he decided to finally place his trust in Anakin for the first time, for the last time, at the worst possible moment with regards to Anakin's mental stability and failed to predict Anakin's sudden yet inevitable betrayal.

Windu knew his Vaapad form walked a fine line. He was very leery of teaching it to others because he knew it was so hard to use it safely without falling. The immense self-discipline required was part of why he was such a hardass.

Dumbledore may not kill but he actually says to Voldemort something along the lines of "I must admit that simply killing you wouldn't satisfy me." so he can find worse ways to punish someone than killing them (I know I've been saying this a lot but I always assumed that Dumbledore's intent was not to kill Voldemort but leave him mortal and powerless through Harry's sacrifice).

The reason why people like the Grey!Jedi trope is because the Jedi Code/way especially in the movies is downright stupid.

** Me, I'm okay with people saying their motivations are more personal, fighting for selves or (chosen) family, instead of fighting for an ideal (like "justice" or "freedom" for all), and that seems to be what a lot of "grey" fics seem to aim at depicting, Harry shifting his hero complex from saving the whole world to just focusing on those close to him (typically including Hermione, who by definition is threatened by the pureblood agenda, making them an enemy for him to fight anyways, he's just doing it for her not for everyone, and sometimes will even just abandon Britain instead of dealing with the corrupt Ministry etc).

** The neutral/grey side is for writers who are too edgy for the fanon!light side and want to bash Dumbledore, but are just barely self aware enough to realize that there might be some problems with trying to claim that the fantasy Nazis are actually the good guys. So in practice, they tend to just be the dark side, but with a personal grudge against Voldemort and slightly less racism.

Although in their defense, I think that the neutrality that those fics glorify is almost never neutrality in the war. They might form their own third side to the war, but they do still try to end it. The neutrality really just means that their politics put them somewhere in the middle of the two main sides, which is not necessarily a completely unreasonable position to take. (Though those fics also tend to exaggerate the positions of the other sides so much that they become completely unreasonable.)

**** Politics tend to be more nuanced than good and evil and while many fics don't explore that well.

Being Neutral, if you can, is often a very pragmatic and valid point in a conflict.

The part of if you can is very important, in most fics the author makes it valid by either making the "Neutral" faction strong or influent enough that Voldemort wouldn't want to fight them and the "Ligth" at the same time, or that they simply avoid fighting by bribing him or offering other kind of services(which would make them kind of on his side but not exactly, something /extremely/ common for someone to do if they can)

I mean, in those situations, theoretically, the "Neutral" side, would make it so that no matter who wins, they survive, and while that may be immoral, it's pragmatic and the path of least resistance.

It kinda was, though. Only Harry could end Voldemort for good. If he left Wizarding Britain to fend for itseld, many innocents would die. If Harry truly managed to run away and not feel an ounce of guilt, he'd be a coward. You have to remember the ones really affected by Voldemort weren't the Purebloods, but the Muggleborns.

Harry was much more "innocent" than the pepole of Britian, he had zero choice in the making of the war or his own involvement, that was taken from him before he was even born.

Not really. Dumbledore engineered Harry's survival, not his death.

In book four, after Voldemort's ressurection, Harry catches a glimpse of triumph in Dumbledore's eyes after describing the ritual. That's because Voldemort used Harry's blood, making him a Horcrux of sorts for Harry.

Voldemort wouldn't die without the Scarcrux's destruction, which, unfortunately, could only happen by Harry's death.

Dumbledore couldn't tell Harry he would survive the second killing curse because doing so would prevent the protection Harry's death gave the wizarding world.

Had Harry run away, Voldemort would've remain ruling over Wizarding Britain, killing muggleborns and half-bloods, etc. And he would be doing it forever. No one else could truly defeat Voldemort. Harry's willingness to die can be considered a Power He Knows Not. Voldemort would never consider dying.

Not everyone betrayed Harry. In fact, only the Ministry really did. People didn't believe him when he told them Voldemort was back, but that's hardly a betrayal.

Harry couldn't just abandon his friends, and leave all the innocents behind. It would be a super dick move to say 'Screw them!' when only he could end the war.

Also, let's remember Voldemort would stop at nothing to kill Harry. He would search for him forever.

Being a curse breaker doesn't make Bill an expert Horcrux finder. To destroy a Horcrux he would have to use basilisk venom, or fiendfyre, or a killing curse. The last two are out, he wouldn't cast an Unforgivable, and I don't expect him to know how to control fiendfyre, or even to know how to use it. But maybe he does. Basilisk venom is rare, I think.

As for Harry himself: no, Voldemort isn't omniscient, but he is ruthless and implacable. He stops at nothing to get what he wants, and what he wants is Harry dead. Harry can either fight now, before Voldemort consolidates his power base and likely adds much greater protections to his horcruxes, or he can spend miserable years in hiding and fight a pathetic last action on his own, when Voldemort does eventually find him.

Finally, should or no should, Harry had to handle it. He was the last horcrux. Either he dies or Voldemort wins. There were no other options. Only Dumbledore's manipulations were able to give him the chance to live again afterwards.

I wouldn't begrudge Harry to have left Britain to burn, he wasn't an elected official, nor law enforcement, he received no training, no incentive, after the government tortured him and then barely acknowledged he had all the rights to tell them to fuck off, he only stayed behind because of his friends, his sense of revenge for Voldemort and lastly because it was the "right" thing to do.

I don't think a kid leaving adults to deal with a Dark Lord is cowardice, it's just the adults fault for not dealing with it properly.

You are confusing Canon Dumbledore with Fanon Dumbledore. Canon Dumbledore is more than willing to kill Death Eaters. He even says to Voldemort that merely killing him would not satisfy him, that there were things far worse than death. During Year 5, Dumbledore was under heavy scrutiny, and couldn't just go around breaking laws, and invading Death Eater homes, he'd be arrested on the spot. Year 6 he was busy dying, searching for Horcruxes and being headmaster. He could hardly go around killing Death Eaters. Especially if he didn't know where they were.

Harry believes in the greater good too. There's a quote in canon where Harry says: "This is war! Sometimes you have to do things for the greater good."

No, he only did that after he saw it was the only option, before he expressed several times that he would want to avoid this whole "Chosen One" thing, since it never really brought him happiness during childhood.

He was fucking 15, I don`t think it's okay to throw him into a war, without training, explanation, and minimal support, as skilled as he may be, he wasn't a super-soldier or something like that.

Ginny had that phrase, but it wasn`t like Canon Harry was revenge obsessed, he just didn't see a way to finally be free without dealing with Voldemort, and by that point Dumbledore had convinced him that he was the only one able to do it, to say nothing that he saw, again and again, how inept or incapable some of the others that should help him were.

Now, that last part is just wrong, that wasn't the idea he wanted to pass to Tom, he was merely telling Tom he had condemned himself to something worse(staying as less than a spirit in limbo forever) not threatening him with torture. Are you saying Canon Dumbledore would relish in other's(even the villain) suffering or something, cause it seemed to me it was the opposite of that.

Dumbledore could've assassinated lots of DEs in the time between the wars, he could even have killed the ones in Azkaban, that he knew wasn't exactly safe from a returned Dark Lord. He could`ve done that and used his political capital to cover it up, he was still beloved by 80% of the population, if you recall.

But he didn't, and others suffered for it, he wanted to save Draco to the last, and Katie and Ron suffered for it, he knew Tom as a young man was evil but never really did anything to stop it.

He did not act because he is extremely afraid of wielding the power he has, he basically doesn't trust himself with it, this is why he doesn't use it unless really needed or why he avoided the post of Minister several times, because he still thinks of that time he and Grindelwald planned to conquer the world with magic and might, and he still thinks he can become that, he could've stepped up several times, but always did the minimal he could get away with, because he just didn't like using his power, be it magical or political.

That is Dumbledore's character as JKR had to make him so that he didn't solve the plot in a single book, an extremely powerful wizard that avoids using that power.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”

  “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy.

********* Yes, that was after Fifth Year, after the DoM, after Harry had confronted Voldemort several times, by this point he saw it as his only option, at this point he had a personal vendetta and it was his choice.

Before that, Harry was perfectly content not having anything to do with Death Eaters or Voldemort, and if Dumbledore told him that he would deal with it and showed himself capable, Harry would`ve been fine with it. He only ever interfered after exhausting all the other options (after telling the authority figures and them ignoring him) he had a sense of duty, but he had no obligation to do it.

Harry only got this real sense of revenge for Voldemort later, the thing Ginny says to him is only indicative of that moment, not before it.

And Harry is certainly not talking about the Greater Good, but the greater good of everyone.

Even so, those things don't give him ANY duty to do squat, he is NOT Law Enforcement, nor elected official or anything of the kind, if he wanted he could just leave Britain and make Voldemort the ICW`s problem after he burned Britain.

He was just a kid, I don't know where people get the ideal he had any duty to fight Voldemort, Dumbledore could be said to have that duty, since he was indirectly responsible for his rise, same thing for Slughorn, and the Ministry officials who also were remiss in their duties.

Harry? He had all this forced to him and only did something because JKR had to write him as a Noble Hero of Knightly proportions, it would be entirely in his rights to just move to the USA and let the adults deal with it.

As Dumbledore said, Prophecy doesn't force him to do anything, it only placed him in the position too, and JKR left it open ended too.

One where the "Light" side wins and they didn't help the Death Eaters, so they're off scot free. And the other where the Death Eaters win, Voldemort sure wouldn't be happy with the lack of support if the person/family was of importance enough for it to matter. Otherwise, I don't think he'd care and the so-called "grey" family would go about the same business they would if the "Light" won with added Voldemort.

** I personally don't think it's possible for Harry to be "neutral" in the war. He *has* to pick a side, and realistically, the only side he can pick is "not Voldemort". Even if he's anti-Dumbledore, Voldemort isn't going to leave him alone. Even if he pledges to join Voldemort, Voldemort isn't going to leave him alone -- he's far too big a risk (in Voldemort's perspective) to be left alive!

So Harry has three options: do what Dumbledore indicates he should, run away, or don't do what Dumbledore wants but still try to kill Voldemort.

Regardless of your views on the prophecy and whether or not Harry is at all necessary, Voldemort will not leave Harry alone. He's obsessed. He views it as an existential problem for Harry to be alive and free. There is no negotiation on this, Voldemort being Voldemort will not want that loose thread. If he learns about the pseudo-Horcrux in the scar, that might change, but probably not in a way that's good for Harry.

Neutrality is possible for halfbloods and purebloods though. Voldemort doesn't want to kill them, he just wants to rule them. If they accept the new order, they can live relatively freely, albeit with new restrictions. Muggleborns will struggle, as we saw in canon, so they only have two options: run away, or fight.

So whatever options others in the wizarding world have, Harry doesn't have the same ones. He can run away or fight Voldemort. Those are the options. Even a "Dark" Harry has only those options. Even a Harry who wants to purge the muggleborns and establish wizarding dominance over muggles has only those options. So that's why I don't really get "neutrality" in fanfic.

I get why other wizards would try for it, I just don't get why Harry would be think it's possible (assuming he knows about the prophecy).

** I agree that most fanfic authors tend to water down 'neutral' to the point where it's essentially a meaningless label.

Zap Brannagan jokes aside, I think the best bet to tackle the 'what is neutral?' question is to realize that, no matter how straightforward it may seem on the surface, politics is inherently bloody complicated.

Even among major political parties not everyone agrees on everything or supports the party for the same reasons. They might even hate everything the rest of their party stands for but stick with it because of one single issue (or cult of personality) they care about above all others. Some people might support a side due to reason while other might be attached to it emotionally. Some might support a side out of rational/petty self interest while others might be True Believers.

Some people also might support a side out of family loyalty or because they feel pressure to choose a side, but don't really know or care what that side represents. These can either be swayed with more information or might just double down on their tribalism depending on their personal tendencies.

Then there are the people who just don't give a shit about politics at all and would rather just stay out of the way while they live in a neutral little bubble.

There are also plenty of people who might have a solid opinion on an issue but value they and their family's safety first or just aren't cut out for violent conflict. They could also be so safe from reprisal that they can pull a Switzerland and just carry on with their lives because nobody can force them to get involved.

Others might have a vested interest in prolonging a conflict, such as war profiteering. Or maybe they just hope both sides will wear each other out so they can swoop in and pick up all the pieces for themselves.

Finally, there are also the people who quietly support one side but express indifference or indecision because they don't want to be perceived as supporting a socially unpopular opinion.

'Neutral' is basically the most complicated 'side' to any conflict. Thus it is especially hard to write, particularly for an amateur fanfic writer. It's a lot easier to turn it into a personal faction or simplify it to Diet-Good/Evil.

Which is not a negative thing -- it simply means you have pre-set values (just like everyone has) and implicitly apply these already in the onset of your assumption. In particular, you implicitly assume there is value in such ... well, values, as "bravery", "honour", "fighting" etc. You see how this aligns with Gryffindor.

To raise the counterpoint, then: Bravery is foolish, honour a self-destructive excess of pride, and instead, neutrality shows prudence, self-protection, and thoughtfulness.

So to get back to your question: If you ask "why do they respect neutrality", the answer is they value different things than you do. In the end, it's a matter of who you are, and if you are not like that, it won't make sense to you. But of course the same is true in reverse.

Finally:

#+begin_quote
  ... it's impossible to stay neutral ...
#+end_quote

You already raised the rebuttal, though. All the people who just continued living in DH were neutral. And they remained neutral. And Voldemort let them be neutral, because the implicit pact favoured him: He had neither the means, nor the desire to fight the whole wizarding world. So as long they didn't act, he wouldn't act and vice versa; and by staying neutral, they effectively supported the status quo.

Perhaps this is what you mean: There is no true neutrality unless you pack your things and move out. Neutrality always supports the current status quo -- but of course this, too, always works both ways, because while the neutrality kept Voldemort in power when he was, it also didn't defend him when he struggled, and ignored him when he wasn't.

***** It is because they are directly affected by a dystopia in which people disappear even for being heard incorrectly by a Death Eater supporter. We don't get to see much of Voldemort's reign but from the few glimpses we get through the Potterwatch, it seems that once the purges of Muggleborns were complete, it turned more into a Stalin-like regime where people would just vanish if they spoke against the Ministry.

**** That would be true if the choice was between 'everyone standing together' and 'everyone rolling over'. Realistically, any one individual can only make a decision for themself and not others.

Lets say you are a ministry worker and a Death Eater becomes your boss and demands that you keep working for him. You could make a principled stand and refuse, but even if your non-existant combat skills allowed you to beat them, you can't take out the entire organisation yourself. Not only have you effectively matyred yourself, but also probably condemed your family and maybe close friends to rape/torture/being fed to werewolves etc. as an example to others.

Yes, the majority can often rise up and rip the boot off their neck, but the outcome is rarely certain and even success brings sacrifices. Look at examples of protests and anti-authoritarian movements around the world today. Being at the forefront of a revolution (or in this case perhaps counter-revolution) requires a willingness to bring suffering down on yourself and those close to you on the off chance that life gets better for people you have never met.

Being dissapointed that not everyone is a hero implies that you think heroics are normal. Not managing to achieve something special should not get critacism, and equally should earn no praise, as it is the default state.

**** Er, yes. You are saying the same thing in different words.

Your answer applies value judgements on actions. In this case (I'm paraphrasing) that it's cowardly to stand by. Which is fine, like I said. But don't you see how you could get to entirely different judgements of the same action if you had different values?

If bravery means nothing to you, and (what you would call) cowardice is a virtue, naturally the very same action must look entirely different.

****** That just makes no sense, and it`s now how it works at all, even in geopolitics.

Eh, well, what if the bully doesn`t mess with them because they have a reason to? Like they are bigger/stronger or have a larger group?

Bullies tend to be pretty smart on who they shouldn't bully otherwise they stop being bullies because someone kicked their teeth in or taught them there is always bigger fish.

There's also the case of the bully not provoking too many people lest they gang upon them.

That`s a very simplistic way of seeing things and does apply at all to geopolitics or human interaction.

** Neutrals just need to be strong enough that no side wants to attack them and have to face them PLUS the side they are already fighting.

Sure, Voldemort would probably plan to attack them next, but maybe they could have a way to appease him or something.

Neutrality is just a pragmatic form of survival, some countries have it as a policy, and it works for them.

It's not cowardice if it helps you survive, morals tend to be a matter of perspective and are subjective in these cases.

** Based on my readings of fanfics, this is my general understanding.

​

Dumbledore basically embodies the "Light" side. Generally speaking Dumbledore is all about giving people 999+ chances to be redeemed if they're on the "Dark" side. Which is just as wishy washy as your seeming definition of neutral. But anyone that does something that Dumbledore thinks is morally wrong gets the look of disappointment that is supposed to induce feelings of guilt in someone. Generally speaking they don't want to be bad to anyone, so they are pretty "inclusive", as long as it doesn't involve their squib accountant relatives, or actually getting to know muggles, that is.

​

The "Dark" side is full of traditionalists wizarding families who have taken a stance against Dumbledore because he's somehow gotten a reputation for being a wishy washy (which he is) muggle lover, even though he really doesn't do much to help muggles (eh, propaganda, right?). So as a result of placing themselves ideologically opposed to Dumbledore, they end up being viewed as eeeeeevil by the light siders (eh, propaganda, right?). Old Tommy Riddle ends up leading this faction because if you complain too much about him and his Band, they come and curb stomp you in the middle of the night. So you better buy the Voldy and the Death Eaters records they're selling down at Diagon Alley.

​

So the Neutrals would just be people that don't like being forced to go Proselytizing with Dumbledore and his goody two-shoes, or being forced to go sell Riddle's band Records in the middle of the night. They generally like magic and want to enjoy their life of making money so their family can get ahead and gain some political capital so they can just say No. So that's where Harry Potter, independent, comes in. The Neutrals need their own Poster Boy to counter the Misionaries of Dumbledore and the Crazy Fans of Riddle's Boy Band.

** I don't think you have to resort to arguments against intrinsic neutrality to conclude that this is stupid. Harry has too much at stake emotionally and personally to be neutral in the wizarding war. I think all of the fics I've read where he is neutral have him either being an obnoxious edgelord or "occluding" the fuck out of his emotions.

There's probably enough support for a neutral side to develop in fanon if you stretch some things (arguably not in canon, where there is none). But Harry joining this and making a big deal out of it stretches even fanon sometimes.
