Don't judge me; you know you want to see it too. (Stories where they see [or think they see] a UFO but are not actually abducted would also be appreciated.)


** Personally I think Luna should just CLAIM she was abducted by extraterrestrials when something totally mundane actually happened.

*** That's good. Actually, here's another great idea: how about a story where Luna and Hermione both see something in the sky and Hermione's trying to come up with a reasonable explanation for it but of course Luna is trying to convince her and everybody else that they saw a UFO?

**** no it should be vice versa, the sight of the ufo causes Hermione to go a little crazy, cause all her spells and magic says it's actually a ufo, and nothing muggle/wizard. Meanwhile Luna is dismissive, "don't be silly Hermione, aliens Don't exist. That's stupid!" Followed by some joke about nargles or whatever cause fanon!Luna demands it.

**** This was the first story I let my son read. As a concept, it works surprisingly well.
