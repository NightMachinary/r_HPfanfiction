  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Will have my own characters starting from chapter 26. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey, strong, intelligent Harry.Harry x Fleur.
