Like herpo the fouls notes on how he created his Hocrux are found by another wizard but instead of just creating a horcrux immediately they brake the process of creating a Hocrux and improve it to mabye only require the sacrifice of a large animal or lessens some of the negative effects.

And then the eventual another person find its and improves upon it again with each person improvement upon it till the creation of a Hocrux only takes the sacrifice of a rat( or the need for a sacrifice is romoved entirely).with the improvement of the Hocrux creation being improve upon all the way to into the 20th century.

Mabye an effect of the needed sacrifice getting less over time and negative effects of creating a Hocrux decreaseing over time means that more people will study it leading to more impovment of the ritual creating a feedback loop.

A story were Tom Riddle uses the over 3000 years of magical advancement to improve the ritual before creating a Hocrux would also be good.


** Voldemort made great improvements to the Horcrux making process in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), and he was immune to a canon Horcrux hunt.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I know this is a pretty controversial fic, but it's the best fit that I know of.

In linkffn(5782108) Tom vastly improves the Horcrux ritual, possibly on his own, it's not really explained.

Basically, his perfected Horcruxes [[/spoiler][tie his soul to the living, without requiring him to split it. He has created countless Horcruxes. Tens of thousands, who knows. Some of which are in /extremely/ hard to reach places.]]

*** That's not exactly how it works, though. [[/spoiler][HPMOR is an AU where souls don't actually exist; the normal Horcrux ritual worked differently by copying one's brain, minus magical knowledge, into an object so that it could imprint on someone, much like the Diary did in canon. Tom's invention essentially /creates/ a soul for himself, not tie one that already existed to the world.]]

**** You're probably right, that fic was one of the first I read, quite a while ago.

The effect is the same, though. My summary gives enough information without revealing as much about the story.

It has different horcruxes. That's just a part of it being an AU fic.

Imo that part makes Voldemort a better villain.

******** Right. He found a better way of doing it, because he's a genius wizard, a contender for the greatest of all time.

Instead of shitty immortality, he's got a pretty good immortality.

He found his immortality and it's nigh impossible to kill him permanently, so another solution is needed.

I think that makes him a better villain than a Voldemort who mutilated himself and went nuts.

** linkffn(A Distant Storm) Voldemort reveals that he combined the Horcrux ritual with a ritual used by the Egyptians, allowing him to retain his sanity, a process that he shares with Grindelwald. (Mummification was used to counter the Egyptian ritual because it made the body more difficult to control)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
