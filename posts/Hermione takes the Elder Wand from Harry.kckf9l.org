:END:
I've tried asking here once before, no luck. I've waited a good while and will now try again. 99% sure it was on FFN.net. As far as I recall, it was a one-shot.

In it, Hermione took the Elder Wand from Harry and became its new master (mistress?) before obliviating him so that nobody could take it from him. Her idea was that, if I recall correctly, if it actually belonged to her but everyone including Harry thought it belonged to Harry instead, then it would be more likely that the owner would die and the wand's destructive power with them.

Last time I asked I got one very unhelpful response that completely missed the point of ‘fan'fiction - so I hope that this time someone might be able to point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!

  One-shot. Sometimes the only way to save your friends from themselves is to betray them. No pairings.

** The only MistressofDeath!Hermione fic that I can recall is ‘Hallows and Pathos' by Perspicacity. It sounds like a interesting concept so I'll keep looking and If I find it I'll drop the title down
