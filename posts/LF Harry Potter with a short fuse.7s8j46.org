I have read plenty of Fanfictions in which Harry Potter has pretty much the nerves of a saint. Cool. But I want to see him explode and lash out. And if there are stories in which he actually bitchslaps or kills Snape/evilDumbledore, I wont mind.

Cheers.


** Gotyou fam.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

*** Yes and no. Canon Harry is quite easy to flick someone off, but there are NEVER any consequences. Its all daisies and sunshine and awww.

I like stories in which Harry actually acts. Where there are consequences. Harsh ones even.

** Well there is always linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer), lots of weird smut but about equalish levels of plot. Not too far in Harry does a little bit of magic that affects his temper, to the point he belts Malfoy in the face with a goblet and gets Lockhart through the hand with a fork. Made me laugh at least.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** I concur. Ive read the fanfiction, it was a decent read. And I agree with the author that there would be lots of sex going on, but. You dont need to write that much about it? Eh, whatever. Good stuff.
