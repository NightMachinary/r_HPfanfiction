  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** Well, it's a crossover and not that good, but there is one I can think of. Harry ends up in an Age, called the Second Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past...

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Joining of Destinies by Kalistar).

I think the author asserts it is travel to the past, but based off all the clues in the original series, it is definitely the future. Kinda. Wheels man, wheels.

**** Sadly, most of the stuff i like has romance. But linkffn(browncoat, green eyes) is pretty light on it.

My own story is very romance heavy in the prequel which is where we're at.

Then there's this one shot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/33/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual]]
