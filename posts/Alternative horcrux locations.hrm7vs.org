When rewriting the horcrux hunt it can be pretty tricky to make the trio realise that the cup is Gringotts seeing as in canon it was more a lucky guess based on Bellatrix's reaction than anything else. So, if instead of coming up with some alternative reveal you want to come up with a different hiding spot entirely, where would you pick?

My personal idea would be something to do with Billy Stubbs, who I'm pretty sure I'm right in saying was the boy whose rabbit Tom Riddle killed as a kid. Might have been the first thing he ever killed, which would make it a significant event in Tom's life, like the events that happened in the shack, the cave, Hogwarts etc.

Maybe Billy buried the rabbit and that's where Voldemort hid a horcrux? Or maybe at some location that Billy habitually spent his time?


** In the dark forest in Albania. The place seems to have held some importance to him. He might have stayed close to a Horcrux of his to regain some strength.

** Voldemort traded off some ego for security: he mixed 1 mundane item among his artifact Horcruxes, and threw that one to the bottom of the Pacific.

I'd like to see how well canon Horcrux Hunt works here.

--------------

If I were writing this fic, I would get rid of canon Horcrux Hunt altogether. We know what happened in canon, we've seen it or its minor variations thousands times already. How about writing something new, something creative, and something refreshing?

*** My head canon: objects for Horcruxed need to hold some importance to the creator, otherwise it was almost impossible to bind your soul piece to the object.

And Horcruxes should be closer to a magical place otherwise the protections around he horcruxes deteriorates slowly, like say a century or two.

And throwing it in ocean, make it impossible to access your Horcrux if needed in future.

As per locations to store Horcruxes

1. Some place in Forbidden Forest.

2. Ministry of Magic

3. In his fathers tomb?

4. Hogwarts Express

5. Azkaban

*** Yes, that's the best way to hide a Horcrux. Get a random rock, and chunk it off the edge of a boat. No magic involved besides the Horcrux.

** I personally really like fics where the horcruxes are /all/ in alternative locations like A Black Comedy did. Scattering them across ancient tombs and trapped bunkers makes it a way better read then the atrocity that is the canon camping trip.

*** I once read a fic. I think it was WBWL story.

Lucius wants to buy the Horcrux, but Burke quotes high price. Harry overhear the discussion and asks Burke about it. And Burke mistakes him for His brother and sells horcrux to Harry for few galleons.

** If you want other locations then choose prominent/significant places in British history and myth. Hiding the diadem in All saint's church in Kingston upon Thames, for instance

** Don't forget the plaque for his services to the school. There was a few fics that did that. And/or used it for the DADA curse. He got that plaque for framing Hagrid for killing Myrtle.
