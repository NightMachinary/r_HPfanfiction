Im looking for a fanfic wich purebloods have more magic power than muggleborns or half bloods, resuming a fanfic that has magical level/rank


** Sorry I haven't come across a story like that, the closest thing I can remember was a Fic where Hermione finds an old spell with which you can test magical strengths and Ron was the strongest of the 3 and Harry the weakest ... didn't read a lot longer after that point.\\
Unfortunately I can't remember the name either, the whole thing played after the main story and I don't think Harry knew what he wanted to do with his life. In most magic wank fics it's the opposit like funnily enough in canon HB Tom, Albus, Harry are the "Strongest".

*** The fic you're thinking of is Loose Canon by Manatee-vs-Walrus. I absolutely love this fic. If you keep reading the fic you find out that Harry isn't actually magically weak. No spoilers, but that seems to be a sticking point for a lot of people so I figured I'd mention it.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/][*/Loose Cannon/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11271166/manatee-vs-walrus][/manatee-vs-walrus/]]

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

*** I started reading Prince of the Dark Kingdom, and it has something similiar as magical level ranking, i just doesnt know if it is ranked by blood purity

I was searching about it, and it seems it is called magical core i think...

** I know there are fics where pure bloods have special family Magic's and abilities. Sometimes it's just secret knowledge and in others it's bloodline abilities. It's not ranking power, but purebloods literally have access to more spells/ powers than muggleborns. I'm not sure of the names of these fics, but it's a trope I've seen more than once.

*** Not to mention things that could be called 'bloodline traits,' like Parseltounge or Metamoorphmaguses. Somehow I doubt Nymphadora got that from her father.

But that brings in whole question of /why/ she got it, which was probably just part of her father not being a distant relative of her mother.
