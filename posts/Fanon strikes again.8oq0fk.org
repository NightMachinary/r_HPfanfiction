Just reread DH. Where in the ass did Hermione have 'Mudblood' carved into her arm by Bellatrix? And why the fuck do people think that happened?

No, 'Harry had "I must not tell lies" carved into his arm so Bella must have done the same to Hermione' is not a valid explanation.

Edit: Apparently it was in the movie. The last time I saw DH was in the cinemas, back in ye olde 2010 and 2012. Carry on, nothing to see here.


** Because it was in the movie, and people liked it and/or thought it was in character for Bellatrix.

** Movie is not canon for me. In fact, it's just another mediocre fanfic written by Steve Kloves that contains lots of Ron and Ginny bashing, plus tons of ridiculous scenes.

Confetti Voldemort anyone?

**** Well, it /is/ a canon in its own right, though not one as well-built as the literary one to be sure. As long as a writer explicitly say they are a fan of the /movies/ and are writing fanfiction of the movie universe, it /is/ a canon.

But either way, the point is more that in this case, it's a very iconic and in-character thing for Bellatrix to do. Even under the premise that the movies aren't canon, that makes them "officially sanctioned fanfiction", and there's nothing wrong with borrowing ideas from that "other fanfiction", much as stories routinely borrow from one another (wards, etc.).
