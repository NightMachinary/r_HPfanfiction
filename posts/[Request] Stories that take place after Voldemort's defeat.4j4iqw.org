I'm looking for the best/most entertaining fics that take place after Voldemort's defeat. I'd prefer them to be ones that start shortly after, or even a few years later, but not at the point of the epilogue. I don't particularly care if they follow canon or branch off into AU, or if Voldemort is dealt with earlier/later. I don't care about the pairings, I don't care if it's slash or not. I don't care if it has no pairings, or isn't Harry-centric. Basically, I want stories of the aftermath of the war, and rebuilding the wizarding world (if applicable). 8th year fics are good too.

Sorry if this is too general of a request, but I'm not exactly sure what I want, and I figure I have better odds of finding good stories if I'm more broad with what I'm asking for.


** I suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's work]] so often I'm surprised someone hasn't told me to stop yet. Anyways, it follows canon very well, and if you look at the bio you can choose the stories that are right after the battle. I think linkffn(grave days) was pretty good (and completed). Personally I really liked linkffn(hunters and prey) because it's actually finished and I enjoyed the back and forth storyline; it takes place about two years after the war but involves catching Death Eaters.

** linkffn(After the End) takes place shortly after Voldemort's death although it was written pre-ootp. Lots of rebuilding and sounds like what you're looking for if you don't mind it being super AU.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.
