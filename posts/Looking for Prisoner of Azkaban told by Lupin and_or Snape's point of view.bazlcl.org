Preferably 3rd person but as long as it's well written I don't care. It's my fave book and I'm fairly new to the fanfic scene. Thanks in advance!

*** ...107k words. That's a lot. The actual book has 107,253 words, this fanfiction based on that specific book has more. The hell

**** It is. It would benefit from an editor as many fics can. I admittedly skimmed some parts because of the length but enjoyed certain aspects very much.

Seems like the word count was a deliberate choice by that author, given how closely they match.

** Please heed all warnings associated with [[http://www.angelfire.com/magic/moonshadow/staffroom.html][Staffroom Seduction]].

It's during PoA from Snape's perspective with Lupin as his lover. So it's the first thing I thought of when you asked for some Snape/Lupin perspective on that year. But only click that link if you really are ok with GRAPHIC SLASH SEX AND VIOLENCE.

This was one of the first fics I ever read, probably around 2001. Since it was written before OotP, it is definitely AU now, and you'll probably need to consider how little we knew about Snape and the Mauraders. Also there's good odds I'll re-read it and cringe, but I'm probably gonna do that tonight ;)

Thanks for the trip down memory lane!
