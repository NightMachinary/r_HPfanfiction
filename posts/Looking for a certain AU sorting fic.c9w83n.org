:END:
I've been searching for this pic but I can't find it. I, unfortunately, cannot remember the name nor author.

From what I remember, there was a Ravenclaw!Draco, Ravenclaw!Hermione, Gryffindor!Susan Bones & Gryffindor!Theodore Nott. I think Ron was a Hufflepuff but I'm not sure. Harry was either Slytherin or Hufflepuff but I'm leaning towards Slytherin. It was focused on First Year or at least the Sorting.
