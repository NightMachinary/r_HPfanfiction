** I've actually read quite a few stories about muggles (most about dudley). Petunia and Vernon aren't often written about, because not many people like those characters. Dudley showed personal character development in the books, so quite a few ff authors have told stories about him. One of my favourites was how Dudley got married, had children and then the children turned out magical (I think the wife was a squib, can't really remember).

There is probably at least one story about each of the topics you mentioned.

Also, I disagree with you about Ron, but we can agree to disagree on that.

  How tf does a Vernon meet a Petunia?

There are a few fics which touch upon that. I remember that much from my brief foray into Snape at Hogwarts fics. And it comes up in a few Marauder centric fics as well, usually because Lily and Petunia have a falling out and Vernon sides with his girlfriend.

  show us WHY we should like Ron

Again, plenty of canon-compliant stuff goes down that route. Building a house on a rotten foundation (eg the epilogue) is not the best idea IMO, but each to their own. Personally, the ones I've read made me dislike him because they try too hard.

  What are some you've all noticed?

Honestly, I have seen pretty much any avenue covered. Quality is a different matter, but there's a fic for almost every premise. No Magic AUs (eg Coffeeshops, High School), Good guy Voldemort, Harry going back through time to band someone, other kinds of time travel, Harry banging his father's best friends, Harry banging his father's nemesis, MURICA; FUCK YEAH!, almost any crossover imaginable...

Honestly, the one thing I haven't seen so far would be a "serious" attempt at Harry/Lily which is neither porn nor about the incest.
