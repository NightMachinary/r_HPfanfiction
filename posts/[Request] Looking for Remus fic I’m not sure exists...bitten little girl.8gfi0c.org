Years ago, YEARS, I read a fic where Remus Lupin bit (or thought he had bitten, I can't remember if he actually did) a little girl. I think her name was Mary? Anyway, he bit this six or seven year old and ended up semi-responsible for her. There was a whole slightly demented father-daughter thing happening, because she just didn't have anyone else and he was trying to make up for ruining her life.

The only scene I clearly remember is them going to see Princess Mononoke, and him not quite getting the idea of Muggle films, but her being really excited. Something about a French woman helping him out, too? And a network of werewolf safe houses?

It was quite a dark fic. Long one, too. I'm 99 percent sure Remus smoked.

Either this fic exists and I've forgotten it, or I invented the whole thing in the bath and convinced myself it was real. It's driving me mental.

Did this exist???


** I remember something like this as well.

It's been years since I've read any Remus fics though. I think I found it somewhere in Fanfiction.net Remus-100k words-Favorites?

** Found it!!!!!

Also has a sequel called wolf by ears but it's unfinished and at one of the worst possible cliffhangers.
