Whispers in the night and wind shear do a good job of it where they show that the war actually was a war rather than just a duel between dumbledore and grindlewald where there are actual veterans and that dumbledore actually fought rather than just the one duel Are there more fics like those?


** Diablerie linkao3(16697380) deals a lot with Tom Riddle's trauma of living in a Grindlewald/WWII era London and how that war affected people. It also really gets into some of the really horrible crimes committed under Grindlewald and the imprisonment/punishment of him and his followers in Nuremberg.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.
