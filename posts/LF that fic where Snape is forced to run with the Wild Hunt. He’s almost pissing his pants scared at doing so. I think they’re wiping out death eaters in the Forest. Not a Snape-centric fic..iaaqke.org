#+TITLE: LF that fic where Snape is forced to run with the Wild Hunt. Heâ€™s almost pissing his pants scared at doing so. I think theyâ€™re wiping out death eaters in the Forest. Not a Snape-centric fic.

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically I believe how it went was Harry is able to call upon the European folklore of the Wild Hunt to chase death eaters and/or unnatural beasts of the forest.

Snape is voluntold that he will be running with them. I remember he damn near shits his pants due to his fear of them.

I recall a scene where people inside the castle are able to hear the hounds of the hunt howling throughout the night. I think Dumbledore is extremely disappointed maybe but resigned to it being necessary.

Thanks for any help.

Chapter 35. Snape, Harry, Nightmares (fancy horse demons?), and centaurs are killing acromantula at the behest of The Morrigan and Cernunnos.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU
