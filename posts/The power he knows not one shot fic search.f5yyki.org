:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a one shot fic I read years ago. This fic centered on "the power he knows not". Basically, Harry would develop a new power and, instead of keeping it a secret to use against Voldermort, he would send Voldie an owl and tell him about the new power. Since Voldie now knows of the power, Harry would then develop a new power/ability that Voldie wasn't aware of. Rinse. Repeat In the end, Voldie gives up because Harry just develops too many powers.
