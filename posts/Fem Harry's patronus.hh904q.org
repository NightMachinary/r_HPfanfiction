** I've seen both ways work. The writer Laventadorn writes her fem!harry as having a stag and it suits her sort of tomboyish, brash nature I think. More introspective or gentle, empathetic fem!harrys having a doe also makes sense. It's up to the writer to show what fits their vision of a fem Harry I reckon

**** Imagine some Canadian wizard visiting and whips that out.

Whole bunch of Brits standing around going 'what the fuck was that' after a ten foot tall, 1500lb deer-thing goes tearing off after a Lethifold.

**** Hmm, it is. Sorry, that's my ESL ... I had wrong impression it was (in Czech) ‚Äúsrna‚Äù which is very often considered female deer, but it is in fact a separate animal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_deer]].
