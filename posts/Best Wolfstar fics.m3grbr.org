I recently got developed an obsession for Wolfstar but I can't find any good fics, pls recommend the best ones. Any help will be appreciated


** What have you read?

In order of my favourites:

The best is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]]. A canon look at Lupin from 1971 to OoTP. It just is the best one.

I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] which is a texting fic but is just very cute.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13990401/chapters/32213229][Dress Up in You]] is also a muggleAU but its really well written and just very very good. Same author as ATYD above so you know they have the dynamic down.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is a wolfstar Raising Harry fic which is also wonderful. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][The Dogfather]] is similar and again, just great.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571][Remain in Light]] is a wonderful Sirius Lives fic that is so well written. But has some very NSFW scenes so be warned.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12147474/chapters/27562521][Casting Moonshadows]] is a very piney fic with some VERY dark themes. Big warnings here for abuse and all the rest but its wolfstar and I don't know what you're into. All the other fics are angsty, this one is just sad.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/20750912/chapters/49305518][Sweater Weather]] is a hockey AU which again has some VERY NSFW scenes and a forced coming out. Its too smutty and fluffy for my tastes but I enjoyed learning a lot about Hockey and Canada. Other people seem to enjoy it though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1319809][Electric Fizzing Whatevers]] is the most Kudosed oneshot about Wolfstar from what I can see and is very good.

I have not read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7869079/chapters/17970910][Blends]]. I don't know what it's about other than its an NSFW coffee shop AU. But people who like fluffy angsty wolfstar seem to like it. Though I can't vouch for it.

​

And tadaa, that's all the best wolfstar I have. I can expand on more if you have further questions.

*** This is an excellent list! I second trying all of these, and I'll chime in on Blends. It's my favorite Wolfstar non-magical AU. Both of them are complicated and bad at things and sometimes annoying, but ultimately good and good for each other. It's a very realistic mutual pining scenario (told from one person's POV), and it's beautiful to watch them slowly figure each other out and come together. The other characters and their dynamics are really well done too. It's only NSFW near the very end. Blends also has a WIP sequel!

I'll add some others: two raising Harry WIPs, one very angsty fic (check the warnings), and two more non-magical AUs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27300139/chapters/66700582][*that's the art of getting by*]] *by sarewolf:* “What do you want me to do?” Remus says, tiredly. All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can't stop looking at Harry. “Remus...” Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone. Hates that he knows it will hurt. “There is no one else left.” A bitter laugh escapes him. “So you'll curse the poor thing with a werewolf for a guardian?”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20059978/chapters/47507422][*chase the stars*]] *by Duskglass:* It's probably the most foolish, reckless, dangerous thing Sirius Black has ever done in a lifetime of foolish and reckless and dangerous things... but he takes one look at Harry and knows it's the only choice he can make.(Or: ‘Sirius escapes Azkaban early & accidentally kidnaps Harry' AU.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973/chapters/1948502][*73 Aberdeen*]] *by Mici:* There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22331551/chapters/53344351][*Ever Thus*]] *by WrappedUp:* “Right, well I'd say it's about time to put an end to this nonsense, wouldn't you?” James nodded sagely. “You've obviously still got some things to chat through with him, but he will talk to you about it, Remus. He thinks the world of you, you know that. But the important thing is that you do talk because nothing's going to get sorted if you just sit cry-wanking in your room.” The world is excruciating and enthralling in equal measure. The gang try their hardest to navigate it as real, legitimate adults.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27679754][*Rourke*]] *by sreka:* When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love.

** I have just realized that wolfstar isn't a popular author but a ship named. I feel so dumb.
