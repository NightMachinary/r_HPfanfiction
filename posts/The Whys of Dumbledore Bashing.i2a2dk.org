While I definitely understand the reasons to bash on Dumbledore, as the man's mistakes are many and often cruel in their results, having recently re-read Goblet of Fire I am having a hard time understanding the fandom trope of an evil Dumbledore. His actions, and emotional responses to the revelation of Barty Jr's deception, Cedric's death, and Barty's getting kissed seem entirely genuine.

So, for those of you who lean towards that interpretation, what do you feel is the most convincing argument for an evil Dumbledore?

  "You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years." ...

  "She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet she still took you ..."
#+end_quote

This is the root of my dislike of Dumbledore. He knew exactly what he was sending Harry into, knew how his aunt felt about him and how he was likely to be treated, and did it anyway. That he later says he thought Petunia would learn to love Harry is belied by these statements, and is just an excuse to get Harry to forgive him. That he claims that the way he set Harry up, lied to him and and kept secrets from him, is because he "loved him too much" to tell him the truth is perhaps the biggest lie of all. He doesn't love Harry: Harry is nothing more than a tool to defeat Voldemort. He may /regret/ the "necessity," but not enough to change what he does.

** He left Harry in an abusive household and just uses blood wards as a means of keeping him there and not listening to Harry when he said he wasn't treated well. (I have read so much fanfiction so Idk if this is canon or fanon)

*** "and not listening to Harry when he said he wasn't treated well"

Harry doesn't ever tell about the Dursleys to anyone.

**** I don't recall him discussing the Dursleys with Dumbledore until he himself brought up the topic of the "ten dark and difficult years", but it's incorrect to say that Harry doesn't tell anyone. Sirius knows about how Harry is treated, Harry writes to the Weasleys and the Grangers asking for food in the summer of 94, and everyone in the Order knows by the fifth book.

***** The thing that they suspect or know to different degrees, doesn't mean that Harry tells "Hey the Dursleys are mistreating me". Harry never asks Dumbledore or anyone else to make the Dursleys treat him better, he asks to be moved to Sirius or stuff like that... but he never requires intervention on the Dursleys. Which makes the "not listening" part not entirely accurate.

He asks to be moved to a different place, and Dumbledore tells him his reasons why he should stay with the Dursleys at the end of book 5. So he does listen and answers with reasons.

ABout everything else, I just made a huge Dumbledore post about it.

****** I agree that there's a good argument that a number of people *should* have known, but because it suited the plot they didn't have solid enough information to act.

**** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  I've been trying to find out exactly how much of this is his fault alone
#+end_quote

All of it.

#+begin_quote
  What responsibility does he have to check up on a magical child in a foster home other than being the one who put him there? He's a headmaster at a school where Harry hasn't even started
#+end_quote

This ignores that he: sent Hagrid to take Harry and bring Harry to him, had Harry followed, placed someone in the neighborhood to watch Harry, stops Harry from being expelled at the beginning of OotP, and stops Fudge and Scrimgeour from bothering Harry at the top of HBP.

****** Pretty much, though I wouldn't say indirectly in the case of Mrs. Figg, who admittedly was more powerless than everyone else, and the Weasleys. Mrs. Weasley believed George at least a little bit when he told her they were starving him.

******* I find book two to be the wierdest in terms of adults reaction to Harry being removed from the dursleys, like mrs Weasley heard that they put bars on his Window and just waves it aside.

They should have checked the Dursley residence for signs of abuse.

** The only reason why I could get behind the whole manipulative, evil Dumbledore thing is Sirius. I mean, I get that things looked bad for Sirius after the first war, but seriously, Dumbledore couldn't even spare a few minutes to talk with him? Even if only to ask why did he do that?

It's one of those things that bothered me the most in the books, I think. Considering everything we hear about Sirius and James, it sounds ridiculous that so many people believed Sirius to be guilty. They were best friends, they were like brothers, Sirius lived with the Potters after he ran away, James trusted Sirius over Dumbledore with Fidelius, and yet no one ever wondered what made him turn against James? The guy was in the Order since he finished Hogwarts, and did what Dumbledore told him, but Dumbledore didn't even try to understand why he switched sides? Sirius didn't even have a trial! Like, Bellatrix had one, and the rest of death eaters, but Sirius was just sent to Azkaban without a chance to prove his innocence. And everything happened while Dumbledore held the most important positions in the wizarding world (except being the Minister of Magic), and had enough sway to defend Snape, whose allegiance to Voldemort was confirmed by another Death Eater. WTF...

The evil Dumbledore theory fits quite nicely here since Dumbledore's behaviour could be easily explained by saying that he wanted to manipulate Harry and with Sirius as his godfather it would be more difficult.

*** Great list. I agree with everything you wrote. There is truly a ton of justification in Dumbledore's canon actions (or lack of action) to justify the manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore tropes.

Add to the list When Harry and Hermione (and Lupin) tell him that Pettigrew was scabbers and that he is alive and confessed to giving up the Potters to Voldemort he does nothing to get Sirius a trial and basically imprisons him in Grimmauld place. He provides no glamours or other methods of hiding Sirius' identity nor uses the ICW to give Sirius a trial to declare him innocent etc.

** I like both of the docs as long as in the fan fiction, it makes sense. I don't think that there needs to be any reason or proof that your particular way of thinking is true, even in canon, because the whole point is that you change something about canon or expand upon it by making things up that (hopefully) makes complete sense either by interpreting canon in one way or making stuff up.

** For me, evil Dumbledore is actually an extension of a canon ideal. In canon, Dumbledore could do almost no wrong in anyone's eyes. With evil Dumbledore, everything he ever did wrong is on purpose and with malicious, devious intent. I enjoy reading it as I sometimes get tired of having V always be the villian, a little change is nice. But to me Dumbledore's biggest flaw is his hubris. He doesn't listen to other people's opinions and keeps important information (like Horcruxes) to himself. I would also say he's definetely a manipulator.

I think the most interesting portrayal of Dumbledore I ever read was one where the main characters (Harry and some sidekicks) kept reading into his actions to get evil Dumbledore. Meanwhile, the POV would occasionally shift to Dumbledore and we'd see that his intentions were good, but his execution was poor. A good example of this was the year 1 protections. He never meant Harry to see the mirror while he was working on it's final enchantments. The traps were reasonably easy because he wanted V to get cocky and get trapped by the mirror. I can't remember what fic it was, but Dumbledore felt very plausible to me.
