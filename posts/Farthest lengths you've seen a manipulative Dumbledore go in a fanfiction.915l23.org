** Dumbledore orphaned Harry, the NBWL.

Dumbledore mind-wiped James and Lily.

Dumbledore placed mind magics on Lily and James to make them never think about having another child, such that in the story when the magic is ended everyone realizes Lily is like 4 months pregnant.

Dumbledore literally doses half of Gryffindor house with potions to make them isolate or resent Harry.

Dumbledore tries to mind-wipe Harry's girlfriend at one point, which only gets prevented when /Harry/ threatens to set his twin brother, the BWL, on fire.

And all that is only scratching the surface of one fic.

I really thought I'd seem some horrifying stuff. That may just take one of the top three spaces (one of the other ones going to some of the things I've seen Sirius get up to, and another one going to the fic where Dumbledore persuades Harry and Ron to rape Hermione).

** The Dumbledore in one of Perfect Lionheart's fics was just whoa.

It's been a while, but here's what I remember:

He stole land (literally, using some magic trinket he also stole if memory serves) for his collection.

He had a horcrux.

He was storing Grindelwald's horcrux.

Snape was his minion as well as full on evil too. He had a horcrux too.

He was a dark lord in hiding.

He deliberately styled himself after Snideley Whiplash for some reason.

Basically, he was a straight up supervillain.

And it was played straight.

I still can't tell, even close to ten years later, whether or not the author was trolling or just had their bashing sequence run out of control and go so far off the rails it was technically flying by accident.
