Help! I'm looking for fics where Sirius DOESN'T die in the Department of Mysteries, and that includes both Remus and Tonks as well.

I'm looking for more interaction and friendship between the three, Sirius being able to take a bigger role in Harry's life, and hopefully even a love interest for Sirius. Romance and drama themes. Would like for it to stick to canon whenever possible (despite the fact that Sirius is alive!). No slash please, and preferably an M rating cause I'm sucker for a little smut. If it's first person, I'd like it to be written from the perspective of Sirius, Remus, or Tonks. Extra points if it includes the ups and downs of Remus and Tonks's relationship! And extra extra points if it's a long fic.

Also, I have a second minor request - fics where James and Lily don't die, and that focuses on the early-20s marauders just living their lives. Aso romance and drama themes.

The Marauders (especially Sirius) are my favorite character, so I'd love to read more fics where they all get to have a fuller lives!


** It doesn't quite fit your request, but have you read linkffn(A Black Comedy)? It's one of the best fics on the site bar none.

linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) is a good Sirius fic even though it's not really a high rated fic due to the use of some bad cliches.

** Sirius is so popular that most pre-OoTP AU stories with happy endings have him making it through.
