:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I mostly remember the first chapter vividly, so here goes:

- Sets off during the 4th year. Romance Fic. Include Dumbledore bashing, and probably even Ron Bashing (Not sure on that part)

- Harry dancing with Hermione, and some of the wording describing his dancing as "flying"

- The Hogwarts Castle Playing Music to entice the students to dance as well.

- Dumbledore trying to get the castle to play death music, which he couldn't.

- The (moving) pictures of Harry and Hermione being posted on the newspaper.

- Very same pictures being given to Hermiones' parents and Harry being present in their house for the time being.

- Some statues creating havok. One particular Mohai being the death sentence to many a people.

- Some Death eaters trying to storm Hermiones' place, only to get their asses kicked.

- Dolores being tortured to insanity and then her memory being wiped clean every time she does so.

That's all the major points I remember. But I can't for the life of me remember the name of the fic, and searching it seems to be useless, never could rely on my memory or my bookmarks to remember that.
