I try to avoid using any colloquialisms/slang/whatever in my stories, but sometimes it slips in because I'm not aware it's only said in my country. That's true for any non-British. So what stands out to you the most of Americanisms/other countries' English? And what British terms should be used instead?

***** When I was in year nine, the leaving sixth formers made a hell of mess of the school grounds shortly before the end of the year (after exams, possibly). It's too long ago for me to recall any details, but I know the school banned later years from having any kind of similar party. (Now I think about it, I'm pretty sure that's the same year group that was rumoured to have one of the sixth form girls sleeping with one of the English teachers.)

Don't recall any fires, but someone did drew a huge penis on the north quad in the snow one winter. The math classrooms were next to it and the female teacher was /furious/.

**** I've heard that proms are getting more and more popular in the last few years. I know they definitely have them in Canada because we were in Vancouver during prom season and there were kids in fancy dress everywhere.

What about other school dances? Here in the US, there are generally two formal events--Winter Formal and Prom--with smaller dances sprinkled around throughout the year. A popular one is Sadie Hawkins where the girls ask the guys out and they dress in ridiculous matching outfits. Oh, I forgot about Homecoming which is another formal situation and a Homecoming King and Queen are elected. I would imagine there's no UK equivalent since Homecoming is usually associated with American Football.

***** No, we have nothing like that. Individual schools might hold a dance (actually, during my childhood, we called them discos; don't know if they still do, might be showing my age) for whatever reason, but nothing regular.

Also, now that I think about it, while we don't have graduation, Hogwarts might have Leavers' Day. I don't know what it's like in a state school if they have them, but at my boarding school it was a bit of a big thing. Huge tent on the sports field, headmaster and one or two others would give speeches, special mention given to outstanding pupils. Lunch was served after, and throughout the afternoon parents could visit the buildings to see work displays or clubs performances (small, informal performances, I think; the only one I actually recall was the gymnastics display that I was actually a part of).

We did have a Leavers Day in my state school. We hung around on the field, cut up jumpers, signed/wrote/drew penises on shirts, went to our tutor groups for the final time, had an assembly and then participated in the school's time honoured tradition of running screaming down the corridors in the middle of the school day to leave early and go home.

Things like the art exhibit (for those doing the art GCSE) or whatever those doing the PE GCSE did happened earlier.

Although I think they did have the leaving feast where like the House Cup winner was announced, but that was more for the whole school rather than the kids leaving school at the end of their seventh years.

I find the differences between UK and US schools endlessly fascinating. A lot of what the US does seems tied to good old American exceptionalism.

**** Oh my goodness, it's a whole big deal. Seniors got out of school a whole week early. I remember taking my senior picture the summer before school started and ordering a whole bunch of wallet sizes to give away to friends. Class rings are a big deal, but I didn't get one. You have to order your cap and gown and there's a whole bunch of other stuff you can order and then when you graduate, you can be a tool and hang your tassel from your car's rear view mirror. Then you have to decide who you're going to walk with for the processional, get enough tickets for your family (my class was huge and the event was held in a local event arena) and then there's the graduation party afterwards with gifts and and and. Ugh.

How long ago did you leave school? And are reunions a thing? I graduated in 1991 and I have yet to go to any of my reunions, though I might go to my 30th (shudder). My dad's 50th is this year and he said for his alma mater's graduation ceremony this year, they're going to have members of his class on the stage. I'm encouraging him to participate because he needs to get out of the house more.

***** We don't have any of that. We broke for our exams in May, then came back for our leavers assembly and then on the last day, you played hangman and riddles and stuff. We had an 18 page red year book and that was it. No caps, no gowns, you wear your uniform every day until the assembly then you dress 'smartly' and your parents are invited to come. We had some orange juice and chocolate. People then go back to school after and on the actual leaving day, people usually wear their uniform and people write on it like you would a year book.

Ours is split into GCSE (think OWLs) and A Levels (think NEWTs), so I had my year book and leavers do in 03 with GCSE but I went onto sixth form as well (A Levels) so I finished that in '05. Most people rely on A Level grades for university, but I became sick so I didn't start university until '12. That was more like what you're describng. We didn't have a reunion - one was theorised about on facebook and quickly shot down. My mother, who finished school in (I think) in '69 and my dad who finished in '68 (he was held back a year because he couldn't understand the new currency) both had reunions a few years ago, though my mother is northern irish and my dad is from the west country.

Yearbooks are a huge deal in the US. There are tons of pictures and a lot of kids will join a bunch of clubs just so they can be in as many yearbook photos as possible. I remember some kids would go through and actually count how many pages they appear on. I think all of mine--Sophomore, Junior and Senior--were in excess of 200 pages. Like, heavyweight, nice pages. Most of which are scribbled on in pen and marker by people I don't really even remember, but were SO IMPORTANT almost 30 years ago.

I remember my junior year I was in a bunch of clubs because I was a busybody and the guy I had a massive crush on was a photographer for the yearbook and he took the club photographs. So in that year, my face is frozen in the most ridiculous smile.

I don't even remember what year I took my SATs or what my score was. It must have been my junior year. I do recall that I did better on the language part than the math part.

I'm really loving this glimpse into the UK school life!

***** There's also probably some difference when it's a combined secondary and sixth form as opposed to a straight secondary where you go to a separate sixth form.

I went to a state secondary with no sixth form. So when we finished our GSCE's that was pretty much it. We had to come back in a few times after that for Leavers Day and to collect anything we'd left behind. Apart from things like exhibiting the art done by Art GCSE students and possibly something for the PE GCSE students parents didn't come in at all.

All that sort of pomp and circumstance is reserved for university graduations. That's when you have caps and gowns, family watching, going up to shake hands and get your diploma.

Reunions are not a thing for state schools. They /might/ be for public schools or boarding schools but I'll defer to those who actually went to them. As far as I am aware, no state school has any kind of reunion.

******* School leaving age /used/ to be 16, but I think it's now been raised to eighteen.

Secondary school is 11-16. Sixth form is 16-18 (confusingly for Americans, sixth form can also be referred to as 'college'. University is solely referred to as university or uni)

You do your GCSE's in Secondary School. Your AS and A-levels are done in Sixth Form. Some sixth forms also have facilities to resit your GCSE's if you didn't do very well. Being held back a year or moved up a year is insanely rare.

There's no real university prep. You do need A-levels to get into uni (mostly, exceptions can be made for mature students whose education was completed when there were still O-Levels or who only did GCSE's and then went into work) though but we don't have things like your SATS (/our/ SATS are or were done at age 11 - I'm not sure if they've got rid of them but frankly I don't much care).

If you want to be both authentically British and contemporary, Harry would have been one of the first few year groups to take the SAT in Year 6.

Even our universities don't really do the reunion thing, not that I'm aware of.

********* Pretty much everyone goes to sixth form now. There are also sixth forms which focus on more vocational training rather than academic for people who aren't interested in university.

IIRC sixth form is a holdover from the old grammar school system where you took an 11+ exam and from there you might be able to go to a grammar school where years would be called 'forms'. So your class of 11-12 year olds would be 'First Form', going all the way up to 17-18 year olds being in 'Sixth Form'.

Our SATs are nothing like yours and I'm not certain if they even still exist but 15+ years ago I took them as an eleven year old.

Unless you're getting steak and kidney pudding from the chippy for your tea.

Also: bullocks are castrated bulls. Bollocks, meanwhile, are one of those universal words. You can talk bollocks (nonsense), be the dog's bollocks (very impressive), get up to bollocks (drunken and/or criminal shenanigans), describe something as a load of bollocks (tiresome and/or nonsensical), and, if it comes to it, kick a lad /in/ the bollocks (testicles) for talking bollocks. None of these involve cattle for good or ill.

It's also a very, very old slang word for a vicar of a parish church, which the Sex Pistols insisted was what they meant when prosecuted for obscene advertising.

Also, 'nutters' is a plural noun. One nutter (crazy person, distinguished by the bollocks they're spouting), two or more nutters. It is not an adjective (although it can look like one, properly used in context - "Nutters, the lot of them.")

The nub of my gist, here, is that using someone else's dialect can be decidedly tricky and make it quite clear you're not a native.

** 'Blocks' - Even newly built, specifically designed UK towns are far, far less linear than American towns. You can't just run around the block, because there is no block. Blocks are used to describe flats, as in 'a block of flats'. The older the town, the more likely it is to be wiggly and nonsensical because it's been built and rebuilt and added on to. I did my undergrad in a city which was over 1000 years old.

Forgetting the NHS. I know socialised medicine is scary to Americans but nevertheless, we have it. Although the Dursleys hated Harry, they would not be not taking him to the dentist or the optician because it cost too much. Children under sixteen get everything free. If you're going to say that they chose not to take him to the opticians or dentists, that's fine but give me a reason other than money.

Ever since, "Talk Like A Pirate" has been, in fact, "talk like an elderly West-Country yokel."

** Everything British can be so regional - Mum, Mam, Ma for mother, for example. There is no one way to do it. Knowing I'm from roughly near where Godric's Hollow would be, I find it easier to model that but I don't know anyone who's done a midlands Lily Evans. That said, my personal pet peeve has always been cupcakes being used instead of fairycakes. They're different things, I know, but one is much more prevalent here.

*** What about "Dad"? I've heard "Da", but I don't know if that's specific to a certain region. Can you elaborate?

**** Da is more northern (In Belfast, in's pretty common) but I don't see as much variation with dad. Grandfathers get more with Poppy, Papi, Pals, Pops, Granda (Belfast again) and my neighbour's grandkids always call him Pampy.

***** LOL, "pampy". Make me think of Pampers. Years ago I worked with a guy who had a dad that was a lot older. They jokingly called him "Damps".

****** LOL Awwww! One of my neigbours managed to make it to her great great great granddaughter being a toddler and she used to call her the real nana because she was the oldest. Sometimes, it's familial, rather than area based.

** Yeah for me the language isn't a huge issue. Yes, there are some things Americans only say, but it's not a huge deal. I also don't expect writers to learn to write in a completely different dialect of English just to do fanfic.

And they're not super accurate either. I'm American but I write words with "u"'s, and say stuff like "I've drunk that before." Generalizations are useful, but they're not the be-all-end-all.

But behaviours are another thing. British society is different from American society, from its traditions to its pop culture to its government/school system, so fanfics that get that right get many more points in my book.
