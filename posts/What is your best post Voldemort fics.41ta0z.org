** I find Post Volemort fics to be interesting as the standard 'killing Voldemort' fic can get formulaic and boring, especially the obligatory yet-another-horcrux-hunt-of-doom. At the same time, creating a believing antagonist after Voldemort isn't exactly easy, as yet-another-dark-wizard is hardly much more entertaining.

linkffn(The Ring of Gold) and its sequels have one of the most intricately built mysteries ever, and the new antagonist is compelling.

linkffn(Unatoned). Harry/Daphne femme fatale. Has problems with the believability of the setting, but brilliant, atmospheric writing and a plot with some excellent twists.

linkffn(Yellow Submarine). YMMV on this because of the themes it deals with, but this is some of the best writing in the fandom.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][Paradigm of Uncertainty]] is the original post-Voldemort fic. The plot is fast paced and there are some interesting twists. It is also the only H/Hr fic in which I liked the way the romance was built. The writing rather unexceptional though.

linkffn(After the End): The best immediately post War fic. Exceptional writing and characterization, but very much slice of life.

linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided): Best Next Gen Fic Ever.

linkffn(The Malfoy Case): Excellently plotted Legal drama. Draco/Astoria. Canon characterizations.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me): Simple Harry/OC romance. In the book club right now.

linkffn(Song of the Trees): One of the best built mysteries in the fandom.

linkffn(Invisible Circus) is Ron-Centic with Ron in the role as a spy. Highly recommended if you like Ron.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] is a really good exploration of curse breaking.

Others: linkffn(Stunning Shifts; the albatross did follow; Etc Etc and Life Goes On; Exile by bennybear; Lost Time; Clash by Shezwriter).

Also, most of Northumrian's stuff.

That.... became longer than I had expected.
