From what little we know of her, Narcissa loves her son. What would happen when Lucius's inaction in part of being a death eater leads to Draco's death. I imagine this happening at Malfoy Manor. Narissa destroys the Manor and gives her son a proper burial. She then hunts down deatheaters and slowly kills them and gives her husband a particularly bad death. She helps the Golden Triangle with their search. At the final battle after Voldemort casts the killing Curse on Harry, Narcissa attacks Voldemort. Molly, Augusta, and Andromeda join her in the attack and the combined might of a mother's love defeats Voldemort.
