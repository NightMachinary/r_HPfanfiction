I'm looking for stories where an OC or a reincarnated crossover character is the child of Sirius Black, but Sirius still ended up in Azkaban like canon. Also, the character must have no future knowledge or anything indicating that Sirius is innocent.

I'm particularily looking for the confrontation between Sirius and his wayward child, so ideally recommend stories that didn't die before that could happen please.

*** Thanks! Though I actually know that one; it's the reason I made this post in the first place. Sadly dead before it really got anywhere.
