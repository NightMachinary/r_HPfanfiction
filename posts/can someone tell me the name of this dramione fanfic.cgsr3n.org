I've been thinking about this one dramione fanfic I read a long time ago but can't find it anymore and it's driving me insane!!

Basically the premise is that Hermione marries Draco and kind of slowly falls in love with him even though he's extremely cold to her and cheats on her. They have a daughter and a son and he constantly neglects his daughter who is always vying for his attention. One of the plot points is that Hermione ends up in the hospital after she trips on the stiletto of one of his conquests on the stairs and falls down.

eventually it gets to the point where hermione leaves him because he is way too neglectful of his daughter after he blows up at her for going into his potions lab and draco realizes the error of his ways and tries to convince his family to come back to him.

I definitely read it on fanfiction.net but it could exist elsewhere too possibly ...... HELP ME YALL


** Check out the Dramione Asks tumblr. They're much more helpful.
