** Hello. I am so sorry for my clumsiness. Where should I begin? I am new to this. My first language is German. I was writing this on my iPad which has a German autocorrect. And sometimes it does that without my input. It annoys the hell out of me but I was kind of tired fighting it when I wrote my post. I promise to do better in the future.
