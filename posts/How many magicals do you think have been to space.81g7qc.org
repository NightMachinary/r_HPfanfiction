I would say at least some wizards have been to space even if it was only a magical government getting one of there people onto a muggle space mission.

But when you think about it magic takes makes getting into space a lot cheaper. The only problem is what would a wizard need to go into space for?

Also since Voldemort probably knew it was possible to go to the moon why did he not hide one of his Hocrux there?

Edit: I think if you were to explain the idea of asteroid mining to the goblins the magical world would be doing it with into 5 years


** Considering there's that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Moon_Frog][one guy]] who claimed to have flown to the Moon in the Quibbler, it sounds like very little is known about it by magicals. I suspect that some have /tried/ but they either failed or didn't survive the trip.

*** Yeah, somehow I doubt the bubblehead charm is 100% airtight and could cover your entire body.

**** It allows people to breathe underwater and not smell dung-bombs. That implies that all it does is actually let in oxygen (and perhaps some other gases to get a normal composition of air), and filters everything else out. So yup, probably not air tight at all, and definitely no use in space.

****** I'm not saying it's air tight. I'm noting that the charm is most likely acting like a selectively permeable membrane that probably has some additional functions to keep the air ratio proper. Its main purpose seems to be filtering, not acting as an air tank, so it would be useless in space.

** I think quite a few wizards and witches have been in space --- I wouldn't be surprised if rocks from the moon were useful in some potions. Might be they're actually ingredients in the Wolfsbane Potion? It would certainly explain why it's so expensive. As to other reasons wizards might go there, well, wizard Astronomers who can see Mars with perfect clarity through their enchanted telescopes might want to actually go and see what it's like someday.

About Voldemort, though: he only hid Horcruxes in place that /meant/ something to him. He never felt a particular connection to the Moon, ergo he didn't put one there.

** I think a lot of wizards visited space, but I think magic would behave quite unpredictable there, and the experience would be interesting at the beginning but become quiet boring and unpleasant for them after a while. I think it would be like visiting Antarctic for us, something mainly done by researchers and occasional tourists.

#+end_quote

Because he had no connection to the moon, he didn't want to hide a horcrux at places without significance, he also thought he is already safe with nobody knowing about them and nobody else knowing about the room of requirement.

them doing asteroid mining would actually be a great explanation for how the value of a galleon became so small(quidditch through the ages mentions how in 1269 a hundred and fifty galleons were as much worth as a million galleons today).

** Honestly, I'd assume none have. I mean, we know they can't apparate there, since it's too far and none of them have been there before and since they can't do it easily I doubt they'd do it at all. We know wizards are unaware of muggle technology most of the time, so we know they certainly didn't replicate a rocket and I really doubt the ministry would try get a wizard onto a muggle space exploration mission.

** I don't think any witches or wizards have been into space. Hogwarts students study astronomy and astrology with a very medieval idea of what space looks like. There's one guy who claimed that he did fly to the moon, and gave a bag of frogs to a gossip magazine as proof.

I think muggles are miles ahead in this race. If you need a wizard in space for your story, make him a muggleborn. He could have connections.

Regarding Voldemort and his plan. I don't think he planned on staying alive literally forever. He was a cunning, sentimental S.O.B, who kept all the shards of his remaining soul in England. It's very like ly that he still wanted some form of self-termination possible if he ever got sick of living.

If one horcux is a not-retrievable pebble on the surface of the moon, good luck getting it back after civilication has died because the moon exploded.

Where did you take this from? To the contrary, they seem to be fairly knowledgeable, I mean we see in PoA that they have things such as "perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball".

**** I extrapolated; astronomy and astrology is given as the same course, they use an Astronomy tower (modern day muggle astronomy is often done on the ground because it makes no difference) and both astronomy and astrology are used in Potions and Divination, all of which gave it a more medieval vibe to me. I missed some details, like that galaxy ball, but as far as we know it was perfect from the perspective of a 13 year old. I never interpreted it as an actual perfect model, because such a model wouldn't move noticably. It reminded me more of an orrery, that usually cannot be built to scale.

But I checked and they do indeed have a pretty good grasp on the concept of the universe. They seem to know that Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, is covered in ice. They cover planetary tracks, and can see Venus at midnight (which is pretty much impossible for muggles, since venus is closer to the sun than earth, you can't see it when you are fully turned away from the sun).

I still don't think wizards Have gone to space yet, though, since that conclusion was more based on the fact that one guy DID claim he went to the moon. Not only was this worthy of reporting (which hints that he was either the first or one of very few), his proof was a bag of frogs given to a gossip magazine (which kinda takes away his credibility).

*** It's more that a wizard could have gotten into space for years before the muggle did with magic that has been available for years.

You have magic to make things weigh less ,Unbreakable and air tight and the charms used on brooms would make it trivially easy to escape the earths gravity well.

A muggleborn with an newt in charms could probably make a viable way too travel to the moon over a weekend if they wanted to and there spacecraft would be reusable.

**** It's true that a wizard could do it with magic, but wizards lack a lot of scientific reasoning. Their way of inventing new stuff reminds me very much at throwing things at a wall until something sticks. I don't think they know about the vacuum of space until someone actually attempted to fly through it first.

And why would a wizard fly to the moon, if he doesn't even think of celestial objects as places in the first place. Wizards still used a lot of earth centric astronomy in 1994, after muggles already had common knowledge of heliocentric astronomy. I don't even think that the common wizard knows he can go to the moon, when Ron (a slightly lazy, but decently capable and smart student of 14 or 15 years old) didn't even realise at first glance that a moon covered in rice is a silly idea.

A side note, I don't know if brooms work in a vacuum, and the fact that the quibbler reported that someone (allegedly) went to the moon, already implies that it isn't common nor trivial to go there.\\
But yes, a muggleborn would most definitely have a head start. That's absolutely where you are right.
