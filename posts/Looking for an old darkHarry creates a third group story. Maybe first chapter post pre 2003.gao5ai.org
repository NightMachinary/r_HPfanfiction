I remember that Harry was forced to become a living weapon/werewolf thing with a split personality called "Weapon" on Dumbledore's orders and returning to Hogwarts during 6th or 7th year. Draco, Ginny, and Sirius did as well with Harry's help: Draco became a humanoid Dragon, Ginny a harpy/angel, and Sirius a kitsune. It had old school Blaise cursed to become a ass kicking bunny. They take over Hogwarts, a lot of people die, and Hermione uses a athame. Does anyone remember this?
