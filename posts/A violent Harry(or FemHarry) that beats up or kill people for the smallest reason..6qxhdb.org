I'm bored and and honestly frustrated.

to be fair, I read to many ''Sirius is dead, I can't do anything with out him'' angst Harry, I just want a Harry that will beat or kill anyone that sets him off in a violent mood.

And I mean ANYONE, I don't want no story where doesn't beat up a specific person because of ''she's my first friend(/cough/ Hermione)'' bullshit.

The typical setting: Abusive dursley's took it too far, and Harry had enough and decides too answer back the only way he knows, through physical violence. Ends up as a street rat, is forced to kill out of self defence, happens quite often that Harry becomes too damaged that the smallest thing sets his violent tendecies off.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Due to a severe head injury, Harry experiences a rather extreme change in personality - namely, a sudden tendency to kill people he doesn't like. Awesome!Psycho!Harry, Harry/Luna main pairing, Ãœbermanipulative!Dumbles, major Weasley-bashing

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
