Aunt Petunia had decided if Dudders was going to have to suffer through the diet and exercise program the Smeltings nurse had assigned, the whole family was going to have to suffer. While it was kinda nice to actually be included in the family for once, Harry knew he was the only one that would actually be expected to do it. It wasn't even that intense. It was just a normal amount of training. With a sigh, Harry began to exercise. 100 push-ups. 100 sit-ups. 100 squats. And a 10k run, every single day. His arms had started to make weird clicking noises yesterday, it was probably nothing.

  This story takes the trope/cliche of Harry Potter working out to become a fitness buff to its logical and completely ridiculous endgame. Now it's time to meet Beefcake Harry, Dudebro supreme. Also starring his mentor, a great big buff guy... named Thanos. And stoner Dumbledore, because why not?
