:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I need help finding a fic. I don't remember the name but I'll try to list as many of the details as I can.

fem!harry would kill herself often before she went to hogwarts, using this time to visit Death who was the Harry Potter from our world.

She had Voldemort living in her head and talking to her.

She was basically a god. She made an apple appear in her hands by tricking the universe into believing it was always there.

She once made a rabbit out of eldritch demons and said that he would eat students. This rabbit was then eventually transformed into a boy by her.

She then also helped Voldemort get out of her head into a body she made for him.

I'm pretty sure she had her own table at hogwarts.

Half way through her first year she killed Quirrel and then left school, running a shop on Knockturn Alley with a Vampire asssistant/accountant. She inherited this shop from a dark witch who looked exactly like her but with different coloured hair.

It was eventually revealed that this was actually her using time travel.

She builds a time machine and loads of different versions of herself appear, all telling the previous one what will happen and what to expect. She ends up kidnapping herself once whilst quoting “The Princess Bride” I think.

She once went back in time to Tom Riddles orphanage when he was a young boy and became his mentor figure.

All of this happens before 4th year.

I think it was on A03

I hope someone recognises the fic i'm talking about.

edit:It's been found. Now all I gotta do is find where I left off

At the very least, the first half is definitely this. I don't remember much of the stuff after 'she killed quirrel' though.

*** It was weird but amazing. I just don't remember what happened to it. I was reading it on a safari tab instead of on the app and I must have accidentally deleted it whilst clearing out tons of tabs.

******** I'll check it out. Tbh, the only thing I really vividly remember was tom saying something like "Congratulations Harry, you managed to turn the most feared dark lord gray." That's it.

*** This is it! Did my description help finding it? And I called it a crack fic cause i'm fairly sure they were having trouble thinking of the genre it was in at the beginning of the story, though that might have been a different fic. Regardless it was amazing
