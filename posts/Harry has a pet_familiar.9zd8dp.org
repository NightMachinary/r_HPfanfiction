Ideally, his relationship with his pet/familiar is a significant part of the story. And none of them turns into humans so that Harry can have a harem.

**** Hedwig mostly played litmus test for how evil someone was. Look at how the Dursleys treated her. Look at how Umbridge hurt her. Otherwise, she was more useful than any cat I've ever had.

**** But with that said, one thing a lot of fanfics do (something I think fanon almost always does better than canon, actually) is to treat Hedwig as a familiar -- it's /common/ for fanfics to have Harry talk with Hedwig and have her understand what he's saying in her own way. This doesn't happen (much) in canon. This is also something that seems to be specific to that particular bond -- I can't really think of any fics where /others/ talk to their owls or similar.

**** Yah but like that's what pets are like. I'd be sad if my cat died even if she just like chills on my bed and purrs. It's the audience sympathizing with the loss of a pet. More so because she died for him and was his first friend.

******* No, it's bad writing. If you have established characters, you use them in New and interesting ways, and see how they react.

Having almost every male character be gay is stupid, unrealistic and boring. Unless you are into shitty storytelling.

You don't get to call me homophobic because I don't want to read about a gay relationship that makes no sense.

How about Remus? What the hell happened to him? And how is Harry gay? He is 12 when this becomes a thing.

I asked one of my friends who happened to be gay, and he said that he knew that he was gay when he was 15.

Also someone coming from an abusive household like Harry is in no place to even begin to be in a place to discover that kind of relationship.

So, no I'm not homophobic, just realistic

******** a little boy who talks to snakes going to wizard school to learn magic is perfectly reasonable, but multiple gay people existing within proximity to one another is 'bad writing' and unrealistic? not to shock you, but one of those happens in real life, and the other doesn't. the fact that you cry about it being unrealistic shows you're very ignorant and - wait for it - homophobic. people dancing around trying to make excuses for why they dont want to read about gay people are so boring. call a spade a spade. no one's buying it.

gay 12 year olds exist. gay babies exist bc being gay is an internal part of a person. it doesn't just suddenly 'happen' to you. unless you're screaming in rage at fics which have a 12 year old harry (surrounded by straight people) having an innocent crush on a girl as children do bc you think its 'sexual' and inappropriate, don't pretend there's any other reason for you to be mad than that it's gay people.

once again, its literally fanfiction. i doubt you sit and spam alternate dimension fics screaming about them being 'unrealistic'. get a grip

** oh and serpent tongue is pretty good. it features harry the summer before 5th year meeting a kinda rude snake in the garden. after it bites Dudley in defence of harry, he decides to bolt rather than deal w his aunt & uncle's reactions. it's not massively bleak and isn't edgy, which I appreciated. It's mostly about harry trying to deal w and heal from the events of gof while starting to bond w the snake while they both try and evade the people looking for them throughout London. linkao3(7103419)

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** I was going to post this exact question today! I'd read tales where in medieval times, a witches' familiar was supposed to help in her spells, and in D&D, a wizard's familiar, you can have an empathetic bond and eventually scry on the familiars presence. And didn't Lavender Brown have a pet rabbit in the books she was worried about, but the rabbit was at home and not at school? (or maybe that was a fanfic I read a very very long time ago...) Anyway, to me that says there is a difference in pets and familiars as to which is allowed to bring to boarding school.

â€‹

Owls, I understand; owl post. But that's all: besides Snape threatening Neville with feeding a bad potion to his toad, Trevor, if he messes up in class, there is no mention of WHY the school allows these animals in at all! Sounds like a headache on top of trying to wrangle students for teachers already overnight-babysitting for a year.

â€‹

Hermione's Crookshanks' was supposedly helping Sirius in 3rd year, but that turns out all right in the end because he turned out to be Harry's DogFather. Sirius noted that, I think, at the end of the book in the Shrieking Shack scene. And, there's Mrs. Norris, a Squib's familiar? who helps to patrol the halls for Filch.

â€‹

But: TLDR: yeah, would love to see more interpretations on the purpose and usefulness of the familiars in this magic world.
