** Budchick once started a fic that's a bit like that: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6778133/1/The-Most-Resilient-Parasite-Is-An-Idea][The Most Resilient Parasite Is An Idea]] linkffn(6778133)

The basic premise is that Voldemort won and captured Harry. Rather than kill him, he trapped him in the same sort of layered dreamscape as Inception. His goal is to implant the idea that Voldemort is Harry's ally rather than his enemy. Meanwhile the Order have finally discovered where Harry is being kept, and they send in a team to try to bring him out of the dream.

It's an excelent fic, but sadly it's dead.

(Edit: The fic is marked HP/TMR, but the plot never got far enough to begin any romance, so the pairing doesn't really exist.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter lives at Grimmauld Place with all of his friends and family. There's Mom and Dad, Dad's friends Sirius and Remus, Sirius' cousins Andromeda, Bellatrix and Narcissa and their families, and everything is perfect. He doesn't know who Voldemort is, and he doesn't need anyone telling him to wake up. TMR/HP. Crossover with Inception.
