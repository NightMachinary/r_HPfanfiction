I am currently looking for a beta for my first Harry Potter fic,the beta must know Portuguese,since I tried post a one shoot about the characters and realized it wouldn't work since I need to learn how to adapt to the English writing,the beta also must be very experienced since this is my first fic and I would like writing advice from a experience writer.

The fic is about a Slytherin that is a half blood that was raised by Americans that had a harsh childhood in school,but he eventually befriends albus Severus,scorpious,Rose and the other Mc that is a muggle born that had a normal life and was very popular,and she is in Gryffindor,the main idea of the fic is try to make the wizarding world sounds more global,for example the main vilain is a global treaty that has been recruiting allies to his cause(erase the cast system in the wizarding world)since he graduated from ilyvmorne,the defense against the dark arts teacher is an American that studied with the main villain and the Mc mom,so there will be basically another global war and I also planing to solve the prejudice against Slytherin in this fic,I will also explore the house better in this fic since this will be a Slytherin point of view fic mostly,this fic will be about friendship,family,depression and healing and romance when year four starts(I am planning in making this a franchise fic btw the name is the rise of Slytherin)

  for example the main vilain is a global treaty

How can a global treaty be a villain? Some sort of reverse Kyoto-protocol?

Also, if you want to go "global", you have a lot of reading up to do on 18th-century geopolitics. Assuming that the statute of secrecy went into effect in 1705, you have the 1705 borders, which means countries like Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth or the Holy Roman Empire have a magical equivalent still alive and kicking. At the same time, you have Bulgaria, which did not exist at that point, so there have to be some changes, but keep in mind that "Transilvania" is a canon nation as well, so modern borders are entirely unrealistic. Most of the border changes in Europe are the result of the Treaty of Westphalia, the Congress of Vienna, the German Unification wars in the 1860s and the world wars, none of which concern the magical population.

So basically you have to make up an alternate magical history of Europe just to cover the "direct" neighbourhood so to speak. And we haven't even talked about the "recent" Balkan conflicts, the British Empire and Asia.

Of course, there are plenty of issues just with that. If you look at Silesia, it was passed along between the "Czechs", the "Austrians", Germany and Poland (after the second world war). So the local magical population (at least the established purebloods) are either Austrian or Prussian, with a few Bohemians thrown in between. And you have Polish Muggleborns growing up and being told that their arch enemies (minus Russia) are now ruling over them and the entire education and bureaucracy is in German/Czech. And Silesia is pretty resolved right now, unlike the Balkans. You could have Bosnian kids who lost their parents at Srebrenica being told that they now have to pay their taxes to the magical Serbian government, which will not go over well at all.

See why trying to make sense of Rowling's worldbuilding is an issue if you move even 500 miles from London?

**** To safe you a lot of trouble, Rowling's world building doesn't work outside of Iberia, France and the UK (and France has Alsace-Lorraine as an issue). Especially the amount of students which would be visiting the schools in Asia, we are talking about tens, if not hundreds of thousands of students unless you go with some Mao purges.
