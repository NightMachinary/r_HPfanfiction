I remember harry dying at godric's hollow in hermione's arms. She somehow gets sent to the past and saves James. She makes a vow to Sirius that she is trying to help.

Another part is everyone is eating icecream and hermione freeks out because harry is allergic to the flavor James doesn't believe her (because he's never seen him eat it before) Hermione tries to clean harry up as much as she can and finally James snaps at her after seeing the rash to "let him take care of his own son".

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. --- Begins Mid Deathly Hallows, AU going forward.
