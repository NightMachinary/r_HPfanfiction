I've read a couple of good ones from other fandoms, but never in HP. Are there any out there that are worth reading?


** Butalerner's A Curse of Truth is likely the best one out there. Absolutely incredible (edit: compared to other self-inserts), or it was when I read it a few months ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][*/A Curse of Truth/*]] - /An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot!/

*** I read it a while ago and whilst I don't agree that it's absolutely incredible or even that it's a little incredible for that matter, it's probably the best self insert fic that I've read. That's not a great feat however.

*** Thanks for adding that Edit. It really puts things in proper context.

I thought the ending was very well done. The author tied a lot of great plot points together in interesting ways.

*** Seconding this one. I think it's actually great even without considering it's a self-insert. The banter is of the best I've read in a fanfiction.

*** I think there are actually two with that premise, with one being way better than the other, but I can't remember specifics.

** I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][The Visitor]], but it's incomplete and it's been a few years since the last update. The self-insert character has enough flaws that she didn't seem too mary-sue-ish.

** There was a self-insert that I read a while back that literally had a fanfic reader/writer being pulled into the HP world, complete with foreknowledge and slight confusion as to what was canon and what was not. Really wish I remembered what it was called now. But it was good.

** The most recent self-insert fic I read was called The Story of Tim Parker Adams though the author hasn't updated in almost a year. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10252313/1/The-Story-of-Tim-Parker-Adams-ON-HOLD]]

** The most famous and controversial example of a self insert (kind of not really ish) is Harry Potter and the methods of rationality which is a) by no means normal fanfiction and b) not for everyone

I encourage you to give it a shot instead of listening to everyone else's opinions

But it is very long. Anyway just a heads up

*** I've been reading fanfic for years now. Of course I've heard of HPMoR. It was actually one of the first fics I've ever read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it at the time, although I admit I've soured on it as my exposure to (in my opinion) much better fics increased. Still, I have been meaning to go back it now that its finished.

**** ah yeah I dig. if you've been reading fanfiction for years (so have I) I'd be down to hear some of your favorites

disclosure, HPMOR is my favorite, but it was more about the process, the speculation etc than the actual story. Some of both

***** My absolute favorite is The Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity, if you can count that as fanfiction. Other favorites (in HP) off the top of my head would include Backwards With Purpose by Deadwoodpecker, Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi, and With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat.
