I mean, my favourite pairing is Harry/Gabrielle or Fleur, and it seems like everyone recommends to read Vitam Paramus, but I have read 6 chapters and I can't force myself to read further, it's just so boring. Maybe there is a twist somewhere? Why the hell do people like it? It seems like they just drink and chat meaninglessly, no events after the death of Weasleys and Delacours in chapter 1. Just write why do you like it if you do, I need to decide either I want to carry on or not and you can help me with that.
