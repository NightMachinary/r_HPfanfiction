Looking for stories that really get into what it would be like to go to a magical school. Everyday life is really explored, like racing brooms in the hall, just all around magical shenanigans in Hogwarts. Preferably without too many original characters. I would really like long stories, but if it is a really good one-shot I'd be interested as well. It can also be a subplot in a wider story. Thanks!


** That's pretty much the one thing that linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) pretty much nails.

A very good one that does this is linkffn(What You Leave Behind), though that is a very popular fic.

I feel like I recommend this next one in virtually every other comment I make, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) has this in spades, and if killing a man would get [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]] more time to write and therefore quicker updates, *it would be done, and they will never find the body*.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.

** My favourite go-to fic for this is linkffn(We All Fall After The Yule Ball). Full of shenanigans.

One of my other favourite fics, linkffn(Lesser Evils) does a great job of juxtaposing Harry's role in the war with his constraints at Hogwarts. It's internally consistent and realistic - and far more so than I've seen of most any fic of its kind.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?
