** - [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][/Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council/]] (362,806WL; Updated: Dec 2015; HP × Buffy × Addams Family) spotlighted some experimentation with magical tech, but the protagonists in it are Xander Harris and Wednesday Addams --- Harry's more of a satellite to them.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/][/The Arithmancer/]] (WL: 529,129; Complete) and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/][/RuneMaster/]] (WL: 149,721; Complete) should have some themes you're looking for, but both are mediocre writings, imo.

- /In the Mind of a Scientist/ is supposed to be a scientist!Harry story, but it felt like a poorly made crackfic, so I'd recommend /against/ it.

If you like comic book scientists and Frankenstein, you'll like it. But it is straight up crack.

Or rather, it's Dr Franken Stein if he had grown up as a magical instead of a Meister.

***** Which I think is the point, considering the original premise was that the only thing that changed was Harry being blind and stuff would follow from there, and in the end what happened was that Harry had a reason to see and got more OP for it.

I do think it's a decent story (especially considering Sturgeon's law), but the complaint is valid as far as I care.

**** Being OP is only a problem if it makes the story boring. I didn't think that happened here. The fic isn't about beating Voldemort or some enemy so his power is irrelevant in that regard.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Not Harry Potter fanfiction, but the same author has written some original stuff that's imo better in a lot of ways, found [[http://www.yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/][here]], although much of it (especially /Failed Utopia #4-2/, the /beisutsukai/ series and /Three Worlds Collide/) make sense mostly in the context of his non-fiction writing [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][here]]. I recommend reading 'The Sword of Good' first.

** ... okay, once again overpromoting but in my darkness!harry story harry and his friends do a big project a year while being an impetus for more projects (though they're not inventing, they're just remaking the wheel basically) at the academy. In my startrek!harry story he's the mastermind behind inventions but has other people doing it all.

And in the same vein as my two stories, rorschach's blot's also has an inventor building things off harry's idea.

Not exactly what you're asking for but still gonna link them all.
