So, I love Hermione-any-male-character-but-Ron, but lately I've been annoyed because I feel like everything I read with Hermione is her being the protected, worried one. Either she's seeing someone and patches them up after the blood quill or they're the ones who cause her pain. I'd just like to see something where Hermione is in a relationship with someone who is protective of her and wants to take care of her, instead of the other way around. Full story, preferably.

Though I do love how kick-ass she is. I'm just looking for a change.


** Usually, my complaint regarding many Harry/Hermione fics is that Harry does all the protecting, and she's the damsel in distress, or the one in need of help.

Check "Healing Hermione" for an example of the "Weak hermione in need of being saved by the powerful Harry" fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][Robst]] likes writing this type of stories. For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10669760/1/Don-t-look-back-in-Anger][Don't look back in Anger]], Harry would go aggressively after anyone who threatened Hermione.

**** Haha. Excellent! It is a Hr/SS. Basically Hermione posts in the personal section for a BDSM relationship, and ends up with Snape. He helps her deal with stuff from the war. Also, super smutty :) [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600098714]]

Chemistry and Timing though it is a bit of both. Hr/RL linkffn(7860277)

** I like writing Capable Hermione with someone who wants to protect her. Here's one of my less smutty stories where she has to learn how to live without being able to see.

** It's tropey and sappy but Harry Potter and the Soul Mate Bond by Kiera Marcos could fit the bill. Harry is super powered, Lord Potter, etc.. But he does do his best to look out for her.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
