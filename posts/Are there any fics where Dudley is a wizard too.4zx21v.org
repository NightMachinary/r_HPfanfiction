** There is only one that I'm aware of. linkffn(Magical Relations) is an interesting premise, though I believe its characterization of Dudley isn't particularly well done. Let me know what you think.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** There was one Peggy Sue fic, I can't remember the name. Dudley got blasted back through time--by accident--and was eleven years old again. He got magic through the time travel, and is desperate to make amends with his cousin. He goes straight to Dumbledore about the whole thing, and at one point, I think he beat up Malfoy.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

  Dudley Dursley has many regrets about his past. But he never ever thought that he would end up back in time, and He defiantly never thought he would be able to do magic or go anywhere near Hogwarts, let alone attend it. This all happen because of a necklace he got from a yard sale. gen. fic Time-travel Rated T for possible violence in the future.

**** Author fiat, mostly.

Snape is pretty massively OOC in the story.

Also, Dudley's being a wizard was not causally related to Snape's behavior.

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.
