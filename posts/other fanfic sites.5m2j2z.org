** [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php][Ashwinder]] (Sycophant Hex), [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080210191944/http://www.chantico.com/darksarcasm/][DarkSarcasm]], and [WIKTT Archive]([[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=82][www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=82]]) for Snape/Hermione

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/][Occlumency]] (also Sycophant Hex), thepotionsmaster.net for Snape

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/][The Petulant Poetess]] for Hermione

I'm not sure how specific these are (I'm at work so the internet is blocking my access): [[http://patronuscharm.net/]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/]], [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/index.php]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/]], [[http://www.sugarquill.net/]], [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/]], [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/]], [[http://hpfandom.net/eff/]], [[http://www.huntinghorcruxes.themaplebookshelf.com/]], other sub-archives of Sycophant Hex (Sappho and Eros, Chaos, and Lumos).

Don't forget LiveJournal. There are probably a whole bunch of fics there, but they may be harder to find. There are also a few that are on archive.org like Dark Sarcasm.

** There's quite a few old ones that originally coalesced around particular pairings. Finding what you want on them may be more difficult though. Off the top of my head there's Sycophant Hex, Hawthorne and Vine (DHr--pretty sure there's others out there for other pairings but a rec sent me to this one recently), tthfanfic.org has mainly buffy crossovers but some only hp (I enjoyed Hermoine Granger and the boy who lived if you like superpowered hermione) muggle net has it's own fic hosting, and of course there's always the adult fanfiction (never really liked the quality there) and livejournal (if you're tryiing to navigate lj my advice is to find a community or author you like and apply tags--if you're really lucky there may also be a delicious community fic listing. Everything I mentioned here is mostly kinda old so cannon may not be up to date.

There's also tumblr but I can't help you with tumblr.
