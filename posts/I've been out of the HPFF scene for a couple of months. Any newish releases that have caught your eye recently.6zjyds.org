** Linkffn(10629488) Blood Crest is about a young Harry who gets apprentices to a necromancer preHogwarts. Really realistic take on learning. Harry isn't summoning spirits or a dark art prodigy (in fact he takes a long time doing a simple levitation and animation charm and knows only the most basic magic), yet he experience some truly gruesome and DARK magic. It blends some of the more truly twisted part of magic with a very realistic Harry. Love his characterization and his dialog. His master is an OC but is very fleshed out and interesting. Even better, Harry will be going to Hogwarts, so it'll be interesting to see that interaction.

Next is Linkffn(12331839) Realignment. A very powerful and magically proficient Harry goes back in time to kill Tom Riddle, resulting in conflict with both Dumbledore and Grindelward. Has some of the best dueling scenes that I've read. Dumbledore' characterization is so on point it's canon to me. Same can be said with Tom's and there interactions are realistic while keeping true to their nature. The dialogue are written exceptionally well.

Linkffn(11950816) Harry Potter and the Game. I don't think it's as good as the previous two, but it's really entertaining. Harry is given the gamer ability, which makes him a lot more powerful, but the author makes Voldemort and antagonistic elements more dangerous as well.

Linkffn(12388283) The many deaths of Harry Potter . Completed! Harry time loop every times he die, and Voldemort is a lot more active and more dangerous.

Linkffn(12350003) Weeb is comedic and complete. The hp world is modernize (internet, anime) and that influence the way Harry thinks about and explores magic.

Well hopefully, linkbot works, if not google the names + Harry Potter fanfic should get you the link. Happy reading!

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged.

Hermione Granger, Demonologist is a delightful (so far) fic where pre-Hogwarts Hermione learns how to summon demons and befriends them. Judging by the summary though, it's going to get dark eventually, but I find it a good read thus far.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete - updates with a new chapter every Tuesday.
