** Ideal is challenging to find! There are definitely things I look for though, and a combination of some of them is usually enough to keep me reading.

1. Readable grammar, spelling, and structure. I don't typically nitpick but it's important. If every other sentence has an error, or if there is absolutely no 'flow' to reading, it's hard to get invested. Huge blocks of paragraphs and terribly structured dialogue usually affect this more than misspelling a spell's name.
2. Magic as a feature of the story. I don't particularly care about the specifics, but I like reading about magic and the feeling of wonder that characters get when they learn it. The only exception is mathematical magic systems. That feels so anathematic to the HP universe.
3. Reasonable uniqueness of the plot (subversion acceptable, fanon not). Usually a problem with shipping/some want of a nail fics, I find that just forcing a story to adhere to EVERY canon plot point with the same characters to be tedious and unbearable to read. There are some massive loops writers tied themselves into just to make sure a Slytherin Harry still receives the Map, for one example. I like something that feels different and like I haven't read it ten times before.
4. A competent protagonist. I much prefer to read about someone whose invested in betting their life and situation than someone who allows all opportunity to pass them by. Doesn't have to devolve into an Indy!Harry story by any means, but cracking a book would be nice

** 1 Readability, obviously.

2 Anti-Muggle Wank: I don't want to read fics about how muggles are superior or about guns/martial arts beating wizards. Wizarding society surely must have cuisine, cultural events, drugs that Muggles don't have.

3 Imperfect Hermione: I've read too many fics with Mary Sue! Hermione where she's the prettiest, smartest, bestest at everything. I really like how Hermione is portrayed in "Victoria Potter". She's really smart but also so fucking annoying, has no social skills, can't ever imagine anyone else being better than her etc.

4 No easy redemption for Snape or Malfoy: The other good characters in the fic can't see Snape or Malfoy as a good person/tortured soul unless the fic is set in an AU and they never joined the Death Eaters. Malfoy can be redeemed if he spent ~10 years in prison for attempted murder and his family fortune is drastically reduced.

5 No politically savvy 11 year olds/no weird romance scenes about 11 year olds.

6 Magic as a part of the story. I occasionally read slice of life/romance/family/friendship fics but for a fic to be ideal, magic definitely has to play a big role.

7 Smooth/diverse magical combat scenes. If the fic has a combat focus, I don't want to read 15 scenes of people casting stupefy at each other.

** My ideal rests somewhere between Rorschach blot's make a wish and some crossovers. it changes wildly depending on my mood though the constants are fairly...constant. 1-Good Grammar (though fairly obvious i have bad grammar which is why i dont write) 2-consistent characterization, by this I mean i dont like it when for a seemingly minor reason a character does a complete about face personality wise.(if its a build up of minor things that lead to a mahor upheaval in the characters life its more acceptable to me)

** Hard to define /exactly/ the ideal fanfic, since I kinda believe any theme or ship or story can be done well or can be done poorly. But there are some things an ideal story would need for me, I guess:

1. No bashing

2. The writing flows (not necessarily perfect grammar or anything, just good flow)(which bad grammar can mess up, but not always)

3. Gives me something new (a feeling, a perspective, an idea)

4. Doesn't hit any triggers/squicks

5. Ends

(Edit) 6. Is self-contained as a story/Doesn't need previous knowledge of anything except the source material (e.g. when fandom discourse/headcanons/personal opinions/real life events are introduced with zero explanation)

Doesn't mean a story can't be /good/ without any of these, just that it can't be /perfect/.

** A really good WBWL styled fanfic with Slytherin Harry (something similar to The Prince of Slytherin), but Harry's twin is a girl rather then a boy. I just think it would make for an interesting change.

** A plot that is actually progressing, and doesn't overly adhere to canon events.

Good grammar and spelling, obviously.

If there's a pairing with Harry, I prefer it to be Harry/Ginny or Harry/Ron. And Ron absolutely has to be friends with Harry. Aka no Ron bash, no dumbing down Ron. Preferrably a fic that plays on his strategic strengths.

Ideally, Hermione wouldn't be close friends with Harry and Ron. Though if the plot had to adhere to canon, I'd like to see one where Harry and Ron manage without Hermione. But that's like my dream fic, and I've never come across anything like it.

** 1.  Good SPAG, flow and characterization. Doesn't take 200k+ words to get through year 1 (PS was under 80k) for example, and the characters have to be reasonably characterized.

2.  No bashing.

3.  No MarySue!Hermione (see my complaints with Fanon!Hermione [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jvue3g/hermione_is_not_allowed_to_be_flawed_in_most_hp/gcnbryu/][here]]. Taure's Victoria Potter has the best Hermione I've seen so far.

4.  No Muggle OR Wizard wank. A compare/contrast between the two and the things they provide to each other would be great. Authors like to project themselves on one side or the other and it's really cringy and obvious when they do.

5.  Good magic system with consistancy.

6.  Fem!Harry is always nice to see.

7.  Incorporate some lesser-used characters. I've seen plenty Hermione/Neville/Draco/the twins subplots and redemption arcs, it's time for something different. Maybe Ron, the Creeveys, Percy, Montague, and canon OCs (à la Daphne Greengrass).

8.  Minimal canon rehash.

9.  Character-driven vs plot driven. Plot is still important but I like seeing charcters learn and grow up too.

10. Competent protagonist. Enough said.

11. Is complete.

** Readable

Has the trio being friends with students from other houses and just a focus on how the houses get along/learning to get along in general

One that points out the flaws in Hogwarts (like how the point system kinda sucks)

Hermione isn't perfect

All the characters have flaws and aren't perfect because that's annoying

Explores the possibilities with Magic and the questions magic brings

The Dursley's get punished for being awful to Harry

I'd like to see one where Dudley becomes better and even friends with Harry

The weasleys or another family notices how shitty Harry's home life is and takes him in as their own (could go with the Dursley's getting punished/called out thing)

Harry isn't some overpowered lord-Potter-Black person who can do anything because again the perfect characters that gets boring fast imo.

** My ideal changes very frequently now that I think about it. Solid writing is always good, and I'm always a sucker for really long fics, but in terms of tropes/genre it varies.

Lately I've been on a bit of a dark!Harry kick, not necessarily violent or immoral Harry, but fics where he uses dark magic and aligns more with voldemort than Dumbledore. I've also been more into character/relationship focused stories than action stories. I'm also on a bit of a world-building kick, especially expanding on dark magic and take some aspects of magic from druidry.

Of course, a couple weeks ago I would've said pretty much the complete opposite lol

** 1. A coherent plot;

2. Canon compliant but ideally set in a different era or the main story told from someone's POV whose perspective varies greatly from that of Harry's;

3. If there is a point of divergence from the main plot, the characters should remain consistent with their canon description;

4. Primarily focused on adventure/magic. Ideally romance is in the background and doesn't play a significant role to the main plot;

5. The author represents the perspective and the behavior of the characters according to their age. E.g. you can't expect an 11 year old to have such a complex view of the world or a really solid moral compass as an adult.

** This is fun!! I think these are some constants I look for all the time:

1) Slow burn that makes me excited for the two to finally get together. If Draco is in the pairing, as he often is in the fics I read, I want him to work hard for his redemption before the romance really gets going.

2) A big story, both in length and in scope, which weaves in the protagonist's goal and the world building. I want the plot to go new places, see interesting things, and make me feel like I'm in a wider magical community.

3) Believable and interesting side characters who contribute to the overall story. I want to care about them. I don't want the two individuals to be in a story all by themselves.

4) Interesting magical world-building that uses canon as a starting point. This is last on my list because it should be something in the background, not the main focus.

** 1-)I should be able to read it with my two eyes.

2-)No 10000 words long author notes except maybe at the begining of the first chapter.

3-) No needless bashing of any character.

4-)No changing a characters race, religion or ethnicity just because of feeling like it. If it is important enough to dedicate a mention, it should be important enough to effect the plot in a meaningful way otherwise it is irrelevant and not needed.

5-)No powerwank where harry just stares at Voldemort and Voldemort is vaporized.

6-) No politically savy 12 year olds.

7-)No five chapters long shopping trip where Harry and his harem buy things that will never come up in the story ever again.

8-)No Lord-too-many-titles-Hadrianioius-Potter.

9-)Actually good plot flow. sometimes i start only to realise first chapter is the middle of it and i will never see the begining of the story.

10-)Magic. There is a reason why i am reading Harry Potter fanfiction. It is to see some magic. So i expect magic to be a big, BIG part of the story.

11-)Harry/Hermione pairing. I ocasionally like reading other stories too but this i like.

12-)Actual character development.

** Forgetting writing quality, because duhh

I like a good fluffy romance, where the conflict is external to the couple and couldn't be resolved with a honest conversation, as a major part of the plot

Magic should be a factor in the plot.

A single point of divergence.

A logical butterfly effect from that point, starting with small changes, before blossoming into bigger ones.

A good pace with well written moments of heroics

Something that dosen't contradict cannon beyond the events as caused by the SPOD

** Ah this is hard.

1.  Quality writing. I'm not sure how to explain but there are fics that feel like a published book and ones that while decent/fun read as...I don't know a less experienced writer. But quality writing usually has a tighter plot with little useless information, has foreshadowing, leaves clues, has a distinct tone, makes u feel a lot of emotion, brings things full circle, etc. It doesn't just feel like a summary of this happened then this then this.

2.  Excellent characterization. Give me a ton of depth and nuance for a character that only has brief mentions in canon, expand on it and have that be relevant to the plot. Or show me a canon character who we know fairly well but show me them in a new situation or from someone else perspective where they can maybe be seen in a different light.

3.  If this will be more AU or make a character dark or give a darker character a redemption arc. That's fine but make it believable. A darker character should have to really earn their redemption and the other characters should respond believably. Or if a character is going to go dark then put them in a situation where the negative side of their canon character traits become more prominent. Like, a dark Harry you can focus on his tunnel vision like he had with draco in HBP then go from there. Like use canon traits to show me how a character just snaps under the right circumstances. I'm not even against very OOC horror stuff like maybe it's a thing where all the characters are the same but just a bit off and it has a very creepy feel to it. That's interesting and cool if it's well written!

4.  If there is smut please let it be good. If you aren't experienced with what you are writing please research. This goes for straight people writing gay/lesbian smut, for people who want to write bdsm scenes, etc. I also like when the characters personality in the bedroom is written believably. Like, I'm not saying a character can't be dominant in the bedroom just because they are “dominant” in regular life but I like to see their personality shine believably in the bedroom in mannerisms, quirks, phrases, kinks, etc. please understand female anatomy/orgasm/arousal.

5.  No one is ever using the term “pup”

6.  If they are 11 they should be written as speaking/thinking like an 11 year old unless it some kind of dark child thing like maybe Tom as a kid, or some kind of possession or dark influence thing, or even a dark gifted child.

7.  An interesting well thought out plot and good world building.

8.  OC characters can be necessary but I want them to be believable and necessary and contribute something to the plot and people interact with them in a believable way. I don't want them thrown into canon events for no reason. Also names that make sense. And very distinct personality. I don't want to read a bland self insert character. Like the OC needs a personality that dictates their behavior and gives the other characters something to react to.

9.  Good pacing....not too slow...not too fast...problems not solved too easily...fluff fine but don't want anything to feel like filler.

10. I don't mind reading about violence, gore, very dark thoughts, dark themes, abuse, toxic characters, mental health, etc (I'm a big horror fan). I just want it to feel necessary to the plot and treated believably. Like people who have tragic back stories usually have behavior that reflects this. People who are sexually assaulted react different ways but don't just get over it the next day.
