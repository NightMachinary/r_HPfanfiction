Looking for a super old fic that was once on checkmated. Synopsis and title below.

âœ­ Lucky - ron/hermione - NC-17 After an especially horrid year and a broken marriage, Hermione hopes to bring some luck into her New Year with the help of a friend. .

Any help would be wonderful!


** Who is this Rob you speak of?

Please tell me it isn't Hermione and Robert Pattinson. I got enough of him when he played Cedric in GoF as it was.

***** Tale of a Winter Witch is actually quite decent if you can live with the fact that Hermione doesn't start to bring technology such as the toilet or printing press to a medieval world where she is stuck in. The pairing was done reasonably well, it's the world building that's struggling there.

******* I'm writing a oneshot where Hermione brings technology to Westeros because she wants to exterminate slavery once she learns where Slavers Bay got its name from.
