** Super wizards are a whole can of worms I don't want to get into, but reminds me of a line from Wind Shear ("The same thing that's stopping me and him from deciding that, because you don't listen to us, and are, in fact, being purposely obtuse and obstinate in regards to this, that the lot of you should be summarily dealt with." Dumbledore stated with an edge to his voice that immediately made the governors stiffen. "Our desire to maintain civility for both ourselves and society.")

​

I think you missed the biggest issue with extreme power imbalance in personal relationships. The stronger wizard will have greater efficiency in most tasks compared to a weaker wizard/muggle. So they will be able to clean the house, take out the trash, make dinner, and all the other household chores better and faster than their weaker partner. This will most likely lead to resentment on both sides. The strong one will probably end up doing more and resent the weak one for not doing as much. While the weak one will resent the strong one for not doing x with a flick of the wand while it takes the weak one 15 minutes to do it.

** A lot of these themes are prevelant in Superman books, especially the power dynamic aspect.

Can we truly trust a god on earth, who himself proclaims that he is merely a man, with a mans flaws?

We know that Kal El is a truly kind and good soul, but how can anyone in universe know it for certain?

As for the relationship, Clark also displays a great example of power difference in a long term and loving relationship. Seriously, Lois Lane not only is targeted for being his Supercrush, but also had to give birth to and raise a half Kryptonian, who could crush a car when he was a toddler, and she still makes it work.

When it comes to the manipulation that a powerfull wizard could inflict on someone else, it all comes down to the story.

When done well Love and Trust being stronger than suspicion and doubt can be moving and powerfull. When portrayed poorly, it can seem naive, and incredibly preachy.

*** Everyone who wants something of the former, check out *Superman: American Alien*. A funny, sad, touching and hopeful story of the man who would become Superman. Max Landis may not be my favourite writer but he poured his soul into this book.

Other good recommendations are *Superman for All Seasons*, *Superman: Earth One* (second and third volumes) and *Superman: Rebirth* series by Peter Tomasi. But *American Alien* is quintessential.

** Good point, but will be easily overlooked on !power fanfics.

But reading this post I had a short idea....

​

#+begin_quote
  but did that actually happen, or did they put a fake memory in your head?

He did. He did exactly that for decades. He portrayed them a normal and mundane life. The happy every after.

Because she could no longer perceive the outside world after the incident.

Is he still the monster for that?

​

Just the idea he would do that, but for a good/nice (or maybe desperate) reason. Not to be cruel but out of compassion. Did anyone wrote something like this?

** Agreed with everything you say. People today speak a lot about mary sues, but gary stues are rarely mentioned. And well, both are quite flawed types of characters. The protagonist should, as you say, be relatable in one way, or another. And an antagonist should be able to actually challenge the protagonist. That is the entire point of an antagonist.

In general, I feel like people are too lazy to put in actual thought, research, and work, in general, to create a character, that may be powerful, talented, but not overly so. A character, that would have flaws to overcome, and nuances, that would make the character interesting.

I understand, that people are not being payed for writing fanfiction. But don't they want to actually write good stories, anyways, before sharing them online?

**** An what is the point, I may ask, to upload your story online, if not to share it, and get feedback? To get other peoples' opinion on your work?

***** I don't know what the point is either! I just uploaded mine because my friend Achille does it! But I don't even upload anymore now because I do not see the point. I write for myself.

** Those are good points, and ones that would be interesting to see explored in super!harry fics.

Tone down the power level though, and I'd argue it's not such a big issue as you make it out to be when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Let's say Harry is Voldemort's equal in power as a teenager, and above that as an adult. So no world bending directly to his will, just command over magic few in history achieve. Why would it matter if he can single-handedly defeat five regular wizards or fifty? Dueling skills just aren't relevant to daily life.

** There's a cross over with MCU that addresses this, where Nick Fury finds out about adult Harry and his crazy powers. Pretty good read but i remember it wasnt finished.
