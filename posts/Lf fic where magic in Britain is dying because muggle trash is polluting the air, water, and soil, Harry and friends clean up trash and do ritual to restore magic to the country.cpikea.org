:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Been trying to Google for the fic for a couple days with no luck, wanted to recommend it for the 'wizards fight climate change' post, but can't find it. I remember that there's newspaper articles about muggles seeing flashing lights, but I think they attribute it to aliens rather than guessing it's magic.
