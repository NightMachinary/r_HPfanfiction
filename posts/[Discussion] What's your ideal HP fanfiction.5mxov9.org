General plot, main characters, genre, writing style, pairings (or lack thereof), how it ends and/or begins, cool scenes, symbolism, etc. -- anything you want.

Let's hear about your ideal read.


** I can't really say what sorts of fanfic I like, because it's a special mix of different things that attracts me.

I like romance, but I don't want it to be overly sappy or mushy. I don't want to be /told/ that these two people are in love because blah blah blah. I want to see it for myself in their subtle gestures and interactions.

I like humor, but I hate most comedy fanfics. Because they just don't feature my sort of humor. My sense of humor is a bit on the dry side and maybe sometimes a bit snarky. I didn't find the pranks the Marauders or Weasley twins played in the books funny, and I particularly don't find it funny in fanfiction. That sort of humor is kind of a drag, to be honest. I like it when characters have witty, somewhat sassy exchanges. Self-deprecating humor is also nice when done well.

As far as this subreddit goes, I seem to be in the minority in that I really dislike the super long fics. It always seems like the author creates all these unneeded subplots and tries to juggle POV from ten different characters when I'd really rather focus on one character's journey.

And lastly, I like fics where the characters understand the concept of "middle ground." Not everything needs to be good or bad, wrong or right. I like when the grey area in between is explored. Like Hermione and her house elf crusade. Good on her for wanting to improve their lot in life. But one thing that's often ignored is you can't just tell them all "you're free" and then leave them to their own devices. That's pretty much what the US did to slaves at the end of the Civil War and over a century later, there are /still/ areas where the descendants of those freed are struggling. Instead of just releasing elves and letting them figure out the rest on their own, why not learn more about the apparently symbiotic relationship they seem to have with Wizards (Dobby appears to be the anomaly, and Winky's reaction is implied to be the more "normal" one in-universe for sudden onset elven freedom). There has to be some way of improving the elves' living conditions without driving them to a drunken depression. The notion that "Slavery is bad, so we're going to end it abruptly and then everything will be okay!" is rather immaturely optimistic.

** Well, I know that no-one else is going to write exactly what I want to read... so I might as well suppose that I would be the writer.

I'd keep the canon myth arc (Harry Potter vs. Voldemort, the self-fulfilling prophecy, etc) but keep the tone more consistent throughout. The early books, written for younger readers, are very incongruous in comparison to the later books, which were naturally meant for a more mature audience that had grown with the series. I get a very real sense that the first few books are like a completely different world from the last few books, and that's always jarred me.

I'd include lots of awesome magical stuff instead of just rehashing canon's magical spells and paraphernalia - part of the charm of JKR's magic, in my eyes, was that there was always something new. Teleportation via /fireplace/!? Flying soul-sucking zombies and animal guardian spirits!? Disembodied brains with memory-tentacles!? Sweet!

For that matter, I'd also like to explore some of the underlying metaphysics of the 'verse - why and how does magic work? Is there really an afterlife, as implied? What is the afterlife like? Where did magic come from, who were the first wizards?

Also, I'd include femslash, to pander to my lesbian ass. Because I'm trash.

** I'd like to see a fanfiction that plays with politics but without Harry being some type of lord. Something where Harry, Hermione, and Ron aren't just fighting against a dark lord, but instead an entire rich pureblood society that looks down on everyone. Perhaps a world where Slytherin was an odd one out for believing that everyone should be taught.

Maybe Hermione gets sent to a lower class school. Not to mention Harry is a bit of a lepper for the lone heir of the Potter clan marrying, and dying for a muggle/muggleborn. The houses would still be considered somewhat in the same light. Gryffindor is consider the best because they're brave. Hufflepuff is for the loyal, but is still looked down upon. Ravenclaw is considred only for the smartest. And Slytherin is for the cunning, but is almost alway full of half-bloods.

Basically I want something that actually tries to make the "Dumbledoor is evil, and Voldemort is good" trope actually work. Of course it'd be something a bit more Grey with Voldemort's group still basically being "Magical Terrorist" just witha good cause.

** For me, my ideal read would basically be canon, but with a few changes. I'd like to see more of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. I'd like to see Harry be taught more by Dumbledore ( Harry suddenly being this absolute master at the end of book six seems a little odd) about magic and things like that - if only to explore magic as a concept further. I'd like to see more development of Ginny as a character and her relationship with Harry. It seems a touch rushed, which I understand was JKR's attempt to convey young love, but I feel I'd like to know a bit more about her. I'd like to see more of Harry's relationship with Sirius, and how that affects him.

My completely different ideal fic, is a Harry/Ginny fic where Harry is brought up by Sirius as his fathers son, ie a bit of a womaniser, strong willed, gets into a bit of trouble, etc., and also gets a bit more training. Basically, I want to see the progression of Harry so I can believe he is capable of holding his own against Voldemort, rather than it just kinda happening.

*** My interpretations of canon magic is that JKR had the most important parts as conceptual- "meaning" the unforgivables, the power of love, dementors as depression, the story of death and noble sacrifice, etc. If the students are writing multiple feet on a spell for homework, it's clear that there's a lot we don't know about that JKR glossed over for just regular spells.

I think it's well within the bounds of canon for Harry to just get better because he's taking classes- we generally see no more than 3 sessions of any class for a given year, and even the end of year exams are brief (unimportant) in the grand scheme of the story. Dumbledore is leagues better at magic than Harry and doesn't really need to teach Harry anything more than what Hogwarts already prepares him for, but does need to teach Harry to understand Voldemort. Hermione uses defensive spells to protect the campsite in DH, but those could very well be standard NEWT/post-OWL level charms. Hogwarts may not explicitly cover making new spells, considering the creativity required, but it's fair to say that they indirectly teach the foundations for it if Snape's inventing multiple spells when he's 15/16

**** I think I understand what you're saying, but to me t doesn't quite add up. At the end of a year out of school, not being taught, so he has the skills of a 6th year, he manages to at the very least hold his own against a wizard who is described as one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time. He gets taken down easily by snape at the end of book six, yet at the end of book 7, a mere year later, he manages to defeat Snape's master. While it could have been that Harry was reading books, or whatever, some explicit mention would be better. It somewhat ruins the end of the books for me, as it completely kills my suspension of disbelief in that final battle.

***** At the end of book 7, it wasn't dueling skills that let him take down Voldemort. It's all conceptual.

Magic has its own rules but is largely dependent on intent rather than specific spells (i.e. Tonks packing Harry's stuff by saying "Pack" with a wave of her wand at the beginning of OOTP). Accepting that basic premise of selfless sacrifice (walking to his death without fighting back) borne out of love providing protection, it's clear that JKR is attempting to evoke the results of heroism. While the Horcrux ritual is said to have something to it beyond just killing, according to JKR interviews, there's no indication that the magic that protected Harry involved any of the common fanfiction tropes- blood magic, soul magic, etc. There's also the interpretation that Harry survived because Voldemort took his blood for the reincarnation. He won his final duel because he was the master of the Elder wand, even if he never claimed it himself, resulting in Voldemort killing himself with his own spell once more. In any case, Harry didn't beat Voldemort because of anything he studied. In canon, it was always due to a set of circumstances that goes beyond standard rules of magic.

If you're familiar with the Nasuverse, or really many other fantasy universes, this isn't uncommon. Voldemort is intended to be evil with no remorse, no redeeming quality explaining it. I really don't how JKR treats him as already evil at the age of 10, but it's not uncommon in literature to have a villain who is naturally evil, especially when the original backbone of HP is a fairy story. In fanfic, some of my favorite stories involved a more realistic descent into darkness, but in canon, it's largely glossed over for a reason.

Finally, Harry is a hero, but he's not pure- he's cast the imperius, the cruciatus, etc. However, his overall inner good and final sacrifice still protect those that he's fighting for.

^{On a slightly related note, I'm actually not even sure what the trio were even doing once Ron left.}

Edit: That's not to say I don't like fics where Harry can actually match up to Voldemort. Although I've come to dislike "magical core" fics, I do like the concept of . However, canonically, that's not what is required for Harry to fight Voldemort. That's why one of the fics I recently read that I really loved was the H-Hr-N-L fic where they go to an AU Hogwarts after an accident in the Lestrange Vault, where Severus, Remus, and Lily are friends and professors in the AU Hogwarts, Harry was never born, Neville died at the end of AU GoF, and the Malfoys are among the Order and leaders of the fight against Voldemort. In it, Luna and Dumbledore both hint at how the end doesn't come from clever stratagems or learning powerful spells, but from the larger concept of intended self-sacrifice.

** Well, I'm not too sure how popular this kind of opinion is, but my Ideal ff should stick pretty close to canon, while also expanding on it, without blowing it our of proportion. I am a sucker for the "Magic A is Magic A" trope, so I like fics that get a bit technical but without losing the magic of, well, Magic.

I'm a diehard H/Hr shipper, but I can work with most ships that are *well developed and not rushed*. This means that if a relationship is to be a part of the story, it should be done slowly and carefully.

I also /absolutely despise/ bashing. To me its presence in a story is the mark of a bad author, and I completely refuse to read stories that feature it. This is the same with "Evil, manipulative Dumbledore" fics, which could be interesting if the premise wasn't so overused everywhere on FF.net.

All in all, my ideal fic would be a 6th year canon compliant H/Hr pairing with a bit more of screentime for the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. And Ron, more Ron is always good (When he is well written).

** My go-to fics are Harry/Ginny post war angsty stuff and my ideal fic is actually a combination of 4 or 5 actual fics already written, with each fic getting about 80% there to what I consider "ideal."

Ultimately I want a story that shows the impact the war would have on the relationships of the characters. I also like when the Harry/Ginny relationship is consistent with the tone Rowling set out in the books. They go great together but this is a realistic relationship prone to typical relationship issues and not some "we know we'll be together forever from the first time we kissed" relationship. As such, my ideal fic has the couple struggling to deal with not seeing each other while Ginny is away. They both get a little jealous of others hitting on each other, perhaps Harry isn't writing as much as he should, and Ginny equally focuses too much on Quidditch and NEWTs.

There is enough in canon to suggest these two could have some issues with communicating, jealousy, and having career ambitions conflict with the relationship.

I would like a fic where eventually one or the other, preferably Ginny, to break it off due to the stress of not seeing each other. Neither wants to date someone else but are convinced by friends to get back out there. Let's say Ginny breaks it off, and is convinced to try and go on a date with the guy who has been flirting with her all year, and she finds that while the date is technically great and she should like this guy, she just can't because Harry is the one for her and always has been. It's cliche and sappy, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for that stuff.

Or, I also find I enjoy fics where an ex of Ginny or Harry try to cause problems (unsuccessfully). While canonically, I doubt Dean would try to steal Ginny from Harry, I also don't think Ginny and Dean would be good friends and Dean would be totally cool with her and Harry. I like the idea of Dean trying to win her back while he is at school with Ginny and Harry is away. I read a story like that which was almost exactly what I'd want in that plot line.

And another: I liked a story I read where Neville was kinda Ginny's best friend because of their shared experiences that last year, and he falls in love with her and gets weird. My ideal fic could potentially use that plot line, or at least go into how Neville and Ginny share something that her and Harry don't, and how Harry feels about that. Perhaps Ginny could talk about how she envied the relationship Harry has with Ron and Hermione and is insecure about never being on their level of closeness.

While this is going on, there is a separate side story involving the uprooting of corruption in the Ministry. Harry and Ron are heavily involved. I just think changing the way the Ministry runs is a huge and necessary lift. I always thought it interesting that Rowling said Lucius Malfoy got away with everything again, which shows that the Ministry is still as corrupt as ever.

** Centred on indy Harry with mentor Dumbledore (and loyal Ron if he's involved at all) going up against competent and evil Voldemort. Preferably Harry paired with a girl who isn't Hermione, Ginny or Luna. A lot of magically magic and less of a gunfight style of duelling. Hopefully Hermione isn't in the story or has minimal effect and dies horribly because of her devotion to rules or authority figures.

Decent amount of humour and light-heartedness, with minimal angst.

At this point I've read so many things, I really go for AU stuff. More authors should branch out like Inverarity with the Quick and Hogwarts House Divided. I can live with stations-of-the-canon rehash, but it better be through the lens of major changes. I wish the fandom community had more ideas for replacement villains. I kinda prefer stories to begin after the Tournament, if only because they can avoid a half dozen chapters rehashing events. At least with WBWL stories there is a different tension than canon.

** Non-romantic Hermione fics. Not in the sense that I don't want there to be any romance, but I don't want it to be the main theme. So many Hermione centric fics are Hermione/Someone (usually Draco or Snape for some reason) which really rarely interest me. However, fics where Hermione is tweaked a little bit to take on a more protagonist role, are fantastic to me. I'm really into an author who explores the specifics of magical mechanics, and Hermione is exactly the sort of person who asks those sorts of questions.

I feel like Rowling has already told Harry's story. All these Slytherin!Harry, Genius!Harry, Disabled!Harry stories are cool, but Harry Potter himself feels more like a burden than a boon, as the author is forced to work around Rowling's plot and characterisation.

Also, I favour more nuanced interpretations of unsympathetic characters, such as Malfoy, Snape, Pansy and Lockhart. Yes, Draco's a whiny little bitch, but some of my best friends have been whiny little bitches--he doesn't always have to be antagonistic.

**** Sure, but I'd argue those are more in the vein of fixfics, creating deliberate contrasts and parallels to canon. I do enjoy those from time to time, but if you want to explore a particular aspect of Potterverse (e.g. Hufflepuff house, science vs magic), you're much better served with a different main character.

I suppose you could go completely AU , so that Harry is no longer recognisable as his canon self (HPBWL comes to mind). But at that point you may as well be honest and go with an OC. Sadly, OC fics just aren't as widely read.

** I'd like to see more well written postwar fics in the style of CIS, House of Cards, and West Wing. It's now canon that Hermione made it to Minister 20 years after the Battle, so how she got there would make an excellent story. Unfortunately, I've yet to see a SINGLE decent fic that addressed her professional career.

I have written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/598o74/the_fics_that_you_want_to_read_or_write_what_are/d96lnq0/][a plot bunny]] about a postwar 'dark Hermione' scenario before, by using only canon facts. It's probably a too dark interpretation, but I think nevertheless a plausible one, because 20 years is a long time, and politics and power will change people greatly. In addition, Harry was ready to crucio his enemies without a shred of remorse by the end of DH, so he was not a nice person by that point and not the law-abiding 'saint' depicted in so many postwar fics.

Furthermore, I ask all of you who have children these questions:

**** No, the British Ministry was by magnitudes worse.

The US government has its faults, but it's still better compared to the great majority of Muggle governments in the world, who are in turn still a lot better than the British Ministry of Magic.

The fact it was using soul-sucking monsters to torture minor criminal offenders should tell you how bad it was. In addition, this government was utterly ineffective against genocidal and ruthless terrorists.

Now look at the US, it had made lots of mistakes, big ones even, but it had established one of first world's constitutional republic; freed its own slaves; overcame (or tried to) its racism; defeated one genocidal maniac; stood up to two other totalitarian monsters; and let humanity to unprecedented improvement in living standards. Before you think how miserable your country is, take a look at history and find out how badly it sucked back then! Also, look around in other countries and find out how many of them are really better of than you.

***** I was being a bit tongue in cheek, but you make a valid argument.

That being said, keep in mind that perspective is based on the person. Someone who is in one social bubble of a country is going to see something vastly different from someone in another. So someone who's always been upper-middle class with all of the benefits that come with that upbringing is going to have a /vastly/ different outlook on the state of the government than someone who's hovered right at the poverty line since birth. And maybe you can't make a side by side comparison between the two governments (I'm sure that wizarding Britain has it's bragging points as well), but the US government has a /lot/ to answer for in its failings for certain demographics.

I can love my country while still being honest about its faults, and the USA has a lot of faults. And saying "other people have had it worse!" doesn't really change the fact that it's still pretty bad for some people. That's like telling someone who's just been stabbed "Well at least you weren't shot. Other people are hurt worse than you are." The fact that someone else was hurt worse does not change the experience of the person who was stabbed.

Buuuuut that's probably too heavy a debate to get into in this particular subreddit. :) I was joking for the most part in the original reply.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** A fic where everything gets ramped up to 11, and the consequences of that. Massive wizarding warfare, not skirmishes. Powerful wizards able to level small towns with a single spell, to say nothing of Voldemort. Lots of political intrigue and everybody being massive assholes to each other. Everything is grey, no black or white at all.

Not to mention Harry would also be at the core of it all, but this wouldn't be a super Harry fic. No, everybody else would be elevated to super Harry levels as well. It's like Eliezer Yudkowsky said in one of his guides once: if you give Frodo a lightsaber, you have to give Sauron a Death Star. Let's have Harry's plots crash and burn, his friends killed off and his ass kicked in fights. Let the final, desperate ploy come a hair's breadth away from utter failure. And then let's see him rise from the wreckage, anger burning in his eyes, clothes and skin torn, wand shattered, limbs broken, meeting death head on and then let's see him kill the big bad in a massive duel that on a scale that kills thousands with the fallout.

Let's have a fic about a conflict between two men large and catastrophic enough to be called a war.

** I like romantic fics in which you see Harry starting a relationship with a girl. Good storybuilding is necessary because otherwise it becomes very cheesy and boring. I also like a bit of action but that's not a must for me. I just read Contractual Invalidation, linkffn(11697407) which is a HP/Daphne Greengrass fic. The story is good, doesn't get stale and is mainly focussed on the romance. I wish there were more stories like that.

I also like it when Harry interacts with the muggle world like in Grow Young With Me (linkffn(11111990)). Harry is just Harry, not an OP monster who slaughters everyone and saves the pretty girl. No, just something that can happen in the real world as well.

** Two types. I dislike the epilogue but part of it because its so happily ever after. A post war dealling with the trials and Magical britian recovering, the stress of being the man who conquered all while dealing with the deaths. I want to see realism slap Hermione round the face. I call bullshit on her ever making minister without riding Harry's coat tails hard. I can only think of one fic where its pointed out she'd be an awful person to work with. I want this to lead to a fracture in the relationship in the trio as Harry becomes even more closed off than before while Ron and Hermione try and make it work. I've got some notes towards a story where this leads Harry to taking a holiday to discover who he is as a person. Me being me it leads him into Daphne who tears him apart for not using his titles to change what he wants and still moaning.

Alternatively I would love more Harry tutored by Dumbledore. I don't care if the Horcrux dies early or if they aren't even in the story but Harry exploring magic with Dumbledore would be awesome. I would love a story about a Slytherin Harry who when he asks Dumbledore if he has to go back to the Dursleys causes flash backs of Riddle so Dumbledore lets Harry stay at the castle over summer and takes an interest in his education. No Hermione or Ron but focusing on that point where Harry spends too much time with adults to be a child but too young to do much. Draco Malfoy accusing the headmaster of blatant favourtism and being right but who cares? Harry thrives under the watchful eye of Dumbledore and tears apart the triwizard. We watch him chafe under umbridge as his regular pattern is disrupted and Dumbledore has to stop him from interfering and removing her. I want him to be based out of Hogwarts during the war as he and Dumbledore argue about the place of morality in war and what is acceptable.

I like my Hermione mature, strong, intelligent, and independent...but flawed. Usually some form of stubbornness, hot-headed, reactive, etc.

My favorite brand of Severus is basically the Byronic hero: acerbic, brooding, snarky, aloof, brilliant, powerful, but inwardly hurting and vulnerable...low self-confidence, guilt-ridden, self-loathing, damaged goods.

I like there being an actual plot around which their slow-burning relationship can build. "The Other Side of Darkness" by Abby is an example. I don't always like fics that are SOLELY about building their relationship (like "Post Tenebras, Lux" by Loten).

** I think there are two main things that are most important for me: Character voices and theme.

Character voices: If I can't hear the characters speak when they talk the fic is not going to work. I can deal with some amount of OOC-ness if it is explained in the Author notes (like... Harry didn't live with the Dursley, but was raised by Remus and is smarter because of it), but the "core" of the Character has to be intact. I guess I believe in some form of existentialism like Joss Whedon. Basically this is just a big talk about "nature vs. nurture", but I just can't enjoy a story at all that assumes nurture is all-defining (absolutely loathe brainwashing fics... Harry is raised by Voldemort and becomes a loyal follower). I realize this is a hot button topic, but you are asking a very subjective question. IMHO there's lots of scientific evidence that nature plays a much larger role in development than some people like to believe (because it's a nice fantasy to believe you can make anything out of yourself if you just work hard enough). Okay, I'm going way too far here. In conclusion: Characters are super important, my ideal fic has the core Harry Potter characters in it in a way that I can clearly recognize them. Exploring different avenues and shades of their characters is absolutely okay and interesting.

Theme: Harry Potter for me is about friendship, adventure and a lot of wholesome stuff. My ideal fic is propably a lot more adult than JKRs writing (I like a good amount of sexual references and violence, because that's real life), but I have yet to enjoy a Dark-Gritty type of fic (that vibe belongs to A Song of Ice and Fire). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love George R. R. Martins writing, but such a bleak world IMHO has no place in a Harry Potter story and a fic that completely abandons the positive attitude of the series doesn't really feel Harry Potter-ish to me.

It's really hard to get that right though, because a lot of fics (like those by popular author Robst) completely abandon all adversity and become pure fluff. If you want to have a story about overcoming obstacles and evil it has to have some amount of conflict and difficulty in the first place. There has to be a low point where all seems to be lost, but then hope instead of despair dominates the story.

I realize I'm talking about very abstract and high concept stuff in this concept, but these things are much more important for my "ideal" fanfic, than more technical things like plot and structure. If you get these two things right you'll probably have a fantastic fic, even if it follows the most basic of plots. This is probably the reason why I love Harry Potter so much, even though a lot of stuff that happens in the canon story is super dumb and ridiculous: "Wait, so you are telling me that there is a magical artifact that can force someone to do basically anything without consent and a murderous Death Eater can so perfectly impersonate a (in)famous Auror known for his paranoia that not even one of the smartest Wizards, Dumbledore, can see through his act for months? Ahh, who cares, I wonder how Harry and his friends will get through this?"

Edit: Oh almost forgot, of course my ideal fic has almost none of the canon pairings. No Remus/Tonks (blech), no Harry/Ginny (yeah great, your main protagonist should totally hook up with a non-character for most of the series) and Ron/Hermione (kill-me-now, this is the worst). Over the years I've noticed that I will read basically any pairing (except Slash, just not into that very much), even though I of course have my preferences, but the canon "Romances" are literally the worst I can come up with (okay, Draco/Hermione propably comes close in awfulness to Ron/Hermione, but I've read one or two convincing post-Hogwarts stories that I actually found more... acceptable than canon; The idea that Hermione would willingly condemn herself to a life with Ron Weasley fills me with a deep sadness and tragic despair... it's not really describable in words... yeah yeah, I'm being overly dramatic, sue me)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** I'm a total sucker for Lily/James. I ADORE linkffn(The Life and Times) , as it's a bit more adult and almost grittily realistic for the times in parts, but I also love more silly fics like linkffn(Commentarius) . An in depth retelling of Lily and James' story, right through their battle against the Dark Lord, would be my ideal fic. Something mainly canon compliant, but certainly expanding on their lives.

Ideally a little deeper than your average 'share a dorm, patrol together' fic.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Well, let's make a list - shall we? ;)

Main Character: Harry (all the way, I like one shots about others, but long stories? Far and in between)

Genre: Gen or Romance (and long, with a decent plot)

Writing style: Like in the books themselves!

Plot: A true heroes journey, no deconstructing/ruining the hero (like - IMHO - Rowling did in her last book when she made Harry even more clueless and kind of lost!). More cool magic, some learning/training, some sense of wounder (Harry not being a damned lazy fool) with Harry being interested in certain magic fields (whatever they may be) but not a slouch in others etc. exploration of the world outside of Britain (also a fave of mine!) and magics that Hogwarts does not teach (how about Vodoo or Blood-Magic etc.) :) No lazy pushover Harry (that's why I hate canon Harry, he never really stands up for himself, he's too busy feeling sorry for himself a lot of the time! "I want to be just Harry"...) Politics are always great (if well written - Harry walking all over Dumbledore is amusing sometimes, but not very realistic IMHO!) No rushed relationships, no crappylogue (sorry, but I hate the Harry/Ginny ship and I hate Hermione/Ron even more, mostly because I hate Ron (bad friend and useless IMHO - I say this despite the downvotes I'll get for disliking a fan-favorite!)), no putting Hermione on a pedestal (she ain't so great IMHO, she's not a new Dumbledore or Voldemort - she's a great and intelligent student, but not a prodigy!) etc. etc. :)
