Andromeda is in the order and doesn't trust him. It definitely has the classic Slytherin hierarchy. I'm pretty sure he had to sign or swear some kind of oath but he mostly gets passed it. Dumbledore and Andromeda met with Harry in the three broomsticks or leaky couldren to see if they would induct him into the order.
