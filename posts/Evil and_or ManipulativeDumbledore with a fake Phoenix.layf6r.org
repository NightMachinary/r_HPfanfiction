:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's fic finding time again! I'm looking for a fic that had an Manipulative!Dumbledore who may or may not have even dipped into Evil!Dumbledore. He had a magical bird that was supposed telling of a bad character with similar abilities to a Phoenix, and he used Alchemy to make it look like a Phoenix.

I /think/ in this fic as well Voldemort was actually a product of Dumbledore manipulating Tom Riddle to become another Dark Lord so Dumbledore can be seen in the good light and get even more power. All Voldy wanted was someone to see how bad of a person Dumbledore was. Though that could be a separate fic. I read a lot of this type of fics at the same time.

Any help or even similar fics are welcome, thanks!

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
