Looking for interesting/believable Luna/Rolf stories.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. I love Luna, she's one of my favorite characters but sometimes the author makes her too weird/crazy to the point it wouldn't make sense. Please keep her characterization believable.
