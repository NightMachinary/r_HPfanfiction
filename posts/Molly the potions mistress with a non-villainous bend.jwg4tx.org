Most stories about Molly the potions mistress have her provide love potions for Ginny to ensnare Harry or for Ron to do the same to Hermione, so why not Molly the potions mistress with a non-villainous bend:

- Molly made the love potion for consensual use with Arthur as a sexual role playing device
- She made it as a part of an interdisciplinary project between Potions and Defense Against The Dark Arts on how to detect love potions and counteract them
- One of her friends was a lesbian, in an arranged marriage with some pureblood bigwig and needed to get "into the mood" artificially to produce a heir
- She produces potions for the use against Death Eaters
- Or something I lack the creativity to think of


** She notices Harry seems under-fed, so laces all the food she sends him during the summer with nutrient-fortifying potions.

** Harry was mildly confused that day, at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Molly Weasley had called him over to the kitchen, where several small cauldrons were simmering with potions - a sickly sweet smell overpowered several others.

"Harry. Dumbledore thought - and I agreed - that we might have to have a talk about certain things - specifically, about girls starting to notice you. Given your fame, and I know you don't like it already, some girls might use... Less-than-moral methods of ensnaring you."

Harry realized, with a grim and embarrassed face, that she was right. Last year, he'd already caught a few third-years giggling and reading Potions books that he decidedly didn't remember in the third-year curriculum.

"I thought, with that in mind, it'd be a good idea to teach you to recognize various love potions. See these cauldrons? They contain every love potion that's legal to brew, and one that decidedly isn't."

Harry nodded. He might not like it, but Molly was absolutely right. The knowledge was prudent, especially with a lot of his fans currently experiencing puberty.

"Now, this first one, which puts the drinker in an affectionate mood towards the first person they see, is the easiest to recognize - it smells sickly-sweet, no matter what you try to disguise it."

Harry nodded. He imagined this potion was the most legal one, given how easy it was to recognize and how much work would have to go into ensuring the drinker saw the right person first.

Molly, meanwhile, had moved on to the next cauldron - which contained a colorless, syrupy potion. "This next one's transferred with skin contact, meant to increase how pleasant that contact feels to the point of being highly addicting. It leaves a slight sheen on the skin, like so..." With that, Molly put a little bit of the oil on her hand, then showed it to Harry. It was hard to spot - had Harry not known better, he could have confused it for a cosmetic, but there was something unnatural about it that Harry couldn't place. He was sure he could recognize it if someone tried to touch him with it on, though.

"This one's Amortentia, the most powerful one and not exactly legal to brew except for educational purposes. It can leave the drinker with a powerful infatuation towards whomever made the potion. It smells of something dear to whomever smells it."

Molly waved her wand, banishing the first potion - the one with the strong, sickly-sweet smell - and clearing the air for the Amortentia to be noticeable. It was strange - somehow the new smell reminded him of broom-polish, treacle tart, and a flowery scent he couldn't quite place but was sure he'd smelled at the Burrow before. And quite recently at Grimmauld Place, come to think of it.

"For unknown reasons, the only food that can be laced with this potion is chocolate - any other food will make the potion not work anymore, so just be aware of anonymous gifts of chocolate or girls who seem oddly eager to give you some. In a drink, it'll create heart-shaped bubbles at the surface, so that's how you'd recognize a drink laced with it."

Harry reckoned that this information would probably be the most useful, committing the sight of the bubbles to memory and resolving to immediately destroy any chocolate he wasn't sure of the origin of.

"Now, Harry. Could you help me clean out these cauldrons? I'll have to brew a nutritional potion, and Arthur and myself are long overdue for a booster against the Black Cat flu..."

I wholeheartedly support Wholesome Potions-teacher Molly, as I did in another prompt (if I can find what I made then, I'll reply to myself and copypaste it). Here's Potions!Molly teaching Harry how to recognize love-potions, which will come in handy in sixth year.

*** Found the one from the old thread, too. Copypaste below:

Good!Potions!Molly:

--------------

"Today, we'll be learning about the Draught of Affection, which makes the drinker feel affectionate towards anyone for a few hours... It's usually used to, well, never you mind that. I'll tell you once you graduate.

Now, don't expect true love to come from this - or any - potion, or for the affection to be directed at you. When I say "anyone", I mean exactly that, it'll make the drinker affectionate towards whomever they interact with, for the hour the potion lasts. Don't make the mistakes I did... Oh, but if I start reminiscing now we'll never finish our assignments.

There, instructions are on the board. Be careful to crush those seeds - your textbook wrongly says to cut them. Crushing is easier and releases more juice, not to mention it keeps you from having to handle a knife. Don't want anyone to lose a finger, after all.

MISS PARKINSON! HOW DARE YOU TRY TO KILL MY SON! THAT'LL BE A HUNDRED POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN, AND IF YOU EVER DO IT AGAIN I'LL SEE YOU EXPELLED! Ronald, dear, go put on some clean underwear, you probably need it after that explosion. Off you go!"

I have trouble writing Molly Weasley as a bad person (which Potions!Molly often is), but I am 100% on board with "kind but embarrassing parent Molly" who just happens to be good at Potions. Kind of hoping this snippet will spark a full-length fic from someone who's better at writing prompt-fics than me.

** I'd imagine that they were both interested in each other, but Arthur was too shy to ask her out. Maybe Molly found out about this through a mutual friend and used the potion to give him the confidence he needed.

Another thing Weasley bashing fics often point out is that they already knew where the entrance to platform 9 3/4 was, but Mrs. Weasley was being really loud and conspicuous about reminding everyone. People interpret this as a setup to make Harry find the Weasleys, but there's a more benign explanation:

Mrs. Weasley is being conspicuous so that she could get the attention of any muggleborn who needed directions to the platform.

*** I recently reread books 1 and 2, and I agree with a post I saw the other day: it is really plausible that the Weasley parents are just engaging the kids at their level.

I loudly ask a lot of questions for my kids to have a chance to answer, and I mess up pronunciation and simple facts on purpose all the time.

** She laces the food she makes with love potions. But she doesn't do it to ensnare anyone (the dosages are far too low for that), but because food literally made with love tastes better.

*** What I could imagine is her lacing food with love-potions in low dosages as a form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatism][Mithridatism]]. Making her kids and Harry gradually immune to a specific love potion just in case someone tries to take advantage of them.

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatism][Mithridatism]]*

Mithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a poison by gradually self-administering non-lethal amounts. The word is derived from Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus, who so feared being poisoned that he regularly ingested small doses, aiming to develop immunity.

​

so many options there: healing, glamour/polyjuice, invisibility, thrown-potion vials(bombs), felix felicis, draught of living death for Voldy while they hunt for his horcruxes...

That's what fanfiction writers have *Molly* often do to facilitate Weasley bashing.

** /me remembers one fic where Daphne knew about Harry and Hermione being potioned (and had sex, not with each other) and did exacttly nothing because some people allow love potions to be used on them consentually, to enhance effects. (This wasn't case here. It was Manipulative!Dumledore fic).

Daphne's opione changed when she becomes persobally involved.

/me also remembers other fic where Arthur allowed himself to be potioned, except that Molly didn't knew about one dirty secret of her new family. Now she also have to take part.
