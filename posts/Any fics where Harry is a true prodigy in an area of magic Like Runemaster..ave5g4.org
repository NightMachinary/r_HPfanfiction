As the above says. Any stories that feature Harry going above, and beyond an aspect of magic. By prodigy I don't mean him being a damn good Transfiguration student, no I mean if he was a Transfiguration prodigy he'd be doing thing the examiners have never seen ala Dumbledore. How about even a COMC prodigy ala Newt. Go nuts, as long as he is doing remarkable things with said field of magic(whatever field it is), but also stays in bounds of the story somewhat. I don't it it bein a little out of bounds, but i'd rather it isn't so farfetched that i'd look at it, and say "that's just not possible, how can he transfigure an entire island into chocolate."

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  "Mr. Potter's placement test was one of, if not, the finest entrance examinations in the history of Durmstrang. The young man did things with a wand I would never have believed possible from an eleven year-old."
#+end_quote

He's skipped several years and he's still top of his class. He discovered an entirely new principle of transfiguration and it got published in what's basically the world's foremost scientific journal, but for transfiguration. Oh, and he beat Grindelwald's academic record that stood for 97 years.

After having spent a grand total of 6 weeks at Hogwarts, this Harry was transfiguring at a level that would be impressive for a fourth year student.

*** Geek Of Magic is brilliant, but I decided to stop reading until it is completed, or hasn't been updated in six months. The way the story flows makes it way better to read in one sitting instead of waiting for chapters. I haven't read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, because it sounded very tropy. Is ge OP, and/pr learns Wandless magic easily. Sorry, it just sounds like that kind of story, and I wouldn't mind spoilers much if you could clear it up a bit.

**** I would say it's actually not really tropey at all. IIRC, he doesn't know any wandless magic. I don't think it has any of the usual living Potters, wrong boy-who-lived or brother of the boy-who-lived-tropes. His family gets along just fine, with some minor speed bumps. Dumbledore doesn't suspect he's the next Dark Lord - He even helped Harry convince his parents to allow him to go to Durmstrang.

I mean he's OP for his age, but that's what being a prodigy of magic means. The upper year students shouldn't have much of a problem beating him if they were to fight, to say nothing of experienced adult wizards. It really doesn't come up though, he's not getting into fights. The canon plot stuff happens at Hogwarts, and his brother is the one going through that. I imagine that if the fic continued, he'd be pretty fearsome by the time he graduated. That's just how it goes if the character is a real prodigy.

Other than talent, the reason he's so good is that magic is his passion and he's been studying it for years before going to school, as much as his parents would allow. It's basically all he does in his free time.
