And is almost immediately found out as a time traveller.

Update: Pretty sure he first went to Ottery and met an orphan, and then walked up to the burrow and met Ginny who invited him to play. He said his name was Harry Evans. Molly seemed to recognise him, so she flood Albus, who came, Harry outed himself, and then outed Peter.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.Eventual Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. Tags will be updated when it becomes relevant.

*** Umm... I don't think They're looking for a specific story, just any recommendations that have that as a plot point. Or I could be wrong and they should have used 'Fix Search' instead of 'Request'.
