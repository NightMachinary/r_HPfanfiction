I am writing a vampire Harry Potter fanfiction, and was wondering if anyone had a good crossover idea for when I finish the Hogwarts Arc.

** Hmm. Grimm, Supernatural, Heroes, Skyrim. I would say if it's just HP so far, turning it into a crossover may feel jarring.

** I second 'what we do in the shadows' - and there's also The Count from Sesame Street (could be fun!) or the League of Temperance from Diskworld. The Lamashtu of IRL Mythology could also be interesting, given that it kidnaps children (Harry raised by a near-feral Vamp could be /real/ fun).

**** The Count and whatever the fucked-up-Clanger back-up singers were from the Mahna Mahna song. 'cause those things were definitely some kind of vampire. :D

**** Doesn't it? It's a criminally under-utilised area, Harry being raised by 'Dark Creatures'. The only one I've really seen that doesn't devolve into ABO or something similarly kinky-smut is Dark Healer, where he's raised by a Hag, or No Competition, where he's raised by a small village of different Dark Creatures.

** When I read "vampire Harry", I think /My Immortal/, which is a crossover with tween goth culture. Am I the only one?

** No ones mentioned it but I think a crossover with Dark Hunters could be interesting...

That being said as someone mentioned though, it could be jarring to just add a crossover so I'd suggest to reread the book with how you add the crossover and see if it's smooth.
