So, shameless self-promotion alert: this is my story. I've been waiting to post it until I had a decent backlog of material.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]]

Summary: A curse goes astray, and the course of history is forever altered. When the Brothers Dumbledore cross wands with Gellert Grindelwald, both Ariana and dark plots survive the encounter. Born in a world where Albus Dumbledore is more infamous than famous, Harry Potter charts his own course on a journey of love and loss, friendship and betrayal, truth and reconciliation.

A few words on what the thing is about, where it's going, what I'm interested in talking about or devoting screen time to:

1. An exploration and expansion of Hogwarts as a truly magical place -- I want to capture that sense of wonder first-years feel when they see the castle for the first time, and let Harry really delve into the castle's secrets -- of which there will be many only hinted at in canon (or completely made up by me.) Hogwarts has a 1,000-year history with unprecedentedly clever founders and tens of thousands of the brightest wizards and witches of the day all leaving their mark on the place. Secret rooms, tapestry puzzles, forbidden knowledge, hidden passageways and hidden dangers. (There will be no physical manifestation of Hogwarts that gifts Harry with all sorts of silly powers, though. Don't worry. The castle is alive with magic but it's not alive.)

2. A different trio of main characters. Canon focused on Harry, Ron, and Hermione. In this story, Harry is exactly one year older, and is in Cho Chang's year. The ‘trio' of this book will be Harry, Cho, and Cedric. I always thought Cho and Cedric got a raw deal in canon -- they were mostly there to be foils for Harry. In Cho's case, a generically pretty love interest, and in Cedric's, a generically perfect do-gooder to make Voldemort look extra-evil when he had Peter casually murder him. So, expect Cho and Cedric to get a lot of character development and screen time. They won't replace Ron and Hermione -- don't expect Cedric to suddenly sprout red hair and a massive inferiority complex, or Cho to morph into a bookworm heroine. They're their own characters. Ron and Hermione (especially Hermione) will have their own roles.

3. A believable, slow burning, in-depth love story. I'm a sucker for a good love story. In reading (a lot of) Harry Potter fanfiction over the past year and a half, I've been really drawn to Harry/Fleur stories, partly because Fleur is an extremely interesting character to me, especially the way her ‘fanon' personality has evolved, and partly because there are so few stories that feature this pairing that nail it, and so many that come oh-so close. Of course, your mileage may vary, but it's how I feel and it's a big part of why I wrote this. Also, a word of warning (or reassurance, depending on your predilections): There will be no special veela life debt magic, no soul bonds, no veela “marking”, no marriage contracts, nor any other kind of relationship cheat codes. If Fleur and Harry are going to make a go of it, they'll have to come by their love honestly.

4. A believably powerful, proactive Harry Potter. My version of Harry will be reasonably near to Dumbledore and Voldemort's league in the end, but it'll be a long, tough road to reach that level, and he'll do it without the help of a fortuitously-powerful ancient magic that he's gifted through random chance or Fate. Almost all of the magic that Harry wields will be the magic in and hinted at in the books, and it will be available to anyone with the dedication and talent to master it. Harry will also rabidly, sometimes ruthlessly protect the right to control his own destiny. If this is setting off some alarm bells in your head about certain types of fanfics, all I can I say is that there are no bad clichés, only bad writers. I've made a sincere effort to come up with unique and fun ideas, and most of the wild stuff I've thought up I haven't read anywhere else, but there are over 600,000 HP stories on this site alone, so by the law of Sufficiently Large Numbers... no promises.

Anyway... have at it!


** I really hate the Australian OC. He reminds me of fics that use American OCs that go to Hogwarts for contrived reasons and criticize everything about Britain and the dumb-asses that live there. I really hope he doesn't have regular appearances.

Other than that, I really like the memory mystery and the fact that Cedric and Cho are major players. I'm also curious as to why Aberforth of all people is at Hogwarts. He has never seemed type to enjoy teaching. It's still pretty new without too much substance yet, but I'm following it and looking forward to more.

*** Yeah, the whole "Aussie" thing was a definite misstep and has since been removed. I toned down Vaisey a lot in the last revision. He doesn't have a large role to play, in any case. There just aren't that many named characters in Cho's year.

Nice pickup on the Aberforth thing; you're right, he's /not/ that fond of teaching, and being Headmaster isn't really in his wheelhouse. But he's the option that works for the major players: the Ministry thinks he's a weak Headmaster they can push around, and Albus obviously has an in with him, so it works for him as well.

*** Good Harry/Fleur stories are pretty thin on the ground, which is one reason I wanted to write mine. If you check my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elaneanasazi][FF.net profile]], I've got writeups for my personal top 20 HP stories. A few of them are Harry/Fleur.

** I read it, and I have to say it's pretty good. You're a much stronger writer than most I come across. I'd say pacing is your biggest issue at the moment, the time jumps across the first year seem a bit jarring to me. Overall strong though.

*** Regarding pacing issues - I was actually concerned that it might go the other direction. I mean, 40K words and just now getting into the summer after first year seems like I need to speed things up, not slow them down.

Glad you like the writing; thanks for giving it a chance!

** Like the writing, the characterisation, the AU setting and the mystery. So far the only worry I have is that Harry's magical skills have developed far too early, but we've already discussed that.

*** Yeah, the nonverbal Shield Charm was probably a bit much. Hopefully it was mitigated a bit in this last chapter, where the Aurors indicate that it was a really pathetic one that barely stopped a low-level jinx from a first-year.

**** Alas I'm afraid it's not much of a mitigation, as it's still more than canon Harry could do in HBP. I mean, a non-verbal weak shield is still significantly more advanced than a verbal strong one.

***** Hmm... I guess my question is, assuming the Aurors are on the lookout for odd behavior from Harry, would you think a /verbal/ Shield Charm would be sufficiently "weird"? That's what I had originally, but considering the reaction (calling in the heavyweights, forcing Legilimency on him), I figured the inciting incident needed to be pretty dramatic.

****** The shield charm isn't normally learnt until 5th year for the OWLs, so yeah I'd say a first year casting OWL-level magic would be enough to make you think the person had years of thorough, comprehensive magical education. Especially as said Aurors are already suspicious and on the lookout for any hint of unexplained knowledge.

To be honest if I were you I'd drop the shield charm altogether. You could replace it with Harry blocking the spell, which was conceivably within the capabilities of second years as we were first shown it in CoS (admittedly by Lockhart lol). Also, as it's a /technique/ rather than a /spell/ it requires Harry to have much less theoretical knowledge (knowing the shield charm rather goes against the idea of him having a hodge-podge education, as it's a pretty advanced concept in DADA. Would be like an 11 year old knowing calculus but not trigonometry).

******* That seems reasonable. I've never been quite clear on how spell-blocking worked in canon, though. From what I remember, the most clear example is when Snape shuts down Harry at the end of HBP, and it seems to be a fairly advanced technique that at least peripherally involves Legilimency. Or is what Snape is doing there something else entirely?

******** Yeah, it's very vague. CoS implied that to block a spell you have to make a certain wand motion. Snape in HBP showed the legilimency can be used to great effect in blocking spells which implies that knowledge of what spell is being used helps.

My headcanon is basically this:

1. You can prevent a spell from completing by making a blocking wand movement /simultaneous/ with the casting of that spell. (Blocking can't be used on a spell that has fully formed)

2. Weak spells like jinxes can be blocked with a general block, but other classes of spells require specific blocks. Some spells require a block which is particular to that spell alone, and the Killing Curse has no block.

3. Blocking anything other than weak jinxes is extremely difficult as you have to very quickly identify what spell it is and use the appropriate block. In practice the only way for it to work is by trained reflex as you don't have the time to think it through in the second or so it takes for the caster to complete the spell.

4. Identification can occur by the first syllables of the incantation, the wand movements, any visual effects the spell has during formation, legilimency, or if you're very skilled like Dumbledore you can sense the magic.
