Slytherin Harry was one of my first favorite kinds of fic when I first got started. I still like it but im more picky about it than I used to be.

I love plot driven fics that put a emphasis on friendship over romance I like seeing a exploration of succeeding using Slytherin values( cunning ambition etc) I like Draco being friends with Harry. Ya hes awful in the books even when hes a kid. But he is a kid with the right influence he could have been as rebellious as Sirius though maybe in more subtle ways. I like exploration of the wizarding society

I dislike when it feels like they make the Griffindors dicks for simply being Griffindors. The house rivalry will be there sure sometimes there will be bullies but at least those bullies wont bully the same exact way that Draco did in the books.

I dislike it when the characters suddenly become emotionally intelligent because they are in Slytherin or are close to Slytherins. Some will be most won't. Hermione isnt fem Tom Riddle she accidentally upsets people becsuse emotional intelligence isnt her Forte. Tom Riddle could minipulate someones crush on him to getting him the cup of Hufflepuff

I dislike romance centric plots or the characters suddenly being very suave in romance. Like...they are still like preteens and teens wait till at least 6th or 7th year for them to be less awkward. I also like romance starting later in series if it happens. Im just not that interested in romance when they younger.

I dislike Harrys twin stories, Genderbending, Dramione, OC ships and anyone of Harys year with the marauders generation or anyone older than that generation. Even if its a time travel fic.

I dislike generic bully Draco. Its just boring.

Long fics preferably complete its fine if its not. Het slash and femslash are all fine if there are ships.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  Book 1 out of 7 in my rewrite of the series. During his trip to Diagon Alley, Harry meets a young blonde boy starting Hogwarts as well. Harry quickly befriends him and figures he might as well be in same house as him. Slytherin!Harry, NON-Slash, "Ron-Bashing"?,

** I recently finished catching up with Prince of Slytherin. There's quite a few interesting plots and a very competent Pettigrew. It's WBWL though.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** While I'm not a fan of this fic, partly because of all its cliches (WBWL, teen politicians, the whole "Slytherin Prince" with his throne and everything . . .), one of the few things I appreciate is the "innovative" way it treats some characters like Peter Pettigrew, or Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. And also the fact that it try to stay away from bashing (from what I remember, the closest thing to bashing would be James, and even there is really toned down and somewhat explained?)
