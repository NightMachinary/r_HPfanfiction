I could think many stories but never came across a Fanfiction based on this "draco dormiens nunquam titillandus" quote.


** Ah, one of my favorite ancient Tumblr posts.

#+begin_quote
  do you ever think Draco Malfoy would get cocky that his name is in the actual Hogwarts school motto? 'yes Potter, DRACO dormiens nunquam titillandus, not /harry/ dormiens nunquam titillandus. Ha. Never tickle a sleeping Harry. Sounds ridiculous.'

** There's a fic written from Salazar Slytherin's POV where he exasperatedly reminsces about how the motto was made because Gryffindor actually tickled a sleeping dragon or something like that but I can't find it anywhere.

*** The one where he reincarnates into Harry? linkao3(Ouroboros by NovusArs)

It's quote good - lots of good worldbuilding and history stuff (can't speak about the IRL accuracy but it seems on point) and well-written. Continually updating, and lots of hinting towards manipulative!Dumbles if that's a turn off.

  Salazar Slytherin woke up in the body of a three year old boy with the most ridiculous head of black hair and a runic scar craved into his forehead. The last thing he recalled was dying. Now it is over 900 years in the future. What is a wizard to do?

** Tom knew he was special. It was just a question of time before he would go beyond the realms of magical knowledge, and everyone should know about his might. What a better way to make history than poking a sleeping dragon in the eye?

... You can imagine how the eleven years old boy confrontation with the "just a big gecko" went on. With a full stomach the dragon went back to slumber. The wizarding world will never know the impact that this result had on the peace in Europe for the next century.

** It's a very minor point but in Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay, he falls asleep in the Ravenclaw House library and no-one wakes him up because "it's in the school motto - don't tickle a sleeping dragon".

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkffn(you poked a dragon) it is very good and canon compliant so far but diverges beautifully the only other fic that does it better is linkffn(forging the sword)

Both fics involve a death that pushes Harry and his friends to understand the actual consequences if the fail in their “adventures” and truly become serious about surging and winning against Tom and his followers

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL

** Well, there is a fanfic that's literally called Draco Dormiens.

It's a rather old one (predating some of the books) and it focuses on Draco.
