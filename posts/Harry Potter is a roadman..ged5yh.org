Harry Potter is not raised by the Dursleys, and is instead raised elsewhere. Due to this different upbringing, Harry either becomes a mega-chav, or a roadman. Whenever he greets someone new, he should do so by saying, 'Wagwan mandem.'

I am fully aware of the sheer ludicrousy of this request, however I sicerely wish to read it. I have neither the talent nor time to see this fic to fruition and hope someone will take aboard the most aids infested portion of British culture and smoosh it together in an unholy union with Harry Potter.

**** It started as an emulation of 90s black culture, when it is put on by others not of the culture, black americans jokingly refer to it as "blackface".

It could be fun if you do it justice, but then you referred to it as "the aids of british culture" and all the optimism I had for this idea vanished.

***** Alright mate, calm down. In what way do roadmen emulate 90s black culture? People going around acting like they're harder than everyone else, bragging about how much expensive crap they have? This has nothing to do with emulating black culture. Honestly, when I was in high school at least 90% of the lads in my year acted like this, and out of about 40 blokes only 4 were black.

What OP is requesting is a form of British slang.

Nothing about it involves black people.

******** Slang and words don't belong to one group once an idea is out it belongs to everyone. But the culture op wants to give to Harry is UK black culture. Period, that's it. Its not just "UK slang mate, no jogs I swear mate". That's not what their asking, they want Harry to emulate a culture that would offend people if not handled properly. And op starts out the request with referring to it as "The aids of british culture" So I'm not hopeful that they could make this Harry funny without defaulting to just being an ass.

Bottom line OP write the fics you want to see, don't censor yourself, but be self aware on what you post.

********* The idea that something can belong to a specific culture is wrong, all that does is segregate people.

Who cares about offence? What does getting offended solve?

If someone is interested in your culture enough to write a story involving it then that just shows that they like it.

So what if it get used wrong, simply correct them and move on.

It's not as big a deal as you seem to think it is.

By subverting the conversation to "Its just slang." And not my concern of "Hey this concept has the potential to be easily be offensive handle it with care." It gives the impression.

******* I fail to see an issue. It honestly pisses me off when I get people like you trying to ruin a harmless bit of fun by insinuating that I am a racist. Being a roadman is one of the things that British people generally take the mick out off, with most being seen as dossers or layabouts. It is, thus, seen as a bad thing. And when I said it was the aids of British culture, I was making a joke. It may have been a shit joke, but it was still a joke. So screw your bloody head on, and stop getting offended over nowt.

Option 1 [Story starts with Dumbledore dropping of Harry on the wrong address in East End] Option 2 [Story starts with Dudley's gang beating up young Harry some blokes intervene, they become friends]

TBH you'd find longer more established stuff looking up a run-away Harry story. He joins street gangs but they are not the aesthetic your looking for.
