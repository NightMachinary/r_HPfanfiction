I say dungeon meaning like his own realm. If he has his own dimension thats cool to ;3. But something where in this place he's got a TON of power. He can do anything. But he can still tire out if its too much.

EDIT: Please try and keep it over 70k words!


** /Read Title pulls out 20 sided die and handcuffs/

Alright lets get this party-

/Reads description calmly pushes handcuffs and die into a drawer/

Never mind.

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) has his own realm, eldritch horrors in its dungeon, and [[/u/ryder10]], he'll have that too when he's a few years older.
