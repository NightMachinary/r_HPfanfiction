We know from DH that Voldemort's Killing Curse in the clearing destroyed the Horcrux that was inside Harry. I'm looking for a story that explores what might have happened if Harry had been a little slower with his Disarming Charm in the graveyard at the end of GoF and Voldemort's Killing Curse destroyed the Horcrux then. Does anyone know of a story like that? Gen, het, slash all okay.

It's an AU from year one onwards. This is one of the major changes from canon.
