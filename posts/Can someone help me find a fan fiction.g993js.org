:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
My friend (i guess) who I haven't heard from in nearly 3 years somehow knew that I enjoyed Harry Potter fanfics even though I didn't like them when we lost contact. What she texted me seemed interesting but she didn't give me a title or how to find it so I was hoping someone could help me find it.‘ the War is over, Harry is the master of death but he's bored or regretful or something. Death decides to give him the choice to go back in time, he does but ends up in Tom Riddle era. He is now Hadrian Peverell, who Grindelwald captured because he wanted the deathly hallows, he's saved just when he is about to be tortured. Something happens in the hospital, too boring I skimmed over it. Gets invited to Hogwarts and is sorted into Slytherin. Abraxas complains, Harry gives him a concussion or whatever happens when you‘re thrown against a stone wall. One of the Lestranges befriend Harry, apparently he's gay so is Harry. Tom is intrigued, Tom duels with Harry, loses and Harry becomes an “honorary“ Gryffindor. Tom and Harry have this “I'm stronger than you so bow“ thing going on, I think Tom tortures the Lestrange and Lestrange puts loyalty in Harry instead. Harry has a pet snake who likes puns. He saves Aragog and gains like spider whisperer or something similar. He overhears Orion Black arguing with Tom about a sick sibling? asks death if he can heal him, death shows him how, Orion becomes friends after Harry basically nearly killed himself healing Sirius. And I forgot the rest, I think I lost interest. Also i think I told this summary in the wrong order. Sorry. Have fun reading.‘ ‘'Dumbledore tells Hadrian in the kitchens to changes houses, Hadrian refuses so Dumbledore decides to be petty and proceed to take house points without any reason whatsoever. Examples - breathing too loudly, touching Orion's shoulder, etc.'

For someone with short term memory loss, I'm surprised at how much information she gave me. This is not the exact text, I changed some wording so People could read what she wrote instead a mess of incomprehensible words.If anyone could help me find this fic, that would be wonderful. Thank you.

edit. I have found It but I promptly lost it again.
