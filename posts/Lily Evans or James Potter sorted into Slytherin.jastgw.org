I was wondering if there are any fics where Harry's parents (god parents too) are sorted into /Slytherin/ instead of /Gryffindor/ and how that might have changed things. Like would Lily and Snape still have been friends? Or stranger still would James not have bullied Snape?

Would either of them have been Dark? or would they still end up together? what if it was Sirius or Remus, would they have all still have been friends? and how would all of this effect Harry's life? would he still be the bwl? or would his parents have been on Voldemort's side? or neutral?

And now I want ot read stories where Harry's parents or god parents where on Voldemort's side, and they like still died (Azkaban) and everyone lies to Harry to get him to be their golden boy. Which goes to hell when Siri escapes or some shit. Anyways Recs wanted haha.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  James Potter had always known he would be a Gryffindor. When the Sorting Hat shouts the word he dreads most, can he overcome his fears and become the best that Slytherin has to offer? Oneshot.

** Just because his parents could have been sorted into Slytherin doesn't mean they would have been death eaters. I mean Slughorn said Lily would have been amazing in Slytherin or something like that and she used to give him amused remarks
