:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember harry was a kid and still Horcrux who was being raised by Sirius and Remus and he was traumatized by the colour green and either fully mute or selectively mute.

Edit: I think he had ptsd from voldemorts attack and it was too the point where he was avoiding certain blocks because of thier coloring and im pretty sure it was on ao3.

At one point harry makes a movement to grab Sirius wand and it was explained that he used that to explain himself when it would take too long to write it out. I think he was wearing the locket at some point too.


** Harry: /goes outside/

** I remember a fic where the first time Harry saw a floo being used he had a meltdown. (Adoptive) family member steps in, flash of green light, and then they were gone...

  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

  Everyone said Harry was different, but what if the differences were more than just surviving the killing curse? What if Harry had Autism? How would the wizarding world react and adapt to The Boy Who Lived?
