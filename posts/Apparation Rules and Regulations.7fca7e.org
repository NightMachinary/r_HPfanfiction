** We know international Apparition is dangerous, and can even kill you. I think that's really it. No other limits are discussed as far as I remember.

*** There is a certain amount of evidence that crossing bodies of water is a barrier to apparition, in addition to distance. Here's the reasoning:

In DH, Voldemort had to fly back to the UK after his visit to Nurmengard in continental Europe.

Voldemort was in a desperate hurry and had no reason to delay, meaning he would have taken the quickest mode of transport available.

The English channel is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point.

In HBP we see Harry apparate from the south of England to Hogsmeade, with Dumbledore in tow, a distance far exceeding 21 miles.

Voldemort can almost certainly apparate better than Harry. And yet he wasn't able to apparate across the 21 miles of the English channel.

Conclusion: there is something about the English Channel which blocks apparition, other than distance.

Two contenders seem to arise as to this "something". It is either something naturally occurring, or something man-made.

The latter seems less likely, because at this point Voldemort was in charge of the British Ministry and therefore would presumably have control over any man-made magical immigration controls.

When considering naturally occurring barriers to apparition over a body of water, the most obvious conclusion is the water itself. After all, the ability of bodies of water to block magic is a common theme in folklore and JKR often draws upon folklore for inspiration in building the world.

**** Let's assume the theory of water-based defense. There might be some wards that can block wizards, but it is costly to use them for borders. This has a significant impact on the world.

At country level, I expect large countries with few borders. They may not even have the concept of counties but instead have continent-wide governments. Of course, local communities exist, but laws, taxes, etc are chosen by continent.

Islands are the exception to this rule. If you disagree with the government, it is the easiest to find an island and declare yourself independent. Minorities often 'flee' to islands, leading to a drastically higher percentage wizards and witches in these areas. (Evidence: 1. The large amount of folklore from Britain. 2. Central Europe has two large magical schools while Britain has one. This indicates that there are twice as many wizards on the main land as in Britain + Ireland.)

These are a lot of assumptions, but I loved the world-building I just did. Hopefully, it is useful for you. Thanks for the inspiration.

***** I feel like this perhaps treats wizards as a bit too much like Muggles.

There's a lot of evidence that the international wizarding community is much more integrated than the Muggle one. The "other" for wizards are not wizards of other nations, but rather Muggles, and the wizards of the world are collectively engaged in a grand conspiracy against said Muggles to conceal their existence. This has led to the creation of a strong international order oriented around secrecy and has lessened inter-governmental rivalries - especially as a magical war would be too risky with respect to breaking secrecy.

It also doesn't really consider wizarding incentives. Unlike Muggles, wizards don't really have much of a reason to covet territory and the natural resources it contains. I don't picture wizards as having much in the way of territorial ambitions, with there instead being a largely stable consensus over the composition of magical communities primarily based on nationality/ethnicity/language.

**** But Voldemort only controlled the British ministry. He definitely didn't control the French ministry. If there was a man-made barrier, it could have been maintained by both sides, or each side having their own barrier.

** Distance is a tricky thing. London - Inverness is a longer trip than London - Frankfurt or London - Paris. Does that mean you can apparate to other countries or are there magical borders. Do these borders even match our current ones? For all we know the magical borders were decreed in 1306 and half of France is part of magical Britain. After all, why should wizards care about muggle borders?

As for inland apparation this is a difficult question to answer because judging by the books most magicals are morons who cannot cast a simple shield spell, something a bunch of school kids learn pretty quickly. So, if they cannot cast easy spells, how can we expect them to teleport themselves across hundreds of miles? I don't remember reading about people making stops because they lacked the range to do their journey in one go.

As for taking people along it has to be rather difficult else everyone would do it and floo travel would only be useful if you are drunk, underage or travelling in a large group. There are no clear answers in the books but the common theories go with mass, magical powers of the moved persons or number of people as factors.

Like with most things, write what you need to use and not what is given. Canon seems to lack definite, consistent limitations so you better be making your own.

*** The limits we do know are these:

There is an Anti-Disapparation Jinx, which keeps people from Apparating in Hogwarts.

International distances are dangerous.

Depending on skill level, Apparation causes a sound anywhere between a pop and a car backfiring.

Also, Apparation is a class unto itself, Shield Charms are covered under DADA, which we all know has a poor reputation when it comes to actually preparing people. (And Umbridge was specifically making it impossible for anyone to learn.)

**** But International distances is a open term. The English Channel is not even 50 miles across and you are in another country. And London - Hogsmeade is a longer trip than London - Germany.

*** Thanks, this was helpful. I'm probably just going to make my own rules. I just like basing my magic stuff close to canon so no loopholes become too apparent.

** Apparation is annoyingly thin on details in canon. Does it even require a wand or is it completely wandless? It's not clear at all. I would say start from the basics and make your own rules, but be consistent in your application of them.

In my AU world, I have Aurors having a skill of silent Apparation as it made no sense to me that an Auror would announce their arrival on the scene with a loud sound. Harry, having had bad experiences with Floo and Portkey travel, uses mostly Apparation and is very good at it, able to cover large distances safely, even while taking someone else along.

The other thing that gets me about how non-specific JKR is about magical travel--what are the rules for international travel? I can imagine that magical authorities don't want people moving about willy-nilly through their borders, so how is that regulated? This is where I have to make up my own rules and stick to them.
