#+TITLE: I want an OP MC(Harry, Ron, Hermione, SI, etc...). My only specifications is that Voldemorts already dead, or it's gotten to fifth year. Even Harry from another world bought back by the GOF is fine. As long as he is OP.

** Well linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224]]) counts. Harry's in his early 20s when he gets sent to another universe after Voldemort is defeated. Sadly incomplete.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?
