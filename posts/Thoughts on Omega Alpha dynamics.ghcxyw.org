*** I agree some of the stories kind of grew on me but I really want at least some story line not just sex on every possible surface and in every chapter. I even read (like 2 chapter or so) of one which had 2 or even 3 sex scenes in 1 chapter and the chapter wasn't even long.

** A/B/O can make for an interesting plot if the author takes the time to work out how it would affect the shape of society, or to explore how cruelly unjust it is that the dehumanizing effects of being an Alpha or Omega remove the freedom for a person to choose their own future.

So the A/B/O fic's I've enjoyed tend to be ones that weigh in heavily on the psychological horror end of the spectrum.

**** I'd prefer not to post any links. A/B/O is extremely unpopular on this sub (understatement). If I posted a link then the author might end up with a lot of undeserved negativity directed their way from people who just dislike the entire premise of A/B/O.

However, I will mention one example: "Life Isn't Fair" by RiceBowlDevils, though it was recently deleted.

It was an unfinished story set in an alternate universe. Harry is a teen omega who experiences bullying at school and emotional abuse at home from his only adult caretaker (Vernon). When he runs out of hormone blockers his life seems to spiral completely out of control in a single day, ending with him murdering Vernon in self defense.

It was not a happy story by any means, but in my opinion the author did a good job writing Harry's emotional and mental state while he struggled to keep an even keel through everything in his life trying to push him down. It was a candid look at what life as an abused teen might feel like. Harry's near crippling anxiety about his future in the aftermath of Vernon's death was especially well written.

** I was very freaked out by them at first but don't seem to mind them as much now either. There are various levels to the worlds, though, & I don't like the ones with dubious consent/rape/underage sex/statutory rape, etc...

** I reall dont like these story's because most of the time, the omegas are forced to marry and have sex with somone they dont want to on my because they are omegas. It really sickens me. The only ones I like are when its literally just somthing that makes sex a little different but other then that has not affect on a person's life.
