I've been on a bit of a sport's kick recently and I was wondering if you awesome folk had any good fics with well-written quidditch or Quodpot, or really any other magical game as a big or at least reoccurring part of the story? I prefer bigger stories or series, at school or professional league, any pairing or none.

Also I just now thought of it, but wouldn't a story about a modern adult wizard in the professional quidditch league be awesome? I know of no such story, nor do I intend to write one, but it seemed like too neat of an idea not to share.


** My personal favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]], with the best written Ron ever as the star. It's just under 15k words of pure awesome. Ron is a veteran pro keeper.

*** Seconding this story. It's one of Jim's best stories, basically a fusion with the book [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Love_of_the_Game][For Love of the Game]] by Michael Shaara (one of my favorite authors).

*** I just read it last night It's pretty good, little weak on the character development of Titus at first, but other than that it's good

** Here's one I like that's primarily a romance but told around some good Quidditch parts. Interesting strategies and some development of how a pro league might work: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup]]

** I love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866813/1/A-Whiff-of-Competition][A Whiff of Competition]], which, like you mentioned at the end of your post, is all about the world of professional quidditch. It focuses on Katie Bell and Oliver Wood, but one of the most important and most interesting parts of the fic is the whole concept of pro quidditch that the author creates. It gets into the trainers and coaches, the facilities and compounds, and the inter-team politics. It's a WIP, right now over 100k words.

Beyond that, I'll say that that ship, Oliver Wood/Katie Bell, has several other stories focusing on quidditch, at Hogwarts and the pro level, and would certainly benefit from more readers!

*** That sounds amazing. As soon as I put a dent in the other recs (I'm trying to get out of my habit of reading three fics at the same time) I'll start on that.
