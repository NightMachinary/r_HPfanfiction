I'm looking for a fic where Harry learns more about / reconnects with his parents. Could either be time travel, finding James or Lily's diary, finding family artifacts in his vault, etc.. Would prefer that it's the main plot but if it's a smaller plot line or scene in a fic that works too!


** This one has a much larger overarching plot but he does get to know his parents in it. And it's well written so that's always a plus.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.
