:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In an alternate universe, where (I think) Neville drew the unlucky lottery ticket, young Harry Potter is a monstrous little shit. He steals, he lies, he tortures puppies, he's cruel to his little sister. His parents find it extremely difficult to love him, etc. Then one day, he falls down the stairs and dies.

It's at this point that canon-ish Harry is called in to take his place

His parents are alive, he has a younger sister

He also has a trashed reputation, due to years of lying, stealing, cruelty, etc

What's a guy to do? Faking amnesia is a good start (helps cover over the minor detail he's flying blind here) and start the hard slog of reputation rehabilitation

Starts pre-Hogwarts

Anyone have a clue?

** I've read this...

Isn't this the one where he wakes up in the Godric Hollow graveyard where his alt self killed himself, he goes inside and everyone freaks about where he was, only his mother really cares about him, his father and 2 sisters hate him, sirius has a kid the same age who his alt self made mad at him and everyone's basically wondering why he is now trying to be good but his mother is all over loving him and even sleeps in his bed once the good new harry is there.

Right, that one?

(Edit) Is this one of the ones where harry is at privet 4 in the summer and dies in his room to get sent to the AU New Dimension World? Its not a reaper challenge flic right? I'm trying to find the story but not having luck yet.

**** After he gets to the new world the only person who likes him in his new family is lily. She has always wanted her son to love him and he was a shit so when he shows up really nice and wanting hugs and making breakfast for the family she just eats it up. Its a slow slow slow burn for that ship. His father is a piece of shit and cheat on lily I think and this new amazing harry just shifts lilys world to him instead of james. James totally deserves lily abandoning him in this story. Harry ends up the strong male who takes care of the family and after a Ministry event where he tries to lure out voldermort or something voldemort allows the whole who wants to join me in this pureblood team thing and james basically gives up his wife and kids saying he will let them die so he can live, theres a big fight and after that lily sees him more as the man she wanted james to be and after that they are together I think, its not fleshed out well but it is pretty cute and I love this story.

*Wand of Uru* - "Stay the fuck away from this one. It's not only unfinished, but it's just /bad/. "

*Girl Who Lived* - This one's average for what seems to be a fixit fic. It's proofread and has good grammer. The first part follows the original pretty much exactly.

*New Lives and New Battles:* "It's the same shit as all the others for the first few chapters. I'm sloggin through another variation of this. I'm sure if you squint it's an okay story. "

*Steve2* - "On the bright side, the Hat is a sarcastic asshole. As I mentioned earlier, I love that. Too bad we have Harry Sue as the main character instead of it. "

*Smaster28, an excerpt -* "Don't worry they are my family too. I am a true earthling or the member of the very first human race. We have more powers then you can even comprehend. We expanded our civilization across the universe. The stronger people amongst us could move from one planet to another in an instant. They could destroy galaxies at their whims. A long time ago before I was born, a deadly war broke out because the people got greedy because of their powers. Our Emperor stopped the war. Barring his allies and family members he took everyone's powers; thus creating the modern day human beings. The theory of evolution is just a hoax created by us to hide our existence. I am the Emperor's youngest son. Recently my own powers were increasing at a rapid rate. Fearing that I may not be able to control myself, I split my essence into two equal parts."

**** Harem...Sigh, ok SisterIncest... Ughh!

I'm 95% certain that this is the story I was looking for, but a) I 'remember' certain scenes which aren't in the story. And b) I don't remember any incest I'm confused

***** I just went through some of my old saved stories and SilverAegis's Harry Potter and the New Life is almost certainly the story you are looking for. It was taken down but you can find it on the wayback machine. [[https://web.archive.org/web/20140802234831/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2390801/1/]]

***** Sorry, looking through things further I realized I was wrong. I'm pretty sure the actual story you are looking for is The Next Great Adventure by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3413716/profigymulligan][profigymulligan]].

** is it gen?

if so, check some popular gen harry potter fic lists. as well as lists of fics where he's not the boy who lived. and parents are alive fic lists. etc.

do a major ao3 check.

just write down what you know and divide that into tags(eg. neville is the boy who lived, bad/dark harry, etc.) then just search for those.

this is the best help I can do, I don't read anything but drarry and have never come across this specific fic.

** Not related to Harry Potter, but there is a novel called The Scapegoat which has almost this exact situation. A (bad) guy switches lives with another (nice) guy who looks just like him.

Loved it...

** I read one where Harry joined Voldemort, killed his brother, and was essentially the second most feared wizard alive, after Voldemort himself. Something happened, a ritual gone wrong, and he swapped worlds with canon Harry. Canon Harry was pretty quick on the upkeep, especially when he gets attacked, stunned, and bound. I think his sister helps him escape, and she was under some sort of spell from the evil Harry.

Cannot remember the name, but it was a good read.
