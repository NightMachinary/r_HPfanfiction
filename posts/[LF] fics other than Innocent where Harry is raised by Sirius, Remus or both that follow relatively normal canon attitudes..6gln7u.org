Hell, thrown in Harry raised by James and Lily if that's a bit too narrow. Just please avoid purebood apologism, WBWL and clich√© standard non-standard pairings like Harry/Susan or Harry/Daphne.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

Harry grows up with the feisty Padfoot as his best friend and companion and thus, when he is accepted into Hogwarts at his 11th birthday, he refuses to come unless he can bring his dog as his familiar. Once at Hogwarts, Snape is behav

  On that fateful night in '81, Sirius arrives first, gathers up Harry and takes up his god-fatherly duties, raising Harry with the help of Remus and a nudge from the ghosts of Lilly and James in secrecy before returning to the wizarding world for Harry's third year. Rated M for violence and language. No slash, no definite pairing yet.

** I haven't read this fic all the way through (it is very long), and there seems to be a small Harry/Daphne relationship, but this is one where Harry is rescued from the dursleys by the Blacks and is raised within the Black family as a "dark" wizard but this isn't a dark!Harry story in any way, the entire concept was very intriguing and I'm really enjoying it so far linkffn(Growing Up Black by Elvendork Nigellus)

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.
