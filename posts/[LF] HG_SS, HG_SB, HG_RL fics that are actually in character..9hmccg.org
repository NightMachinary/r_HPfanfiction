I was reading a post earlier about how this subreddit seems to hate HG/SS and it got me wondering if there were any of those fics that are actually true to both their characters, especially his. I threw in the pairings with Sirius and Remus because I really love them and would like to see Hermione paired with them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind time travel, if that's what you've got. Thanks!


** linkffn (The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) does Hermione (sort of) and Sirius plus Hermione (sort of) and Lupin in one story. By the time it happens, Hermione is very different from her canon self, but it doesn't just happen, rather the change is gradual and done well so it's not a huge jump. It's definitely one of the best stories I've read, although Hermione is perhaps a bit too perfect to be realistic. EDIT: bot didn't get that one so linkffn(10772496)

As for HG/SS I'll give you linkffn(A Maid in the Devil's Manor by Ms-Figg). It's the only story with that pairing I've ever read that didn't make me want to cringe.

** Camerado, best HG/SS I ever read, and it follows canon quite closely. It's on ff.net

** I really enjoy /desert_c/ (or /desert_sea/ on AO3) as her Snape is delightfully dark and snarky. Lots of smut, but great stories I love to re-read. A bit heavy on the BDSM stuff, but effective writer.

/Subversa/ is also grand at characterization and her writing is like poetry. Every line seems well thought out yet crafted effortlessly. She's a true talent. She does often have Snape utilize "pet names" which makes me cringe, but aside from that she's my favorite HG/SS writer and I'm gutted she doesn't write anymore.

/Hold_en/ is newer on the scene on AO3 but quickly becoming a favorite as her(his?) Snape seems most Canon-y to me. Less smut, more twists/turns/adventure/romance. Could definitely use a beta at times, but not enough to distract from the story for me. (Currently writing a time travel story I'm obsessed with)

The one everyone adores but I'm sort of "meh" on is /Loten/ and "chasing the Sun". Great writer but their stories never really do it for me.

Love to know what you think.

*** I love both of the first two authors you suggested, and am excited to check out the last one. I know I've read Chasing the Sun and I think I liked it, but I don't remember if I loved it.

I really enjoy Hermione pairings, and I know it isn't popular around here, but I seem to like her with an older man.

** I find that for in character HG/SS the longer they're away from hogwarts, the better. Mostly because I find that only a very OOC or impossibly manipulated Shape would engage a school age or just graduated Granger.

Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten

Times Hammer by ishouldbewritingsomethingelse. (Time turner fic - He was never a teacher, so my above caveat doesn't apply).

Sin & Vice by mak5258. Another time turner fic where hermione ends up much closer to his age.
