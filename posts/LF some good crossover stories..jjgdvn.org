  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12778977/chapters/29159019][Harry Potter and the Winchester Brothers]] is my favorite crossover. (Ongoing, last update was in 2019.)

Never even watched Supernatural and still love it.

  Dumbledore said Harry had a choice. He could go back, go back to battle, end the war. He could go on, be with his loved ones in the afterlife. Somehow, he settled for in between and landed somewhere in America in the year 2010 with two guns pointed at him. Plucked from one war in one universe, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of another. (Betas acquired!)

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.

** linkao3(7353028) - Pokemon. Crack sort of treated seriously? I was not expecting to like this, but I did. Is a retelling of the Hogwarts books, but with Harry determined to be the very best - so it doesn't leave Hogwarts and the Wizarding world behind, but it definitely takes a whole new angle.

linkffn(11426651) - Avengers/MCU. One of those fics where I'm left wanting MOAR of the author's vision.

linkao3(holly potter and the midlife crisis) Long fic; lots of brilliant, unique interactions (I personally want more deets on Banner's work with the werewolves); action packed but very episodic a la Dragonball - each new crisis yields a new powerup, which immediately solves the crisis until the next brisk mini arc.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

** linkao3(25133773)

This has quickly become my favorite crossover since it started coming out in July. Not just my favorite Star Wars crossover, but of any fandom. It's the only fic that has ever made me want there to be fanfiction of a fanfiction. And the author is even writing those, too, in his outtakes and AUs fic.

I really enjoy the way the author managed to tie in both worlds, in a way that makes perfect sense and is unique enough that I've never seen it before.

Other than that, one notable one that I haven't seen linked thus far is this - linkffn(13326497).

I will admit, I struggled at first to get into this authors writing style, actually read the first page of the one I linked and gave up, but since then I started reading his other fics, and have come around on him. It's not the best writing I've seen, but it works, and a lot of the concepts this guy covers in his fics are pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in fics these days.

Ugh, dumb bot. Here are links -

** Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon on Fanfiction.net

It's a crossover of Harry Potter and the world of Firefly (created by Joss Whedon) post-Serenity (film). Some bad people wake up Harry who was kind of frozen in stasis for like a thousand years because they think he is the saviour of man-kind. Harry wakes up to a world unlike his own but is confused by the lack of a wizarding world. Where are all the wizards and witches? He flies solo for a while then joins the crew of Serenity who help him look for answers. Lots of humour and world-building. Characters are written in the same tone as Joss Whedon's “Firefly” crew so it's funny. Harry is older and more experienced so he's a bit OoC, but it's believable.
