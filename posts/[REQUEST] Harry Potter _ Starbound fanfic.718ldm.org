So this has been sitting around in my head for a while - the premise is that Hogwarts is this magical subsection of the (Terran? Terrene?) Protectorate (check out starbound wiki for jazz you don't know about if you're curious), and that rather than being 'wizards' they have the 'Spark Of The Creator' or something that allows them to directly manipulate Ancient Technology, essentially giving them magical abilities when they have a wand or staff on them. Probably roll with both magical and starbound Lore, just jam WIzardness into specificall Earth I guess?

TITLE: Scarbound

MAIN POINTS: -Harry is a Novakid with his Brand being in the shape of a lightning bolt. He was raised as a normal Novakid (no Dursleys here), and as such has a remarkably small attention span along with the deep-seated belief that literally everything can be solved with a proper application of firearms. -Voldemort.exe is a Glitch, who created Horcruxes (an unholy union between Erchius Crystal Magic and Normal Dark Magic), including Harry's brand, that allows him to project himself as a funky ghost thing but its a lot more efficient if he just possesses something. He really hates Harry specifically due to a minor bug in his programming.

MINOR DETAILS OR VAGUE SUGGESTIONS: -Ok so I figured in terms of carrying stuff over, Azkaban would be held on a Moon, and Dementors are Erchius Ghosts? -The Troll scene could be done with a Momma Poptop and plumbing as a projectile? -Harry's Boggart be an Erchius Ghost simply because it is the one thing his guns don't work against -following that logic (if it can be called that) his patronus is a gun that works on Erchius Horrors -He uses that on Voldemort a few times? it becomes his signature spell like Expelliarmus was for Harry -Brooms are just rockets on sticks. with like five-foot gouts of flame to keep the game interesting -Hogwarts exists on basically the Challenge Portal Dimension, only accessible by giant magical stone glowy train. -rather than everyone being really conservative, the reason everything is old timey is simply because nobody even knows how any of it actually works, and as such they just work with what they have -that time Harry burns Quirrels face off isn't so much his mother's love as it is him literally being made out of plasma and feeling threatened. -The Basilisk doesn't work on him because he anatomically does not have eyes. -Draco Malfoy is a hylotl, as are most purebloods - the Blacks are Avians. -do something cool about bellatrix and Asra Nox -also something cool with morphballs and animagus transformations -Hagrid is either Apex or a Glitch named Halfgrid -Ron is basically an incompetent Floran -Hermione is an Avian -Neville is the only Floran more cowardly than Ron, until book 5. -In the DA Harry teaches everyone a spell to make a magical gun. -Harry charges in gun first into literally everything -He accidentally shoots Norbert -he deliberately shoots the Devil's Snare. -he does that cool thing where he shoots the one important key with his revolver when Ron and Hermione expect him to broomstick -he doesnt take a potion in Snape's challenge hes literally a star he wont be stopped by a little thing like fire -He gets to 1v1 a Bone Dragon in the Triwizard Tournament


** Are you doing this as a written fanfic or as a Starbound mod? Genuinely curious, as I suspect it would be the first game entry to this subreddit (although I might be wrong).

*** Probably a written fic. Maybe in graphic novel form if I'm feeling particularly saucy? I just felt like it could really go somewhere, you know?
