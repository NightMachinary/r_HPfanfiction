I read this ages ago but can't seem to find it now. It was a ss/hg fanfic where everyone is stuck in grimauld place and Severus in injured (I think his secret is discovered by Voldemort). Hermione is supposed to help him convalesce. She forces Ron to come play chess with Severus because he cannot leave the room. Severus and Hermione end up talking in love during this time, although noone knows about it . She is kind of his apprentice too while he recovers. I know this isn't much to go on, but can someone please help?
