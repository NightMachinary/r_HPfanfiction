** Princess of the Blacks may suit you, if you're OK with fem-Harry. It's quite heavily AU, and both the story and it's sequel are complete, though the third in the series is still ongoing (looks like it's getting pretty near to completion too, though). Jen (fem!Harry) is absolutely ruthless and has no hesitation using incredibly dark magic.

If crossovers are OK, you might enjoy The Denarian Renegade series. It's a crossover with The Dresden Files that involves Harry picking up a coin containing a fallen angel at a young age, with just about the results you'd expect. The entire series is done.

Lastly, I know you said Dark or Grey /Harry/, but if you're willing to try a story about Hermione instead, I can't recommend Applied Cultural Anthropology enough. Sadly it's not complete and hasn't been updated in a while, but even with that it's probably in my top 10 fics of all time. Instead of Gryffindor, Hermione ends up being sorted into Slytherin and finds herself becoming increasingly brutal and devious in order to survive and eventually thrive in the snake pit.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.
