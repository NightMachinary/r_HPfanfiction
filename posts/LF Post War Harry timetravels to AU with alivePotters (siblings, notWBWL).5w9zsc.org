The premise of the fics I'm looking for should be Harry who has won/lost (or both) the war is displaced to an AU where the Potters are still alive and have a family. He could go back in the body of the younger alternative of Harry or stay an adult, can be genderswapped or look different in some way (haircolor change, reborn in another family, takes over from someone who died, etc.). The only things that I'd like to avoid is the wrong boy-who-lived trope where he gets abandoned for no reason in favor of a twin thanks to an OOC!Dumbledore. The timetravel portion shouldn't go further back than the alternative!Harry's birth.

Basically I'm looking for a fic in which Harry gets to know his parents and have siblings even if it isn't in 1st person form and he acts as a family friend.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
