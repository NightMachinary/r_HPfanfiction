And by that I mean praying to the Oncler god and singing along to cheesy Disney songs. Someone spiked the punch. No one knows who did it but everyone knows someone did. There's a random Gryffindor in there, he doesn't know how he got there. There is way too much screaming and those who aren't are singing.

It's pure chaos. They all regret it in the morning when they have school and then do it again next Wednesday night.

EDIT: Y'all really making me do this, huh? I'll get back to you in a bit with a one shot
