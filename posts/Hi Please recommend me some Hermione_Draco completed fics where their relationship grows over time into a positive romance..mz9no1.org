Not looking for anything that needs a ton of trigger warnings on it.

I like the idea of post-Hogwarts, sent to the past, 8th year, and resorting tropes.

​

Btw, if anyone popped by to see the other recs in this thread, what got me back into this pairing was:

What You Call Sin by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/into_the_midst/pseuds/into_the_midst][into_the_midst]]

Butterbeer Mustaches by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ravenslight/pseuds/ravenslight][ravenslight]]

​

Thanks in advance for your recs :)

** Super slow burn but one of the best characterisations of Hermione I've ever read (I actually haven't caught up with it for a while, but I read the first half and it was super great)

The two drank ones I've enjoyed the most lately are both post Hogwarts

Fake relationship dramione is the best dramione: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8981179/chapters/20533522]])

Coworkers who are terrible at communicating/mutual pining: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26056906/chapters/63370063]])

One last one because I spotted it in my bookmarks---Draco redemption and PTSD healing for Hermione and her parents post war: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19662142/chapters/46574620]])

  Hermione Granger has a career she loves, friends she can depend on, and a nice set of hand towels for her new flat.She's single and tired of tiresome men, but that doesn't stop her from wearing beautiful lingerie underneath her serious Ministry skirts.Or having pictures taken in naughty knickers.Just once.For herself.Draco Malfoy doesn't get upset at the sight of blood, which is good, because he sees a lot of it.What he doesn't see a lot of is Hermione Granger in her unmentionables.Usually.A series of meetings and mix-ups in which one cannot possibly mean done.

  "All her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope." It was definitely the worst of times. Follow Hermione as she navigates through the quagmire: saving the world, getting top grades, falling in love, lust, and a whole lot of trouble; and comes out of it hopefully at least partially sane. (Super slow burn)

** I absolutely love Mugglefied - its set after DH, Malfoy is sentenced to a year without magic and ends up in the same apartment complex as Hermione. I will note that Ron dies off screen pretty early on, but its not played for laughs at all. Slow burn with excellent development for both characters.

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 66. COMPLETE. EWE. Dramione.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.
