So I just finished The Aurors(the first fanfiction I actually liked) and I'm thirsty for more like it. I've always wanted to read about adult wizards living life, doing work(preferrebly Auror) and am now looking for more of that. Can someone recommend such titles that are actually good, canon- compliant(this really is a big one to me) and, preferrebly but not necessarily, include Harry as the Auror?


** So glad you liked my fic! You might also enjoy the author Northumbrian, who writes canon compliant post Hogwarts stories, including Harry being an auror. They're all linked together and there are a lot of them.

*** Oh wow a celebrity :D Thanks, I'll give him a try. I also got into your sequel, Hollow Ash, but unfortunately I only found 4 chapters- I'm guessing the rest isn't out yet.

**** Yeah writing is pretty slow going on that one for personal reasons, hoping to update next week though!

** Revolution, Resonance, and Resolution, by GreenGecko.

By far my favorite fics ever made, although they are not canon-compliant.

Still, I think it's worth it for suspension of canon to give them a read.

** Are there any Auror Harry fics where he doesn't just act like a (Film Noir) cop?
