I really want to get into this story, as it has been recced repeatedly in this sub. However, I'm (always) wary of such long fics, especially ones with so divided reviews. The verdicts are so contradictory, as some say it's fast paced and well-written, while others say it's redundant and boring. I personally finished the first 2 chapters, and... I honestly don't know what to think right now. I don't know where the plot will go to at this point, and I feel the writing is a bit off, some how. I don't know if it's because the fics I read before are dramatically different from this one, or DaE really attracts different readers.

fyi, some of my favourite fics are The Sum of Their Parts; Ignite/Starfall/Oblivion; The Changeling; Stay Standing; The Art of Self-Fashioning; The Weapon

And on a side note, I'm kind of wary that the plot of this story will go along a similar path to Art of War(Story: Art of War [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10179471/19]]). I can't say I enjoyed this fic.


** I don't believe Starfox's writing works for everyone. I tried to start a few of his other stories, but felt the same way about the writing and the characters so I never finished any of them.

I haven't read this particular fic, but I would recommend quitting if you are still not feeling the flow and the writing after a few more chapters. There have been times when I tried to power through fics where I didn't like the writing style, but in the end they just weren't worth the frustration of reading them.

It is something to decide for yourself though. If you want to keep going you should, but it's also fine to not continue a fic that everyone claims is amazing when you don't get any enjoyment out of it.

** Take this with a barrel of salt. I don't like Starfox5's fics though I did my best to give this one a fair assessment.

I'm not a fan of muggle wank and the whole thing with wizards being thwarted by teenagers with explosives repeatedly is meh. Hermione is the central character and the girl who had trouble scraping together 2 friends in canon becomes an unquestioned leader of a teenage guerilla group. I also wasn't a fan of the good guys being infallible. The bad guys take all the losses and somehow the good guys are supposed to be the underdogs. And there's a whole host of issues that comes with the author which I simply don't like: evuul purebloods, evuul Ministry, mugle wank, Hermione wank. I don't begrudge anyone if they enjoy it, but I don't, so I can't recommend this fic.

*** First, the Resistance loses a lot of people. More than half of them are dead at the end. They are neither infallible nor perfect. It's just that in a guerrilla war, as long as the guerillas have the initiative, a safe haven to retreat to, and can pick and choose their targets, they tend to fare very well. And at the start of the story, the Resistance enjoys that setup. As soon as they cannot prepare thoroughly, have to react quickly, engage enemies on ground not of their choice, people start to die. Such as the fight in the Ministry, or the later engagements.

Not to mention that there are several screwups during the early phase as well, like misjudging a bomb's effect on a potion shop, or the Resistance repeatedly wrecking Dumbledore's political plans with their attacks and causing trouble for him with the Ministry. And, of course, all the trouble caused by various people going off on their own and starting their own little wars. A main theme of the story is how plans keep getting wrecked by circumstances outside the control of the various people on all sides - as happens in war.

Explosives work both ways in the story - Voldemort, having grown up in muggle England during the war, uses muggle explosives to take out the Aurors among the Order and blame the Resistance for it since, obviously, the Dark Lord would never use muggle things.

Hermione had trouble with making friends at 13. In her twenties, in canon, she was an adept politician, rising to Minister. So, that whole "She cannot lead people" is shitty fanon. But "unquestioned leader"? From the start on, Alan tries to undermine her leadership and she has to struggle to keep the others from going all "Let's just kill all purebloods". She's far from being the undisputed leader for most of the story.

Evil purebloods? Some are evil. The majority of the purebloods are normal people who merely believe the government about the evil muggleborns wantonly killing them. But, yes, as in canon, a significant part of the purebloods are bigots. This is not a story where "it was all the fault of the dozen Death Eaters! The rest of us were resistance fighters, really" is even remotely true.

Honestly, it shows that you haven't read the story.

****** This is my full review from DLP, because I don't feel like rewriting it:

#+begin_quote
  Also, after browsing Patron and The Marriage Law Revolution, both of which I gave up on in the first chapters, I approached this with a rather skeptical mindset. The first thing I can say is that in comparison to those two, Divided and Entwined is a major improvement as far as writing goes. Patron and the Marriage Law Revolution both started off simply atrocious, immediately giving off typical shitfic vibes. This one seemed to hold more promise, so I plowed on.

  TLDR is that ultimately, Divided and Entwined is like the white goop from Matrix: a meal that provides you with the essentials, but has no flavor and doesn't look very appetizing.

  First thing, on the technical side, the author's writing has improved, but it's still not engaging. It works. It conveys what it needs to. It does the job of letting me know what the story is. But it doesn't draw me in. There's no X factor. No hook. It's bland.

  It's clean, I didn't spot typos, but then you have things like years (as in 1982) typed as such - 1982. I don't mean the scene headers with dates, it's when a year appears in the narrative. It's more of a pet peeve, but I find it unelegant and something to be avoided.

  Another issue that plagues this fic is the structure of dialogue scenes. There's a lot of dialogue in this fic and when it arrives, you have long sections of speech, only broken up by indications of who's talking and the occasional "he laughed", "he sneered", "he did some other generic in-dialogue character beat thing". Sometimes there's a short description at the beginning to set the scene (Fudge's office, Grimmauld Place, restaurant), but after that, you're got characters just talking. No one picks up anything, or squirms in their seat. Granted, not at dialogue scenes are like that, there's some chin-scratching or tea-drinking, but it's a very common feature here.

  Another technical issue ties into the blandess of writing - the author isn't very adventurous with word choice, depending on the same beaten patterns. I'm not expecting Starfox5 to thesaurus the shit out of this, but the fic could be made much better by getting more creative from to time. Also, a lot of things are repeated over and over, particularly in Hermione's and Brenda's scenes. Like, seriously, I've seen it all before, move the fuck on.

  That last thing contributes to why Hermione isn't a very exciting character to follow. She's just going in circles, rarely stepping off the ring she paced into the floor. After the Resistance was formed, her interactions with Dumbledore and Sirius have had little to no variations, scenes she shares with Harry and Ron are either about talking boring war stuff or the love triangle, which is by now so beaten into the ground that whenever this shows up, I wish Hermione would just do something, shag each one, then sent them on their way. It's static. Unchanging. Boring.

  That's not to say that characterization in general sucks. There was some progression (Ron especially stands out here), but perhaps this fic's biggest problem is that things stay too still. It seems like a lot is happening, but I don't see the effects of this on characters. Fudge is still the same. Amelia Bones is the same. Brenda is the same. Her Auror buddies are the same. Dumbledore exhibits some changes that suggest him reverting to an apparently more bloody-minded war persona, but it's agonizingly slow.

  The biggest character development happened in the aftermath of the Malfoy Manor bombing - Malfoy's crowd changed, the Muggleborn Resistance was formed. Cool. But since then, Hermione - I come back to her because she's arguably the central character - has stayed the same. That's most of the fic that's stood in the same spot, character-wise.

  I think my favorite character was Allan Baker, just because he stood out from the bland crowd, but in the end, he was made into a two-dimensional psychopath. Which perhaps was the point, because he was a psycho with a one-track mind - but he could have been written a little better, I think.

  Now the plot. I can accept some handwaves or implausibility to get the setup out of the way. I always took the view that kids in the Potterverse "grew up" quicker than in the muggle world, simply by the virtue of studying in Hogwarts, where sinister events seem to be a feature of life. Thus, it didn't bother me much when a bunch of 15 year olds created a guerilla group to fight a war. Honestly, the fifth year was a good enough setup that, combined with Hermione's (at times somewhat sanctimonious) pointing out of parallels to fascism sold it to me. But the Muggleborn Resistance has a giant, massive problem plot-wise.

  They are infallible.

  On one hand, wizard 15 year olds are more mature than their muggle peers. Okay. On the other hand, they're still a bunch of kids. And yet, from the moment of inception, Hermione has been talking like a seasoned veteran. It's cringey to me, she sounds like a Genre Savvy tvtroper who has read all the zombie apocalypse related pages and then the zombie apocalypse happens and he applies the tvtropes knowledge and it works. The group was formed too smoothly and has been operating too smoothly. Hermione slid into the leadership role too smoothly. The seemingly opposing elements within the Resistance are all tell-not-show, no-consequence artificial flavoring that attempts to pain a more realistic picture, but fails to make me suspend my disbelief.

  I'm told repeatedly that Allan, Dean and Seamus are much more bloodthirsty, but apart from the whole Allan subplot (which in the end didn't cause any internal shake-up), none of that matters. Dean and Seamus drone on an on about wanting to murderkill all filthy purebloods, but all they do is talk. Grown Hit-wizards (one references the first war, so at least that one is like in their 30s) doesn't blink once at Hermione's leadership. The Resistance is entirely monolithic, regardless of any internal differences of opinion. There's no tension there.

  The other thing is that everything they've done has been a success. Their casualties include Martin Cokes who was nothing more than a plot device, Allan who was ultimately inconsequential and the ongoing subplot of the Creevey brothers and the Withering Curse. That's a rather great fucking record considering everything they've accomplished. Because really, they haven't failed once. All their plans work out without a hitch.

  This pattern of excellence has been firmly established, so now I'm conditioned to expect the Resistance to succeed instead of rooting for them to succeed. In a word, boring. Brenda's trap had me excited for once. I thought, this is it. The trap is well-prepared, the Resistance is outnumbered and up against trained Aurors and Hit-wizards. Nope. They all make it out and drop another bomb. Just what they've done every single time. Hit-and-run, bomb. No tension. No conflict.

  This problem is compounded by the book excerpts at the top of each chapter. You already told me that the good guys will win. Okay, wait, that's not a legitimate point. The same is true of most fiction.

  Let me try again. I have the default expectation that the good guys will win, which is affirmed by the book excerpts. In that case, the draw of the story has to be the journey (though that's also more of a general point applicable to all fiction), but the journey here is boring. The good guys have had all the success and their losses have been minor - the most notable is Kingsley, who was in the background of the background in this fic. The Resistance is fine, Harry and Ron are fine, the Order (apart from Kingsley) is fine - why am I supposed to be rooting for these guys again?

  For all the talk of how the Resistance is oppressed and hunted like animals, all I've seen is them being the top predators. The author tells a lot, but doesn't show it.

******* Brenda changes a lot from the beginning, when she is angry at her partner for using a bigoted slur, to the point where she's using the slurs herself. And as I pointed out before - people die. A lot, even, in later battles - but that happens when it makes sense. Not just to mark off "second act, set back for heroes" on the chart. And, of course, all the deaths that do happen somehow don't count, because, hey, that would be admitting that things don't always go their way, and that the good guys aren't perfect.

The murder of Umbridge at the end of chapter 1 directly caused the investigation of muggleborn suspects, which led to the Resistance going underground because they assumed the hunt had started - which also caused the actual hunt to start. Blowing up Malfoy Manor killed off several supporters of Voldemort. But it didn't get Voldemort, and the collateral damage drove the Ministry to start a war against the muggleborns - and drove a number of people who had lost family there to the Death Eaters. Overall, it did as much harm as it helped. The attack in Knockturn Alley caused wide-spread collateral damage, and once more hardened the fronts, defeating Dumbledore's attempts to make the Ministry focus on Death Eaters instead of muggleborns.

And that's par for the entire war. Actions and reactions, people growing more brutal, more hateful - that's how war tends to be, especially civil war. And yeah, two rather young - they were mentioned as a few years above the rest of the cast - Hit-Wizards will follow the established resistance when recruited since the Resistance members have better training and more experience at that point than them.

The story is about a civil war and the aftermath, when people who have spent months or years trying to kill each other have to stop fighting and start rebuilding.

********* That's not exactly what I am talking about when you complain about everything going perfectly for the Resistance, and I point out that more than half of them don't live to see the end of the story. That's not nuances missed. That's complaining without knowing the whole story. (Not to mention that when Daphne is driven into Voldemort's ranks because her parents were killed and the reaction of her family and friends, the hardening of the Ministry's stance, is shown, that's not a nuance either.)

If someone complains that in one of your stories, a villain escapes justice, but in the same story, the villain gets his just deserts at the end, that's not a reader missing a nuance.

I'll say it again: If at the end, more than half of the Resistance is dead (two-thirds, actually, if you count the people recruited later), then complaints that they are perfect and everything works out for don't really look convincing.

Now, complaining that they don't die quickly enough would be another thing - but that's a matter of taste. Especially if they are taking losses, like Marcus, which don't count for you for some reason. Honestly, if after a third of the story, the Resistance has suffered 30% casualties, then I wouldn't call that "everything goes perfectly for them".

Poor pacing? That's a matter of taste. I, personally, don't think it's slow paced if at 1/3 of the book, 1/3 of the characters in a unit have become casualties. Especially if that also covers training. YMMV, of course. And, of course, not everyone measures pacing by the amount of casualties the good guys take.
