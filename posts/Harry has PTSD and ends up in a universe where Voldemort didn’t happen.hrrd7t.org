As the title says, Harry, preferably between Hogwarts ages, ends up in a different universe and lives with maybe his parents. But he has PTSD and is always grabbing his wand when someone surprises him/he doesn't know that they are there.


** It's post-war, and a one-shot too, but fits your request otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. What he finds instead is an alternate universe. Harry is recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe.
