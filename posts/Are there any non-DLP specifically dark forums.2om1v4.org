Dark Lord Potter just seems to be rather.... male-oriented, from what I have found on their site, but Google isn't returning anything else even close to their scale.


** There's nothing close to DLP in terms of scale anymore, dark oriented or otherwise. Most of the old fandom forums are dead.

For something not so male oriented, my only advice would be to look around. Honestly, 8 years ago DLP was an island of men in what seemed like an ocean of female dominated HP fandom. I've heard that Mugglenet might still have some posters (though the site itself was rather horrible), that might be something to look for.

**** Well I mean, almost /any/ forum you find that revolves around HP that is still alive (barring Reddit and DLP) should be pretty much female dominated. The fandom has always been composed mostly of women, especially the fanfiction fandom.

Really, DLP isn't a bad place for women. Most of the members have grown up and aren't teenage boys anymore, and we've always had a decent amount of female members. It just tends to be a bit brasher than your ordinary fandom forum.

*** I'm not even really sure what male-oriented means here. If it means something like "not interested in romance" then that's pretty insulting to women who don't like romance fics...

**** Male-oriented because it's very het.... And harem-y. I was unfortunate enough to be reading one fic where Luna was just being Luna, and then all of a sudden she's kneeling over Harry's face. I was very shocked. There is no interest in romance, you're right, but there is a rather common occurrence of spontaneous sex... With random and numerous women.... It's something I never ever ever ever needed to read about in my life. It was very unfortunate.

Also, the way Harry is dark in some of their fics is very.... unsubtle. There's much more curb-stomping by Harry of both the Dark and the Light than there is Harry-corruption. And the death eaters often meet unfortunate ends. It's really just in general squick. Of course I understand that not every single fic can be like that, but I can't stomach sorting through them.

***** I'm not quite sure how heterosexuality is a male idea... I mean, by its very nature it's about both sexes.

Re: harem fics, I can't remember a single harem fic that's been recommended by DLP, at least in the last three or four years.

As for sex and violence, yes, fics often feature sex. Sometimes that sex is spontaneous (though this is generally more for smut one shots than longer fics). In that sense the fics resemble real life.

****** Your real life includes spontaneous sex? And I'm using harem to mean 'Harry hooks up with a long string of girls'. Not sure if that's the technical definition that is being generally accepted. Even if the most explicit thing mentioned is 'crotchless cat-suit', it's still rather.... Extremely off-putting. And sorry if I offended you by denying your femininity or something, it's not my intention. But I prefer my fics to stay far far away from naked women, nor do I enjoy reading about Harry blushing and stuttering around a girl, or staring at her arse or chest or writing poetry about her hair or whatever. If you say it's not male-oriented then fine, I'll retract that statement, and I'm sorry, just that personally I find it squick, that's all. I don't remember mentioning violence, now I have to go check .-.

******* I think it's fair to say that most people will have a few one night stands over the years, especially in their late teens. That's what I meant by spontaneous sex.

By harem I generally understand it to mean a polygamous relationship: Harry dating/having sex with multiple women simultaneously. Such fics are quite consistently [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=750364][mocked]] on DLP. This is distinguished from fics where Harry has several different romantic partners in succession. That's pretty normal - it's a rare person who ends up marrying their first sexual partner (and an even rarer one who doesn't divorce them).

Regarding heterosexuality, I wasn't making any point about whether the concept itself is masculine or feminine (for the record, I don't think concepts have gender). Rather, I was pointing out that sexual relationships between men and women (aka heterosexuality) are by far the most common form of relationship on the planet and, involving as it does a person from each sex, is not something predominately male or female. It's equally popular with both sexes.

******** What I meant by spontaneous sex was the part with Luna, where there wasn't even an indication he liked her or was thinking about her like that before suddenly he was on his back on a table. And I don't think you should make the judgement of 'most people' without worldwide statistics. "Most people you know", maybe, because I don't know a single person who has burned through partners like that. And of course, in this society those 'most people' are men, because it's men who get high fived for getting as many girls as possible.

It's true that heterosexual relationships involve both a man and a woman, but I think they look at them differently and get different things out of it. That's why miscommunication is a thing. Looking at it from Harry's point of view, obviously the reader is going to get the male perspective.

I'm glad you enjoy fics like that and consider those things normal. I'm not commenting on whether or not they're normal for you. But to me, it seems like those cultural ideals are predominated by males, and honestly, I'm really tired of watching a movie or looking something up on DA and seeing naked or sexualised women. I don't need it in my fanfic too. If you think I'm mistaken, and that an equal proportion of men and women enjoy fics and images like that, then again, sorry for my mistake. I guess I just haven't been associated with the same people as you.

Beyond the Veil has a couple of active threads (the story update threads) with a bit of editorializing by members.

***** Yeah, my sense of things (from lurking there for years) is that they're now rather hostile to the "Dark Harry for Dark Harry's sake" stories, preferring even stories with canon pairings that are done well over ones aligning with their namesake that aren't.

They even have a skin that puts up a classy "DLP Project" (Darklord Potter Literary Project) instead of "Dark Lord Potter," further testament to their coming of age as a community.

I didn't recommend it at first as they're more fanboy-ish than DLP on the balance of male/female commentary. Also a bit prudish about what they allow in discussions (ex.: linking to fics with smut will get you banned)
