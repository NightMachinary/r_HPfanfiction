** The author is a mentally unstable cult leader with a lengthy history of abusing and manipulating people in different fandoms, but I couldn't stand it even before I found out about all that drama--- just off the top of my head, Neville is turned into a complete Gary Stu, the gore is /beyond/ gratuitous, there's a lot of casual sexism, and Harry and Snape get bashed to all hell and back (especially Snape, whose treatment is... egregious to say the least).

**** ... He turns him into a merciless torturer, pretty much. For the sake of my stomach, I'm not going to try to recall too many details, but there's a scene where he has Ernie and Neville strung up in the Great Hall, given a hundred lashes each, and left to hang there for three days straight without food or water. (Miraculously, they don't die. Miraculously, they also manage not to so much as let a whimper past their lips the whole time. That's because none of this is based in any kind of reality.) I don't even /like/ Snape, but this is just cartoonish.

I'm not sure if it's the first Harry-bashing story out there, but it definitely makes very clear that Neville is the 'real hero' for building this fake-ass army, while Harry was... hiding in the woods like a pussy or something?

Honestly I think /that/'s within the realm of plausibility by at least /some/ interpretations of the "wizards are more physically resilient than Muggles thanks to their magic protecting them subconsciously" principle.

But as for the rest of it... sheesh. That is bad. Not that what Filch wanted to do in canon was much different, of course; that may be where the author got the impression that this was something a particularly stern Hogwarts teacher might imaginably do as a punishment.

Sounds like something any Death Eater would have to be, just ask the Longbottoms. And Snape joined voluntarily.

What you described is pretty tame if you compare it, let's say Ramsey "Bolton" from ASoIaF/GoT. Lashes and no food/water are nothing compared to flaying someone alive and throwing in a castration for good measure.

Edit: I am not saying that Snape should flay people, I am saying that what was described as "sickening brutal" is not that bad, not even by canon standards (Crouch Jr, the rotting curse on the ring horcrux).

****** I mean, I'm no Snape apologist here, but he's not Ramsay Bolton and has never been shown to be capable of this level of sheer sadism in canon--- I don't see how you can compare him to the Lestranges, who are considered particularly vicious and dangerous even amongst the ranks of the Death Eaters. And by this point canonically, he'd long since gone over to the light in his true allegiances, anyway. He might have a skewed moral compass, but I can't see him /actually/ tormenting children beyond his petty bullying as a schoolteacher like he did in this fic.

It's not so much the isolated incidents of violence in DAYD, though I could pull up worse than even the whipping scene, as it is the constant, never-ending grind of our heroes being subjected to soul-crushing abuse--- I guess it's a matter of personal preference, because GoT got to me in that regard as well. More subtle violence can be a lot more frightening and moving than torture porn--- I'll be damned if I didn't just get /bored/ reading another one of his endless descriptions of gore.

******* Crouch Jr was part of that as well, and proud of it. What is the probability that all four were exceptionally sadistic as opposed to all Death Eaters being sick bastards? I mean, Snape tried to use Sectumsempra during a schoolyard fight when he was 15/16. A spell which can cleave a body part clean off. Which honestly sounds a lot worse than lashing someone.

And I am not saying that Snape should copy Ramsey, I used that as an example of a brutal torture scene. Lashing seems rather harmless in comparison.

******** But the thing is... Snape isn't sixteen here. He's not even in his early twenties and a rank-and-file Death Eater. He's changed sides. I don't even like the guy, but I'll give his redemption arc enough respect to say that by that point, he wouldn't have relished the idea of torturing schoolkids within an inch of their lives.

And there's nothing harmless about lashing to that extent--- one hundred lashes would have flayed the skin off their backs, not to mention that they could've easily died of dehydration or infection from being left there, exposed, for days. Maybe I don't have the highest tolerance for gore, but IMO, what Neville described in Deathly Hallows was chilling enough without giving Snape a taste for sadism far beyond anything he showed in canon.

I thought those were not a thing in the magical world.

And there is the whole "accidental magic" thing to consider as well. Neville became extremely elastic when thrown out of the window. It is not unreasonable to assume that something similar might happen under these circumstances.

  far beyond anything he showed in canon
#+end_quote

Canon depicted a genocide as some background thing which came up once. There was not a single mention of rape and countless murders are just there but never really discussed. Which is to be expected from a children's book nowadays.

If you write a more "realistic" approach to the whole war, which the author undoubtedly tried, you will have a lot more than the odd reference to an atrocity. The bad guys will regularly rape, loot and burn. Prisoners will be executed. Both sides rake up war crime tallies. But that is to be expected from a story focusing on a civil war. And expecting anything else is like going on Pornhub and being surprised that there is porn there.

****** Yes, but Snape isn't Ramsay Bolton. And what happened with the Longbottoms was the worst thing the Death Eaters had ever done, so I don't think it really counts as something any Death Eater would do, much less Snape, whose entire purpose at that point was to protect the students of Hogwarts.

** It's plain shite, sorry. There's one thing that can be said in favour of the story, and that's the author's above-average grasp of the English language. By fanfic standards, he's pretty good in that department.

The characterization however is atrocious. Most characters only share the name with their canon counterparts. Snape, Neville and Ginny are some of the most outrageous examples. The story is riddled with stereotypes, especially where gender and ethnic background are concerned. The boys are the heroes, the girls get supporting roles as girlfriends, healers and.... rape victims. Seamus gets turned into a caricature of an Irishman.

The plot is in parts ridiculous and jumps the shark in the infamous execution chamber scene, after which I only skim read the remainder of the story.

I also found the overt glorification of child soldiers rather tasteless.
