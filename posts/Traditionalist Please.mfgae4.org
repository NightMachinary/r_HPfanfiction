I am really interested to know how this fandom has taken on the challenge of making pureblood hatred against muggles and muggleborns make sense. After all if there can be Harry/Pansy fics that should be probable.

I would love it if you could give any fic where Harry hates muggles and or muggleborns, (Bonus Points if both), slash is preferred not but if the fic is good I will read. Long is best, please no Friend Hermione.

The longer the better.

ty for any fics you hopefully send.


** A lot of people often either simply use vague language and call muggles barbaric and primitive but use weak examples like ... stitches? I mean yeah if you can fix a cut with a wave of a wand its going to appear weird but not insane. Instead I've always thought the traditionalist backlash would come from two major factors, the growing muggle expansion into previously wild lands and enclosure during the 17th century onwards. And the actually evil things muggles did IRL such as slavery or the constant wars of territory fought over many centuries. If we establish the wizarding world as a largely stable society with relatively few wars or major conflicts, those that do exist relating to interspecies conflicts or individual dark lords then the conflicts like the 30 years war or the franco-prussian war could definitely help establish the stereotype of the violent muggle savage, much like what has happened to western perceptions of people in the middle east, particularly Iraq and the Levant. Given long magical lifespans then the parents/grandparents of death eaters etc could easily have grown up during things like the scramble for africa, colonisation of east asia or the genocides of the native americans and from that the bigotry is justified.
