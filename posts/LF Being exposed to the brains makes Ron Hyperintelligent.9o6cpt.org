Like Fanfiction Hermione level of intelligent, let alone canon Hermione. Suddenly going from Part 1 Naruto (Stupid academically but can pull out some genius strategies and surprise moments, would be smarter if he tried in school) to Shikamaru (ultra intelligent supergenius, whose main weakness is one of his own making - Laziness) And he finds School so easy that he retakes his OWLs, gets straight O (Or Fanfiction O+ Board of Governor awards etc) and aces his NEWTs, whilst casually resenting the fact that he has to be in classes, finding it "Troublesome" because it's easy now, instead of because it was hard


** Someone should do this... and show Percy's reaction.

** What are you trying to say here, OP? That Ron is not already hyper-intelligent? I see how it is.

** This idea could even be made somewhat canon compliant. Now I want to read a fic in which the contact with the brain didn't immediately make him hyperintelligent, but over a period of a few years gradually made him smarter. His full new intelligence hits, say, 10 years after the Department of Mysteries battle, and he uses it to...

...create absolutely crazy stuff for WWW.

** This is so interesting. I wonder if the Dept. Mysteries scene was symbolic to each of the trio, like Ron is strangled by brains, Hermione destroys the time turners, and Harry is confronted with death.

** I feel like Hermione would be really annoyed at Ron all the time if this happened. Can you imagine if he started correcting her homework? lol

** Remembering the episode where Patrick traded his own brain with brain mushroom or something like that and became hyper-intelligent. This reminds me of that episode of Sponge Bob.
