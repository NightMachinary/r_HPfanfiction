Was it a "what if xyz had/hadn't happened" scenario? Another work? A random thought?

Mine was totally a "what if," lol. More specifically: what if Dumbledore was defeated by Grindelwald or around the same time as Grindelwald.


** Too many mariage law stories where the heroes who defeated Voldemort while he controlled the Ministry suddenly let the Ministry force them to get married/raped.

** I felt compelled by a myriad what-ifs, but I suppose the central three were:

- What if the wizarding world was bigger?

- What if Voldemort never rose to power?

- (Not exactly a "what if") What makes magic "powerful"?

Everything else came after that, and I've just been digging myself into a deeper hole ever since.

** I've got a couple unpublished works on my google drive, mainly all around the idea "What if Harry was an X?" So far, I've got:

- Harry the blood mage (via a book he looted off a murdered wizard)
- Harry the Animagus/Metamorph amalgam (via weird genetics)
- Harry the deity (because reasons) (two different versions of that)
- Harry the Incubus (via finding a cursed cock ring)
- Harry the eldritch horror (via getting picked as Nyarlathotep's heir)
- Harry the Fairy (via getting kidnapped by the Fair Folk)
- Harry (Freak) the changeling/slime monster (created to serve as a fake/replica left in place of the Harry who was kidnapped and turned into a fairy)
- Harry the Leviathan (snake animagus who frequently cast an overpowered /engorgio/ on himself when he transformed)

I've also got Remus Lupin as a weird pseudo/ex-werewolf and servant of Nyarlathotep. I /did/ publish that one, but then abandoned it. linkffn(12057255)

  Remus Lupin vaguely knew what to expect when a being that called itself a god appeared before him. An offer for a paying job wasn't on that list. It wasn't like he was employed at the moment and the job had good benefits. Too bad he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Pseudo-Lovecraftian AU, with Powerful!Remus. Mild Dumbledore bashing in early chapters.

** The first premise in my AU came from an idea that just popped out - not out of nowhere by any means, but it was kind of spontaneous. This world setup toys with the fact of Voldemort seeking allies in order to beat Dumbledore and The Ministry during the first war, given that - in my AU - Amelia Bones and Dumbledore were winning at first. After that the thing just got big and I ended up with a big ass powerpoint archive to build the World. I got actually proud of its complexity.

Plots and Sub-plots followed the same line, popping out faster than i could actually plan them. That's why i always do a first draft as basis, trying not to overdose the story with too many sub-plots that in the end just don't make too much sense or don't connect with the world and the story i'm trying to make.

** I guess mine was a "what if the Triwizard Tournament had been held in 1898, and Dumbledore and Grindelwald had met earlier?" However, to make it work, it was also partially a "what if Grindelwald hadn't been expelled" as well, although we don't really know exactly when or why he was expelled, so I had to do some extrapolation anyways.

My other, crackier fic was based on two facts that were mentioned in Half Blood Prince.

1. Around Christmastime, Harry had a high volume of girls trying to corner him under the mistletoe hung in the corridors.

2. Draco Malfoy had access to Polyjuice Potion.

Naturally, it only followed that this Polyjuice Potion may not have /just/ been used to guard the Room of Requirement.

Albus is surprised when he meets a Durmstrang student who may not be on par with him in talent, but makes up for it in cleverness, charm, and spirit. Maybe he's met his rival, or maybe - just maybe - he's met his match. / AD x GG / WIP

What if Voldemort won against the Magical World, but lost against the muggles, and then decided to travel back in time to 1989 and pose as his own 11y/o Grandaughter so that he (now she) could seduce Harry Potter and unite all of the magical world against the muggles.
