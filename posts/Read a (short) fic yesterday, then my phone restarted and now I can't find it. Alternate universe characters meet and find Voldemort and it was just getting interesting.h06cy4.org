:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys,

I looked at this fic yesterday from my phone, starting from reddit - so the link must be here, but I have spent a ridiculous amount if time searching now, so I'm hoping someone can help. I am annoyed, cause I want to finish it haha. It was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

It's a 4 chapter (i'm pretty sure) fic where Harry, Ginny, Ron, Neville, Hermione and Luna travel into an alternate universe - they were battling 3 Voldemorts (timeturners) and wanted to get the timeturners but destroyed them instead.

In the universe they came from Hermione and Harry are engaged and they are openly fighting Voldemort. The universe they got to, Harry was killed by Voldemort as an infant. So it's quite the shock for Lily and James (and their 2 other kids, one of whom is called Remmy) to see Harry turn up.

Harry is also a metamorphmagus and in the new universe the chamber of secrets was never opened. Lily is angry that Hermione keeps her from seeing Harry (who is near a mental breakdown upon seeing his parents) and keeps calling her a "little girl" in her mind.

You'd think with all this weird ass specific detail I could find this fic. I cannot. I would really appreciate any help because this is driving me bonkers haha.
