This might well just be a personal problem, but the "centrist" political position taken in so many fics where it's like "murdering all muggles and muggleborns is wrong; we should take muggleborn kids from their parents and raise them with magical families!" makes me deeply uncomfortable.

That it's being presented as a humanitarian idea by the writers too, because we see a few instances of abusive Muggle families in canon, is just... where did this plot point come from? Why am I supposed to sympathize with a Harry Potter who advocates for genocide??

For context on why this trope gets to me in particular: I'm First Nations, but I was born in America because my mom was victim of something called the Sixties Scoop, where tl;dr the Canadian government forcefully adopted Native kids to white families so we could grow up proper and "civilized". My grandparents had soap put in their mouths at the residential schools for speaking their language, had their ears boxed for hearing it. But so many fics use this idea of family separation as a way to show how [name literally any character] is more tolerant or better than the others, apparently because they advocate for a genocide of culture rather than straight annihilation.

How is there a middle-ground between "genocide" and "not genocide"? and why is it still genocide? why are schoolchildren debating it?

Honestly, am I reading too much into it? I just can't help but see the parallel here, and it just is so unnerving for me to be into a fic and they start trotting out the "for the children" apologism that gave half my family trauma. I think it's more disturbing to me that I see it so often than that I see it at all, if that makes sense?


** You're right. It is wrong and it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I read a fic that has it in. BUT, these fics are usually labeled as Dark!Harry, so it's good to remind yourself that he's not a good guy in this fic. He might think he is, but he's not.

** I think the only times I've seen that idea mentioned is in the context of the Founders' Era, where the families and neighbors of those muggleborns where much more likely to kill them. And in that context, I think it does seem like a reasonable policy. (I might argue against the validity of that context, but that's a separate issue.)

But in a story taking place in more modern times, I completely agree with you. I think it is better than actual genocide, but not by much.

I suspect this sort of thing comes from people who want to write about how "pureblood culture is perfect and has to be the way it is because magic says so," but are just barely aware enough to realize that trying to keep the muggleborns out it's pretty racist.

Basically, it's another form of the general rule that any grey/moderate/centrist Harry in a fic is really just a dark Harry with some misplaced sense of moral superiority.

I figure you get the idea but just thought it's important to note, so as not to diminish it as a serious matter (not saying you are, but some ppl consider family separation to not be genocide and thus not as serious)

**** Huh. I guess I've learned something new today.

However, you could argue that that's not really what's happening here. Muggleborn culture is just muggle culture, which they are not making any efforts to destroy. It's less "eradication of culture" and more "selective forced immigration." Which is still terrible, obviously, but I think it passes the incredibly low bar of not being genocide.

***** yeah, defining something as genocide is actually quite difficult and fraught with politics, because there needs to be an established special "intent" to destroy a specific racial/ethnic/other group, or something like that (been a while since I studied it)

For this HP scenario, the govt could probably effectively argue that their efforts are for humanitarian reasons and not with the intent to destroy a type of people. On the otherhand you could argue that Muggleborn do have their own unique culture, being on the fringe of two societies. And the fact that many people who would implement these policies are actually doing it for xenophobic / racist reasons would hurt their arguments as well.

** I think it stems from linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), an au fic wherein Voldemort took over Wizarding Britain. In the fic, it's an explicitly evil law (and, hell, there's even a minor twist when Harry figures out that the parents and children each lose memories of the other). In the fic, it's an explicitly evil thing that happens to benefit Harry specifically because it pulled him out of an abusive household, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that a bunch of people read that and missed the point, thinking that it was a genuinely good idea.

** Per Pottermore, this is pretty much what MACUSA did under Rappaport's Law; IIRC muggleborn Ilvermorny students were supposed to distance themselves from their families, completely cutting ties and Obliviating their families by graduation at the latest.

Which leads to the realization that while MACUSA may not have intended to, their policy of strict muggle-magical separation would have definitely made it much easier for the white muggles to steal Native American land.

Small, insular group of people that practices shamanism? That reeks of magic right there.

Magical Separation enforcement comes in and rips away their shamans, which were most likely the only thing keeping the "invaders" at bay.

They literally had two different enemies: the magicals trying to enforce "their" laws, and the english invaders stealing land and resources.

I could totally see Wizards doing that in times of the Inquisition where all wizards(and even non-Wizards) who lived among muggles were in danger of being burned at the stake.

Modern day? No. Unless the family is abusive, then I would agree on that /individual/ case of getting the child out of that environment and doing some Obliviation.

But in the case of the Inquisition time, the child is in actual danger of getting hurt, in the context of "modern day" it's just kidnapping and cultural stuff.

** Yes, forced family separation to raise/indoctrinate children in a different culture is absolutely a form of genocide. It may not be physically killing everyone (though rampant abuse is typical), but it is an attempt to systematically destroy a cultural/ethnic group.

I haven't seen much of this sort of fic, thank God, but I'm not terribly surprised that it pops us. A lot of people make the mistake of assuming that the middle position is automatically the right one, and that "both sides are just as bad", even when the sides in question are "Genocide" and "Not Genocide".

** I think it's definitely rightfully disturbing. there are certainly stories where it's intended to a sort of deranged idea that only makes sense coming from purebloods who are uncomfortable with murder but still don't think of people without magic as people, but there are also a lot of stories where it's presented as a genuine idea which isn't very flattering to our society.

one thing is that this issue is still not anywhere near as well-known as other colonial atrocities (which nonetheless have apologists), and is far more contemporary. while residential schools have all closed afaik, Canada's last one lasted into the nineties which is after Harry Potter entered publication. There are people who grew up reading the series who've likely never even heard about the issue, and without that knowledge the magnitude of the problem with this ‘solution' is less obvious. look at all the children Americans ‘saved' while leaving Vietnam, for example, or all of the religious ‘human rights' organizations set up by colonists in india etc.

personally, I just don't read stories with this sort of theme unless I think the author is likely to be aware of its full implications. I do the same with stories featuring house-elves, goblins, and any other allegories. life is too short to read racism apologia

*** At least with house-elves, there are some variations:

1- The common "they are paid with magic they need to survive" justification.

2-The usual actual slavery one, where their culture is just so used to it that even most house-elves see no problem in it, some even like it.

3-The more evil "house-elves were cursed/charmed to be that way".

4-The also morally ambiguous, "house-elves are homunculi created by wizards to be servants"

5-The weird "house-elves have blue and orange morality" ones.

Heck, there could be even one where Hermione faces the same problem Daenerys had when freeing the slaves, and that old guy came and asked to be re-slaved to his old family because they treated him well and he was kind of a family member.

** Yeah, this is a weird one. Looking at it purely from a real world perspective, its absolutely not something that could morally be done. But if you put yourself into the mindset of a wizard, there are some considerations that don't exist in the real world.

I think one reason you can make a good argument for it within the context of canon is that allowing muggleborn children to be raised in the muggle world increases the risk to all wizards of exposure of the magical world. The less contact between wizards and muggles, the lower the risk to all wizards. Very much a greater good equation, but it has to be considered.

Also I'd be willing to put money on it that the rates of mental health problems amongst muggleborns are substantially higher than the average for the muggle world or for wizarding raised children. Abusive families and/or bullying peers - accidental magic makes /different/ and in a scary way, that will naturally increase the chances of abuse and/or bullying. Even the most well meaning, loving muggle parents would no doubt sometimes react with fear to their kid when that kid makes something explode during a screaming fit - and thats not a fear thats going to disappear overnight, its going to colour every single interaction they have with the kid for a long time.

And finally, you could easily argue that wizards are the minority trying to protect their culture from that of the majority. That spins many of the modern, woke arguments on their head. Is it ok for a minority community to take more extreme action to protect themselves from being absorbed by the majority?

** Personally, I think that they should identify magical children earlier and contact the Muggle parents. The parents should then decide whether or not they want to let their child learn about the magical world (after they have created magical elementary schools to introduce children earlier). If they don't want to deal with their "devil child" then they're obliviated, the child is checked for ancestry, and they're offered to their closest magical relative or are sent to an orphanage if there are none. If the parents accept, then they are bound by oath and their children go to magic school to learn about the magical world. If the Muggle parents abuse their children, then it's the same thing as obliviating them, checking their heritage, and dropping them off at a relative's house or a magical orphanage.

There's your middle ground.

P.S. I really disliked when they stole the magical children from their Muggle guardians without giving them an option.

** Well, I don't /know/ what you are supposed to feel. The best stories don't tell you, but leave it up to the reader to judge, and if you (as a writer) manage to get reviews flaming you simultaneously for something /and/ its opposite, you know you've done everything right. Or at least that's my standard, anyway.

If you're asking about the rationale behind that approach, I guess you can take your indigenous example and tweak it so it actually mirrors the wizarding world (to the extent it can, at any rate). Which is that 99.999...% of all people in Canada are indigenous, and one town of about 10k is not. And for some reason, every year, a couple of indigenous children are sent there, to live there.

So whose rules would they have to follow? Does the advantange of numbers give anyone any right to decide one way or the other? Is the culture of the 10k minority of settlers worth preserving? Is the culture of the minority of indigenous people within the minority of the settlers worth preserving? What happens when those aims are in direct conflict and mutually exclusive?

Etc.pp. Whatever your particular stance, at the very least everyone must agree it's not a trivial problem with an obvious solution.

The equivalent of your conclusion, by the way -- "just leave them be" -- is to leave the Muggleborns in the Muggle world, and fully separate the two worlds. In your world, natives are natives and deserve to live that way, and muggleborns are muggles and deserve to live as muggles. It can't account for children that are actually settlers born to natives.

** You might be reading too much into it since the story was initially meant for children and JKR needed a group of victims and a group of perpetrators. With the latest canonical information we have, the reasoning could be interpreted as Magical world having their own interest in collecting Muggleborn children and considering how eager most parents are willing to allow their eleven year offsprins walk into an unknown world where they could do nothing if something were to go wrong, I would say enchantments are involved. Otherwise the result would be accidental bouts of magic which would take up a great amount of resources from the Obliviators' Office at best, or the formation of Obscurials which would endanger both worlds at worst. Considering that (according to Pottermore's entry on the Ministers for Magic) many of the Ministers were coming from perfectly pureblood families who even condoned Muggle hunting, the acceptance of Muggleborns would have made no sense unless they made some compromise and accepted the idea of allowing them to come into their world but only as second-class citizens. It's only during Voldemort's times that there is a complete disregard for the effects the Muggleborns could have on the status quo, mostly because Voldemort doesn't give a shit about the Statute of Secrecy.

** How can it be wrong given the perspective on perhaps radiation effects magic and muggles are polluting the world / destroying it via waste / pollution / radiation / overpopulation. Some fics have done really well explaining the other side that actually give a reason other then muggles bad muggles die! Just have to realize there is good and bad with all fanfics just take it with a grain of salt.
