I'm looking for fics where Harry doesn't feel like it is his job his sworn duty to oppose evil. He just learns magic, graduates, gets a normal job(No auror), dates few girls(No ginny). Bonus points for Harry skipping Dumbledore's and Voldemort's attempts to drag him into a fight. Extra bonus points for Harry ignoring Malfoy and not becoming his "rival".


** Full-length stories:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- (this may not qualify since Harry's not the BWL) Harry's main goal is to bring his little sister back to life. Everything and everyone else are seen as tools for accomplishing that. Disclaimer: gray, ruthless Harry who gets crippled with irrationality and impulsivity of an addict.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][/For Love of Magic/]] --- Harry's not impressed with the “you have to fight Voldemort because a prophecy says so” rationale, but eventually he's left with no choice because Voldemort demonstrates that he's taking the prophecy seriously enough and thus puts Harry and people close to him high on his kill list. Disclaimer: 'tis a smut-heavy story.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][/Mastermind hunting/]] --- IIRC, Harry just wants to be left alone to do his thing, but various powerful entities (including some governmental organisations) keep meddling in his life. Disclaimer: mind controlling Harry, poorly written ending.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][/Emperor/]] --- Harry's goal is to become an emperor, and everything obstructing that path (including Voldemort) are seen as obstacles to be dealt with. Disclaimer: gray, machiavellian, ruthless, etc Harry.

Calling out the OP GoF bullshit stories:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup][/The Lawyers Against the Cup/]] --- When Harry's name comes out of the cup, he escapes from Hogwarts and asks for a safe haven in a law agency. He then sues Hogwarts and MoM and organises a private education for himself. Nothing particularly special plotwise, but the writing quality itself is pretty decent.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][/Unchampion/]] --- Harry technically attends the tasks but spends minimal efforts on each of them.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Muggle-Raised-Champion][/Muggle-Raised Champion/]] --- Woodworker Harry couldn't care less about the tournament. The story has too much wishful thinking.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** For the "Harry doesn't feel like it is his sworn duty to oppose evil" criterion:

- Obligatory: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] counts as this, since Harry and Sirius have no desire to get dragged into the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort plot in the alternate reality. Harry spends most of his time on other ridiculously amusing hijinks.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] is also a good example. Harry focuses on caring for his adopted son while trying as hard as he can to stay out of the plots of Grindlewald and other pureblood supremacists.

  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.
