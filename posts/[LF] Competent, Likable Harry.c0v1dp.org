I would prefer no bashing (Villains and book Snape and Draco really don't count), no taking Hermione to task like Sinyk does, no lordships, no magical inheritances, no Harry faints from magical exhaustion every couple of chapters, and no seer Luna.

Just a competent Harry exploring the magical world a bit. Dueling tournaments, tinkering, etc.

Canon abuse from the Dursley's is preferred.


** House of Potter Rebuilt is a good one for this.

He's just a normal slightly above average kid, who is actually enthused about learning magic because /magic is amazing/ and unlike Hermione, only reads what he's interested in (or finds useful) and desperately wants a connection to his dead family (like most orphaned children do) and it's quite well written as well.

***** I do agree that it's not fleshed out enough, but it is a good quick read, if that's what you're looking for.

​

Another decent one is Time to Put Your Galleons where your mouth is --the Harry is reborn as an older brother to Sirius and is a little OP but it's explained away and it enjoyable to read.

​

A truly amazing one, the fic that got me into fanfiction was CocoBollo's Harry Potter and the Other Path. Admittedly, it's been a few years since I've read it, but I loved it when I did.

** linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) - Ron is bashed a little but it's kinda believable that he'd be angry at Harry for befriending a slytherin (he gets better towards the end).

linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness) - dark but good, not for the faint hearted. Very little bashing (just a bit with Ginny near the start).

And this last one might not fit but it's really good. linkffn(The Little Veela that Could) has a competent, likeable Harry, he just also happens to be a ghost for the majority of the story.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

**** It just updated. It isn't exactly enlightened so much as James is to young to see some of the ugly truth that maintains the peace. Yuma and bikini atoll and the results of starfish Prime weren't of great impact and importance in just the muggle world.

That said feedback it always appreciated to let me know what needs work, what isn't working, and what is going well.

** Linkao3(This is Not the Chosen One You're Looking For by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel).

Fair warning, this is a crossover with Good Omens, so H isn't quite like he is in canon. But he is likeable, and definitely competent (some might say OP). It's also kind of ‘stations of canon'.

But there's no bashing at all.

** Well, this kind of fanfiction that you're finding hardly leaves the topic having topic of lordship and ladyship and feuds and contracts between houses. But I'll send in some, it has small amount of lordships and stuff, but not to much to make it only circling the topics on lordships and stuff.
