It's taken me years to finally LF this fic, because I don't believe I'm ever going to find it. I don't remember enough specific details to narrow it down imo, but I'm going to try after it's haunted me for years. I probably read this nearly 10 years ago (perhaps 8-9) and I can't even remember if it was complete or not.

What I vaguely remember was Hermione being married off to Draco (it might've been a marriage contract thing) and her being confined to Malfoy Manor. I think Voldemort was dead (had been defeated), but Draco was having meetings with his DE counterparts at raising the violence again or regrouping of some kind. Hermione is trying to spy on him and understand what's going on. She might have been pregnant as well. It's definitely M, definitely was on FF.net. I'd say it was around 8-9 years old, which is really the only thing I can go on.
