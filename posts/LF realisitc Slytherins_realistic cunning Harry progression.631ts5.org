I'm tired of reading fics where all Slytherins are either the most politically savy, manipulative characters as soon as they're sorted, and I'm tired of reading fics where Harry instantly acclimates to life in Slytherin automatically becomes this super smart, manipulative, evilish character.

Are there any fics where Slytherin students slowly become more and more cunning as time goes on? Are there any fics where Harry gets sorted into Slytherin house and is either incredilby uncomfortable or slowly and gradually becomes more slytherin like?


** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) is hands down the best Slytherin!Harry fic I've read. It's recommended here a lot, and for good reasons - it's up there with The Changeling and The Aurors as one of the best written fics.

linkffn(Family Relations by evansentranced) - Dudley is a wizard too. Harry spends most of the train ride avoiding everyone, and arrives at Hogwarts pretty much free of prejudices. Dudley gets sorted into Gryffindor, so Harry decides he doesn't want to end up there.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** The second story you mentioned, is that the one where [[/spoiler][Harry winds up in slytherin, and in first potions class Snape remarks on how odd it is that Harry's relatives can afford to let Dudley have a lavish life, but can't afford anything at all for Harry?]]

**** I get what you mean, the first time I read it I gave up and didn't come back to it for months. But I just read it through for the second time recently, and I'm glad I did. The first two years are mediocre, the third year has its moments, but it really hits its stride in the fourth year, and the fifth year is exceptionally good.

****** I wouldn't recommend it, you kinda need to know a bit about Harry's relationships gooing into it. I'd skim-read the first two, maybe.
