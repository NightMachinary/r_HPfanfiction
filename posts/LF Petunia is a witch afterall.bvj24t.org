:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know about these:

- magnificent series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], which is probably the best I know about,
- linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee), which unfortunately finishes exactly in the point where it starts to be interesting
- linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept by Deco), which I need to reread apparently, because I forgot most of it; oh, I see, it is that crack. I mean, sporting dragons, really?
- linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5), or she is not exactly a witch (muggleborne squib doesn't make any sense), but it is a bit of crack.
- There is a one where Petunia lives in Diagon Alley with both her boys (Dudley and Harry) above the bookstore running a kind of kindergarten for other kids, and eventually organizes destruction of Voldemort, because Dumbledore is too inept to manage it himself. Not much good, and I cannot find it ATM.

Any more?

That's why in the story, Malfoy speculates that she's actually adopted because "not only are you a squib, but you're a muggleborn squib. I didn't even know that that was possible."

*** Is there a practical difference between a muggle and a squib in your fic's universe? I just assumed she called herself that because it's more palatable for the wizards. Great fic, btw!

**** A squib is unaffected by muggle-repelling charms - they can enter the Leaky Cauldron and Hogwarts without trouble, for example. Other spells that target muggles wouldn't work on them either. Otherwise, they're pretty much muggles.

***** Well I've always assumed that if you can get a witch from Muggles, you can also get someone with really low levels of magic. So I figured she was a muggleborn squib.

*** That's a great story. Thank you. I thought more about the canonical universe and her finding out being a witch later in her life, but this is good nevertheless. So, what's next? Harry's adventures among kangaroos?

**** haha, for a while at least. But since Neville doesn't exist in this universe yet, fate (and Voldemort) will probably find Harry and set things in motion one way or another.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622306/1/][The Day The Dursleys Came To Hogwarts]] Before the first task Snape brings the Dursleys to Hogwarts to taunt Harry. This breaks everything, including a binding on Petunia's magic. Tropey but i think it mixes up the tropes to good effect. H/Hr

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
