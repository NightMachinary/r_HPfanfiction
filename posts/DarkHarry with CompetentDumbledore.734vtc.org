#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

Dumbledore is absolutely perfect in this story and the closest to the original Dumbledore that I've ever seen in fanfic. It's really interesting in that he acts as a mentor to a young Tom Riddle that is almost murdered by a time traveling Harry.

** Maybe try Linkffn(Prince of the Dark kingdom). Harry is not dark in there, but he is definitely on Voldemort's side and has no desire to join the light. His confrontations with Dumbledore(who is very much the competent leader of resistance) are very interesting.

Not complete, but worth the read either way. And it's enormous!
