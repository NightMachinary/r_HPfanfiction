:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Exactly what it says. I have a thing for rereading terrible fanfics from my adolescent days and I haven't been able to find this one.

â€‹

Other details I remember:

-He stays in a hotel

-Learns to play guitar

-I think he gets tattoos

â€‹

Help me reddit, you're my only hope.


** Other than escaping to America, it sounds a bit like Runic Animagus.
