It'll probably be a few thousands words long. Just snapshots/scenes of her life, not a serious epic length fic. But if someone wants to turn it into one, then be my guest! Just link me because I'd love to read it.

I think the First Wizarding War is going to be told from her POV and the second from Harry's, showing what it's like to have a fucked up aunt that still loves you (in the way she knows how).

Plot I've thought of so far: Sirius still goes to prison, because no one is going to listen to Psycho Bella. She does, however, manage to bribe and threaten and manipulate enough people to get VERY SUPERVISED visits with Harry as he grows up. Remus, Andromeda, Minerva, or Snape all come along to be like "Yo kid, not every magical person wants to string the minister of magic up by his intestines" and Harry's just like "wtf are intenstines". She also terrifies the Dursleys into giving him a bedroom and not as many chores. Harry is still sorted into Gryffindor, but he's Sirius's heir so of course she still loves him. Every time something wild happens at Hogwarts (Quirrell, the Chamber, etc.) Bellatrix marches into the Great Hall and rips Dumbledore a new asshole. They even duel once. It's the most fun Bellatrix has ever had. She's also the family member that comes to visit him during the Final Task, which has Draco and Harry sharing many a sympathetic grimace. Bella knows about the horcruxes, she and sirius go to destroy them, but they figure out Harry is one and refuse to let him die on the chance that he MIGHT live. AAAAANNNNNDDDDDDD that's as far as I've figured it out. I really need help with the ending. Also, just whatever else you want to help with or might want to add.

Below is what I've written so far. I am quarantined for the next week because I have the flu, so I have plenty of time to actually write this. Without further ado, if you're interested, here is the first third (? Half? Idk.) part of Bella's alternate history. Tell me what you think!

--------------

Bellatrix Black forced her way into the world with blood and pain, her pretty face contorted from all of her nonsensical screaming. It was how she would spend most of her time in it.

There was never any hope for her. It wouldn't have mattered if she were a Longbottom or a McMillan or a muggle. Fortunately, she was born a Black, a wizarding family that honed her obsessive nature, tempered it into a weapon for the ages.

She went to school. It was okay. She didn't have friends so much as people that were too afraid to tell her to go away. She got married. That was okay too, she guessed. He didn't try to force her to have children or stop experimenting and dueling, like some husbands did. He was far too afraid to tell her no.

Life was okay, if not terribly boring. Anything fun died too quickly to provide any true satisfaction. Her only true consolation was her family. She worshipped her parents, adored her sisters, but she really, truly loved her cousins. Sirius was always her favorite. Brash, defiant, confident, unapologetic, intelligent. He was everything a Black scion should be, and then he had to go and meet James Potter and get himself burnt off the family tree. Regulus became her next favorite. He too was everything a Black should be, if not a little boring.

Everything was boring. Everyone was boring.

And then she met the Dark Lord.

He most certainly was not boring. His war was most certainly not boring. Everything Bellatrix had been denied was encouraged. And then one monumental night, little Reggie comes to her, shaking with fury and terror and talking about soul magic and halfbloods and saying, “It was all a lie! I thought he was pretending to be insane to inspire terror, but he really, truly is. He's just as mad as you, cousin. He'll burn Britain down just to reign over the ashes.”

Bella watches him pace across the Lestrange library in amusement.

“Our family has ruled since before the Romans sailed across the Channel,” he rants. “I won't bow to him. I won't make us into something less than we are because some upstart orphan was cast aside by Albus fucking Dumbledore.”

He spins on his heel and claws through his black hair.

“Well?!” He demands, spit flying across the room. “Are you going to take me to him? Or are you going to prove them all wrong? I know you, Bella. You might be a sadistic sycophant but we made you that. We could have chucked you in Saint Mungo's and left you to rot, but we didn't. Will you give us your loyalty? Will you be our weapon? Or are you going to prove them all right and turn me in like a brainless, starry eyed witch fresh off the Express?"

Bella throws her head back and cackles. This is most certainly not going to be boring.

They go to Andromeda first. Andromeda with her round belly filled with dirty blood, her husband standing beside her, his hand tight around his wand. He's fair haired and chubby and utterly mediocre.

"Merlin, Dromeda! Couldn't you have soiled yourself with one of the handsome ones? Rodolphus might be spineless, but at least he's nice to look at."

Reggie runs a hand down his face. He no longer looks eighteen. His eyes have new lines and the corner of his lips are permanently pulled down at the end. A surge of rage takes over Bella. Who is the Dark Lord to do this to her cousin? What gives him the right to-

"Please, cousin, behave yourself," Regulus whines.

Bella scoffs, but she does. She listens to them dance around one another as Ted Tonks eyes her with an ever tightening grip on his wand.

They go to Sirius next. Sirius with his wild eyes and savage smile, James and Lily Potter on one side and a werewolf on the other. Everyone is silent, staring at each other with twitching hands and aggression rolling off them in waves. It's delicious.

Sirius barks a laugh first, Bella right on his heels. He always was her favorite.

Months later, Regulus is the first to die. Kreacher appears in the dining room, wailing like a dying cat and clutching a necklace to his chest. The emeralds glint in the witch light, the frantic whispers and oozing magic a balm to Bella's frayed nerves.

"They are nothing. Nothing. It would take ten of them to take you down. Their screams would be a sweet lullaby, their blood-" Bella snarls as the voice is cut off. Andromeda sniffs haughtily and holds a warded box summoned from the attic at arm's length.

"Disgusting," she drawls. "I'll be depositing this somewhere safe." She leaves in a swirl of violet robes. She will go to Gringotts, Bella knows, and home to her mudblood after. She never craved violence like the rest of them. Sirius, by contrast, is frozen on his seat at the bench. Vengeance is filling him up slowly, singing it's own macabre lullaby inside his head.

"What was that?" Lily Potter asks. James Potter picked a pretty one at least, and clever too. Bella supposes that if new blood is as necessary as everyone seems to believe, then perhaps someone as intelligent as Lily Potter wouldn't be too disgraceful. She's certainly not boring. "It felt like...like..." She rounds on her husband. "What was it?"

"I don't know," he says, and Bella knows he is being honest. The Potters never were very imaginative.

Lily turns to the werewolf next.

"What was it?"

"I don't know," he admits.

"Did it talk to you?" she asks, voice hardly more than a whisper.

Bella cackles. She can't help it. The girl is just so innocent. What could the Dark Lord possibly have tempted her with? Lily Potter jumps, having forgotten Bella's presence in the shock of the night's events and...Bellatrix frowns, then skims the mudblood's mind for clarity, because surely...But there it is. Grief. The girl actually mourns Regulus.

Merlin, these fools are sentimental.

"Of course it talked to him. What dark desires called to you, pretty little girl?" Bella demands, leaning over the table. She bats her eyes for good measure.

Potter stiffens at his wife's side, but does not try to protect her. He doesn't think she needs it. Bella will give the blood traitors that, at least. They don't treat their witches like mindless cattle.

"What did it tell you?" Lily Potter demands.

"I'll show you mine if you show me yours," Bella coos.

The other witch presses her lips into a thin line and raises her chin a gesture that can only be attributed to one Severus Snape. It is that misplaced arrogance that gives Bella the answer a mere moment before the girl bites out, "Knowledge."

"Ah," Bella says, collapsing back in her chair. "The Dark Lord has plenty enough of that. He passed much of it down to me, you know."

Potter narrows her eyes. "You're lying."

"She's not," Siri cuts in, his deep voice even rougher with emotion. "And she's going to put that knowledge to use tonight, aren't you, dear cousin?"

Bella beams. Lily Potter does not.

"Sirius?" she questions worriedly.

Sirius Black turns his gaze to her and both Potters flinch. There is madness burning in his silver eyes. Madness, fervor, and a hunger that Bella is all too familiar with. They are doomed, she knows, deep down. The Blacks are doomed to leave the world in an explosion of hellfire if Sirius Black is to be their lord.

It will be glorious.

"Black blood has been spilled tonight. I intend to drown them in it.”

His chair scrapes across the stone, causing James and Lily to cringe back in their seats. Bella lingers long enough to hear Lily Potter ask, “What did it tell you, Remus?”

“He's a werewolf, darling,” Bella cuts in. “It told him the same thing it told me.”

She pauses at the door, throws her curls over her shoulder and smirks.

“It told us to kill you all.”

With that, she follows her cousin out into the night, just barely managing to hold in her laughter.

Bella helps her Lord stagger through the entryway hours later. They are both exhausted and covered in gore. James rushes down the stairs and takes his friend in his arms, dragging him up to his rooms. Lily Potter stands hugging herself in a cheap muggle robe and bare feet, looking every bit like a little girl out of her depths.

“You're bad for him,” she says quietly.

“Maybe,” Bella allows, flicking a piece of brain out of her tangled hair. “Maybe I'm just bringing out what's already there. All of us Blacks are mad in our own way.”

“You all make each other mad, you mean. Regulus wouldn't-”

“Sweet little mudblood. Sirius didn't even tap into the ancient Black magics tonight. Something about crossing a line, whatever good that will do. Regulus would have had no such qualms. He would have turned them inside out and left them in the middle of Diagon Alley as a promise.”

“She's right, Lily,” a soft voice says.

The werewolf ascends the steps from the basement, his sandy hair wild. Remus Lupin is nice to look at. Rodolphus had a sort of cruel, sharp beauty to him. Lupin's is different. The rugged lines of his jaw and lips are accentuated by thick scars. Another tendril of angry pink flesh curls under his sleeve like a lock of unruly hair. He's smart too, and would probably give her a bit of a challenge. Not as much as Mad Eye or Sirius, of course, but enough to make her interested.

“But you're right, too,” he says. “Those of us stained with dark magic grapple with it every day. It calls to me, begging me to be let out. Being here, living in this house, fighting against dark spells so often....It's difficult. But I have you and the Marauders. You are here to remind me of what I can be. You give me hope, just as you do Sirius.”

“But what about her?” Lily asks, eyes wide and innocent.

“Oh, sweet girl. There was never any hope for me.”

She frowns stubbornly. “That's not right. You're here. That's something.”

“I'm here for my family and my lord. I couldn't care less what happens to the rest of you.”

“Well, that may be so, but I care about what happens to you.” She draws herself up importantly, shoves her chin in the air like Severus fucking Snape. “You and I are going to be friends, Bellatrix Black.”

“Girl,” Bella snaps, playfulness gone. “I have bits of bone tangled in my hair and guts dried under my nails. I killed thirteen men tonight, and only one of them with the Killing Curse.”

Lily Potter only sniffs and tosses her hair. Bella is almost positive she's seen Narcissa do the same thing before, in that very spot.

“Then we'll just have to get you cleaned up, won't we? Come on and I'll draw up a bath. You can tell me everything Vol-“ She presses her lips together in annoyance as she remembers the taboo. “Everything the Dark Lord taught you. He might be a git, but he's a smart one.”

Bellatrix glances at the werewolf incredulously. He just lifts one shoulder.

Well, Bellatrix thinks, it can't be any worse than having tea with Auntie Walburga.

Far into the night, alone in bed, Bellatrix cums to the memory of snapping Rosier's neck, of how his arms twitched, how the bone snapped so audibly. She smiles contentedly, wondering what her new friend would have to say to that.

*** Thank you! Do you have an idea of how it should end? Like the Horcrux being removed in some obscure magical ritual? Or should Harry sneak away and let himself be killed, causing Bella to go on a rampage?

I don't think I want her to survive the series. Death might be the kindest fate you could offer to someone like her.

**** Holy crap this was amazing!

Just my thoughts on the ending. You could have the whole 'Harry sacrifices himself' thing from canon and when Tom is gloating she completely loses it, attacking Death Eaters left and right. You could have her get wounded badly and just as she dies she sees Harry killing Tom for good. So Bella leaves the world as she entered it, with blood and pain but her face is smiling.

Also, with Andromoda being there, I desperately want Tonks and Bella interactions.

**** When she finds out Harry is a horcrux she starts traveling round the world interrogating cursebreakers on how to remove it from people without killing them. Maybe she kidnaps the smartest ones and keeps them under inferi guard, promising that she'll turn their families in to the next batch of inferi if they don't figure it out. You could have it as a series of interludes throughout whichever book you have her find out Harry is a horcrux. I really like the idea of her going out in a blaze of glory, surrounded by the bodies of her enemies, laughing like the mad woman she is. Bonus if she wasn't taken out by a Death Eater but a vengeful cursebreaker she kidnapped.

**** you could always have her go to a Muggle/Squib psychiatrist, get her a prescription for some antipsychotics, and have her become relatively sane by the end of the fic. (or have that as a plot point before killing her off.)

if you're really set on her dying, she could always sacrifice herself to protect Harry. like, full circle, ya know?

One suggestion though. I would keep going as snippets connected together then as a long story. Benchmarks in road, if that makes sense.

Either way, I'm sure it'll be an impressive read. Thank you for filling the world with something great to read.

** Have you ever seen Keeping Mum? It's a movie with Maggie Smith as almost exactly this, only sans magic in an idyllic English hamlet with Rowan Atkinson as a priest. I bet you'd get a lot of inspiration from it.

Also that was exquisite and I look forward to seeing more. I imagine Bella getting really camped-up-crazy-but-enjoying-the-heck-out-of-life-all-the-same by the end of this.

On your ending note, I would second the 'Bella goes out in a blaze of glory' proposal, but you could also have Harry do something terrible to win the war and nearly end up in prison because of it, yet Bella takes the fall and goes willingly to Prison because it's one last time to save him. Keeps it open for a sequel where she's broken out by Harry and they go on the run/released by the Government to help out with something or whatever else you can think of.

Hell, perhaps she and Harry just both die together as that would be quite a nice family bonding experience (That was a joke).
