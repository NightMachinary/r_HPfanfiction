Looking for any fics where Hogwarts has a junior auror or ROTC like program and yes I've read Hogwarts Battle school.


** It's not exactly a program, but Darklooshkin has written [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/37/The-random-craziness-file]["The prefects: Incident Reports"]], where Harry and Hermione treat being prefects as basically "Junior Aurors", and got training from Moody over the summer. Very funny.
