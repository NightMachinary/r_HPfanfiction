How far would you be willing to accept changes to the world and characters in a potential future reboot(how far AU could it go before it's just isn't Harry pottter for you)?


** I think this is definitely a very personal question because everyone will differ drastically.

To me it stops being Harry Potter when you change the (very loose) fundamental ideas of JK's magical world. Aka- using different words like mage instead of wizard/witch, the theory behind magic becomes so precise it makes the book impossible, the structure of the wizarding world is noticeably different from the loose idea we are given.

This doesn't mean I don't enjoy someone defining some ideas JK doesn't pin down. But when you start making the magic and it's world incompatible with the books it's not Harry Potter and /his/ world. Now it's your own. This doesn't apply to someone giving the magical world nobility or politicking becoming important. And it doesn't include that people might get tired from using too much magic: this is somewhat canon. But when you suddenly define it too much and make these really specific ideas about people's “magical core” - I will kindly think to myself that you should write your own novel with your own world and close the page (if the story isn't enthralling).

I put up with Emperor for a really long time because I found the story interesting and engaging. I never felt like I was reading Harry Potter however. And that's not because Harry was OOC, but because the authors theories about magic were incompatible with JK's world. And overtime I got bored and stopped reading. That had nothing to do with the AU in which the author had written, but the story telling.

Edit: I should add I can put up with a lot of character changes. If the story is good, I don't care what you've done with Hermione as long as the story accounts for her personality changes in the storytelling. You want to make Harry totally OOC and dark or light or gay or black or abused or an abuser. I don't care. Give me context, give me a story I want to keep reading. But it's the minute you change the world too far that it's not the HP magical world, I'm not reading Harry Potter but your personal world building. And that's okay, but I'm not going to think of it as a HP story.

Well to be fair, a few other words /do/ seem to be used (albeit less commonly) in the Wizarding World. We have evidence of "warlock" and "sorcerer" at least. And I like the idea that "mage" is a formal word that wizarding anthropologists and the like use when they have to use a gender-neutral term for a member of wizardkind, but it's not widely used orally.

**** I will acknowledge that others words are used like "warlock." But they are only in very formal titles (Supreme Mugwump, Chief Warlock). No one actually says, "hey! You're a warlock, Harry!" It seems to just be a title and not a term any witch or wizard would use to describe themselves. As you said, not used orally. But I don't believe it would be used beyond official titles. We each have our own head canons :) Personally, I really don't like the word mage. I couldn't tell you why, but I hate the sound of it.

Sorcerer was never used to describe anyone, just utilized in the American titles because they thought Americans would be too dumb to know what a philosopher is (cue massive eye roll). Nicholas Flamel isn't actually referred to as one, he's labelled an alchemist. It's only the physical Philosopher's Stone that's ever called a "sorcerer."

Please correct me if I'm wrong!

***** Dumbledore, if I recall, is a Grand Sorcerer, as were several past Headmasters according to the inscriptions in the movies, art books and theme park. Though that's also a title.

My headcanon is that "wizard" and "witch" are the basic descriptors for people with magic; "mage" is more or less equivalent to "human", and is extremely awkward to use in conversation; and "sorcerer" and "warlock" are both initially-Muggle terms that refer more to /occupation/ than to /nature/ --- a warlock or sorcerer is not only someone with the gift of magic, but someone who studies and trains it extensively. Naturally, only such an accomplished user of magic could be a leader of the magical community, hence Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot; and magical scholars whose skill is recognized as extraordinary, like Dumbledore, are granted the title of Grand Sorcerer as something akin to a Nobel Prize.

** I think there's a difference between 'Harry Potter' fanfiction and 'Wizarding World' fanfiction. There's a lot more leeway in the second. I can accept stories where there is a point of divergence as HP fanfiction. But if Harry Potter is a girl and isn't even called Harry, is it Harry Potter fanfiction at all?

I do see quite a lot of fics --- some of them are even pretty good --- which I don't think are really HP fanfiction at all. Take out the odd canon name, and it's original fiction. I understand authors wanting an audience, and there's precious little interest in original fiction unless it's published, but it feels a bit like cheating.

Ultimately though, it doesn't really matter. We all read what we like and ignore what we don't. Or should do.

We don't get all hot under the collar about our own particular peeves, do we? Nobody tries to dictate what is right or not according to their own opinions, do they . . .?

I'd say definitely. I see your point for stories that star OCs or take place in Ilvermony or some such, but a change to one characteristic of one character isn't enough for it not to be /Harry Potter/ anymore. A story about Ron, Hermione, Neville and Dumbledore would still be a /Harry Potter/ fanfiction even if Harry himself is absentee, I think we can all agree on that (seriously, how many people here read canon primarily for the main character?), so a story featuring a character who's /mostly/ like Harry, except a girl, with an accordingly different name, ought to be even /more/ /Harry Potter/.

*** Not exactly the same discussion (though there's overlap). OP here is talking about a hypothetical "reboot" that would present itself as an official retelling of the canon story with any number of changes and tweaks, whereas the "Pillars of Potter" discussion was about AUs in fanfiction.

*** Look, this is primarily fanfiction of the /books/. That the movies bungled Ginny is of no matter to most of us, for whom the basic canon that we're fan of is the novels, with the movies as nothing more than a novelty on the side. Certainly, there are many characters and events that I picture completely differently from the movies (though there /are/ also a few things from the movies that have entered my headcanon).

**** Well the books didn't do much with her either, and by “reboot” I assumed this was for a movie because you don't reboot a book. In either the books or movie she's never a fleshed out character. She's just a redhead who likes quidditch who has a temper of a Weasley. Beyond that and excluding any fandom facts what else is there?

******* Clearly, it wasn't just about being "lonely", if you actually realize what she went through. And if anything, in that book she was a main character or close to it.

It seems like you just conveniently dismiss or twist the facts for your narrative that Ginny "is just a redhead who likes quidditch who has a temper of a Weasley".
