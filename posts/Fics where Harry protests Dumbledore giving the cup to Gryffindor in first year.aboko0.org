  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** You know, I know I've read about this before, and it made a lot of sense. Giving out lots of house points for saving the Philosopher's Stone is one thing, but letting Slytherin think they'd won, even decorating the Hall in their colours, standing up to announce the winner and /then/ pulling the rug out from under them? Jerk move, old man.

But I can't remember where I read it. Sorry.

Edit: Ah, there we go, it was in linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), chapter 36.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
