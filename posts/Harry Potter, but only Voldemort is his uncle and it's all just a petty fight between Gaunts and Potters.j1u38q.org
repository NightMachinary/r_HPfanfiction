And I meant by the only minor difference that will happen is that essentially Lily Evans is a Gaunt in blood and Voldemort is the uncle that "turned dark" and is merely wanting to get to Harry because prophecy because apparently to beat a Dark Lord you need to regain full soul and he accidentally lodged part of him to Harry while also trying to regain the other Horcruxes after a state of a depressive evil time of being kicked out of DADA. Also regretting killing Riddle Sr and Myrtle after that.

Aka. Good Dumbledore, Relative Tom Riddle, Canon-Semi-Compliant, and also everything's still the same as before.

** Ohh. I imagine a softer Harry Potter. Maybe rather actual deaths curses, theyre attacking each other with embarrassing pranks. Harry befriends Ron, who helps strategize, through the twins and Hermione with her brains, assists in the equipments for the pranks.

Oh God that would be cute!

LOL. This snippet is hilarious. Harry needs to put this in a pensive, and have Uncle Tom watch it.
