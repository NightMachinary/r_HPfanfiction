It's been on my mind for some time now. So many fics have helpful goblins and bring a goblin friend or some other variation, but everything in canon says otherwise. Here are some reasons why.

Fact 1: The goblins believe anything they've made belongs to them... Not so bad but.

Fact 2: The goblins have Curse-Breakers raiding ancient tombs and cleaning what's inside, meaning anything someone else made belongs to them... That's pretty hypocritical considering the first fact.

Fact 3: spoiler for 7 book if you haven't read it We know from Griphook's actions that they'll betray you at the first opportunity.

Conclusion goblins are not honorable warriors like some fanfics portray but robbers and thieves that will stab you in the back.

Agree disagree discuss

*** I think it's authors trying to be edgy and making a weird colonialism parallel - or the wizards whitewashing history and Harry has to be open to new ideas. Somehow this segues into being open to a new love interest and possibly turning evil

** I always wonder what people who are SUPER into this in fics thoughts on banks IRL are. Like do they believe they're there to do for humanity if only you're kind enough/deserving of it as well?

why is this such a common opinion? 1. that's literally just racism, 2. Harry was fully planning on betraying Griphook at the same time
