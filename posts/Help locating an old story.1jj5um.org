The story that I read involved Harry being a prisoner in Azkaban (maybe). He was able to stay sane due to an ancient spell and had the voices of his parents as well as other witches and wizards in his mind and using their power he was able to take Voldemort out with "rolling waves of magic".

*** You are amazing! The story was on the list. It's called Fixing Broken Glass by YamiPaladinofChaos. Thank you so much for sharing this link. If I have more money, I'd give you gold.

**** Thanks for the recommend!! A good story is gold enough for me. :D I read SO MUCH fanfiction... I currently have three tabs of different stories open on my ipad, 2 on my desktop, and I'm always looking for more to queue up....... Not to mention the 75+ alerts I have on FF.net!

So yeah, the more stories the merrier! Reddit Gold would just take away from how much time I have to read fanfiction. ;)
