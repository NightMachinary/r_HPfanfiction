I've been on an intelligent Harry kick recently and wanted to know what other people would recommend.

I honestly love it the more a story is AU and am not against different main characters I just really prefer Harry Potter centric.

So far I've read, really enjoyed, and would like to read things similar to any of these: Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi (love everything about this except that it's abandoned) The Mind Arts by Gang The Merging by Shaydrall The Green in the Grey by The Blacks Resurgence Three Black Birds by Excited-Somniac The many deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT The Fourth Champion by James Spookie The Life he Leads by GeneralStarFox Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Causality Harry McGonagall by witowsmp What you leave behind by Newcomb The lie I've lived by Jbern

Thanks for taking time to read my post guys and gals, hopefully this gains traction and others who are looking for stories like these can find new fics to get lost in with me :)


** Apologies for the stories I have posted being crammed together, when I typed up the post they were spaced out but Reddit seems to want to cram them together.

Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families? Or will he buckle under the strain? YEAR 4 FINISHED. Now in Year 5

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
