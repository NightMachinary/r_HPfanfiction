:END:
I know this is not a groundbreaking request but I have gone through my current supply of this type of fic and am looking for more.

I am looking for fics where Harry is very....

1. Independent. He does not need Dumbledore, or the Order, or really anyone elses help. He chooses his own path, and often self teaches, or goes outside the bounds of typical learning to gain information. That said, while he is independent, he still may want companionship or romance. He is not a shut-in.

2. Powerful. Not necessarily god-like, but he is strong enough to stand on his own without assistance and challenge anyone. This can be magically, politically, or financially, but should really be a combination of the three. This will be connected to intimidating.

3. Intimidating. In relation to powerful, he should be intimidating in his skill and very nature. He may mostly work behind the scenes but he should still be feared, even if people do not realize HE is the one they fear. An example would be destroying the death eaters at the world cup but doing so in disguise. People may be intimidated/impressed by that person, without realizing its Harry. Or he could just be openly intimidating/powerful.

4. Darker. I am NOT talking evil. But this is a Harry not afraid to get his hands dirty, to use scare tactics and intimidate folks. To go after what he wants and not let many things stop him. To challenge others. To kill. To not fear darker magical aspects/teachings provided he does not lose who he is. Not a Voldemort style individual though (aka not fallen nearly so far as to have horcruxes for example)

Other request aspects:

Feel free to recommend anything that at least covers a few of these bases. Even if it's not a perfect match I am alwas open to suggestions so have no fear. Romance of some sort preferred included (but not required). Almost any style pairings are fine but no main character slash please. Smut/Lemons are fine but plot should hopefully come first. I prefer fics to be at least Mature in nature and rating if possible.

Thank you and Happy Holidays/Merry Christmas!

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

****** Oh yea it's actually very well done (some of the girls' voices are a bit much though). You can tell the guy who makes/made them genuinely loves the story, but it sounds like the effort to make them ended up overwhelming him as there hasn't been a chapter 12 uploaded in months.

I definitely recommend it. Easy enough to find if you search 'dodging prison and stealing witches' on youtube.

** I don't know how to use the ffn bot but The Darkness Within by kurinoone sounds like a perfect fit for you. There's a rewrite of it on kuronoones profile but I haven't read it yet so don't know if it's better or not. But the original is great. [[/spoiler][Harry gets kidnapped instead of killed on Halloween, raised as Voldy's 'son' and is a dick. He eventually breaks free but is still a dick. Extremely powerful. Slight bit of romance towards the end and moreso in the sequals]].

*** Thanks. Interestingly, while this story seems familiar to me, It's not showing up in my saved fics as one I have read. So hopefully its not one I have read.

Also, you just type linkffn.(The Darkness Within) but without the period inbetween. Or, instead of a name between the brackets, you can put the number code of the story. For example, it would be 2913149 in this case:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

Shortly, after, the bot should reply to your comment/post. I prefer using the number because there is less chance of a mistake since some stories have similar or the same names. But you can also add the author as well within the brackets to help narrow it down.

On the right side of your screen in this subreddit, if you scroll down you should see a section called Bot Usage (just after rule section) that gives more details and options.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
