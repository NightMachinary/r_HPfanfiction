  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13130447/1/Anonymous]]) is the only one that springs to mind. It's about an OC grappling with alcoholism and PTSD. Fair warning, though, there's rather a lot of child abuse, parental neglect, and non-graphic rape.

  Harry never thought that he wouldn't even know the name of the person he trusted most. After the War, McGonagall forced students involved to anonymously contact each other weekly. At first, Harry thought it was a cheesy attempt to show the Light and the Dark aren't that different from each other. Now, he feels like he can't be without her, even though they never met. HPxOC

** - There is a bit of it in linkffn(3912184) and its sequel (the best Daphne Greengrass I know about, and very different from all Haphne's of the world), but not much deep stuff.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936]] comes from the other side and it is really depressive.
- linkao3(601124) is about PTSD, and it seems like written by somebody who either studied it or has too personal experience with it
- linkffn(6142629) has at least some non-war traumas

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
