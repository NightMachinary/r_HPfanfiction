Looking for a fic I read awhile ago that centered on Remus during Order of the Phoenix. It involved him posing as Dudley's history teacher I think, in order to covertly protect him.

I remember it being a fairly decent fic, with surprisingly good characterization. I think it explored a bit of the relationships that Remus had with Tonks and Sirius as well as the rest of the Order.

Haven't been able to find it searching through fanfiction.net, so thanks if anyone knows it.

*** Thanks! Fernwithy is one of my favorite authors, I had no idea about this story. Her Hunger Games fics are fantastic.

*** Yes, this is exactly it, thank you!

This fic isn't on her FF.net profile for some reason, which explains why I couldn't find it.

I'm glad it's as good as I remember.
