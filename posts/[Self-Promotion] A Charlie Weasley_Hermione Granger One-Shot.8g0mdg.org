** Where is the magic? Overall the writing is not bad and the interactions are believable. The Harry Potter universe has magic at its center and to have a work without it is almost criminal. That's just my take.

Now for me to nitpick. I think its OOC for Ginny to dislike Quidditch the way she does. She snuck out as a child to fly brooms, I don't think her love would disappear for it, or for it to be just a job.

As to Harry not wanting a family? Another thing I really don't see happening.

Overall very solid work. Keep writing!

  Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger have a secret, one that Ginny's been orbiting for a while. And at Harry's twenty-fourth birthday shindig, she's about to come in for a landing. Rating for smut. A one-shot.
