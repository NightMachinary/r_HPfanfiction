Hey guys!

Considering all the uncertainty, I've been looking for comfort in my reading lately. I got wrapped up in In the Name of the Brave by LullabyKnell, and I'm looking for similar works. Exploring a lived-in Hogwarts. Real 11-year-old concerns, like mean prefects, weird interactions between teachers, homework, etc. Young trio friendship feels. A Harry who desperately wants more information about his parents, but has too many questions and no one to ask.

Thanks very much! :)
