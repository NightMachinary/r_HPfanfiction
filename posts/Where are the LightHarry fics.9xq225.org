I've read so many dark fics lately that I'm getting a bit tired of the same thing over and over again. Are there any fics with a Light!Harry that's a legitimately good person and also not ruthless?

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

** What's up with the completely unconstructive comments in here? When people ask for Harry/Ginny fics I never see you sending them to canon [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] .

@OP: Sadly there's very few fanfics. Most (cynical) people think that Harry is stupid, because he [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood][is]] too [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb][good]] not that he is stupid and also [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotDumb][good]]. There's a few TVTropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice][pages]] that makes for an interesting read in that regard. I'd love to have more Chaotic or even Lawful Good Harry fics, but most that aren't dark are somewhere on the neutral axis.

If I can think of anything else I'll come back to this comment. I've recently recommended it, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) kinda fits. Seeing Lawful Good characters that aren't mocked is quite a rare occasion.

**** Lawful Good has a pretty bad rep, because it's so easy to portray it in a comedically stupid manner. I think I already linked to the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood][Stupid Good]] article.

But it's probably one of the hardest archetypes to get right. I'm sure Dumbledore started out as some kind of Lawful Good in JKR's mind... ah, I'm not going to go into that now.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

**** Excellent. I'm on mobile now, so I don't quite have as good of an organization system up here as I do on my computer so I'm basically just wracking my brain instead of looking at organized tags, but here's a couple more!

Linkffn(12382425) Like A Redheaded Stepchild by mugglesftw is an adorable, delightful romp that starts witha redheaded Harry, in his hand me down clothes, being confused for a Weasley. Mugglesftw tends towards writing good characters anyway and I will also recommend Harry Potter and the Iron Lady, but even though Harry stays light things get pretty bleak in that one, fair warning.

linkffn(11898648) I also will recommend Harry Potter and the Runestone Path by Temporal Knight. So, for this one, my brother and I argued about whether it counted as a purely light Harry. I say it does and this is my comment, so it's going here, but be warned I may be wrong. Some dark things happen, but as far as I remember they're all basically Harry poking things he doesn't understand too well and accidentally making runic stuff that's, uh, extra scary and he always feels bad and backs off it once he realizes how he fucked up. It's a harem fic, but it's got a really engaging storyline and I highly recommend it.

There is nothing in canon which would indicate that the Patronus is different from any other advanced charm. For all we know, it causes untold agony to the dementors (as opposed to the swift release of "death" by Fiendfyre).

This however raises the question of what you would define as "light magic"? There is a pretty common theme of "light" magic as given by the (good) god(s), so stuff like the cleansing fire of a diety would be light magic even if it smites someone just like the killing curse. Burning swords wielded by angles seem to be a thing, as is "holy water" (or similar) which ruthlessly kills dark creatures.

However, I don't think that this is what you are going for. So what would you define as "light magic" and why would anyone use it in combat as opposed to something which is actually useful? Canon, for example, has pepper spray against tanks during the final battle (with the exception of Molly, who uses the killing curse).

***** I'm well aware that nothing separates the Patronus from others, but it is commonly used as an example of light magic, thus I used it. As for what I define light magic is basically very cryptic, ancient, and powerful magic, that while not requiring any type of moral fiber, is also unusable by those who have seeped themselves in more foul magics. It's relative secrecy explains it's lack of usage, and it's requirements rule out it's usage by Voldemort and his ilk.

Of course, I know that is a very specific definition (or headcanon, more like it) that I plan to use for a fic of my own some day, so I'm mostly just satisfied with magic that is basically the opposite of dark magic, and on the same power level of it, roughly. Just like the Patronus, things that are fueled by happy things or emotions.

** I'm curious if you simply use "light" as the opposite of "dark" or if you're more after good!Harry stories instead of those that feature independent!Harry or edgy!Harry protagonists.

The choice of words can make all the difference, I've come to realize. Not too long ago I read a story in which Harry is curious why nobody talks about light magic, since everybody says dark magic is bad. He researches things, realizes that both God and angels exist and eventually learns why the wizarding world swears by Merlin instead. I don't remember the author or title sadly, but it started in 5th year. It's not a play on a good!Harry though, more of an alternative take on wizarding world culture and history. Maybe someone else can help out if that's something you are interested in reading.

​

I think World On Fire also counts. It's a headmaster Harry, top of his game, fighting an alien invasion. linkao3(13570164)

​

I also think that pretty much every fic by Esama features a moral, "good" Harry. Especially linkao3(1134255), linkao3(1358209), linkao3(3412346), linkao3(2849939).

** I remember reading some fics by Athey that described light magic as being based off of willing sacrifice. As opposed to unwilling sacrifice. The key idea is the bone of the father ritual which incorporates blood of the enemy forcibly taken versus the bond of blood charm that has Lily's willing sacrifice combined with Petunia taking in Harry (however grudgingly). The latter is somehow Light while the former is Dark.

This doesn't really get to the patronus question. Some fics I've read have the patronus as a dark spell because it involves emotions, however positive.
