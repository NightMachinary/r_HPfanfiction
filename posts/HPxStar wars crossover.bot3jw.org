I am looking for a story that i read a long while ago. It starts with Harry falling through the veil to the times of the when Yoda is still just a knight or even before this time. Harry can't die in this story and he starts a company called Potter industries or Corp, cant remember which. He lives for at least a thousand years, was originally trained by the Sith and became an assassin before breaking their control on him. This story is supposed to be a HarryxHermione story with Harry waiting out all these years just to get back to his correct time.

If anyone can help me figure out just what this story is, id greatly appreciate it.


** Sounds like linkffn(12497548), but its Luna instead of Hermione

** It might have been Luna but I could have sworn it was Hermione. Maybe my mind is just blurring two stories together. It wouldnt be the first time.

Thank you though for answering, I really appreciate it.

** I know it's a Darth Marss story. It's Harry/Hermione/Luna, and turns into a crossover with Stargate Atlantis, I think. I'll look for the link.

*** It doesn't fit. In that one, Harry ends up in Star Wars during the Empire, and he had forgot about his original world. The sequel is a Stargate: SG-1 crossover.
