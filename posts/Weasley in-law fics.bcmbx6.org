Looking for fics or one-shots that involve interaction between the Weasley in-laws. Like Harry and Hermione are best friends so it's a given that they'd hang out, but I'm looking for them doing things with Fleur and Angelina, or whoever you might head cannon one of the Weasleys marrying. Like it can even be just them getting weekly tea and discussing all the dumb things their spouses and children got up to in the past week.

Doesn't have to be the focus of the fic, but I'd like it to at least be a part of. Can be serious or fluffy or crack.
