Misunderstanding a conversation with Hermione where she's talking about Pet Peeves, Harry decides to make Peeves his Pet, and causes havoc with the Poltergeist.


** That'd be a great fic. I'd love to see one where Peeves comes across Harry while he's moping about death and basically ends up offering to help with his Bucket List. :D
