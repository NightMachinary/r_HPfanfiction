** linkffn(The Last President of Gallifrey) Hermione is Romana, Ten and Martha show up after the Battle of Hogwarts, right after /The Shakespeare Code/, where Harry Potter was mentioned and played a role in the climax.

In linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) Harry writes his own accounts to tell the Wizarding World the (appropriately altered to avoid a panic) truth of his life, with the true stories being released in the sequel.
