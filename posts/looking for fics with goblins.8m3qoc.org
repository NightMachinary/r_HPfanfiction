Any fics featuring goblins/gringotts! If theyre well utilised, even better :)


** linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) is pretty good.

Incidentally, I have no idea what the /other/ message with the name Achille-Talon, and its weird bot-abuse, is about. I absolutely did not write that and have no idea how you could get the bot to do this. (Help.)

****** What the hell!!!? Your username is the same as mine??? I had no idea that was possible? Damn your account has been active for a long time too. This is so fucking weird.

The bot comment was just an edited reply though, nothing weird.

******* Okay, I get it. /Your/ username is spelled with the letter "i" in capital where mine has regular a "l".

...why did you chose Achiiie-Taion with capital 'I's, though, if not to copy my username (or perhaps we're both referencing the same character? but then, why?)
