I am looking for a fic where Harry escapes Britain to go to a school in the USA. I think there were two different versions, one where he escapes to the US and the one where is forced to stay in Britain. I am looking for the one where he goes to the USA, it involves him hiring a lawyer to escape the country and I think Dumbledore wanting Snape to continue Occlumency lessons in the summer after 5th year, I think it was also over 500k words but not sure on that. If anyone can help me find this I would really appreciate it.


** Here ya go, one of my favorites.
