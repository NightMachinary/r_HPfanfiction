Recently I have discovered Jordan Peterson. As for my love of Harry Potter, are there any attempts on the internet to fuse these two? You might know Jordan Peterson for his lectures on the value of the archetypal hero: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w&list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat]]

Now, any story that gives a decently truthful depiction of Jordan Peterson would already suffice, where his personality is accurately and credibly portrayed. What is out there?


** I think the more appropriate question is: Should there be?

The answer is no.

*** Why not? I see it as a thought-experiment written out where the archetypal hero encounters someone aware of the conventions and rules regarding the archetypal hero story. What's so dangerous about it that it should not exist?

**** Because Harry Potter is about magic, adventure and bravery. Not about philosphy or psychology. So no. Absolutely not. It'd be horribly wanky.
