I remember he became friends with orochimaru who went to his village, amused that the snake guy is looking for immortality but hates obito/madara He tries to constructively help the missing nin but not overstep their free will. I think his only rule is no killing in the village and to not to bring anbu/hunters in the village. Where most village feels threatened that there's a village of missing nin.


** I believe it's Missing Nin Village by Galleons'n'Gold.
