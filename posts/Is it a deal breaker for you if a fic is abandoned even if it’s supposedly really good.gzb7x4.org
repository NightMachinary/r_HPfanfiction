** No. It's very disappointing but not a deal breaker. Of course it both helps and hurts more if the fic is a long one.

There were a handful of fics that i had in my abandoned drawer that got updated during this quarantine. So there is always hope.

** Yeah, its pretty much a dealbreaker. I get reeeeeeally emotionally invested, and if the story is abandoned it pulls the rug out from under me pretty hard. I sometimes avoid even active fics without consistent uploads, just to avoid that kinda thing.

** Yes! I also won't read anything on hiatus, with inconsistent updates, large gaps in the writing (I check this with reviews on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and the full page index on AO3). It has to update at least once a month or be finished. I hate getting invested and then never finding out where the story goes. The reason I don't read stories with large gaps in the writing (like a few months or so) especially long ones because if I am reading all at once I notice authors forget their own plot points and events. It ruins the flow of the story for me.

** Yes. I can ignore if it's been a long time since an update, because I am an optimist (and the world is in quarantine), but if the summary says straight up that the fic is abandoned I won't even open it.

** No, I would still read and enjoy it. Then I would curl up and cry.

** Yup. I get way too invested and then that last chapter is just a gut punch to me when I realize that there's no story left. The Life And Times was the last abandoned fic I read, and is honestly probably the reason why I only read completed fics.

** It depends on how much I'm interested in the premise, characters, length, etc. Basically it's on a case-to-case basis. But usually it is a deal breaker if incomplete.

** Yes. I've solved it by filtering only for stories marked as ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù - my closure needing heart just can't handle it otherwise üòÇ

** I'm more inclined to read an abandoned fic than one that is still updating. I read so much so fast I can't remember what happened where when the updates come out. I wait until they're done. But I'm always sad when a good abandoned fic cuts off.

** It depends. If the fanfic has 100k+ words then no. If it doesn't, I can't read it

** Theoretically no, but practically yes.

If I read a really good fic, but the sequel is abandoned halfway through, I may or may not read what sequel there is.

What I really appreciate is when an author ends at a natural story arc and tells us the outline of the future plot points as they wrap up their fic. The story Hermione Granger, Demonologist does a great job of not leaving us hanging.

** For the most part I only read completed fics because it's to hard to keep all the WIP's separate. For the rest I consider a fic abandoned if it hasn't been updated in more than a year and I'll read it then. If the author continues from that point it's just a bonus.

** Not really, sometimes I'm not in the mood for a WIP and I wont start anything that doesn't have a decent chapter/word ratio already posted, but there is some great stuff out there that I feel is still worth the read.

** Not really. I mean, it is still a good fic, and if I'm desperate for an ending, I'll just treat it like a prompt and enjoy what is already there meanwhile.
