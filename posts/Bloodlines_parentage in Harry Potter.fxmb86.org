So it is 4:30am and i'm ready harry potter, I've just started deathly hallows and it's got me thinking. So we know what it's called when you have two muggle parents, Muggleborn, we know when it's called when you have one muggle parent and one wizard parent, Half-blood, and we know what it's called when you have two wizard parents, Pure-blood, but what if you hade a Half-blood parent and a Muggle parent, what would you be classed as? or if you had a Pure-blood parent and a Half-blood parent? it just really got me thinking then it confused me a lot because it's not like you could call a child who had a muggle parent and a half-blood parent, muggle and would they just be classed as half-blood or what???? i want answers!


** A half-blood is still a magical parent, so even if they spawned with a Muggle, their sprogs would still be Half-bloods themselves. Pureblood and half-blood would probably also be Pureblood, but it's canonically a more socio-political delineation than a racial one - Sirius's whole line about families just crossing Muggles and Squibs out of the family tree and pretending they don't exist shows you can be Pureblood despite having Muggle (and likely even Half-blood) relatives so long as you deny it loud enough - meaning there's probably a lot of Purebloods with non-Pureblood relatives who just call themselves Purebloods still.

It's not scientific, peer-reviewed categorisation, it's just what the people in power use to say "We're the best, these other people suck!", despite the fact it's an unachieveable goal they could never live up to.

** The real question is what you are if both your parents are muggleborn?

** Muggle-born is if you have magic and had two Muggles (non-magical) as parents. Squib is if you have no magic but were born from magical parents (even if one is Muggle and the other is magic). A pure-blood mustn't have any 'Mudbloods' as grandparents, meaning no Muggles or Muggle-borns, only half-bloods and pure-bloods. The rest is either half-blood or part non-human.
