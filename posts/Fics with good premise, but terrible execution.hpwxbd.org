For me, it's linkffn(Basilisk Eyes).

It has such a good hook... and then it doesn't go anywhere. Like, seriously. It just keeps describing Harry dealing with blindness... for over a hundred chapters. No plot. I don't think they even started their third year at Hogwarts even after 100 chapters.


** Junior Inquisitor. Dumbledore missing Harry's trial and Harry turning it into an opportunity to be on Umbridge's side is an interesting idea. The initial bashing was okay (for me). The turn in, or after, chapter 20 was pretty unexpected.

** I don't know what genre it was marked as though, I think it is kind of supposed to be about disability, and his interaction with all the other disabled OC's. For me I thought it was executed quite well in terms of how they describe the blindness, they obviously put a lot of thought into how it would work in the wizarding world, and being blind myself I thought it was well executed. They're writing style definitely improved as well, at first it wasn't great, but it has definitely got better.

*** I agree. It's as if a bunch of media consumers don't seem to realise that there's more than just the standard action adventure story. They get upset when whatever it is doesn't match their expectations, but if the story wasn't what they expected it to be that's got nothing to do with the creator, that's the consumer's fault.

***** Not really, more like “just because it's not an action story doesn't mean it's not a good story, if you don't like it because it isn't something you wanted that's not the author's fault.”

*** Which is fine for a 10 or 20 or if you really stretch it, a 30 chapter story.

For literally over 150 chapters? Not so much.

** I like Basilisk Eyes for the world building and the multifaceted OCs.

  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him. Blind!Harry POV. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.

** I really liked it even though its so long and isn't reaching a conclusion yet. The OCs are fleshed out really nicely, and it deals with how disabilities are dealt with in the wizarding world. The world building was good and the author put a lot of thought into it.

** I honestly don't know, I might need to go and re-look at the description but from what I remember it didn't really give much away, so I don't even think there was supposed to be much of a premise in the first place. I get that though, it does drag in some sense. Everyone has preferences.

** Linkffn(when in doubt obliviate) the idea was interesting and the beginning was pure gold, but then I feel like it went to deep in crack even though it really didn't need to.

Linkffn(partially kissed hero) was also very interesting, but it ended up dissolving in a Bashing-for-no-good-reason feast that alternatively makes Dumbledore some omniscient and amoral threat with an endless political clout that would torture kill orphans and puppy's for absolutely no reason and then turns and makes him an absolute idiot who can't see his plans being thwarted from right behind his nose and wouldn't be able to find a way to escape from a potato sack even with a map, GPS, signs and literally screamed and detailed instructions. Besides it also falls under the same old ‘power isn't able to overcome experience' fallacy, which never falls to piss me off.
