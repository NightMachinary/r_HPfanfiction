For example, I'm sure if you look at whatever your reading/enjoying at the moment and compare it to the type of tropes your accepted when you first started reading, then you'd be surprised. Especially if you read a lot of AU and your comparing it solely to cabin.

I have only ever read fanfiction from four fandoms, and two of them where only a few stray fics. When I first got into reading Harry Potter fanfic I, admittedly, only ever read for Drarry. No other pairings and not caring about plot points. But then in most of these fics severitus was common, so I got into that. And around the same time I got into slytherin!Harry which openned up a can of wormholes.

At first I would only read WBWL if it had drarry/severitus and I slowly started to enjoy this genre. Then recently I got into timetravel and dimension travel, and somehow I'm now reading Voldemort-won-the-first-fics which there are quite dissapontedly not much of.

For now I still can't stomach dark!Harry but maybe one day I will. I mean, now I don't care about pairings (still prefer slash but not too bothered) and care more about character/parental/friendship/world building development.

So, how did you gradually fall into your hole of fanfiction preferations? 0


** Let's see:

*Summer 2006*

Harry/Ginny 6th and 7th year fics. My entry into the fandom was via the HPANA forums, where I happened across a link to SIYE. So initially the only fics available to me were Harry/Ginny fics. First fic I ever read was Power of Emotion by Melindaleo (you never forget your first).

Then I stumbled across FF.Net and everything changed.

*Autumn 2006 - 2008*

My teenage edgy phase. Dark Harry, evil Harry, indy!Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, etc.

Probably my gateway fic into these stories was The Scorpion Sorcerer by Volorn666. One of his author's notes contained a rant about DLP, who had just placed his fic in second place in their annual fanfic awards. He was pretty angry about not getting 1st place. My curiosity was engaged and I headed over to DLP, where I found my natural fanfic home.

This was around the time that I first started trying my hand at writing. The first thing I ever wrote (no copy of which survives, having disappeared at some point when I switched from one computer to the next) was a truly awful story about a Russian half-vampire OC who was related to the Black family, attended Hogwarts with Tom Riddle and became a Death Eater.

*2009 - 2013*

This point marks the time where I got tired of bashing, tired of endless summers of training, tired of manipulative Dumbledore and thinking dark magic was cool. This was also the period in which my views on magic solidified and grew in sophistication.

I was (and am) still drawn to powerful Harry stories, but my preference grew for a more emotionally mature Harry within fics with unique premises, often telling self-contained stories rather than indefinite epics.

This period was also the time in which I did some proper writing, paying attention to what I was doing and how to do it better, lots of critical evaluation of my own work, and starting and abandoning a number of stories as my preferences and writing evolved. The culmination of my writing in this period was The One He Feared (originally called Fawkes' Gift).

*2014 - 2017*

Dormancy. I didn't leave the fandom completely, but was much less involved. Barely read anything, just updates to the fics I was already following (which were few and far between). Still made some attempts at writing now and then, but got very little done.

*Autumn 2017 - Present*

Re-emergence and writing-focus. In this present period my focus is on writing rather than reading. It marks the period since I started Victoria Potter (a complete re-imagining of an earlier fem!Harry fic I had written).

I still occasionally open Scryer and look through the latest fics published on FF.Net, or check out fics recommended by others. But I can't remember the last time I read a fic that genuinely gripped me enough to keep me reading to the end. I open fics, I skim through them, I look for interesting ideas which engage my imagination, but I don't really consider myself a reader of fanfic anymore. My focus is entirely on writing.

** Wow my taste in fanfiction changed drastically! A small thing was a I changed from fanfiction.net to Ao3 because their formatting is cleaner and easier. For starters i remember when I first started reading I would read some drarry and some Hinny stuff. Mostly stuff canon without any tropes or anything. It was all very sweet and calm( still a sh*t ton of angst cause we love our authors) Now I read a lot of dark!harry I don't even know why it changed. Some people can't get into that stuff which I get but there really interesting to read. Another thing is that I usually stick to Harry as the mc instead of others like Hermione, Ginny etc. I also don't read marauders anymore. So my taste went dark and sort of near sighted. Ofc I read other stuff but it's more rare now.

** My taste in fanfics didn't really change, tropes were just added as i read more. I started with Lord Potter stories then OP!harry to arcane type magic fics. I then learned to like crossovers and original themes. I reread old fics that i liked and search for more like it.

** My overall preferences haven't changed much. I started reading fanfic as a young teenager, around the time Half-Blood Prince came out, and most of what I read was Draco-centered with various ships. I was drawn to redemption arcs, enemies-to-friends-to-lovers, and complex family dynamics. Those all still apply to my current taste. However, I was far less picky at that age, so there was a prevalence of fanon!Draco, hate sex, and so on.

Nowadays, I still primarily read Draco-focused work. I'm just fussier about it. I love character growth and grey areas, but I need the character to resemble their canon selves and grow from those existing flaws - instead of having them replaced with more romantic or acceptable ones. I have less patience for generic good girl/bad guy style tropes and bashing. It's also difficult (though not impossible) for me to read fic written prior to the last 2/3 books being released, as the characterization is understandably quite different.

I also can no longer read Drarry for the life of me, which is a bit frustrating as changes go. I'd have so much more to read if that wasn't the case.

** Oh dear I can't remember the exact path of what I started reading. I do remember that on the early days for me I read a lot of harem/ lord Potter fics, with a good side of dumbledore/ Weasley bashing.

After a while I realized all those fics are exactly the same. Started reading some crossover works which were either “Harry gets adopted by X then goes to hogwarts” or “Harry goes missing they use the goblet of fire to compel him to return”

Now it's just turned into seeing if there are any interesting romance stories done well. Or if there are stories that subvert the tropes we've seen done to death.

** I've been reading for about 13 years & I still have my main interests that cut across all fandoms. Lots of hurt/comfort, family-oriented stories. I have gotten more comfortable with very AU things as time has gone on & appreciate OCs waaay more than I used to. I think I've just gotten more comfortable with creative license overall & don't worry as much about canin-fidelity.

** That is a very good question.

Well, I have been - with some breaks - reading HP FF in the last 15 years (I feel positively ancient now). My favorite pairings never changed - I love Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Krum and I love Sirius/OC and AUs with Sirius alive.

First, I read mostly romance with happy endings, often total Mary Sue or fluff. Through the years, I started to pay attention to other, more ... shall we say... psychological interesting characters like Draco Malfoy. I went through a Dramione phase. After my son was born, I started to question Dumbledore's motives to let Harry live with the Dursleys - I mean, HOW can he left a toddler with abusive family? I really do not like Dumbledore now.

But my one and only love is Sirius Black and I love good fanfiction with him but no slash.

** I spent a long time not really reading fanfics beyond the first few I read and then read way too many in a very short span of time.

In that binge period, I started off reading Harmony and now I basically can't stand anything that isn't Hinny.

An interesting question is whether I could read something [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14454174/chapters/33390198][like this again]]... which is Dramione, but Harry and Ginny were together during the war (until they both died). Given I read lots of next gen stuff with canon pairs in the background, maybe?

** Ah sht, it's been a long year of fanfiction reading and developing my tastes, I don't think I have any maguc system in mind but I do have a looooooooong list of fic ideas that spans two big notebooks, though they are very detailed

I first got into this from those youtube videos that are basically little girls making dream weddings that are separated into episodes and have way too much drama, like ”oh remus died, you've sobbed for a day and now you have to get attacked by death eaters”, I somehow got addicted to those and in one stroke of genius I searched google for more hp fan stories, and that's how I found fanfiction, I then looked at Reddit because there was probably a sub here, and there was.

Now, my first fic was a rather shameful harem fic with a sex curse linkffn(the curse's cure by dragonraptor) the ending was such a cliffhanger that I'm still annoyed at it, but whatever

From there I got into Haphne, partly because she was blonde and I had a crush on a blonde back then, I read a lot of them, probably all the ones over 80k words that are on ffn

Then I went into pure HP stories like animagus!harry, op!harry, MoD!harry and indy!harry, I'm still drawn to those powerful animagus harry stories, but I rarely find any good ones anymore

After this I got into some SG-1 xovers and all that space warfare stuff for a while. Was good read a few fics

At this point I'd found out about Ao3 and the wonders that the search engine there provided, along with reddit those are even now my fanfic searching methods, I went to search for purely well written fics and occasionally looked at all the posts in some tropes (you can just put something like slytherin or snake familiar after [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and it'll show you all the posts that contain that word)

Here I again got into spaceships + magic crossover fics and read a few more of those

I just forgot that I got into Ravenclaw!Harry almost immediately and after that it has been mostly Slytherin!Harry and then some Gryffindor and Hufflepuff stuff, then I somehow found a Snily fic, which somehow became my favourite fic to this day because of the amazing writing, references and plot, it still barely holds my #1 spot almost being beaten by an elemental harry fic that was written so frikin well it's amazing

After the tropey stuff I got into Harry/Luna and Harry/Hermione and loved those, then I thought, what the heck why not both and got into lunar harmony. There are actually very few of those sadly, same can be said for Harry/Luna, but I read a few and am still looking.

After that I just read whatever caught my eye and went with it, but after reading a single fic where there was a fleet of old enchanted ships that attacked Hogwarts, I decided to look into magical naval warfare, but sadly I have only found a single fic and an abandoned sequel, (contain smut and bondage stuff) I don't think I'd like any cross overs with PoC but I think I'm desperate enough soon.

My current pairing to read is Harmony and a rare Harry/Susan fic if I find a good one, if there's a reasonable Tomarry fic then I might read it

Tropes or stuff that i still like: powerful harry, animagus harry and magical naval warfare with old galleons, and shamefully sometimes I do like to read a good Lord HJ Potter-Peverell-Gryffinfor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Emrys-Gaunt-Greengrass-Bones-Black-Weasley-Lovegood-Granger-Evans-Snape-Prince or whatever but it's very rare

Please link some fics that fit any of those, I like my fics.

Edit: omg how could I forget my small venture into writing on a HP minecraft server, where I made very short stories that were pretty good according to my friends, but I'm pretty sure they embellished the goodness of them (I did get an O on all of them)

*** What types of tomarry fics do you like? I know a few good ones, otherwise there's [[/r/tomarry][r/tomarry]] or [[/r/harrymort][r/harrymort]]. Also would you mind linking any animagus!Harry fics? I like a good animagus Harry in a fic but I've never actively sought one out. Indie!op! Harry's are good but you rarely get any unique ones nowadays

Linkffn(the accidental animagus)has two sequels Linkffn(three black birds) was abandoned sadly, but they got to the animagus part Linkffn(vox corporis repost) very good fic I know there are more good ones but I don't remember which ones they were

Edit: nvm linkffn(the saviour of magic) Linkffn(the lightning lord) both are very similar but i think the animagus form is different Then there is this one linkffn(the guardians of power) op!harry severitus merlin and founders mentor fic
