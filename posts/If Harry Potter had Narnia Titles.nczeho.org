If the Harry Potter books Had Narnia Titles

1. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Boy Who Lived

2. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Heir of Slytherin

3. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Dog, the Wolf, and the Rat

4. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Four Champions

5. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Lost Prophecy

6. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Memory Pensive

7. The Chronicles of Hogwarts: The Battle of Hogwarts

Okay, I am only now realizing his similar the titles to Harry Potter and the Narnia books are.

What about with Friends titles?

1. The One with the Escape Room Scenarios

2. The One with the Spiders and Snakes

3. The One with the Map and Hermione Doing Weird Stuff

4. The One with Fake Moody and Dragons

5. The One where Harry Mopes Around

6. The One with the Potions Book

7. The One where Harry kind of dies but is ok

** I thought you meant titles in the royalty sense of the word, which I also think could be neat.

The Pevensie kids all live to adulthood and become Narnian royalty, then revert back to being children when they leave. Starting the story /after/ Harry comes back from Narnia seems like a pretty viable way to give him lots of traits that authors seem to love giving him, without it seeming out of place. Mature for his age, cynical, overly-familiar with politics, skilled at magic, out-of-context magic abilities, etc. Benefits of time travel without the pesky future knowledge.

It also gives you a nice excuse for characterization flashbacks, a source of potential mysteries (people he only knew as adults in Narnia, now in the outside world as children?), and probably other potentially useful stuff without having to clutter the story with a full crossover.

***** I would avoid using the same word twice and to avoid giving out too many spoilers I would go with:

1. The letters, the castle, and the mirror
2. The voice, the ghost, and the diary
3. The grim, the dementors, and the traitor
4. The broom, the herb, and the cup
5. The dreams, the pigs, and the seer
6. The war, the memory, and the assassination
7. The hunt, the death, and the immortal

**** The letter, the stone, and the trapdoor

The book, the heir, and the chamber

The map, the wolf, and the traitor

The cup, the game, and the graveyard

The phoenix, the inquisitor, and the veil

The spy, the past, and the tower

The wand, the stone, and the cloak

I feel like 3 and 6 are the hardest to do this way, with 7, 4 and 2 as the easiest

** While I like the names of all of them, they really do make the books seem like they were written by CS Lewis, would the one for PoA not give away the twist of Pettigrew? The only rat mentioned in Book 1 and 2 is Scabbers and people would naturally assume there was something up with him.
