:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the name but I remember a few details.

It was a Harry/Multi Pairing. (I think it was Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Gabrielle/Luna/Daphne or something)

Gabrielle died in the lake but Harry saved her and he rebirthed her to become part Phoenix part Basilisk

Umbridge tries to take Gabrielle away because Umbridge believes Gabrielle is a "monster that shouldn't be around children"

Gabrielle defeats all the death eaters and Umbridge by turning into her basilisk form and they get turned into statues.

It was on fanfiction.net It is a completed fanfiction.

Please reply if you know the fanfiction.


** I mean to give no insult, but that is one of the crackiest, most ridiculous summaries I've ever heard. I love it.
