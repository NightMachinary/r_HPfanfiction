As stated in title


** The canon effects of Liquid Luck are pretty clear, it directs your actions to effect the outcome most in line with your goals, even if you have no idea what you're actually doing at the time. So you would drink it when you want to buy a ticket, and then it would direct you to get into your car and drive to wherever you can obtain a winning ticket. Presumably if you can't get a winning ticket during the time the Felix is in effect, you do nothing.

*** or you do something else

which winds up with a good result.

you are in your car you drink the potion and start driving, you head in a different direction to the ticket shop. you come across someone with a broken car, you help them out

you get along really well with them and decide to ask them out

you get married, and have a good life

** Taking into account the statistics that many lottery winners end up in depression, suicidal or even family member planning to get rid of them, maybe Felix Felicis prompts you not to buy a lottery ticket at all. But to answer your question, judging from the effects described in the book, you would probably drink it when you select the numbers.

** Since it has a set period of time when it works i'd drink it before buying tickets, but i'd buy said tickets as soon before the lottery having it's results published as possible. That way, you guarantee the outcome.
