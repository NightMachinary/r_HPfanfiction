** If you are looking for guerrilla war and small-unit actions, /Divided and Entwined/, linkffn(11910994), is the right fic. All parties behaved as they should in a real war, which means fairly ruthless and vindictive. You won't see bad guys throwing everything including the kitchen sink, while the good guys respond only with stunners and non-lethal tactics.

If you like clash of magical nations with hundreds of combatants involved, try /Hermione Granger and Marriage Law Revolution/, linkffn(10595005).

For fics describing combined magic and technology wars, where thousands of wizards and millions of muggles fight together, then /Emperor/, linkffn(5904185). It's also full of strategies, some pulled straight from Sun Tzu's Art of War and the 36 Stratagems, and reapplied to the magical world.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** It's really only for the last ten or so chapters, but The Bonds of Blood linkffn(5435295) ends with basically a full on war against Voldemort. The last battle has something like 200-300 wizards on either side. The fix is a H/G soul-bond fic, and can be pretty tropey at times, but I'm a fan of Darth Marrs, and soul-bonds are a guilty pleasure of mine. I'd say it was a 7-7.5/10.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
