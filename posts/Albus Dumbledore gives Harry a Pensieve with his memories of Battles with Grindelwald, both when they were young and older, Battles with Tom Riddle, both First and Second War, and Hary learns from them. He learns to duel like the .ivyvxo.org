** i recall a story somewhat similar to this premise, though i don't remember the name of the story or author. basically, Dumbledore didn't rely on pure dumb luck to make sure things turned out well after his death.

he has Fawkes find harry, and with some type of ritual that included the Elder Wand and Fawkes making Harry bleed, gave Harry all of Dumbledore's knowledge.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Imagine dueling is like playing Starcraft. Instead of mastering computers, it evenly learning all RTS games, like Dumbledore, Harry just grinds Starcraft.

By 15, he has a real shot at being a world class duelist. He cant transfigure flowers to save his life, but turning a huge chunk of floor into ice or lava is easy. He knows of household charms, but he is pants at them.

Sensing, reacting, aiming, willing, timing, and powering spells is what Harry knows. Take your plants and potions and history and what to do against grindylows and stuff it.

** "I've learnt from the best and, the worst Tom, don't make me do this!" Harry screamed at the monster in front of him.

Voldemort stared at Harry, his eyes glowed with a furious red gleam. Then he spoke, his voice low and quiet. "You underestimate my power." It was a statement, not a boast, and not an exaggeration. He spoke with conviction, with full confidence in his words.

Harry did not try to convince the beast in front of him to lay down his arms any further. His eyes now held resignation of what he had to do. Harry whipped out his wand in front of him and, not a moment later a red beam of light shot out.

Voldemort disintegrated the spell in front of him and, shot out his own. It was not like the mans in front of him, Voldemort's spell reeked death and hate.

The world started to warp around Harry as he began to spread his magic outwards, forcing the world around him to bend to his will. The ground slithered and transformed into mythical beasts, the air crackled with power, and Harry was the center of a storm. Wind and fire sheared around him in a circular fashion as he blocked the various spells thrown at him.

Voldemort growled out in frustration as the little lamb turned out to not be so little anymore. With a grasping motion Voldemort overpowered Harry's control over the earth and, instead forced the ground to violently rip towards his opponent. Encasing him in a cocoon of dirt.

Errr, it could go something like this. I do not write anything so the stuff above is super rough.

I did not like where it was going or how it was being written so I stopped mid-way.
