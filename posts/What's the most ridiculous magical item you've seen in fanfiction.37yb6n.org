For me it has to be partially kissed hero's 'language lozenges'. Like, the wizard world has sweets which can teach you any language instantly, which would imply they can make sweets that can teach you anything instantly, which would imply that Hogwarts is a pretty pointless institution.

** On the topic of language lozenges, we know that magic can greatly assist you in learning languages in some way, because Barty Crouch Sr. was fluent in what, 200 languages? That's not humanly possible without magic. It's not even /close/ to possible without magic.

Just because magic can be used to aid learning of one topic, it doesn't mean that it can be used to aid all learning.

(My fanon is that you can use magic to enhance learning of non-magical knowledge, but not magical knowledge. So magical languages would have to be learnt the long way, along with stuff like Charms, Transfiguration etc.)

***** None of it is false. It is incomplete. Enormous amounts of experimental evidence don't undo themselves. Also, any remotely world aware muggleborne would think the goal of furthering humanity's knowledge as a very noble goal, regardless of any "magic". Given the magical prejudice that muggleborns experience, it would be guaranteed that some would return to the Muggle world.

Tesla, Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Aristotle and Archimedes - turns out, they were all magical cheaters!

********** Well, you know, for all the Grindelwald and Voldemort cause are portrayed as unjust discrimination and with clear allusions to nazism, you have to remember - these are wizards that live to 150 and more easily, and even at that age are far more healthy than muggles are at half that age. Also, if magic is hereditary, they *are* actually superior, aren't they?

In a world where hidden wizardry existed, I'd expect most of muggle greatness to come from undercover wizards - especially since, as Taure pointed out, magic can aid in the gaining of knowledge and the likes. In the end, it would seem like wizards are superior mentally, physically and spiritually. Wizards can split /souls/ and achieve immortality, while most muggle beliefs can be attributed to muggle baiting. Turning wine into water and walking on water? Easy.
