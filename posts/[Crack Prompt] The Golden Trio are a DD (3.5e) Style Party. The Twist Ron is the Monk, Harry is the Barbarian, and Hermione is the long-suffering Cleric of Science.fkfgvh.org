Bonus points if Harry is a Forsaker or otherwise suspicious of magic, Ron meditates because it keeps him calm and centered around the chaos of the Weasley household, and Hermione is constantly being dragged away from her scientific method-based experiments with magic.

Double bonus points if Neville is incorporated as a rogue and Luna Lovegood as a druidzilla.

*** Well, it's more along the lines that, in 3.X, there was a prestige class called the Forsaker that got more powerful the more magic items it destroyed, which fit in with the barbarians sometimes being characterized as being suspicious and/or fearful of magic, and Clerics in 3.5 being able to gain power from worshipping and having faith just about anything, including abstract concepts like science.

Plus, being abused could easily have led Harry into being a rage monster who gets stronger whenever he gets angry and takes reduced damage from physical attacks because he's just been beat up so many times.

**** You know, from a certain point of view, 'Get stronger by destroying magic items' could fit Harry. After all, he goes through a lot of Voldemort's horcruxes.

** Is the barbarian's role a tank or damage dealer? I see Harry more as a mid range high dps kinda character. I've never played d&d so I'm unsure of what any of these characters do.

*** It's less about the metagame and the crunch, and more about the roleplay archetypes of the classes, which is to say, Harry is a savage rage monster, Ron is calm and philosophical, and Hermione worships at the altar of science.

*** If you get a Barbarian angry enough, that question is a moot point. Especially when the RNG gods smile upon them.

Eh, Harry is known for his anger, and high pain/damage tolerance. Barbarian enough.

*** I'm not familiar with 5e, and since this prompt isn't predicated on the metagame or the actual rules of the system, it'd probably work; I just went with the edition I'm familiar with, because at least I know the prestige classes and stuff and how some of those might interact beautifully with a crackfic.
