Making people clean the hallways or scrub Cauldrons without Magic or write meaningless lines aren't really useful punishments. Kids in my School got punished depending on the subject. As all Detentions had to be supervised, if the proper teachers weren't available whoever was there just told us to do our homework in silence, but if they were, we were actively made to do things like help the Teacher prepare for the next class, mark homework by a set standard, things that actively made you learn whilst also being a punishment. Are there any fics that do that?


** Well, the one time Hagrid tried to teach the kids about how to take care of an injured unicorn during detention, they were attacked. Then Umbridge tried to teach Harry that he shouldn't lie but that didn't stick. Well, it stuck to back of his hand but...

Edit: changed a misspelt word.

I think you may be confusing Umbridge with Voldemort here. Don't worry; it's an understandable mistake.

** At school, if someone get given a detention by a teacher that didn't want to supervise they'd instead spend it in Room 8 on Friday with others.

For 2 hours you'd then copy an extensive description (basically a full wiki page) of diseases and other disgusting crap.

Perhaps something similar but about magical diseases etc.

*** Depends on the Subject. Having them Copy out the Textbook makes more sense than having them write "I must not talk in class" or whatever. By Hogwarts standards, if Flitwick made someone copy out the Charms Theory Texts, then they'd both learn something (repetition based revising) and get punished. It's the sort of thing I mean

** I thought most of the detentions were something useful, if they weren't for a rubbish teacher like Lockhart and Umbridge. Is it just fanon that Snape makes students scrub cauldrons, clean messes, and prep gross ingredients? While they might not be learning academically, they're learning to appreciate the work others usually do to clean up their mess and dirty cauldrons and stuff. For example, who usually sorts flobberworms? Likely Snape. All the gross stuff he must've done to prep for lessons must build up.

And Hagrid claims that Hogwarts usually issues "useful" detentions, like helping the faculty.

*** Prepping Ingredients makes sense as it's educational AND useful, but cleaning the floor by hand with Filch when you can wave your wand and solve it in seconds is a waste of everyone's time (As is Filch's very existence but I'm certain he's Dumbledore's charity case, at least Hagrid had his skilled area) Unless there's canonically a reason that cleaning cauldrons magically is bad (I don't read Pottermore so there might be) then it's also stupid. Have them Prep the Ingredients, so the "Dunderheads" are useful for something, and make them do more if they do it wrong.

The Forest detention was probably criminal from the moment they split up. The Acromantula wouldn't harm them with Hagrid there, but the separated ones, given that Fang is "A coward"... Free Snack before Hagrid got there. It made sense when Ginny etc were 6th Years that could kill the Spiders if needed, but Malfoy, Harry and Co being First years, nope.

**** I think Snape only made them go no-magic when they really pissed him off - cleaning the bedpans and sorting Filch's cabinet were the only no magic detentions he issued. And the cabinet was so Harry would see what a prick James had been.

I looked up the detentions, it seems scrubbing cauldrons was never a detention issued in canon. Nor did Filch actually issue any detentions, he just wanted professors to make them scrub floors. The closest one was Ron polishing trophies, and McGonagall was angry enough that she wanted to give them nasty ones.

I speculate that Fang was actually ok with Acromantulas, since he was probably raised around them. I further speculate that a)the acromanula had a specific area in forest that the unicorns never went into, and b) they were familiar with Fang and knew to leave anything with him alone. Red sparks wouldn't go far in a dark forest, so again, he must've stuck close.

But...yeah. Hagrid should have been convicted of criminal negligence several times over.

*** Exactly what I was looking for. It frees up the Teacher's limited time (Make someone mark Hermione's essay, that'd be a great punishment given that they're like 3 or 4 times the requested length) punishes the student and helps them learn by forcing them to apply what they learned.
