I've noticed that while a lot of fics leave them the same and leave it to their modified Harry to create variety some do change the tasks or even add some. This ranges from small things like adding some kind of way for the audience to view the second and third tasks to adding entire rounds, most often duels between the champions.

I had an idea for a task where they're place in the centre of a field or forest and given a potion to brew. The twist being they have to gather the ingredients from magical beasts and plants placed in the area. I figured since the Canon tasks mainly focus on Charms, Transfiguration and DADA it might be cool to see one that test Potions, Herbology, and COMC knowledge. And it would still be interesting for the audience since you could make plenty of the plants and creature dangerous.


** For me, it's the Nightmare Potion/Spell thing task in Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise. I really like the idea of a 'see your worst fears and withstand them' sort of task, and the Magicals being so insensitive to put Potter through it in front of an audience is perfectly in character for that culture.

*** You might be thinking the Lie I've lived where part of the second task is brewing a potion to awaken their hostage. That's what gave me the initial idea but in that they're given the instruction and ingredients and just have to do it.

*** There's a potion brewing one in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), if you've read that older one. It's brewing a difficult potion from memory and everyone else is shamelessly cheating, of course.

** I can't remember the fic, but there was a really neat one that was essentially an obstacle course through land, water and air, and you had to complete objectives in each. Each area had obstacles and magical creatures that would get in your way. It was a good way for it to last longer because there were more chances for people to get ahead/behind.

In MayMarlow's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722][The Train To Nowhere]] Tom Riddle won the war but there are still rebels putting up a fight. So in his dystopia, one of the tasks is to find a rebel/rebel camp and kill them. It showcased their ingenuity and tracking skills to find a rebel, and the duelling ability and mental fortitude to be able to kill that enemy. It was very well done.

Kwan Li had a neat idea with [[https://fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], and instead of individuals, there were large teams (perhaps 9-12 ppl cant remember exactly) and so each challenge was more oriented around teamwork (but also much more difficult bc of it). For example, in one of the task each person had a close friend taken hostage (a VIP) and they were dived and given to the other 2 teams. You gained points for any VIPS of your team that were retrieved. So you had to balance out defending against the other teams and also sending out ppl to attack/retrieve.

** My favorite is from a fic I can't remember exactly, the details are that there is a runic array and it generates a fake evil version of yourself that you have to defeat. A sort of version of the cliche facing your inner darkness seen in fiction. The cool thing was that Harry knew so much about runes and arrays that his evil version tried to steal his soul and become the real Harry, and Harry had a hell of a time fighting him because he knew all Harry's tricks.

** It is not something I have seen, but only exists in my mind, if I were to decide to create my own TT fic.

The idea is an alternative 3rd task. The contestants have to race to the top of a pyramid, each of them climbing up on one side. There are several rooms alongside, each contatining one puzzle/obstacle. Some rooms are dangereous, that is you can fail and lose. Some are only there to make the contestant lose time, and there are others where clues are hidden, about the other rooms, and about the final room. The final room would be easier to solve if you had the clues, but does it worth the risk and time to solve those? And like you, I would have put various branches of magic into various rooms, potion, divination, spell crafting etc. probably with at least one direct path to the final room with “practical skills” and an other with a bit more “theoretical”. (But all have some kind of magic applied)

As for the observators, the outer wall of the pyramid would be see through during the task, but the contestants wouldn't be able to see what is in the other room, so some jump scares could happen with dangerous creatures.

** Linkffn(Hallowed by ShinySavage) has a combination CoMC and potion-brewing challenge which isn't unique compared to the rest of fanon, is a nice change of pace from canon.

However, it's third challenge is still the most unique I've seen: a combination of spell-casting, art, and creative thinking, that doesn't require the champion to be an action-hero to place first in. Such a breath of fresh air compared to every other task.
