I just had some questions about Miskatonic University which I decided to post here.

​

Firstly, Since how did it start catching on in Faniction?? Did Rowling put it out on some tweet or something else???

Secondly, Where can I find some reading material related to it?? If it's in a fanfic, which are the ones with a good plot??

Thirdly, Can someone give a decent summary of Miskatonic University just in case I missed something?? I'll write my own version below, so just read through it and add new info or remove wrong info

Finally, are there any other fanfics which have higher concepts of magic???

​

Summary: Miskatonic University is a kind of higher studies institute of magic where they delve deep into more unknown branches of magic and publish their researching some journal which is banned in most countries and needs to be obtained in Knockturn Alley or similar locations. Most of this is from a fanfic in which 13 year old Bella goes to an alternate future and ends up in Harry's timeline. Essentialy, there are 2 Bellatrix, 1 in Azkaban and 1 in Hogwarts. I forgot the name of the fanfic, so I can't link it.

​

I was hoping this could get cleared up for me, thanks!!!


** It's actually from HP lovecraft's body of work and doesn't have any direct connection to harry potter, my guess is that the author of the fic you were reading is just a big lovecraft fan

** linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) has a fem!Harry who spent time at Miskatonic.

linkffn(Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod) also involves Miskatonic University and Lovecraft.

linkffn(It's Always the Quiet Ones) doesn't involve Miskatonic, but does have Lovecraftian themes.

I haven't read linkffn(The Children of Set) yet, but my notes say it's a cross with Lovecraft.

linkffn(Eldritch Asylum) is an unfinished three-way cross among Ranma 1/2, Harry Potter, and Lovecraft. It's pretty much abandoned, and, as I recall, hadn't really brought in much in the way of HP where it stopped, though.

** linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic]] ) iirc has something akin to "higher concepts of magic".

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
