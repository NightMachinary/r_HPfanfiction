I've realised, after going through my ao3 bookmarks, that all my favourite non-crack HP stories feature the best friends to lovers trope.

For reference, some of my favourite fics in this vein have featured the following ships:

Ron x Harry

Ginny x Luna

Ron x Harry x Hermione

Sirius x James

James II x Teddy

Albus x Scorpius

George x Lee Jordan

Percy x Oliver

Lavender x Parvati

So give me fics that do a nice job of portraying both the initial friendship and the romantic interest that ensues? Any genre will do. I'd prefer for them to be on AO3.

My objections:

I hate alt!boy/girl/parakeet-who-lived fics (if you actually do have a parakeet who lived fic link it tho)

No OCs as main LI or characters.

No smut, but nongraphic or minor sex is ok.

I'm fine with ot3, but would prefer it not to be centered around one character (especially Harry). Polyamory, not harem, is what I'm looking for.

No bashing of any sort or "dark/grey" Harry. I'm looking for good writing here.

I despise Slytherin "politics" fics but am not opposed to Slytherins as a whole.

No Drarry or Dramione, though I'm fine with other Harry, Draco, or Hermione centred ships. Ron x Harry x Hermione (and variations of it) is the only acceptable form of Harmony for this request. Maybe fem!Harry x Hermione if it's a really good fic.

No Snape x student, although I'm good with him paired with an adult or a good young!Snape fic.

I'm good with all orientations, but bonus points if the fics actually deal with queer angst.

** Oooh this is exactly my jam and imo there's never enough of this kind of thing, which is why I'm writing my own!

It's Luna/Ginny bff to lovers slow burn, but also pretty off-canon AU that explores new types of non-canon magic. It goes really in depth into their pre-Hogwarts friendship growing up as close friends and the effect that Ginny getting possessed by Voldy in book 2 had on both Ginny and Luna. Oh, and Luna's a Seer, I hope that's okay too!

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood grows up a Seer, the child of prophecy, and best friends with Ginny Weasley. After Ginny is possessed by the Dark Lord during her first year at Hogwarts, Luna founds a magical school for girls to explore the ancient art of women's blood magic, defensive magic, and rhetorical diplomacy. She fights the rising tide of darkness with this new brand of old magic, putting her at odds with the Ministry, Hogwarts, and Harry Potter. Luna must choose between traditions when a darker power rises to threaten her brave new world.

  What if Ron was the know-it-all bookworm while Hermione was the lovable prat? In a world without Voldemort, seventh year Ron Weasley is on a mission to enjoy his last year at Hogwarts while trying to ask his crush out. Hermione Granger wants to do well for her NEWTs and ask her crush out. Can they help one another? Non-canon obviously, with some characters being OOC. Chapter 19 up.

*** I mentioned I wanted all orientations & listed off 2 femslash pairings & an ot3 so idk why people think I asked for slash.

My issue with hetero pairings for this request is that JK Rowling is bad at male/female friendships so Hermione basically has to be involved if you wanted a completely canon based bff to lovers scenario. Lily x Snape maybe, if you changed everything about them. Neville x Ginny (x Luna)? Angelina x Fred? Arthur x Molly? All of those could be good, but they're pretty out there tbh.

Of course, you could always do extremely minor characters (the best straight fic I've read with this trope involved Daphne x Blaise). It's not impossible, just really difficult.

May I point out that downvoting is a way of saying "This post/comment should be hidden from /everyone/, no one should have to see it"? It's supposed to be used when something just shouldn't be there at all. If it's just a matter of "I personally would rather not see this" then you can hide the post.
