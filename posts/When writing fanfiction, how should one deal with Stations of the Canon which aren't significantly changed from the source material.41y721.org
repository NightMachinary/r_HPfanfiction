Skip them entirely and leave it up to reader knowledge? Summarize them somehow?

Or just write the station out with the minor changes?


** Leaving them out entirely can work, but usually not as well as at least covering them in some capacity. Leaving them out entirely after the point of divergence makes your story feel less like a story and more like annotations or footnotes to canon.

I'm still not quite sure if I managed to phrase that how I wanted to.

** This greatly tests a writer's ability. Good writers often start out from a canon event and let stories develop on its own. They can logically determine whether additional canon events could occur or the story would go into a significantly new direction.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is a good example. It starts out with the troll incident, but only Harry showed up to save Hermione and he had an interesting, non-canon, power. As a result, year 1 events diverged significantly. However, Arthur Weasley searching Malfoy Manor still happened, and Lucius Malfoy retaliated by slipping the Diary into Ginny's cauldron. Year 2 then followed canon closely, until Harry went down into the Chamber. From that point on, the story truly diverges from the canon.

** One-liner summaries, unless something significant changed. Just so that readers know that a canon event happened still.

If something significant changed, especially if there are consequences lacking in canon, then those changes and consequences should be focused on. I'd try to at least give it a different viewpoint though, and not reuse dialogue from canon.

Writing out the scene with minor changes should only be done in my opinion if the scene is crucial for the story itself.

Even then I'd prefer a sentence or two with just the changes. If the changes are buried in paragraphs of text, its highly likely I'll miss them, and when the become important later, I'll get annoyed that they weren't clear. I think writing out the scene should only be done if there a major obvious changes.

For example, with the troll, if Ron is injured, cut straight the hospital after, with the crew all upset that someone was hurt. Don't give me a page and a half to only have a sentence with Ron's arm snapping in it.

** Greatly depends on what perspective you chose for your story. If its a very close perspective to the protagonist, then you should only divulge to your audience whatever the character could know.

Do you have a very distant perspective, maybe a story that is told with many POV's, then you might wanna tell your reader about it.

And, as always with these things in fanfiction: Are you sure the event would happen? A good example is the troll in the first year. Even if at this point Hermione has found friends, she still ends up there in /so many fics its not even funny anymore/. Mostly its because the authors are too lazy to develop the friendship between Harry and Hermione without a life threatening incident to kickstart it. Or, another good one is the Chamber. Even in the most darkest of Harry-stories, Ginny is still somehow rescued. I have yet to read a fic where the wraith of Voldemort came back to life because Ginny wasn't rescued.

Anyway, make sure the events really happen. I for one stop reading a fic when I think that the author is simply repeating canon events because they're too lazy to formulate their own plots.

** There are a number of factors to consider...

In my HP/Avengers crossover series, I'm letting a lot of movie canon events happen mostly as they did in the movies (they need to in order for future movie plots to even happen). Instead of just rehashing them, I focus on events before and after (preferably things not shown in the movies). That comes with a risk, though: not everyone has memorized the movies! If I rely heavily on details of canon events, that may confuse people who are lost, not sure what has been happening. I'm not interested in describing events that haven't changed from the movie, but I can't exactly ignore them, either.

For example, I'm working on a story going along with the Thor movie right now. In it, Thor gets exiled to earth without his power - that's critical. I'm not changing the details, so it would be boring to just rewrite it... but I'm sure it would confuse some people if he just showed up, out of the blue, wandering around. Those who knew the movie well enough wouldn't have a problem, but the rest...? So I'll need a non-boring way of communicating what happened, preferably while focusing on events happening around the original movie scenes. It's a bit of a challenge, and it may require a boring scene or two along the way - boring because there's nothing new from the movie, that is.

So if a canon event is important, but you don't want to rehash it, you'll still need to include enough details somewhere to ensure that readers aren't lost. That's less of a problem in HP stories, to be sure, but I don't think it's entirely moot.

Depending on whether you're writing in Third Omniscient, Third Limited, or First Person, you can have canon event that's the same but still different by showing a different perspective on it. What does a Slytherin student think about the Troll Incident, for example? Heck, what was Hermione thinking? (though that's obviously been done - but your take on it might still be good and it's still not a plain rehash of canon).

And when you say "aren't significantly changed," you need to think about the changes that are there. Even if not significant, they may matter to interactions down the road - and in that case, you can't easy gloss over them.

** Ask yourself if it's necessary for the story. Does it explain certain actions of your characters? Are your readers clueless and lost without it?

If so, mention it. I've picked up my own fic again a while back, and it's very, very AU (as in, Slytherin Harry, he runs away from Hogwarts and there's a lot of OC's). What I do, is I mention it in passing, maybe reference it with a couple of words, like "oh yeah, and that happened too". But I try to limit it. Just because it's canon, doesn't mean it's important. It's my story, not Harry Potter 2.0, I may use the same characters and the same world, but it's a different story.

** If you /must/ have them occurring in the exact same way, then describe it from a different perspective than the books. i.e. if the troll+bathroom incident happens, tell us about from McGonagall's view of events. If describing the same event as canon, through the same person as canon but with less skill than the author, then it's not going to be an enjoyable read. Do something to mix it up.

** Sometimes it's best just to mention it in a few lines to acknowledge the event still happened. Or you could write it in a different POV and add more of that character's thoughts/feelings/reactions to the event. For example, re-writing the Troll scene from Hermione's POV would start the scene differently since she's already in the washroom upset and have her reactions once Harry/Ron came in and stuff. That would add new stuff to a scene we already know.

** I've got to the point in my fanfiction reading career that if I see a fic rehashing canon points I just stop reading it. I've read about canon plot points about a thousand times and it's just not interesting to me anymore.

I maintain that the best fanfics are ones that ignore canon and do their own thing.
