I guess most of us have read quite a few fanfics and one or the other might even have tried his hand at writing, so I'm interested in your experiences as a reader and writer: What are things fanfic writers should watch out for?

I started writing a story a while back, I had an interesting idea and a well thought out plot. Or so I thought. While I knew how I wanted my story to end, knew how it started and a few important corner stones, I quickly realised that I hadn't really thought of the daily Hogwarts life too much and had trouble making it interesting.

What I learned from this experience is:

- that it isn't enough to plan the big, end of the year adventure, but that I also have to weave subplots into the story to keep it interesting.

- that I have to know the side characters better than I did. It's hard to write little adventures and interesting conversations when you only really know your main character.

Questions for authors at this point: How do you go about getting to know the main/side characters? Write down notes concerning their upbringing, appearance, goals, interests... or do you just start writing?

Experience as a reader:

- authors often seem to lose themselves in semi-important details. For my writing this means that I reread my scenes to see if they're just a filler or really add something to the story.

- In a few fics I got the impression that the author had no idea where they want to go with his/her story. To me it seemed they started writing because they had a nice scene in mind, but didn't quite think the story through before they started posting. Because of that, I planned my story through until the end, before I started writing. As I said before, I sadly neglected sub-plots and side-characters instead.

- It's very important for me that I can understand why a character acts a certain way. I might not like it, but I want to understand where he/she is coming from. A few negative reading experiences made me more sensitive to this, and when I write I always try to make sure that my characters' actions make sense.

So, back to the point of this thread: *What should fanfic authors pay attention to when writing a fic?*


** I have found that the things you don't put in are as important as the things you do include.

Human characters should act that way. They evolve, they make mistakes, they act like dicks, they act like saints-they're not perfect, which makes them interesting. Perfection always comes across as the character being more than slightly insane.

The setting changes independent of the storyline. Illustrate this. Things happen outside of the scope of the story that could affect it later on. Similarly, the story will affect the setting.

The biggest problem with writing plots is having to deal with your own omniscience. You know what's going to happen. Your character doesn't. You'd be surprised at how easy it is for your character to look like a mary sue if you make a mistake.

Killing named characters is alright... if you have enough characters handy and that particular one will not be missed.

Listen to your fans, but don't follow their lead. If they call it, great. If you alter your story to fit what they want, bad.

A one-shot can be written in a matter of hours. A story can be written in weeks. A serious HP fanfic where you do more than just follow canon takes months, even years, to get right.

There should never be an easy out... unless you're the villain. And even then it should carry consequences.

Which leads into the final one: resolving a plotline or a storyline should be memorable. If it's been done before, either do something different or do it better. 'And they lived happily ever after' may work sometimes, but 'life goes on and other things happen, but that is a story for another time' is loads better.

I'd like to add that, if done wrong, this can cause as much-- or even more harm than a default unoriginal ending.

I remember several such stories where the plot development became so unnatural towards the ending that you could almost see what was going in the writer's mind when they were finishing the story. In such cases they are trying to outsmart and outmanoeuvre their own previously designed plots just so they can award to themselves that “originality achievement badge” and self-congratulate with the ending twist well-completed. A botched twisted ending can completely ruin a story that was doing perfectly fine for its first three quarters.

** For harry potter specifically: don't get stuck in the standard "7 schoolyears" timeline. Be original and write the story as it develops naturally. Depending on what you change and how you change it, a lot of things will end up differently. Don't force the story "back on track" by letting the exact same things happen as they did in canon.

*** God yes, how did I not think of this? I guess the most common "back on track" thing is saving Hermione from the troll. Even if Harry is in another house and not friends with Ron Weasley, and by all right the conversation that Hermione was insulted by shouldn't have happened in exactly the same manner, she still ends up in the toilet that day and Harry still ends up saving her.

**** I chalk it up to a misunderstanding of what canon events mean to the author. 'Canon event', on the surface, means just that-an event that you read in the books or saw in the movies. In reality, though, the outcomes are what should be focused upon-'Hermione befriends Harry from planet/timeline X' rather than 'troll goes for a stroll'.

Similarly, 'Quirrel dies, Stone safe' is the outcome of canon event 'Year 1 Heroing Exam'. There are loads of different ways in which this can be achieved, especially if 'Harry' is a time traveller-inflict deafness on the cerberus, lace the first chamber with heat-activated nerve gas, put contact poison on the winged key or the broom, plant land mines in the chess pieces so that 'hop on' equals BOOM, feed the troll a berserker potion after lacing its hide with shielding spells, switch the flame-freezing potion with the others/nitroglycerine, make the flames to the antechamber poisonous upon contact with flame-freezing and, finally, rig the antechamber's floor so that setting foot on it sets off a thermobaric explosion.

AFTER you've removed the stone and hidden it in the Gryffindor hourglass, of course.

Still counts as following canon in that the outcome is roughly the same, but different enough to entice. The stone is safe, Quirrell is dead and Harry gets to go home to his cupb-I mean /relatives/.

***** I think this is an incredibly important point that people forget. Just because you are doing a first year at hogwarts with the same characters doesn't mean the plot or challenges should be the same. Maybe they suspect a different professor of stealing some other object and drama happens in a gobstones club meeting instead of at quid ditch. It's boring reading the same thing over and over and people are way too afraid to mix it up

*** A very good point! A well written story doesnt have to (and often shouldnt) end with "19 Years later." If the plott is done after 5th year, that perfectly fine! And the author doesnt prevent him/herself from writing possible sequels later, if desired so...

** I could go on for days about this topic, so I'll just throw out one piece of advice that seems to be most related to the OP's question:

Everyone is the star of their own story. No one thinks of themselves as "the villain" or "the wise old professor" or "the best friend." Everyone has their own goals, their own hopes, their own fears. In the course of writing a story, characters can and do fall into these roles - but make sure it's for organic reasons, for reasons that make sense /to that character,/ and not just because the plot needs that thing to happen.

Before you write a scene, take a breath and run through it in your head from different points of view. Make sure that it makes sense not just for Harry, but for everyone interacting with him.

If you write your characters this way - like they view themselves as people, and not plot devices, /you will be amazed/ at some of the things that happen, completely naturally, as you write your characters. They will come to life in front of your very eyes.

** Whenever I write a fic, I always start with research (I am actually doing this for a couple fics right now and a novel I'm working on). I create a doc usually titled "Character Outline", where I write everything I know about each main character, from birthdate to hobbies and relationships.

I also make sure to write down scenes I have in mind. So if I suddenly get inspired and have this fantastic scene in mind, I write it down asap. This way I won't forget it, but I won't get upset if the story doesn't end up moving that way.

An important thing is to make all conversations flow and feel real. Don't make them sound broken or forced, let the conversation flow naturally.

Don't get caught in overly minute details unless they're vital. And don't stress if some chapters are shorter/longer than intended. Some authors write unnecessarily long chapters, so try not to Tolkien-it (/cough/meetingatRivendell/cough/).

Lastly, edit and make sure you're happy with it. If you don't like what you're writing, the readers will know. They will also notice if it's riddled with typos. A few here or there are acceptable, but if someone messes up on the name of a major character when it takes two seconds to google it; I'm out.

One last thing, if you're really sure how to write a certain character, maybe re-read some scenes with them from the books. Or try to think of someone you know who is like them. I write Luna like a fairy/hippie with an intelligent side, Harry is always the emotional(in a good way) but patient best friend. Ron is the loyal but emotional and impatient friend. I always imagine how they might react to certain events and, if not them, then the people who are similar to them.

It all comes down to understanding yourself and your interpretation of the characters. There is still some leeway in writing, so you will have freedomnof expression. Write things down how you see it and make sure you are happy with the final result.

Hope that kind of helps/answers your questions or thoughts. I do a heck of a lot of other stuff when planning (i.e. researching the Ministry), but that's just my way of writing.

** About getting to know side characters: I LOVE coming up with backgrounds for them so I have a lot of notes about who they are, who their parents are, who their siblings are and what they like, what they want to do after school. I think it's important to give them distinct personalities of their own and goals of their own, otherwise they all sound the same. I kind of try to have an idea of where they start and where I think they'll end up so that there's subplots and character growth for them.

As for the main question:

- *Pacing* I'm reading this one story where I was really into it in the beginning, but the last 10 chapters or so felt really stale and just rehashing the same drama. I'm barely skimming each chapter now and this should be the most exciting part.

- *Info Dumping* It's really fun as an author to create all this world-building and character-building, but putting it into a story takes talent. Personally, when I read I want to read a story, not paragraphs about how magic works in that author's story. I feel like I'm reading a textbook in some stories. The same with revealing back-story for important characters. It's cool when it's slowly discovered rather than straight up announced in chapter one.

- *Balance* Sometime s I see stories that are all paragraphs, very little dialogue or stories that are mostly dialogue with a few paragraphs. I find if it's all blocks of prose then it's very tiresome to read.

** I feel like a lot of authors are stuck in the mindset that they must explain everything from the beginning and spend 10-20 or so chapters on pre Hogwarts. Its good to be detailed but too much info can hurt too.

** I spent a fair amount of time /planning/ a fic of mine, spanning four books and with over 90 000 words on bare scenes alone planned, and many more A4 pieces of paper waiting to be added in still... it'll likely be on the backburner for years (sorry).

For a story you've really got to nail seamless storytelling. Everything has to link in someway or add /something/ to the story or it seems meandering and inconclusive (read: irrationally boring) to the reader - who's going to be all: "Get to the fucking point already!"

You've got to meditate on plot and characters too. Fine-tune your story until as few characters as possible are relevant for plot development then bring your A-game on fleshing them out. All too often an author will introduce characters simply to bring in new information then throw them away when they're done and they do it all the time!

This is fucking annoying. It is not seamless, it is cheating - and removes main character growth and interaction where it could be used to forge new perspectives to characters we already know a bit about, foreshadowing a character in order to throw them away is the cheap way of trying to get around that.

If your fanfic makes me want to beat the shit out of you until you re-publish an abridged version then you haven't written it as it deserved to be written.

** Have an outline. Otherwise, you may end up starting a fanfic (or a prequel to a fanfic, says my guilty conscience) and then running out of... point.

I'm still, /five years later/ trying to finish a prequel to what once would have been a perfectly acceptable if left the hell alone fanfic. But I keep going to continue it and stopping myself and asking "What is the /point/? Why am I writing this? Why would anyone read it? Where does it go?"

An outline written when I first decided the prequel was a good idea (and a sequel, I'd planned one of those too) would have really helped with this.

(I feel like a monster every time I think of this fic, sitting unfinished with people who liked it waiting for an update that hasn't come...)
