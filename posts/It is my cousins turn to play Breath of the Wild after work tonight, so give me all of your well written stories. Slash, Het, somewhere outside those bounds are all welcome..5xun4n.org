Yes, yes, another "I am going to be busy so please give me something to read plea." This time though please recommend any fanfiction that you feel is compelling and well written. Au or not, Het or Slash, simple in it's themes or dealing with controversial issues. All I ask is that it is enjoyable, and well written.

Title Edit: cousin's

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
