I have always been fascinated by the Serpent of Slytherin and interested in reading fanfiction. Could anyone write out how they think Slytherin's thought process would have gone installing the Serpent within the Chamber and sealing it within. Like an inner thought monologue? After all he would have known this was a beast capable of homicide, genocide, and traumatic enough to make any survivors consider suicide. Would he have any regrets or instead consider the Serpent like a Golem and being a protector of his people?

Just a writing prompt if anyone is interested.

/The habitation chamber is complete. Its food, water and air regeneration capabilities are sufficient to house 300 humans for a year; it should be able to keep a smaller number indefinitely. To open it, just go to that big statue of me in the dungeon and say "Hogwarts Four"./

/I've put Bessie in the chamber so she doesn't get underfoot; if you need her moved (and I sincerely hope you don't), there's a magic bell in my office you can use to hypnotize her. If I don't make it back, please find another parselmouth to talk to her and keep her company./

/I know what you're thinking, we've had this argument enough times already; even if the purpose I originally hatched her for was foolish and needlessly destructive, I couldn't just dispose of her. She's like a child to me./

Oh, by the way, since I'm bringing up habitation chambers, I've had it as headcanon for a while that behind the statue of Slytherin in the Chamber of Secrets, you know, the one that the basilisk slithered out of, there was this automated habitation module thing designed to keep the basilisk alive and fed all the years it was down there. Just sayin'.

** Pottermore pretty much tell you that Slytherin as a bigotted scumbag, wizard and muggle got on fine before the Statute of Secrecy, witch hunt was a minor issue, and pureblood supremacy only gain traction after the masquerade was put up. Shame, as it create the problem of why didn't the other 3 noticed a guy that they're good enough friends with to form a school was a bigotted psycho that built a hidden chamber and kept a basilsk inside it.

Harry Potter is a kid's book, its easier to settle with GRYFFINDOR = GOOD SLYTHERIN = BAD I get it, but is it that hard to have some ambiguity around here? From the history that we have, it could easily have been Slytherin's word being twisted by bigots, the guy was well meaning and had good reasons to dislike Muggle (religious crazy muggles in the Middle Age are dangerous for wizarding children. Muggleborn kids could be spy for their parent to search out Hogwart's location) , the Basilisk is a castle defense tool, and the Chamber of Secret is a bunker. It certainly make more sense than him building a huge ass chamber undernearth the other 3's nose.

He could've been a Magneto-like figure, but instead we get another Lord Voldemort, a low key, 1 dimensional villain

(Personally, I feel like JK Rowling is using Slytherin house and the Death Eater/Voldemort/Blood Purity issue to push her political view and to associate everything conservative as bad. Yes its a kid story, yes its her story, but it just feel pretty shifty)
