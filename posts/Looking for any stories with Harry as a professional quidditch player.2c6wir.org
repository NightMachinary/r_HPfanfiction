I have read quidditch world cup which was a very well written story and was hoping if anyone had suggestions.

***** Yeah, life kinda intruded. It's sitting at about 7100 words and in need of editing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711029/1/A-Game-of-Style-and-Brutality][A Game of Style And Brutality]] fits the description and is decent, for what it is.

The Jeconais story [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] is a Harry/Gabrielle story that features him playing pro-Quidditch and teaching at Beauxbatons in the off season or due to an injury or something, if I recall. Note that I'm not recommending anything by Jeconais, just pointing out that it exists and strictly speaking fits your criteria.

*** Why not recommend anything by Jeconais? Just curious because I find his stories rather entertaining.

**** Jeconais stories are like cotton candy. Fluff that is sickly sweet - fine enough in small doses but too much and it ends up getting your hands a sticky mess (and not in the fun way).

His stories are readable, but formulaic and so much like each other that it's easy to switch the girls out for each other.

But who am I to criticize, since I don't really write romance stories.

***** Yeah but you still gotta keep in mind that he's been writing them since pre sixth book. I.e. he created most of the cliches that we now see.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] is one of my all-time favorite post-war novels. Harry and Ron both play for the Cannons after the war.
