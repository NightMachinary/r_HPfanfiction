A lot of fics mention a "Notice-me-not" Charm. Which is like Touko Aozaki's Bounded Field that is a "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" field. It was mentioned that a bomb could go off, and the people affected by the field would be unaware of it. I want a fic where warding is prominent and basically like Nasuverse Bounded Fields

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
