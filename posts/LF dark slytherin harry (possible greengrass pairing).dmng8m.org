:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember Daphne kind of pulled Harry into her friend group with Theo and Draco, then kind of realized it was a terrible mistake because Harry's really Dark and they adore/worship him. She's super suspicious of him and invites him to one of the end of year celebrations (I think it was Yule, but honestly don't remember for sure?) in an attempt to prove Harry's bad news. I think she suspected him of murder? But Harry charms Lady Greengrass and Astoria, and the horcrux in him in combination with some other things just end up causing the Greengrass wards to fall at the end of the night???? I remember I ditched reading it because I typically only read queer fics, but all of a sudden I really need to know what happened since I stopped reading it. I can't find it in my bookmarks or any way I try to search for it, though! Any help is appreciated!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, suffered a remarkably similar past to the child Tom Riddle when he was put into the foster care system. He grew up equally charismatic, just as cunning, and with the same love for the chaotic. But naturally, Dumbledore never suspected Harry as he had with young Tom. Harry's chosen allegiances were ones that they would never see coming.
