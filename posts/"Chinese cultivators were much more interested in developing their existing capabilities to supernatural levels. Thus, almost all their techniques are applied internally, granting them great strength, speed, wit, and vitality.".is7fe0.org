** Author probably read some wuxia/xanxia/xuanhuan webnovels. I'm actually surprised I haven't seen cultivation incorporated or mentioned in fanfics more.

*** I've seen it incorporated a lot, it's just that authors prefer to put those elements to a minimum, for obvious reasons ie. A very weak xianxia cultivator could kill every wizard in battle fairly easily and as such giving harry or another character this ability means giving him what amounts to godlike power

**** True, but some other, more subtle aspects could be used. For example cultivation could be limited to mental, with ultimately overcoming tribulation to eliminate heart demons, tying it to occlumency and improving demeanor.

Dark magic corruption could be tied to qi deviation. Blood used to bond enchanted objects.

Wards would be a lot more interesting if some ideas from xanxia formations were to be borrowed.

Imprints could be used to expand upon whatever magic is used to make wizarding paintings.

Something similar to spiritual sense could also be used without being too lore breaking

*** Cauchy is Chinese. I think it's doubtful that he's deriving these ideas from webnovels instead of folk tales or the actual mythology. I might be wrong - I haven't actually read any of them! - but most of the Chinese shows and literature I consumed growing up have these kinds of themes in some form or another.

** While super interesting, it does speak to a somewhat common misconception in history. China and Rome weren't isolated from each other in the real world. Going back to the Greeks, and Alexander the Great, there was certainly trade between the regions through Mesopotamia and the Silk Road, and Chinese Silk was a precious commodity to rich Romans.

To suggest that there is no chance of cultural exchange would need some measure of justification. Even groups that are actively at war with each other try and steal each other's secrets, and with magic, travel is much less a burden than for regular people, since they are able to cross vast distances in an instant.

**** Sure, I mean, technically? That's more likely due to there being a number of other large countries between China and Rome, including the Parthian Empire and India.

And as I said, Magic kind of mitigates that issue. You can travel directly between very large distances in virtually no time. Even flying carpets and brooms are orders of magnitude better transport than caravans.

Check out the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_Relations][Wikipedia page on Roman Chinese relations]]. If you base things solely on their mythology, which crystallised much earlier (ostensibly in the Bronze Age Collapse or in Early Hellenistic times, for Rome at least), you might be right, but they basically had embassies in each other's countries. We don't import culture from countries which are far away from us without a large amount of people moving back and forth, which again, is probably aided dramatically by adding magic to the mix.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** I don't think it works well with canon at all. The canonical wizarding world is a single global community of wizards who have been working closely together since at least the 1600s. Logically, different traditions of magic should spread and compete with each other, with wizards adopting the techniques which are the most effective. By the modern era, you would expect magic to have largely standardised across the world, in much the same way that the Muggle world has adopted the industrial revolution, replacing their traditional industries with modern industry.

And that's what we seem to get in canon. We know that Japanese wizards use wands. We know that Native American wizards did not use wands but that wand use is now standard in North America. There's even mixing of magical creatures: Lupin introduces Kappas in POA, a magical creature of Japanese origin.

In particular, the idea that immortality magic is out there in China and Voldemort never learnt it because it's from a different part of the world is kinda absurd.
