Many people -- myself included -- are far more interested in reading AUs and original story concepts in HP fanfiction. If it's well-written, I'll probably enjoy the fanfic, regardless of how it differs to canon (e.g. sci-fi, with aliens and spaceships than magic).

And despite all of its criticisms, canon is still held in high regard by many HP fans. But that's the thing with fanfiction; /nothing/ is off-limits to change. You just want to use character names and settings? Go for it! Personally, I might not love a furry-themed Drarry fanfic, but it has its fanbase.

Does that make a bad/terrible fanfic, though? You open a fanfic and start reading; it starts off as relatively canon-compliant, until it isn't, but with proper development and so many other amazing qualities (plot, story, characters etc.). It never said that it was canon-compliant, so does that mean original stories are bad?

What do you think?


** It doesn't make it bad. It can make it very frustrating. Why use the names of HP characters when nothing else is the same? Why not just write and original fic, if someone is looking for a Harry Potter fic they're likely looking for a story about a Harry Potter character in the Harry Potter world. Harry raised by someone else is an AU that still takes place in the HP world surrounded by HP characters, but you write a story with no magic, no Hogwarts, no Burrow then why are you bothering to use the names of HP characters? You're just using HP as a draw to your own story about your own thing and that can annoy people no matter how good your story is. Calling it Harry Potter AU is bait when it has nothing to do with the HP world other than the names of a few people.

*** Besides the characters and Hogwarts setting, there is also the surrounding magical universe. A chunk of Orders of Magnitude was set in the era of Merlin, hundreds of years before the Hogwarts founders were even born. So there were no Potter characters and no Hogwarts, and the writing was nothing at all like a Rowling book. The plot tensions were about conflicts between Merlin and other powerful wizards about how to deal with artifacts and magic left over from the then-more-recent collapse of Atlantis.

And yet this sets the scene for the Potter world that would appear 1500 years later. So I consider OOM to be a very good Potter fanfic, even completely ignoring the parts where Harry and friends appear in it.

** Some people on DLP had some good points about this topic [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/a-debate-on-ooc.39670/?utm_source=dlp_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=watched_forum][in a recent thread]]. I think I agree most with this one poster:

"To some, the point of fanfiction is to expand on canon, not break from it. A part of that is to put the same characters in different situations and see how they'd react and how they'd be changed by that. So when the story advertises "what would Harry do if XYZ happened?" and it gets you interested and you open the story and you realize that XYZ is happening only because Harry has been replaced by edgelord#1351, it can quickly get very disappointing."

The answer, ultimately is: The HP fanfic world is a huge fandom, with many different kinds of fanfic, and people read fanfic for lots of different reasons. Some people really liked the books and want to see more of that same kind of story. Some people want to see the same kind of story go off in a vastly different direction. Some people want to read something that is completely different from the books and have happily found it within the world of HP fanfiction.

It all comes down to what you're looking for. I don't think "this doesn't feel like the books" is an automatic tab-closer for most fanfic readers. It is for me, but honestly I think I'm in the minority.

*** This is so true. I myself tend to avoid 'normal, no powers' fics starring Avengers characters, Harry Potter characters etc. These are characters for whom their powers (or lack thereof, hello Black Widow and Hawkeye) /define/ their place in relation to their world and surrounding cast. It's one thing to toss in a Bucky who is an average joe schmoe Marine who thinks Captain America could use a friendly sniper; it's another to have Steve be an artsy woke hipster who meets former infantry Bucky in a coffee shop. The former bends the canon, bends the circumstances of the universe enough that it's still recognizable; the latter is just...foreign characters with familiar names slapped onto them.

That said, it's always happened in every fandom I've ever been a part of (Inuyasha high school no demons AU, pfft), and those fics /always/ seem to have a loyal following as well. So clearly people who write and read these AUs where the original settings of place and characters are abolished entirely are finding /something/ worthwhile, even if I don't.

Harry Potter without the magic is just a sad story of an abused child without any responsible adults saying 'Yeah, we should do something about this.' I mean, I can see how some people might find that cathartic, to use the thin masks of the HP characters to explore abuse and chosen family, but it's not something I would consider fanfic that actually belongs in the fandom tag.

But since fandom is in itself an inclusive activity, I generally just let them do their thing and practice the 'don't like, don't read' philosophy religiously.

See, I would argue that this would actually be a really /good/ use of fanfic. The conversation about how abusive the Dursleys are, and to what extent people in the magical world like Dumbledore are responsible for leaving Harry in that situation even though he isn't safe there has been going on in Harry Potter fandom for at least as long as I've been in Harry Potter fandom - which is almost as long as there has /been/ an online Harry Potter fandom. You could definitely write a no powers AU which was directly participating in that conversation, and I would argue that that would /unquestionably/ be Harry Potter fanfic.

*** I honestly think that fanfiction is an opportunity that in the past was solely missed.

It gives the chance to the readers or the watchers who go and say, Wait, the author fucked up, how can I fix it.

That doesnt mean fix the world for the characters, but the world of the characters.

It can also be used to affront themes that aren't touched or outright avoided in the original, and thats fine, that good.

But for the love of God if I need to stomach another CoffeeShop!AUwere everything but the names are different I will burn down FF.net(if it doesn't collapse on itself first).

Seriously, make your own original work instead of trying to make me read something with characters i dont know wearing the face of my loved characters like the Faceless Men from Agot.

Cause while I might give a read to the original work, the AU will either annoy me or simply make me lose interest

** It's sometimes quite interesting to read a very different story and then realise, Oh yeah, that's based on a canon plot point, wow they really did it differently. Like the troll attack in HPMoR.

I don't have a problem with authors changing things on purpose, even drastically changing them. It mostly bothers me when it feels like the author didn't give any reason, maybe didn't even realise how off-base they were. There is an artistry to understanding a character well enough to preserve their personality and depict them consistently in new situations, and I respect that skill, though it's not the only kind of art.

** IMO. If it's an AU and you are using canon characters, then you should not have them OOC unless the story explains why are they different. Not character change for change's sake. We are reading fanfic, we do that because we care about the characters.

If the story totally needs the character to have an entirely different personality for no reason whatsoever, then using an established character just in name instead of an OC feels like a hits/kudos grab.

*** I'd add that the inverse is also fine: if it's in the canon setting but features all-new characters, that's also fine (ie "what if the avengers were Hogwarts students?" is a perfectly good premise.)

The line gets crossed when AU characters in an AU setting are involved in an AU plot ... at some point, it's no longer HP fanfic, and you're just slapping stickers on it to get more clicks. That's when it feels like a bait-and-switch.

Build your credibility with real fanfics then give links to the non-fanfic stuff for those who trust you as a writer.

**** One of the earliest fics I ever got into was Sailormoon Expanded, which started with 4 fics centered on the rank and file of the Dark Kingdom. All OCs, with the Senshi in the background doing battle with the 'main' Dark Kingdom Generals, while these lesser denizens tried to live life and deal with their own attempts to aid the invasion.

I remember being fascinated that these characters, who were clearly not part of the Sailormoon canon, still managed to inhabit and breathe new life into a part of the universe I hadn't considered.

** I think it comes down to personal tastes, and why you read fanfictions instead of the thousands and thousands of books and millions of original stories that are published each year.

Personally, I read fanfiction to go back to an universe I love, and rekindle with characters I love.

So, if a Harry Potter Fanfiction doesn't feel like Harry Potter for whatever reason, then I'm not interested in it, and I likely won't like it.

It doesn't mean it can't be an AU. An AU with space-ship still can feel like Harry Potter because the characters are still themselves. Drarry fanfiction might not be my cup of tea, but if the universe still is Harry Potter, then why not?

But, in my very honest opinion, if you just borrow the names, and everything else is different, then it's not an Harry Potter fanfiction. It can be a great and excellent story, but not an Harry Potter fanfiction.

** I like AUs. Frankly, I've had enough of canon rehashes, and even if the fic is well-written, there's a big chance I will stop reading it if the story is going the same way canon did.

But many times while reading a fic I thought "it doesn't feel like Harry Potter". What I love about the books is the magic, and I don't mean the literal magic, but this amazing feeling I have every time I re-read the series. It's warmth and love and friendship with a good dose of adventure and fun, and it's something I want to feel (at least in some part) while reading fan-fics based on the series.

** I don't necessarily think that a story has to feel like Harry Potter in order to be good, but it is a lot easier to make a good fanfic if you keep close to the original when it comes to world-building, characters etc.. Then the author doesn't need to nail the characters presentation or the world-building, in order to make it a worthwhile read, the reader has already connected to the characters and the HP world, which makes it easy (read easier) for the author to get the reader emotionally invested and interested in the story.

Also, a big part of what makes fanfics so popular is that they are easy to read and lose yourself in. You don't have to struggle through the beginning of the story, reading 50 pages with full focus, in order to get into it, because the scene is already set and the characters have already been presented. You can give it a lazy read and still get caught up in the story.

That said, I do think very well written stories can be just as good if they stray further from the original works in content, but if they still manage to capture the Harry Potter feeling, then that's the best of both worlds.

** Yes and no. For me, I like to be able to see the /roots/ of the characters in terms of their personalities, or attributes. As a writer, that's what I try and carry over.

For example, in the AU fic I'm currently writing, in canon, one character is very logical. Canon uses this to make her a strategist. In my AU, one piece of information she thinks is factually true, /isn't/. This leads her to become something of a megalomaniac True Believer archetype. So, that's a path I like to see taken by e.g. Hermiones, Harrys, Tom Riddles, Snapes.

** I think it's really dependant on context. In my perspective, the HP universe is a setting, which includes: rules of magic, characters, locations (among other things). For example, if I wanted to write an OC muggleborn in Japan, I think that should be accepted as HPFC, seeing as putting it in this setting saves me time and effort in developing the rules of magic, which I can then spend exploring stuff I want to (presumably character and setting). However, if it's literally nothing to do with the characters: high school fanfic with OOC Snape and Hermoine no magic (which god damnit I do not want to think about let alone see stop it ffn) then I think it shouldn't be HPFC. Of course, remember that (for better or worse) 50 shades was originally fanfiction of Twilight. I'm not familiar enough to comment how it does with the guideline I described above (nor do I intend to), though I presume at best it would use the character personality, at worse nothing.

It's always a relief when a fic author abandons the 'year one, year two' formula for their AU/canon divergent fic.

** For me it depends on 2 different things. Story and/or if it's a Cannon Divergence.

For the story it's mostly comes down to does this Harry make sense in the world the Author set up? What are the tags? Is it a Bash fic? Sane Voldemort? Reverse Good and Bad guys?

Let's say you want to have a spoiled!Harry. In this story what happened to make him that way? Was he raised by a Wizarding family like a prized peacock? Did the Dursley's treat him the same as Dudley? Was he raised the same as Canon-Harry but like Ron craved the spotlight?

If the story is set up correctly then I'll keep reading.

Now if it's Canon Divergence I'm a lot of stricter. If I'm reading a fic where We have a Ravenclaw Harry and let's say a Manipulative!Dumbledore and just a general Bash-fest, If Hermione gets sorted into Slytherin just because she's a selfish bitch. I will stop reading. Because to me that's the Author just being careless and not a true Canon Divergence.

Specifically for that story it was an Abused Harry and a General Bashing of the typical light Characters you'd expect. It was well written. I was maybe 15 chapters into the fic before we even made it to Hogwarts, Hermione showed up acted like a twat, very normal for the tags. But then during the sorting she went to Slytherin. There was absolutely nothing that happened to have a domino effect to change her sorting. Even her being a self absorbed wouldn't change that. I think people confuse the not willing to risk their own necks for someone they're not close to as being selfish. But it's not actually what Slytherins are about.

Or the story develops from a single point where character makes a different choice or some set of events play out differently, leading to very different outcome.

For the first option - power to the writer, go nuts, amaze me with your wacky imagination!

For the second - I will get annoyed if established lore, character traits / personality is not respected or even made to contradict the canonical facts up-to-that point.

** I don't mind AUs. Hell, my OTP requires at least some form of AU to be feasible at all past Marauder-era to avoid OOC. But there's a reason I'm reading Harry Potter fanfics rather than something else, and if a fic diverges too much on what is Harry Potter, then I'm not interested in reading it. It doesn't mean the fic is /bad/, it just means it doesn't interest me. At that point, why bother having HP characters at all?

** No, it doesn't. Literally, Harry Potter has such a massive fandom if you are not interested in a setting in space, or a story that has it's set up entirely without magic, or if you don't like that the characters diverge from the cannon, personality wise, then just don't read. There's plenty to read that's quite cannon compliant and will probably suit your taste better. It doesn't mean you can't use the names or even the idea, by all means, go for it. If someone doesn't like other setups, just don't read that at all.

** Just do whatever you want lol...

It doesn't hurt anyone for people to write furry-themed Draco coffee shop AUs. Just don't read them. I don't and I'm not offended or annoyed by them.

** I remember I once read a supposed HP fanfic where only thing that was even remotely related to HP was that there was a guy named Harry who had dark hair and green eyes. It was a fiction written by fan of something I'm sure but it was certainly not a HP fan fiction.

So yes, it does make a bad/terrible *fanfiction* even if it's not a bad/terrible fiction.

** I mostly agree. AUs aren't really for me most of the time, I prefer stuff that expands on canon or at least sticks to the canon-verse with plot changes. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean that someone else can't though, and I think weird, sometimes silly and nonsensical AUs have and deserve their place in the world of fanfiction.

I think people forget that writers often write what THEY want to see, or maybe they write for fun. It's fanfiction, people are going to do what they want, and I personally think all of the variety you can get in this fandom, from Non-Magic Coffeeshop AUs to an epic retelling of the adventure to defeat a dark wizard are all wonderful.

** To be honest I think it's great that fanfics doesn't always stick to canon, i tend to read every kind of fics, so I still enjoy fics with a very canon setting and interactions But still at the beginning of every fic I read i try to meet every character as new/different one from their canon version, like of course we always have some setting and character traits that remind us to canon, but it's interesting see al these kind of Harry, it also makes you think how canon could be different if Harry had changed a little bit

** I am of the opinion that fanfiction writers have a carte blanche, its fiction by a fan for fans I don't care if its Harry Potter reincarnated as Anakin Skywalker. I love BAMF!harry and he is often very OC but do I care nope, give him a AK47 and fight Space Nazis a good fic is a good story. Fan fics often get modified to become original stories but honestly fan fics get more traffic so its a logical reason to stick with the FanFic tag rather than OriginalWork.

I grade fics on writing style and narrative, not Canon accuracy.... and also if the author is willing to fix errors Im still dying that an abandoned story will never fix the blood type flaw that made it say B was the rarest.... no no its not, Bombay is the rarest after the typical O- and no matter how often I reread and review that has yet to be edited

** I think this is one of those complaints that people conflate with criticism. Like, I totally get not liking a fic because it strays too far from canon territory for a given reader's preference, it's certainly happened to me, but I can't stand when people treat it like a flaw.

** i've always found it confusing why there are so many people who dislike harry potter characters set in a different world? i understand that the personalities of the characters are shaped by their actions in canonverse but at the same time, i dont want to spend 50k words reading how the new universe has shaped the characters. i just want to read about these characters that i know and love in different settings and universes. is it a bad fic if harry and the gang are now living in our modern era as normal 'muggle' uni students? NO, definitely not! if it's not ur cup of tea, well, its a good thing that hp is a massive fandom with tons of fics to cater to every taste isnt it?

** Canon divergence is just fine, but you have to stay within certain limits. Otherwise, just write an original story.

Personally, I prefer stories with some changes to canon, but let the characters remain fairly similar to their original counterparts.

** Personally ? No I don't think so. I want to see these characters do different things explore them in different ways, ways that they didn't get to be explored in canon.

Its I think the equivalent of like superhero comics Batman has had like several different alternate depictions in very different worlds or alternate versions of the same world. Its fun seeing him in these new ways even if its very different from the default batman you are used to and that default still exists. Everyone had their fav story and world and characterization of batman and the rest of his cast. There may not be a consensus to best version and thats fine.

Superhero comics though its possible a more popular depiction of a character may replace the original. Here thats not true the original will always exist so why not have fun with something very different?

You can say well its fine as long as it still feels like Harry Potter. But what makes a fic feel like Harry Potter and not just a fantasy story with HP names I think will be different for everyone. Like personally if the major characters feel too different its not HP to me. Like alot of the Lord Potter stuff seems like some different character not Harry. Who Harry is a character I feel is given no consideration and Harry is turned into a type of character the author would prefer Harry was instead. I also think it feels less Harry Potter if the fantasy gets too technical. But others would disagree and I thats fine.

As for if the original stories are bad , no, but you can definitely end up liking a Hp fic thats very different from the original more than the original. So for you the original story not as good as the fic. But I think thats more a taste thing.

** In my opinion yes. I read fanfics because I want to read other people's take on in-universe unexplored elements. If you want to read about a different Harry or something may as well read an entirely new novel. If I want to read about a world that significantly differs from the one Rowling built, may as well read a new novel. It's not like she didn't borrow heavily from European mythology and other fantasy writers before her. This way I can both enjoy a new story and support the author financially.

** I wouldn't say it necessarily makes the fic bad but personally I don't see the point of writing a Harry Potter fic if the world isn't being used. Honestly I don't even remember seeing any fanfics where the world isn't used although I'm sure they exist. For me the only real draw for this work and Fandom IS the world and the characters are only made tolerable through writers writing the characters ooc or altering cannon. That being said, there are plenty of other Fandoms where I love the characters and don't care for the world or just want to see those characters interact in a different world and I like reading AUs for those ones just fine
