In darkness ascendant, the animagus form can be done three ways: meditation to discover and constant will to transform(mcgonagall), meditation to discover and tattoos to force the transformation(james and sirius), or forced transfiguration over and over(pettigrew). Harry'll have a tattoo to coat his hands in a mystical fire that won't harm him but could burn off a half inch of flesh if he punched someone with it activated. (He does it for more than the fact it's cool though that's why he originally worked on the idea)

Looking for more stories like this, where they're a part of the story and not just some throwaway for how edgy a character is.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) Harry gives himself multiple runic tattoos to cast various effects, including one tattoo that protects anyone wearing it from the Dementors Kiss and similar soul-removing effects. (It doesn't stop the killing curse or any other cause of death.)

linkffn(Simurgh's Son) Worm/HP Crossover, reincarnation fic. The MC gives himself additional powers through runes that are written with henna, since tattoos would be too time-consuming.

****** As soon as Harry Bailey figures out occlumency from the dreams he's getting, he ends up fully accessing MoD!Harry Potter's memories. At that point, he accesses rune magic and is in the process of unlocking more direct forms of magic, though he lacks a wand. It's also implied that Bailey is genetically identical but physically healthier than Potter, being larger than Potter and with functional eyes, but otherwise identical in appearance.

Honestly, it's best to just treat it as a /Worm/ fic with a HP-style OC in it. It's fun an definitely worth a read, but it's connection to the HP fandom is thin.
