I'm looking for any good quality Harry/Ron fics, Harry/Ron/Hermione is welcome too

Strong platonic trio fics are welcome, although I'm hoping for romance in particular


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/562941][Prelude and Fugue]] linkao3(562941) is a masterpiece. It's rather long and engaging all the way through.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000792][I Can See Us Dying ... Aren't We?]] linkao3(1000792) is an excellent trio turned unrequited love between Harry and Ron. Can't recommend it highly enough.

If you wanna feel like you were punched in the gut then check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]] linkao3(16957743) for some Harry/Ron/Hermione angst.

Otherwise check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bpvecd/looking_for_ronhermioneharry_recs/enzb1xw/?context=3]] for some excellent Harry/Ron/Hermione recommendations.

  It took over an hour, from the time Harry arrived at work, for him to realise just how different today actually was.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.

  In which Ron realizes that maybe, just maybe, you aren't supposed to feel this way about your best mate. But only after a dance at the Yule Ball, months of being busy with other things, Cedric Diggory's death, the return of Voldemort, and a quiet knock at his door.
