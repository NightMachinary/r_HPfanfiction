Vernon Dursley is not merely obsessed about being seen as normal, he actually exhibits the traits of a "normal" British male.

Yes, Vernon is a pub-going football fan. He actually plays in the Sunday League, in the local pub-sponsored team, and religiously attends any Chelsea game. His greatest regret is that his dearly beloved son, spawn of his own loins, shows no interest whatsoever in The Beautiful Game. Meanwhile, his wife's nephew, foisted on them without so much as a by-your-leave in the middle of the night, actually shows not only interest but also talent. So, after long discussions with his wife about how to discourage freakishness and nourish normal behaviour, Harry has been enrolled in the local youth team. And the boy flourishes there.\\
Soon Vernon finds himself taking the kid to the stadium in lieu of his son, who'd rather hang out with his gang of friends and play video games, drive him to games and talk football with him.

His only regret is that the boy decided to support Millwall over Chelsea.

Now Harry's ten years old, shows some real promise and the recruiters of the big clubs have started to look at him, and this letter from the Freak School in the middle of nowhere, Scotland wants him to attend year-round. But by golly! Vernon will do everything in his might to ensure that such talent does not go to waste and the boy gets a chance at a career in professional football and doesn't rot away under piles of moldy freak books in a place that doesn't even field a school team.

*** I'd say not. It is unnecessary and takes away the chance to have two football fans (who possibly support rivalling teams) negotiate the the world of Hogwarts and finding someone sane in all this madness. With an early meeting you would have a situation "they already have it all figured out between eachother", makes discovering Hogwarts a whole lot less interesting.

***** In my imagined version he does attend Hogwarts but the Wizarding World would have to make considerable concessions to allow him to continue his sporting activities and his teachers and the wizarding world authorities would regularly butt heads and rail against the limits against their whimsy and authority these concessions to the muggles put on them.

It also allows for a fifth year where Dumbledore's Army gets a proper education in football hoooliganism.

** So what's his reaction when he finds out that Harry is a once-in-a-generation talent at quidditch? Does Harry try to swing tickets to the World Cup to introduce him to the game? I feel like a diehard football fan would hate quidditch if they were introduced to it under these circumstances, but I really want to read a Vernon redemption fic where he becomes the quidditch equivalent of a rabid Chelsea fan.

*** They boy may of course try his hand at lesser games and teach those losers how it's done but those activities will never even reach close to the beautiful grace, to the strategic and tactical challenge, to the team spirit and camaraderie of footy.

Plus, you can't make the money in it you can make in the premier league.

** One of Vernon's work colleagues overhears him complaining about how Harry's going to learn all that 'freakishness' at the school up in Scotland instead of football.

His response is that 'rugby isn't that bad!'.

*** Nah, rugby is an old public school sport. It's unlikely that Vernon or any of his colleagues would have that strong feelings about it. No, the freakishness obviously refers to whaever the Celtics, Rangers and the rest of the Scottish league are up to.

** i would love a story where Harry has a healthy relationship to the degree that all the plans Dumbledore set in motion gets derailed immediatly.

year 1- Does nothing because he has good experience with teachers in his childhood, authority figures are still good in his mind.

year 2 and 3 would be interesting, with finding out Fudge and Sirius as a kid who has had reliable parental figures his entire life.

** Amazing idea. Would be fun if Lily had taken Petunia to outings in the magical world in an effort to mend bridges and it ended up making Petunia a die hard Quidditch fan (I imagine this version of Petunia getting along fabulously with James while your proposed Vernon commiserate with Lily over their spouses strange love for such an illogical sport).

*** Never saw one like this. And I like the portrayal of Vernon as a man who grudgingly learns to approve of Harry because he is actually passionate about something and Harry can give him something his own son can't or won't.

Also, Hogwarts and the Wizarding World having to accomodate ongoing ties to the muggle world or risk losing their hero because when push comes to shove they would be considered the lesser option, that has something delicious.
