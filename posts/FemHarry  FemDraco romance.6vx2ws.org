  It's fifteen years after The-Girl-Who-Lived became the Girl-Who-Vanquished-The-Dark-Lord, and Viktor Krum has a favor to ask of the Head Auror. Or: Harry is accidentally sentimental in a business meeting and her wife, the one secretary who can always be counted on to eavesdrop and not be fired for it, has feelings about it. Serious. Feelings. --- Fem!Harry/Fem!Draco. One-Shot.

#+begin_quote
  When Harriet Potter got a letter informing her that she was a witch, and that she was going to Hogwarts, she was eleven and everything changed. On the train, she ran into Dracaena Malfoy, who (as it turned out) was just awful. Snobby, with her blonde hair pulled back in a pert little ponytail and her bangs perfectly curled. Harriet hated her instantly. The feeling, it rapidly became clear, was mutual.

  "Lyra shifted her gaze upward, letting it scan the room before landing on a girl leaning against the check-out counter, reading a book. The girl had messy black hair tamed by a beanie and was wearing a knit sweater that looked at least three sizes too large---it hung off one shoulder and bunched at her wrists. Black-framed glasses rested on the tip of her nose. As if sensing Lyra's gaze, the girl looked up. Lyra's throat went dry---she had never seen such vibrant green eyes.The girl tilted her head to the side and a smile slowly curled at her lips. Lyra realized she was still staring and quickly glanced back down at the records. Her cheeks heated---that girl had caught Lyra practically drooling at her."
