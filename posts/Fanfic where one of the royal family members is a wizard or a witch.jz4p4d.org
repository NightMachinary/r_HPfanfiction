:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I want to read a FanFiction which features a British prince or princess is a witch/wizard and they received the hogwarts acceptance letter and go on to study at hogwarts and accomplish some amazing things. Is there any such fic?


** "Honor to Serve" [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8089778/1/Honor-To-Serve]]. About half the Royal family are magical. Prince Harry might be going to Hogwarts, the previous Royal Wizard was Princess Margaret, the current is Prince Edward, and the Queen Mother is a witch, although the Queen is not. Prince Charles is Cannons fan, BTW.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen, an event which causes Vernon to die of a heart attack. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry's 9th birthday and several years before Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced. Warnings may change as the story progresses.
