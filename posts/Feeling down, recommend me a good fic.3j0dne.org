I've read most good fics on fanfiction.net so be warned! Anyways, please recommend me some good fics with romance in them. IDC about the pairing.

If I don't get anything good, might end up just rereading Sheeza's series.. but that would suck cause he hasn't updated the 4th book in like forever :(


** Forever knight. Its on portkey and is up there as one of my favorites. After the prologue, the story is really fluffy for the first couple chapters but after that, it becomes really good. One of my all time favorites. HHr though. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]

*** One of the best stories I have ever read. I second this so much. One of the few fics where I stayed up all night reading it.

**** Its one of the stories that I have read multiple times throughout the years. It's dark, thrilling, sexy, and sweet all at the same time. For me, it is truly one of the best written in the fandom. It is simply beautiful

** I often think of C'est la Vie and Oh God Not Again as comfort fics. If you're feeling down, they should be worth a reread for the fluffiness.

But good fics with romance. Have you read Came Back Late? If not, give it a go, it's very good.

** linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus) is the first part of a trilogy. Harry/Daphne, Neville/Hermione.

There's also a sweet oneshot by the same author, not in the same verse, about a burgeoning Greg/Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10986827/22/Hermione-s-Scribbles][Have another diabetes inducing Greg/Hermione oneshot by Crazy Mishka]]

linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66) is a Harry/Morag along the veins of the 'Harry has everyone betraying him' trope.

When I'm down, I gravitate to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion by Rorshach's Blot]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] as guaranteed pick me ups. ;)

  AU post 5th year. A bunny that wouldn't let go. Harry is set up in a marriage contract, but things don't go as planned. Rated for language and blatant - if non-desciptive - sexuality.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun]] Snape Hermione romance story. Unique to me because its one of the only stories with that pairing that mostly follows cannon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5498748/1/Simply-Irresistible]] A Draco/Hermione fic that is a little shorter, but a "funner" read. Well written and will hopefully cheer you up
