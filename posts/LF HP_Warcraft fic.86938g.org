I read this a while ago and went looking for it but can't for the life of me find it. Basically Harry, Hermione, Neville, Augusta Longbottom and either Remus or Sirius plus a bunch of house elves go to Kazaran in Azeroth and essentially claim it as their new home. I thought for some reason that it was written by Shadowblayze but can't find it. Anyone know what fic I'm talking about?


** I know the one you are talking about, was on my favourite list for ages, from what I can tell it has been deleted. If it is the one you are thinking of, they spend some time in Hearthglen for a while I think. The very last chapter introduced Elune being pleased about some form of animagus/patronus/werewolf (Can't remember the specific one) being linked to Omen. Not even the remotest clue what it was called, but its a shame it was probably one of the best warcraft crossovers there have been.
