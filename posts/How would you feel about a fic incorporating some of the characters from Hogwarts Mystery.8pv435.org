Prefacing this with I'm not a fan of the game mechanics, although I enjoy the story where it hasn't been bungled.

I've been working on an AU fic that definitely has a lot of Order involvement. One thing I've noticed is that other than Tonks and the Weasleys, I can't really think of many members not from either Harry's generation or his parents or before, at least not ones explicitly show to be from the inter-wae era. There seems to be a real gap in the characters who attended school 1980-1990.

They definitely wouldn't be the main focus, more side characters than anything else, but would you have strong feelings about seeing characters such as Penny Haywood and Merula Snyde in a fic? Obviously a concern ATM is we don't know how the story ends.


** Very good idea! By all means, go ahead. A problem is that we should probably try and agree on a consistent fanon name for the Player Character, because we can't have that many /HM/ character appearing and continuously dance around the issue of /who/ their good friend who uncovered the Cursed Vaults /was/.

*** That's a good point. For now, I guess as long as it's clear that Jacob's siblng through explicit statement or context, it'll work out. Their role could be filled by OCs, and would have been, but I think that using the gives some different subplot/depth opportunities. I am curious to see what the fandom name is going to be, though.

** I have not played that pay-to-wait game, but I wouldn't mind a fic with them unless it pushes a certain agenda (like Snape is good, the Death Eaters did nothing wrong, everyone is gay).

*** Snape /is/ good. He is also mean and unlikable. Those are two different things.

**** He is not good. A good person would not join the magical Waffen-SS out of their own volition or trying to get a married woman after accidentally engineering her family's murder. Snape is grey, but definitely not good.
