** Agreed. Or, worse, people talking about how the idea doesn't work because of x, y, and z thing in canon.

Like, I also find it super fun to play with worldbuilding and to try to make stories work with what we know of canon as sensibly as possible. But also, prompts/requests aren't just about worldbuilding logistics, they're about fun stories. So what if you have to ignore some parts of canon to make them work? That's kind of the whole point.

I don't see your point, it's fanfiction, Being OOC or Genderswapped is fine, if all Fictions had to respect the Canon personality of the main characters all the time, I would have been disinterested from fanfiction years ago.

However, if someone tries to sell a story as an alternative chain of events, it can irk people - I.e. a story about "what if Harry shot first" at the graveyard - you don't want to suddenly find out that Ron suddenly gets mad because he didn't know about Pettigrew being scabbers, or that Dumbledore is plotting behind to be Grindelwald come again. Or that magic is even more explicitly bonkers and only our OPMc figures it our and makes everyone into their harem.

*** This kind of 'assumption of fault' can be a bit annoying to deal with though. There's a tendency to accept AU elements in a story if they are 'told' to the reader in unambiguous terms, which on its own is fine. The problems come when a writer attempts to 'show' AU elements by having the specific AU element demonstrated almost in passing, or implied by some other aspect of the story. When that happens, there will typically be a number of comments along the line of 'well that's not how that would work in canon!'

I understand the reasoning of finding unintended plot holes, but it can lead to an overcorrection where writers feel the need to go into lengthy lectures about the specifics of their magic system/world even when they don't drive the story forward.

#+begin_quote
  It's not a "You can't do this", it's a "but that doesn't work with this, are you going to fix this or change it entirely as well?"

I guess I dislike the idea that a non canon element either needs to be explained and sign-posted so that no-one can misinterpret it as a mistake, or should be 'fixed' to be canon compatible. That's a recipe for adding a lot of mostly-empty 'telling' to a story.

I understand the conundrum, though. People do make canon mistakes, and how else are readers meant to distinguish between a mistake and an intentional deviation? I don't mind /asking/, but the assumption that it either needs to change, or be 'fixed' doesn't sit well with me.

***** I'll admit that this is exactly the reason I've been feeling more and more like writing properly original stories, but that's very much the nuclear option, and it's really not the right suggestion for the problem at hand.

Take something like Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic]]. which makes such significant divergences from canon that I think every reader enters into it /as if/ they're reading original fiction. When you've so completely changed the setting, all bets are off and I think everyone accepts that.

The issue is really, as is so often the case, in the blurry middle-ground. Those stories which re-use /most/ of the canon, but here and there, for the purposes of setting a different tone, venture into AU elements. As an avid reader of fanfiction, I don't want to drive those original takes away and into writing original fiction for... no real material gain.

Really, though, my beef isn't so much with canon nit-picks, but actually with those reviewers who confuse 'fanon' or 'head-canon' with canon. 'No, your story is wrong because Daphne is blonde!'

It's not about avoiding a writer to go lengthy to explain something in their fics. It's about help them have the lengthy explanation in mind themselves. They don't need to explain all that in their fics, just try to avoid saying something that puts a plot holes there.

Again, not saying it should be fixed. But when it isn't going to stay in canon then you should answer with how are you planning to make it work in your AU instead.

*** HPMOR to me seems like just another alternate-history story written in a style that some people dislike. It mainly changes Harry's backstory, and it makes some changes to the setting that are fairly well delineated. There's a 1-page document about that here:

**** No, it's some asshole's half-mil word count circlejerk about how amazing his philosophical cult is that just happened to have the Harry Potter universe draped over it because let's be honest, no one would have given a shit if it was developed as an original work.

When you have to make so many changes to canon to justify how your characters act that it barely resembles the original work then that's a sign of bad authorship - doubly so if I have to read a primer to make sense of the differences.

***** Shrug, it's a long fic that some people like and some don't. You're one of the ones that doesn't, but that doesn't make your opinion special.

Also: canon, shmanon. The HP universe is a backdrop that exists in readers' minds and fanfic (including HPMOR) makes use of it. It's not up to you or JKR or anyone else to say what readers are allowed to do with their own minds. So there is nothing special about "canon" either. People have written fanfic about King Arthur and Camelot for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur#Medieval_literary_traditions][1000+ years]], they are still writing it, and nobody cares what the original sources were. HP for fanfic purposes is or should be the same way.

****** The issue is, it's not a very good fic. It's written in such a way to seem excessively snobby, and in general, the entirety of the characters said fanfiction are based upon have been markedly changed exclusively because it makes Elizer get his rocks off. Alot of the changes don't even make logical sense, and for someone obsessed with "This is rational, and quite smart."

Also: Canon is your sandbox to play in. Some people make changes to the sand, some people make changes to what the sand is molded into. Some people make changes to what the box seems like. You can't do all three, because then you've got a different sandbox. And, sadly. Elizer did all three, and badly at that.

******* Yeah I understand about the snobbiness and that's certaintly a bad failing of the book, that make some parts of it pure cringe. It's worse in the earlier parts of the book, I'd say. Further in, the author gets more committed to the story. My basic standard of a fanfic is whether a story has enough good parts that I feel like I got something out of reading it. If I was after complete freedom from faults, I'd hate everything.

Canon as well is more important to some readers than others. I personally don't give a fig about it, so I'm not bothered by departures from it. I thought Monty Python and the Holy Grail was a great movie even though (or maybe because) the AU it was set in completely trashed many of the "canon" elements of the King Arthur universe. Rowling's HP series as well absconded with a King Arthur character (namely Merlin), and nobody complains.

HPMOR has 35,691 reviews (obvs. not all favorable) and 26,947 favorites on ff.net, plus it has novel-length follow-ons by at least 3 different authors, and probably a dozen or so shorter follow-ons. I can't think of many other HP fanfics with numbers like that. So it unquestionably has a positive reception at least with a certain type of reader.

I can't understand why that enrages some of the regulars here so much. Most normal people, if they see a fic that they don't like, just read something else instead. If I see "Dumbledore/Voldemort smut, romance" in a description, I skip over it. I don't post rants about how terrible it is and downvote every post that mentions it. That comes across as bitter and impotent. If other people like a story and I don't, who am I to judge? That type of gatekeeping almost makes me think about Slytherin obsession with blood purity. Yes it's a mudblood story. Deal with it. ;-)

******** The reason why alot of people don't like the fact that it's 'amazingly received', as it's not very good, and in general paints the entire fandom as elitist snobs for newcomers. I have actually talked to a guy who I consider a great friend, and tried to bring him into the fandom cause I thought he would like alot of the story of ACV, and he would love Emperor. But, he said that he was tricked once by hp fanfiction when another one of his friends tried to turn him onto HPMoR.

The story itself is a grim reminder of the folly of a fanfic writer. And in general paints a bad light atop the entirety of the fandom itself.

Just because people like something. Doesn't make it /Good/.

********* I don't see what you're saying here. 26,947 people on ff favorited MOR but that means nothing because your friend didn't like it? They thought it was good but you didn't, so what makes your judgment better than theirs? Or better than [[http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2010/06/secret-of-college-life-plus.html][that of David Brin]] (scroll down), a professional writer who has won the Hugo, Nebula, Campbell, and Locus awards? MOR's podcast was a finalist for the [[http://www.parsecawards.com][Parsec award]] twice (2015 and 2016): more bad judgment? MOR has its own subreddit: are the participants all elitists, idiots, or what? What if the first thing your friend read was some kind of violent slash smut and he generalized to the rest of fanfic from that? I'd call it a similar cognitive distortion.

There are /300,000/-ish HP fanfic stories on ff so some of them will be surely aimed at some weird niches, and that is fine. I'd agree with you that MOR has serious flaws but on balance I thought it was good. It also inspired a substantial follow-on subgenre: is that all bad too? Are there other fics that grew their own secondary literature like that (not rhetorical, I'd be interested in reading some)? Anyway, the great thing about fanfic is that people write it because they want to: they don't have to care what other people think. So "paints a bad light atop the entirety of the fandom itself" sounds bizarre to me. I'll go for "illustrates the variety of the fandom itself". Slash smut, of course, does the same.

Fwiw, I did the opposite of your friend. I stumbled onto MOR from something unrelated, liked it, and started looking at other HP fic as a result. If you want to ask your friend to give HP fic another shot, you might point him to something a lot shorter, since it can be a real let-down to invest the time of reading a very long fic and come away unsatisfied.

** *shrug* It is fanfiction, not original fiction, how it fits into canon is relevant..

HP Fan community is large, so you see the entire range from "Story set in the canon universe" to "HP Universe with minor/controlled changes" to "HP Universe with these major additions" to "HP Universe but everyone is a space pirate" to "Original fiction that just reuses the names".

For some reason authors like to sell their fic as being more canon compliant than they actually are. Honestly, I think it is simply that some fics start off as ideas in the canon universe and then take a life of their own, but that isn't necessarily communicated well to the readers.

*shrug* no-one is going onto the space pirate harry fics and saying they are not canon compliant because canon wears pointier hats.

Went to school in the 90's, that behavior toward preteens would have raised an angry parent mob. At a minimum, the child would be removed from the classroom. More likely it becomes a nasty mess.

**** Your school is a special case, then. I've seen countless stories about people having to deal with cruel teachers. Thankfully I never had a personal experience with it.

However, while schools, at least in the past, never cared much about cruel teachers, they /did/ care about incompetent ones. So while I can totally see a 90s school have Snape on as a teacher (who, while a bully of a teacher, was very much competent in his area of expertise), I cannot say the same for Lockhart.

**** I also went to school in the nineties, in fact I would have been in Harry's year, and teachers said mean stuff to the students constantly. No one was talking about bullying at all seriously, much less stopping it, until after Columbine in 1999.

It was super-common for kids to complain about their teachers- that they were mean, that they failed them unfairly- but no adult took it seriously. You would have to raise it to the level of "they hit me" or "they raped me" before a parent would listen, much less administration. Anything else just "toughened you up" or "prepared you for the real world". We didn't have cell phones to so easily record what they were doing or saying.
