**** JKR didn't want to do much world building. She prefered metaphor and symbolism. That's why the bubble-head charm and partial human transfiguration in book four were the height of advanced student magic. And they were never used again in the rest of the books.

Oh. And Hermione's bead bag and camp defenses, but those don't even get names.

Having actual year six and later magic classes would have required delving into what magic was like and how it was used in the world, things that JKR wasn't interested in and weren't important to the story.

I'm not talking here about explaining how things work, though that would be nice, but how things fit into the world. She wrote things happening because they were interesting, not because there were deep in-world reasons behind those things.

That seems weak. She didn't "do world building" very often at all in the books, and didn't seem to care about it, instead focusing on wide themes and symbols. Which is fine. That's not a crime. But it does mean most Harry Potter world building is the fans doing it after the fact, and those odd internet published extras on Pottermore. Which doesn't really help, as it is some of the most wild and disconnected stuff. Merlin was a Slytherin? What.

There aren't just gaps and missing explanations, there are things that simply don't make sense in the context of the world. Things that would cause people and society to be radically different if they existed in a logically worked out world, regardless of the details and explanation behind them. Features don't have to be explained in detail, they just have to fit into a world where things have causes, and effect other things logically.

That's what world building is, not just thinking up things and putting them in a story. The term means something rather specific.

JKR wrote stories with okay plot and characters, and seriously kicking themes and settings -- all created with little regard to connections to the story world after book one. Diagon Alley, platform 9 3/4, and the Hogwarts Express are the best situated features, interfacing with characters, the differences magic brings, and magical society. They still have major problems and missing information, but at least they /try/ to make sense in the world. Most everything else sort of just happens without good links to an underlying order.

Take something simple: Hogwarts. It stands alone, and is a powerfully presented location and idea. But people don't act in the magical world, especially adults, like they logically would if Hogwarts existed and housed and educated all of their children from years 11 to 18. No pre-Hogwarts education is ever mentioned. Preparation for Hogwarts doesn't involve telling your son /exactly/ how his social group for the next seven years will be picked, apparently. Ever. That means something like eight years (at year one) of "no, we won't tell you, and don't ask your brothers." Harsh. And your name is down for Hogwarts, if you are James and Lily Potter's son...which means what to everyone else whose name /isn't/ down for it? Hagrid isn't a muggleborn, so he can't know about standard public (UK) schooling terminology and legacy admissions.

Same with magic wand sellers who fit you with your one, perfect wand which chooses /you/ -- and which can choose another wizard who defeats you in a duel, but not just any duel, a really important one. Sometimes.

People don't act like they would with the Trace (even as horribly as it is explained) being a thing. Sure, it is close on the surface, but not really, as it only exists as a thing to use to harass Harry. The Twins, Ron, and even Hermione apparently gets away with it without comment. That's one reason the Trace and how it works is so often the focus of fanfiction. It doesn't make sense in wider context in canon without a lot of hand waving.

Also, there's the ability to create and alter simple objects. Or the ability to affect moods with simple charms a grade schooler can cast. Or the ability to teleport someone personally or with an item (even against their will) from point to point. Or the ability to create functional animals (even temporarily) from inanimate objects. Or...

We both agree that she didn't link up all her ideas or fully explore them, with some parts being at best vague and at worst requiring significant explanation to avoid inconsistency.

******** Without a constraint on what makes up world building, /all/ of fiction writing would be world building.

When JKR says Merlin was sorted into Slytherin (and nothing else about what that meant) on a website years after the books were originally published, I think most everyone can agree that isn't usefully defined as world building for the Harry Potter universe. That thought had nothing to do with building up the story world of the books and everything to do with being imaginative and adding to a disconnected lore of cute ideas.

I'm loosely defining world building as existing between writing something because one genuinely thinks it makes sense in an imaginary world, and the writing of something because it fits into a cohesive narrative -- and for no other reason. That latter case describes the vast majority of things JKR puts in Harry Potter, which is why I say JKR didn't spend much time world building, but a lot of time working on powerful, evocative creatures, characters, and locations.

Simply writing something isn't world building. Writing something to intentionally fit into a consistent story world is. Things don't even have to be rational or logical, necessarily, to count, but every addition need to cause proper reactions to all elements of the story world it could affect.

Otherwise, the characters, society, or even reality itself is carrying [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][the idiot ball]] just to move the plot along. And that's what GP was complaining about.

The conceptual work done by your distinction of "world building/not world building" can be performed equally well by a concept of "good world building/bad world building".

Given that both definitions are equally useful, and given that there's no "true definition" of the term, then there seems little point in either oen of us trying to persuade the other that our own stipulated definition of "world building" is the one that should be accepted.

(My own definition of world building, if not clear, is something like this: any creation of fictional information which forms the background of a story. As such any fiction would involve a certain amount of this. Whether the author has done a good job of doing so is a separate matter, and to be determined by a number of factors, some of which you describe.)

Ehhh. The /things/ and /people/ she wrote about were powerful and compelling, beloved by many. Not the world itself. The world is more full of holes than Narnia. Which is one reason why Narnia fanfic isn't as popular, even after the recent movies. Less room to work in.

Hogwarts, for example, is powerfully presented, but not /well fleshed out/. How many students are at Hogwarts? In Harry's year? In Hermione's dorm? No exact numbers needed, just a general sense would do.

How many teachers are there? Who gets to go to Hogwarts, and why does Harry's name being down for it since birth matter (this is canon)? Does everyone in the UK just get to go? Are there any visiting students from other countries? Is it expensive or free, or something inbetween? How does one become a "Potions Master", anyway?

We know the number of staircases (142) but any of not this.

Then there are the big things, things that don't need to be said but need to be at least /suggested/ when the legal and governmental systems start becoming part of the plot. We don't know how much the non-magical government actually knows about wizards, whether the Queen is aware of it, or even if wizards and witches consider themselves British citizens at all. We don't even now how the Minister for Magic is elected, and how one might get kicked out of office. Surely someone at Hogwarts would have considered that during fifth year.

That's world building, even if only used in a throw-away line once. That's what's not done well at all in Harry Potter.

I'm only suggesting /why/ she didn't expand on those ideas and themes. Her not doing so is fine. That was her story. That's why Harry Potter doing magic isn't important to the story of Harry Potter. Because magic isn't really important to the story, even if it is important to the world.

That's like saying the lack of peanuts is the best part of a tuna sandwich.

I'm trying to say the reason you don't like the ending is that the /objectively bad/ world building didn't lead into a thematically appealing and logical conclusion, like one where Harry learns more about magic and about himself and his abilities.

He starts out learning he's a wizard, and goes out learning he's a sacrificial lamb with lots of "choice" but really only one path. Where what he knows doesn't matter, only the kind of person he is (seriously?) when the tests of his character come down the railroad lines.

Clashing and very meh compared to "yer a wizard, Harry." That was a statement of infinite possibility, from a world building standpoint.

Harry walking to his death without a plan, after two pointless years (and books) of not growing at all /as a wizard/ was the exact opposite of that. Questionable character building and totally dropping the ball on fantasy world-building.

Why don't you think these things are linked here? Magic is key to the stories -- that's what drew in fans, not the faux-Regency boarding school themes or awkward friendship and hardship storylines. An ending to the story that didn't involve Harry /somewhere/ actively using his knowledge of magic and how to be a wizard that he learned along the way was exactly the wrong way to go.

I'm not saying thorough world building is the end-all-be-all in all stories and genres. But in modern fantasy stories (which is what Harry Potter is), it is very important to show the spots where the setting is like the real world but different. The edges and the seams are very interesting in this genre.

That's why platform 9 3/4 is so iconic. It has a purpose and a place in society. Great world building there, even though there are HUGE gaps left unfilled. It doesn't even physically work in that train station, at that location in real life, but it matters a lot and is literally a passage from one part of the story to another, even appearing in later books as an important feature of the world.

If Harry Potter had first (or really ever) arrived at Hogwarts after touching a ratty boot Hagrid handed him, perfectly acceptable in that world, it would not have been very compelling. It would have come from nowhere to jerk Harry from place to place. Bad world building, even though it sort of makes sense, because it doesn't /mean/ anything to the world. It doesn't answer the questions the Hogwarts Express does (such as it does) and is bad plotting even though it could be totally explained.

That is what the Horcrux hunt was, and to a great extent book six. Magic without reason, agency, and widely without social context. Characters jerked from place to place or emotion to emotion without warning and reason. I seriously doubt that is how JKR planned on the series ending when she finished book one, whatever her later claims.

In the end, she took out a student-based plotline and focused on a bunch of stuff that didn't make a lot of sense in book four, the one she kept having to replot and rewrite. Then that odd refocus kept on in books five (somewhat) and to a great extent in six and seven. It wasn't really about the school, his classes, magic in general, or living in a magical world with the other students anymore. Things got murky and symbolic, and it doesn't hold together well after that. It turned into a sort of morality play about hope and fate and perseverance and depression and death. Magic was no longer a thing that people did, something to inform and influence the world and society, it was a plot device. Something to move the story forward in a series of "just so" stories.

Which is why the world building being bad is really a big problem in a story like Harry Potter that needs a strong, self-actualized ending for emotionally significant characters. Not a budget Greek tragedy, complete (as you point out) with a deus ex machina and poorly named babies ever after.

I pretty much agree with you, but it's kind of hard to imagine a plausible ending where Riddle is defeated that doesn't involve some kind of deus ex machina. When it comes to knowledge of magic, Harry and co. are completely outclassed by Riddle. With Dumbledore dead they're kind of screwed in any contest of magical skill, especially since they refuse to actually kill Death Eaters.

********** It doesn't have to be anything dramatic, where PowerfulHarry magically wrestles Voldemort down.

I see a good ending as being one where Harry picks up a sword (literal or not) that Dumbledore left for him and uses his fame and leadership to rally the entire wizarding world to defeat Voldemort and his Death Eaters...fine, /while using the power of love and friendship/.

You could have communities of muggles and wizards coming together, making the whole statute of secrecy thing interesting again. You'd have people working in secret and then more openly to defeat a common evil, and the overthrowing of a co-opted and corrupt government still staffed by mostly good people just trying to get by. Internment camps are liberated, a Hogwarts resistance group is run by Neville, and people do important and interesting things with magic /on camera/. Good stuff.

Instead of like in canon, where the most action in the "war" takes place in a single battle at a school, against students and random alumni plus Hogwarts teaching staff and the local PTA. They last not even long enough for Harry to manage to throw himself into one last wood chipper. Also, while defending a school full of defenseless little kids against murderers, the adults suffered only like, what, 5% casualties before surrendering? Right.

So thematically odd.

How about after helping actual qualified adults find all the Horcruxes, Harry takes out the last one, Nagini, using his Parselmouth ability to set a trap. Then he stands up and rejects his hatred and fear of death while in a face to face fight against Voldemort, one he can't win, thus severing his ties to the Dark Lord and the path he took. Because shooting an infant in the face is not the recipe for how you make a Horcrux, this is important only to Harry's spiritual well being. And then Harry dies heroically but ultimately pointlessly, because that is what happens when you're that guy.

Then Neville runs Voldemort through from behind with the Sword of Gryffindor, because he was /obviously/ the Chosen One all along. Not someone with personal power, like Harry had, but someone with the power of his friends and community behind him, working together to defend the weak and helpless. Neville's the one marked by Voldemort, causing him to fear death as Voldemort does, making them equal -- he's not literally marked, or literally equal in magical or physical power, which would be trite. This is a fear Neville has to overcome because of his parents -- who were tortured, remember, for information about Voldemort's location after his de-bodying because of the Dark Lord's choice to go after Harry. Making the whole thing /classically/ Greek and /actually/, /technically/ speaking, *dramatically ironic* in the way the prophecy works out.

A bitter victory. Harry's friends mourn*. A tomb, next to Dumbledore...and Snape. But also rejoicing and peace at last, then rebuilding and reconciliation after a civil war.

Epilogue:

Neville's kid going to Hogwarts for the first time, a busy train platform.

"You'll do great, Harry. You're named after the bravest man I know. I'll be proud of you no matter what, even if you get sorted into Slytherin House."

"Why would that matter, da?"

"It doesn't, son. It doesn't. Green's a fine color."

The End

--------------

*Series Reboot Alt Ending:*

And then Harry sits back up again, alive; because he is, in fact, both the Boy Who Lived and the Master of Death. By not fearing Death, and by having all the Hollows, he got one last chance at the price of giving up death's gifts once and for all. The Deathly Hallows appear to wither and turn to dust in Harry's hands. No one else sees this, just Neville.

They win and everyone hugs, but Neville and Harry are confused and worried, unable to believe the long fight is over. Fake smiles are shown. Ron jokes, can't anything kill you? That's what, three times now? Harry and Neville stare at each other across the crowded table at the victory banquet, visibly unsettled. They both know of only one person to have cheated death like Harry repeatedly does. And because he immediately tested it after Voldemort was gone, Harry knows Dumbledore was wrong about at least one thing. He can still talk to snakes.

Cue creepy Harry Potter music.

Roll credits.

+Epilogue+ After credit scene (...for a book, shutup):

(pitch blackness, two figures talking through a tall iron gate, lit only by two glowing wand tips)

"Look, I've got classes in the morning..."

"I'll say it fast then. You watch him, mate. The kid's no good."

"I don't believe it. Harry's a good man. He has a good wife and a good family."

"The things he did during the war, the way he just stood up after that horrible Quidditch accident. And after V-Voldemort- it isn't natural! They say-"

"That's all in the past. The war's behind him, behind us all now. Let it go."

"I've got a kid at Hogwarts too, you know. Gryffindor, and proud of it. I don't want another creature let loose, attacking kids like our second year."

"That's not-"

"You know, the Hat tried to sort Harry into Slytherin too. He said that once. And Hermione checked the old Ministry records at last. He actually is an heir of Slytherin, through the Peverels. So that means his son is, too."

"Not all Slytherins are evil. You know that, Ron."

"No, you listen /Professor/. There's something wrong with Hogwarts' latest Slytherin. I saw the animals, dead and unnaturally so. The weird lights at night from the Potter place. Mark my words, Nev. Albus Potter is Dark."

--------------

*In summary:* should have been a Joan of Arc, not a Christ figure for Harry. And the /entire/ magical world openly fighting the Death Eaters in a civil war. And Neville as the real Chosen One, leaving Harry...just Harry, a normal boy who did what he saw needed to be done. Someone who made all the right choices, not because of fate but because he was a good person with good friends backing him up. Voldemort loses in the end because he can't understand this power.

What we got was so much less interesting.

  it's kind of hard to imagine a plausible ending where Riddle is defeated that doesn't involve some kind of deus ex machina.
#+end_quote

Yes, but just because it's difficult doesn't mean you should just give up. I've read probably 10-15 fics that accomplished this exact feat with varying degrees of success. If they can do it so could Rowling.

I'd rather have Harry defeat Voldemort through sheer luck than for him to cheat. Hell, Harry was successful his first 4 years through basically sheer luck alone. Seems to me like Rowling got lazy, and/or bored of Harry Potter.

I think I finally understand what you are saying, but correct me if I'm wrong. You're saying the early worldbuilding is good, and the later world building is not so good. In that respect I agree.

#+begin_quote
  Why don't you think these things are linked here? Magic is key to the stories -- that's what drew in fans, not the faux-Regency boarding school themes or awkward friendship and hardship storylines. An ending to the story that didn't involve Harry somewhere actively using his knowledge of magic and how to be a wizard that he learned along the way was exactly the wrong way to go.
#+end_quote

Yes I agree 100% and that's one of my primary complaints with the series.

#+begin_quote
  That is what the Horcrux hunt was, and to a great extent book six. Magic without reason, agency, and widely without social context. Characters jerked from place to place or emotion to emotion without warning and reason. I seriously doubt that is how JKR planned on the series ending when she finished book one, whatever her later claims.
#+end_quote

That was really well explained, and I couldn't have put it better myself. I can't see any possible way that Rowling intended for the series to end this way.

It's almost insulting. It's like she realized 2/3 of the way through book 5 that she had a huge influence over the fledgling morality of a billion children, and she needed to put in a good message at the end of the book. So she draws up this idea about Snape's redemption and Harry being an all around stand up guy, and then starts filling in the blanks of how the characters are going to get there.

By the time she got to book 7 she was had an oh shit moment when she realized that Harry had to actually defeat Voldemort, and threw in the Deathly Hallows.

#+begin_quote
  In the end, she took out a student-based plotline and focused on a bunch of stuff that didn't make a lot of sense in book four, the one she kept having to replot and rewrite. Then that odd refocus kept on in books five (somewhat) and to a great extent in six and seven.
#+end_quote

I would have no problem with books 6 and 7 moving away from the school life, but like you said, the focus of the story moved away from the magic, and towards fairytales and morality. It got really confusing towards the end. Not in terms of how difficult it was to follow the storyline, but more in terms of why the hell she would write any of these things.

**** I think having Harry be a horcrux was probably one of the worst parts for me, since it was apparently accidental, Voldemort didn't even know Harry was one, and it's used to explain away all the things that make Harry similar to Voldemort. I like the idea that Harry could have been in Slytherin, but he chose Gryffindor, that he was also a parseltongue (maybe because he was marked by Voldemort, not because of the Horcrux, or maybe just because it's magic), they had similar childhoods, etc. Having them mirror each other in some ways makes them more interesting, because Harry chooses to do good things, rather than being great as the Sorting Hat suggests.

The diary being a horcrux seemed fitting to me, since it was clearly something Tom had poured his soul into and it could possess others; if it had only been the diary and the locket, that would have been fine. Harry still would have had the adventure with Dumbledore, found out about Regulus, and Voldemort would've still split his soul into 3 pieces, which would still be a crazy accomplishment. The ring could still have been cursed and slowly killing Dumbledore without it needing to be a horcrux, there could be some other adventures involving the diadem and cup in book 6-7 that give the reader some adventure that includes getting into the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff common rooms or including those characters in the group. I don't know, I just wish they hadn't left Hogwarts for the quest that mostly got them nowhere when there were so many better ways to go about it.

Without a resurrection you could maintain an "annual mystery" storyline with more "magical boarding school" stuff. Basically, stick to the formula of the first 3 books.

Greatly depends on the situation. There are situations in the books where he acts selfless and there are situation when hes a selfish arse that risks destroying friendships. Neither a plus nor a minus.

denarii already wrote about the "bigot" part. He is pretty prejudiced against Slytherins. He tends to label things instantly and be done with the forming of his opinion at that point. The Durmstrangs, for example.

And he is pretty ignorant about many things. But so is the whole Wizard society, so maybe we can give him a break here. Not his fault for being raised that way. Also, I found it to be extremely dumb in the book that the guy who basically refused to learn got good grades. Harry is no exception there. Harry is actually worse on this point, keeping in mind that hes coming from the muggle world. "Oh, I can destroy the laws of physics with a wooden stick.

Then she spends the next 2 books showing why Snape is actually a good guy. I like the idea well enough, but the % that each book is about Snape is way to high. By the time book 7 ended I felt like I'd been duped into thinking I was reading a set of Harry Potter books, when in reality I've been reading the Severus Snape books the whole time. A character that I've hated since I was a kid turns out to be vindicated to the point where Harry names his child after him.

Rowling steadily increases Harry's skill and power through 5 books. Then in book 6 she stops even trying to make Harry more powerful, and instead invents the horocruxes forcing Harry to have to stop his magical development to go after these things. Meanwhile, half the book is about Snape. She even named the fucking book Harry Potter and Severus Snape for fucks sake. At this point, everybody is wondering how the fuck Harry's ever going to be strong enough to defeat the dark lord. Then Rowling is like "Shit I fucked up, there's no way Harry can defeat Voldemort, because I forgot to make him stronger in book 6. What can I introduce in book 7 to fix all this? Oh I know the Deathly Hallows, and then Snape can come in and save the day too. And I'll name Harry's child after him." The day I read book 7 was the day the last remnants of my childhood died. Fuck you JK Rowling, and fuck Severus Snape.

TL;DR: For me, Snape ruined the entire series. Why would you spend 5 books making me hate reading this guy's name and them force me to read 2 entire books about him.
