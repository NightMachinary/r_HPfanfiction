:FlairText: Looking for Recs
:END:
So I've been reading a lot of 7-book rewrite fics lately and as much as I love them (check out Des98 on AO3 and some others) a lot of them aren't finished. Each fic is great by itself but there's not as much emotional payoff since the Big Bad hasn't been defeated or story-lines haven't been finished. Does anyone have any good recs for completed series?

Key things:

- Doesn't have to be 7 fics long and/or follow the exact plot of the books - actually the more original the better. I've read a few that seem to lift entire scenes from the books, and sometimes they're ok, but the better ones go so far as to even have completely different challenges for the Triwizard Tournament, stuff like that. All I care about is having the emotional payoff of the story being wrapped up.
- Really prefer no explicit sexual content, but I know a lot of times that is hard to avoid in the later years/books.
- I am open to Dumbledore Bashing, Weasley Bashing, Good Voldemort, anything like that.
- Not the biggest fan of WBWL (Wrong Boy Who Lived) but if it's really well-written I'll definitely give it a shot. (I can't find it now but there's one where Harry's twin is given all the glory and Harry is barely acknowledged [to the point that his magic was blocked and he only breaks through in 3rd or 4th year and has to be sorted late] and it turns out Sirius had a one-night affair with Lily and somehow she had a child from both him and James [fraternal twins?] so eventually he "adopts" Harry into the Black family. Also features Dark/Grey Harry, "a third side to the war", Slytherin Harry, and the only other stand-out feature I can remember is that after the Triwizard Tournament when Voldeshorts gets rezzed he carves a snake into Harry's face/throat as a brand. I'm sure I'll find it eventually, but it's one of those that isn't tagged that great. If you find it let me know!)

â€‹

That's all I can think of for now. Thanks in advance!

*** Wow this is a super late reply, I do apologize for that. ADHD + Executive Dysfunction = "I'll get to that later" and I never do. As for "the Cupboard series", do you mean this one? [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895]]

It does sound interesting! I'll have to add that to my bookmarks.
