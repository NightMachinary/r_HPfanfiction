So you know how the death eaters are branded slaves? You know how people always make harry heir/lord slytherin and give him the basilisk because "right of conquest" or somesuch bullshit? So since he gets the title and materials can we give him the slaves too?

has it been done yet?


** I thought it has been done. I seem to remember a scene where Malfoy looks at his dark mark and it is changed to be the Potter crest. I'm trying to find this one also. I know it is incomplete though.

  SSHPDM slash. AU from chapter 32 of DH. Harry saves both Snape and Draco in the Shrieking Shack, and bonds them to him, accidentally. He's determined to ignore it. Circumstances may not let him. COMPLETE.

** There's a truly godawful bash-everyone superpowered Harry (honestly quite racist/sexist/homophobic) story of that ilk titled something about Fudge does the Foxtrot to that regard. Mostly it seems like those sorts of stories are sad revenge fantasies where everyone but Harry's a complete idiot.
