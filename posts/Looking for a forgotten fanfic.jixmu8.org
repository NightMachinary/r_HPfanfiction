:END:
Hi!

I read a fanfic from 6-7 years back and have been attempting to find it.

Though I don't remember much, unfortunately, here's what I do remember:

- the story centered around HP and his friends creating a group of vigilantes to take on the Death Eaters (Order of Phoenix did exist but was separate and led by Dumbeldore)
- HP and his friends all used pseudo-names to hide their identities. Whenever they would fight Death Eaters, they would disguise themselves from both Death Eaters and the Order of Phoenix to ensure their identities remained a secret
- Order of Phoenix eventually discovered this group was helping them in the fight against Voldemort but had no idea who they were and assumed it was a group of powerful/unknown vigilantes
- per the story, Harry survived the night Lily Potter sacrificed her life due to a spell and not because of some unknown magic. Harry was later able to replicate this spell in his fight against Voldemort to block the Avada Kedavra (i believe the spell was a golden shield of sorts)
- HP was strong enough in this story to take on Voldemort on equal footing, I believe

I wish I could provide more details of the story to make it easier for others but since it's been so long, I barely remember more than a few details :(.

I would really appreciate any help!

Thank you so much :)
