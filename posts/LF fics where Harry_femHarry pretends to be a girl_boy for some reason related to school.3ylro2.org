  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?

** linkffn(9081608).

It has MoD (fem!)Harry being reborn during the 1940s(?), when Tom Riddle was a young boy. She pretends to be a boy in the story. I would like to warn you, though, that it's almost a guilty pleasure fic.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter
