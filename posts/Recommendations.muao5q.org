any good sirius black or remus lupin daughter fics. I've loved selcouth and The big dipper.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18704896/chapters/44362291][Anaticula]]

My oc is Sirius' daughter but after her mom is tortured to death on the same night when The Potters die Remus and Regulus both raise her together as Remus' daughter. (She's a metamorphmagus so she can change how she looks) and when Sirius breaks out of Azkaban shortly after being imprisoned he uses a Draconic spell to be able to change his appearance to play Remus' cousin and take up his old job in the Ministry. It's adorable how the three co parent this rebellious girl who inherited her short fuse and temper from her parents.

Oh and it's 336k words, if that would put you off.

  The year before she began Hogwarts, when her mother died and the Malfoys took her in, Ariadne Black thought that things couldn't get much worse. She was wrong. Now one friend hates her because of her house, another is missing at all hours of the night, and her father's a murderer. But at least she has the chance to get some answers, right? Now in Year 3. Sirius daughter AU.
