As the title says, how would you escape from Azkaban? I'm assuming they've plugged the blatant animagus loophole somehow (if you want to propose how that might happen, please do!) and that you're (the hypothetical you in this scenario) a decently competent Wizard that's been sentenced to long enough in Azkaban that the dementors will take your mind before you're freed (and yes, the Dementors are still there alongside the human guards). Also assuming that elves can't pop you out. You have any opportunity you like to plan or procure resources beforehand, and any actions can be taken after you're arrested or after you've entered the prison. So... what would you do?

eg. Would you buy a spare wand and swallow it to be used while you're in there? Would you find allies to break you out? Would you get something smuggled into your holding cell while you're awaiting transportation? Do you make a hole in the outer wall and swim for it, or sneak through the actual fortress itself?


** I think getting out of Azkaban would require some outside help, once the animagus loophole is plugged. Frankly, security doesn't seem all that tight - the dementors are the major problem, but outside of that the guards probably don't like to patrol too much or look too deeply (I wouldn't either, if I were in their shoes, near dementors all the time).

In terms of escape, it would also depend on how blatant you want to do it. Trying to sneak out and not be discovered in the process would be much more difficult than to do the same thing with being able to use a patronus and run around letting the guards know in the process.

The avenue I'd be drawn to for sneaking out would be inspired by how Barty Crouch was smuggled out - the easiest would be to have someone important enough come in to visit you with a guest, then have that guest used to somehow replace you and you stroll out with polyjuice. Alternately, smuggling in a wand for you to use, and managing to get the drop on a guard (provided a strong enough grasp of memory spells) could be enough there.

Aspects that make it difficult to plan, from the outside like this, is that I don't think we know all too many aspects of security at Azkaban. Do they have a testing scheme for bodies, to make sure that deceased prisoners are actually who they're supposed to be? Are there methods of catching people leaving/entering who are disilusioned or polyjuiced? What kind of things are confiscated from visitors - and how are they searched in the process?

With one set of restrictions, it might be very easy to smuggle a wand in, transfigure a rock into a copy of yourself, and have it act out very basic movements (just eating and not responding to anything), while you waltz out under a disilusionment spell in the footsteps of a guard who's been freshly memory charmed. With another, maybe you are more forced to overpower a guard and replace him, with the guard replacing your dead body, slain in 'self defense' to make it so that no one would look for you when you move away. Pick a guard with no family, resign under cover of feeling terrible at having had to kill a deranged prisoner, and you're off free afterwards with no one thinking to look for you.

In another, if you don't care about being found out rather quickly, it might be easier to have a metamorphogus or polyjuiced accomplice pretend to be a high ranking auror who needs to take you back to the headquarters for interrogation - and then getting away that way.

I think to get the most exciting and interesting heist details, putting some restrictions/descriptions of how Azkaban is defended/operates would help :)

**** Hmm... Well, I think one set of constraints that would be interesting would be to try to make it as high security as possible. So, hourly patrols by pairs of guards, daily checks within the cells that include anti-polyjuice, anti-disillusionment, and anti-transfiguration protocols. For visitors, they'd have to go through security checks that again check for transfiguration and polyjuice, like Gringotts does with the Thief's downfall, and be searched for their wand/other artifacts. Visitors would also not be allowed to physically enter the cells, and would be watched at all times. Otherwise, spells/enchantments restricting entrance to only the accepted ones that are watched are probably key as well.

I think those restrictions would make it a lot harder for someone to find a way out of it - and it'd be interesting when someone does figure it out!

** Depending on the spell range allowed (on-screen only; on-screen and hinted at; reasonable fanon; fanon unbound), it could be accomplished via enchanting.

*On Azkaban - The revolving door policy*

Because there are both human guards and Dementors on the island, the place has to allow spellcasting - to get a fire going, to cast a Patronus... While most of the staffing is political, the guards are still allowed comforts that the prisoners are denied. This is a weakness, because no one would be pedantic enough to make the anti-magic spells whitelist-only, and that is if one thought to block anything more than known transportation spells. There is always a piece of magic that can slip through. Once, twice, or hundreds of times - I'd made a tidy profit on extractions after vacating that estabilishment. The wardens never noticed, no matter how many times sweeps and cursebreaker visits were organized. The prisoners would still disappear into the night, and their gold would jump right into my pockets.

What that meant for me? I would spend time prior to my incarceration learning enchanting and animation charms. What I'd need is an amphibious trinket capable of stealtily delivering me, and only me, my wand, some chocolate bars or hot chocolate, and warding off dementors while I recover. Since the risk of 'losing my mind exists', I infer I'd be placed in high security area, and that means less than frequent inspections by humans, but a lot of dementors.

I can spell my wand against detection quite easily, and after I'd given it to my Crawler (name pending) it would hide for a few days. If interrogated, I'd say I'd gotten drunk and lost my wand - I don't know where it is. I'd do it too! Best lies contain a bit of truth... Bah! They are constructed almost entirely out of facts! It's how they are arranged that matters. It takes some devious thinking, but I can make people believe most outrageous things - without ever uttering a single falsehood. They actually still remember me for that - I never lie. The part "because I never need to" is usually left out of the reports - all the better for me.

On to the Crawler. It would be for the most part a crab, capable of tracking me (I could give it a drop of blood as an anchor), sticky charms to allow it to climb walls (levitation and the like might be shared by brooms, so adding those was too risky), an expanded storage space (Undetectable Expansion Charm, thank you!), swim quickly (not too hard to do) and avoid detection (notice-me-not, disillusionment, silencing, scent-killing) and some durability, as well as Impervious Charm. Obviously, the legs would be sharp, blades that could destroy by brute force the doors to my cell or the walls if they proved resistant to spells - have to plan ahead.

It would seem as if animating the whole thing was the most difficult thing - nothing more wrong. Animation charms are a part of basic Hogwarts curriculum, and I still possesed my books. Some review never hurt anyone. I'd also seen ole' Minnie McG animate the suits of armor in Hogwarts with a simple Pierotum Locomotor, even granting them a semblance of personality, each. Transfiguration Mstress she might be, but in charms she's just above average - and I am plenty motivated.

In case the Crawler got intercepted somehow - fat chance, but better prepare for any eventuality - a whole lot of cursed trinkets loaded with compulsions would provide me with alternative means of rescue as well as some pretty neat distractions for my inadvertent rescures. A horde of muggles storming King's Cross, Leaky Cauldron, and singing state secrets on national television would throughly take eyes off the North Sea - cold, yes, but so was sending me to that hell.

Finally, the best way of avoiding prison is to never get locked up - if I could't use a Fidelius charm to hide my identity, I certainly could hide my residence - and buy myself much more time. War of attrition is on my side - Ministry doesn't have enough troops to stake out the general area of my residence, and I feel confident against their paper-pushing lackeys. Living in the middle of a busy muggle area was a calculated move.

And that's it! My master plan! I could go into decoys, delaying tactics and more misdirection - but if you're reading this, I am long gone. Both from the country, and possibly from the world of living. My desire to brag, to crow about my triumph over the mightiest minds of my time and their unending hordes of pawns, as well as illustrious Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore, is not so great as to allow anyone see this while they could still act to my detriment.

** I had fun making these. It's free real estate, a bit trippy, a bit crackish but still works - just dramatized and with,a s I said, a crackish tone and some humour.

​

*Escape One : Hard Mode : no friends and only a wand.*

​

If magic is what it's all cracked up to be, I'd have a hidden third secret wand made in another Engand hating country, always inside my left arm - a cut away. It would hurt like hell to get it out and may take several days and a possible loss of my arm, but - details, people. I'll just be fast about it, and silent. Gotta love me a good chewing stick.

After that, it's quite simple - blasting walls, and chewing dementors. Or, more realistically, not being bothered by dementors because my entire life in the wizarding world would be a mess if I were to be stuck in Azkaban.

Let's say that dementors does affect me tho - I need to work fast, so that despair doesn't invade my soul. I probably don't know the patronus charm, because why would I have ever needed it ? It's not like I would want to steal a dragon from fucking Gringotts - wait.\\
Anyway, I'll need to be fast. So, this entire fleeing part of my story will be a shitstorm of massive proportion : "lone fucker decides to flee from Azkaban, blasts walls and guards everywhere with massive prejudice".

The problem : I'm not good enough to defeat both Dementors and tens of guards. The solution : Metal Gear. So, let's say I don't have the magical ability needed to destroy Azkaban. I'll need to be smarter, faster - I'll need to be a snake, and I'll need to be quite solid. But I'm not a snake, and I'm not an animagus. Plus, they're banned from Azkaban (because they're apparently too op and P2W- casuals, the whole of 'em) so that's that.

So I'll need to be discreet, and faster. I assume they regularly make rounds to see if there's everyone. I'll need to make a magical construct that looks like me. An illusion would be enough. After that, it's nothing but smoke and mirror - or better, a spell to make me invisible, and to delete my scent.

So, there. I am out of my cell, the guards believe I'm not, and as I'm walking out to finally feel the cold, salty wind - fuck, Dementors don't see or breathe, they feel the people by their souls. I'm not hidden from them. Back to square one.

Blasting out is not possible, and sneaking away is not possible. I need to be fast, but efficient. Dementors are op, and I'm only level 50. Or maybe 40. What do I do ? Why, it's simple : Let's go back to the "blast this shit off" plan, but with a twist : I now am able to fly. Or I'm not really, but there's a spell to make the floor not kill me when I drop off. Sure, I'm gonna make nightmares about falling to my doom, but I'm not in Azkaban anymore !

Finally, out of the tower. Checkpoint, and I can continue planning. I didn't put a broom in my arse just for the sake of it, because shrinking charms probably affect them. Dementors are already getting to me (they work fast, damn), and the guards have heard several noises - mainly an idiot screaming "BAKURETSU" and an explosion. Yeah, I'd go see what it is to, if I was a guard - can't blame them.

Plan 1 : Ice. Just freeze the water surrounding the island - just little puddles that I would walk on. The problem here is - hehe, boi, ice sinks when you walk on it ! Back to the checkpoint - what do I do ?

Why, I abuse my perk (wand holder) and transfigure some wings, enough to get on one of the rocks surrounding the island, and use several charms to protect my precious life.

Checkpoint. Nobody saw me, dementors weren't in my way - everything is good, and I've escapen the island. Now is something terrible : I'm on a tiny rocks, and just behind me is the most terrible prison of the wizarding world. Dementors would be able to know where I am, so I'm not safe. I need to flee, and fast - but I've got a bit more time, more energy, more sanity.

So I turn a big chunk of rock into a tiny boat, and everything is spelled invisible. And there I go ! I've escaped from Azkaban, nobody can see me, and WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE PEOPLE SHOOTING AT ME ?

So, turns out that the humand guards have this thing called a broom. And Dementors, being the OP little things they are, can straight up fly. If they see little waves, they're going to know I'm here. So what to do ?

The same, but more OUTRAGEOUS of course ! So I make a boat. That can fly. It can't really fly, of course, I'm just pushing it in the air with magic - but here's the idea. Thing is, now my magic is yelling at me, because my reserve isn't infinite.

Anyway, another rock, another stop. I can't see the island now, only the tower that is Azkaban. That's a pretty good win. What to do now ? I'm out of juice, stuck in a bubble, and they could find me with ease.

Well, I'll just have to plan things for now. I am far from the coast, but close to Azkaban. The dementors are forbidden from leaving, so my only enemies are now guards accompanied by dementors. Because guards alone can't see me. That's kinda good, because nobody wants to stick close to a dementor. Except Colonel Jack McShitFace, because he hates me. It's not his real name, but he's dumb, and deserves it.

Speaking of, here's Colonel Jack McShitFace approaching, searching around with his pet dementor that ca feel me. I'm pretty tired, but I've got some energy back, so I do what I can - Self transfiguration is out, because I don't know how to turn myself back. Plus drowning is a real problem.

So, here's an idea. Colonel Jack McShitFace has a broom. He's far, and his only backup is a disgusting freak of nature - the dementor. I just need to hit him with a spell, make him fall into the water, accio the broom, and zoom - I'm free ! Except Jonh McShitFace is really Ron Fucking Weasley, one of the three heroes of the wizarding world and all around pretty good with a wand. So option "make him probably die" is out, because when I'm free, I don't want everyone to look for me - I only angered some goblins, not enough for the people in charge to want me dead or something.

So, let's just summon the guy himself, punch him in the face because let's face it, summoning your opponent is dumb so he won't react, and voila, a stunned Jonh McShitFace ! Now, he's only out cold and not dead, and alone on a rock on the water. But he still has a wand, so he can make magic.\\
Well, only little sparks because I broke it, but he can still be seen !

I have the broom, and nobody to try to bring me back. So, as I fly into the sunset (not really because it's dumb, I'm easily seen if I'm directly in front of the sun. No, I'm going where it's darker), I begin to think - what do I do now ? Sure, I'm free, but - hey, is that an Azkaban guard ?

So that's it, huh. The final showdown. Random Guard number something is behind me, no dementors in sight. Probably a rookie, sure he can be a hero. Well tough luck, because I have the yoink! spell (accio broom) and that allows me to make him fall into the water. I throw his broom into the ocean with him, so that he doesn't die, but he won't follow me. Probably.

This is it. I'm alone, away from Azkaban. So the final step is : I need to make random movements so I'm not seen. And after several hours, there's land ! And I'm in Spain, because why not.

*** *Escape Two : Really Hard Mode : no friends, no wand, only a goblin knife*

What a good dream that was, escaping with a wand ! Except I'm dumb and I only hid this here knife within my body. This time it's not inside my arm, but hidden behind fake skin.

It's enchanted, because why not, and in real life (or was the dream another possibility, another life ? I don't know) I'm not dumb and I'm friend-ish with goblins. By that I mean I bought one of their magical weapons and I promised on my entire fortune they'd be the first to get it when I die.

It's magical through, so it can cut bars ! So here I am, inside Azkaban's icy corridors. Freeing prisoners left and right, to cause mayhem and secure a better chance at escaping. Ah, and here is Malfoy the old one, now dead because frankly, I don't like him. Did I mention my reason from being here ? I challenged Malfoy Junior to a duel after Malfoy Junior Junior decided to bully a kid I liked. Liked as in "as a family friend" you fuckers.\\
And he may or may not now be dead, and purebloods may or may not want me dead too. Junior is dead, I mean. No, I wouldn't kill Junior Junior.

So, mayhem. Violence. Blood. Yay ! Here's Jack McFucker, more commonly known as Ron Weasley - aaaand he didn't see me. Figures he'd want to follow Malfoy Junior Junior.

Did I mention he got arrested for assault ? Didn't surprise me.

So, everyone is fighting everyone, and I steal a wand that was just there, held by a now dead guard. Those fuckin' kill stealers, man, they're everywhere !

This wand allows me to accio a broom, and since everyone is to busy trying to hold back the other prisoners, nobody notices me using the wand to make the guards uniform fits me. Voila ! I'm undetected. Excepth this here dementors look at me, but I try not to look at him.

I'm going outside, screaming "this one is getting out !" and they leave the guy to me. Except there was nobody. So I'm free to use the broom to get out.

And in fact, I'm just free. Yay me, I guess ?

*Escape 3 : Impossible Mode : No nothing, just myself and this here body*

I'll cut this timeline here short : I'm driven to insanity by the dementors, and I die from being fuckin' hungry.

*Failure : Nothing challenge failed !*

​

*Escape 4 : No items Friends only Azkaban Destination*

Hi. I won't say who I am, in case this communication got hijacked. Somehow.

Here's how I escaped from Azkaban.

I was detained because I posted several unkind things about minister Granger and her friend, National Hero Harry Potter. So what if it was actually illegal ? Rita Skeeter did it,and way worse ! And she never got imprisoned ! Why couldn't I do it ?

Anyway, here's the problem : I'm not strong magically. Because I don't have a wand. Logic, ain't it ?

So, the days goes by, and I'm becoming more and more insane. Dementors do that to you. I almost lost hope in my chances of survival, when finally, I heard a voice from the heaven. Except I'm to bad for heaven, so it was probably from below. Purgatory ? Meh.

"Here, grab this, shitface". The voice said. I think. And then, this someone throws me my wand. I can't do many things with it, because, you know, I'm not this magical hero - but whatever. The voice (one of my friends from Hogwarts, a fellow Slytherin who really liked muggle culture so we bonded over that) says that he'll wait for me in the "third rock north from Azkaban". And at this point, the building trembles. The reason ? One of my friend from Hufflepuff doesn't know the word "subtility".

So the "escape like a grown boy" mission becomes a "protect the VIP" mission. Slytherin friend breaks into the cell, and we destroy the door (subtility is also lost on us). Meanwhile, the guards' attention is away, because of our Hufflepuff friend.

We sneak out of the building with no problems, except for dementors. They are everywhere. But there is a problem : as soon as we're outside, dementors surround us from every sides.

As the end draws near (because I can't do a patronus, of course), a voice makes itself clear behind the dementors "Expecto Pztronum !". It's like a crappy fanfiction, where all the friends I made along the way decides "fuck the lax" just to save me. It's one of my friends from Ravenclaw, who learnt the Patronus because it looked cool. (His words)

The Hufflepuff friend comes to us, with four brooms. We escape, with a tight formation to protect every sides - the patronus scaring the dementors until we're far from the island. Until finally, we lay our foot on the land. We are back home !

And then comes Josh, a friend from Gryffindor. Who doesn't cant to fight the law. So he fights us. Did I say a friend from Gryffindor ? No no no, I meant a Wormtail. So the hufflepuff sacrifices himself (read : takes the stunner heads-on) and we in turn defeat the Pettigrew (read : Stun him, strip him, steal all his belongings and throw him in the water after reviving him). We transplane together several times, and finally - I am free !

And then my slytherin friend slaps me, punches me, and proceeds to berate me for the whole day because "I'm a dumbass" and they "warned me not to publish the article". But truth must always be known to the public !

And what if Granger and Potter didn't have an affair ? It was not slander, I was only following my boss' warnings : "make sure we sell more papers for tomorrow's edition, or else !"

/Body count : 0 prisoner, 4 guards)/

*Success : Friends only challenge defeated !*

*Bonus : "Defeat the Pettigrew of the group" completed !*

​

That's it, I could combine them for more whacky fun but that's good enough, and I'm tired. There's several good ideas in the first escape but I just lost everything suddenly and decided "fuck it, let's make it a story" and then I added some crack. Hope you enjoyed anyway ?

** We don't know enough about how the prison works to give a detailed answer, all we know is that it's in the middle of the sea, has walls, cell doors and dementors, along with a warden or maybe a small group of guards.

If I had a wand, I would probably transfigure a hole in the walls, get out, conjure a small boat and that's it.

Without it, could do the old "Call guard into cell door, incapacitate them and get out". Use wand to cast Patronous to cover the escape and use/conjure a boat.

Getting out without a wand or assistance is much harder unless you can get to boat or ferry, cold water is a serious obstacle.

** If you are slightly above average in terms of power, and find a way to get hold of a wand... kill your way out. The Dementors are easy to keep at bay if you can conjure a Patronus, and human security isn't that tight.

Of course, if you go a bit fanon into Azkaban, the place could have magic-binding chains, all sort of wards on the cells made to weaken and disorient you, ways to administer various potions as gas, and who knows what other joyful features. In which case, being broken out by someone outside is your only hope.

** Since we never actually see Azkaban in detail, its hard to know what it would take. However, we know there are three methods that have canonically worked:

Be an animagus, starve yourself enough to slip through the bars, then swim for it.

Have an accomplice trade places with you (sucks to be them).

Have a powerful wizard outside with influence over the guards break you out.

Magic is unlikely to work, as the Dementors create depression which dampens magical ability, and will sense if you leave the cell. They'd also be fools not to have anti-apparition spells on the place.

If I was going to try to smuggle something in, it wouldn't be a wand- it would be a portkey. Once created, they don't seem to require great magic to activate (can be set to leave at a certain time), and can seemingly work through anti-disapparition spells. But the prison might have ways of detecting one.

I would suggest that a contortionist or escape artist with great mental/emotional discipline /might/ be able to replicate Sirius's feat without being an animagus. But it would be a long shot.

Otherwise, you pretty much need a guy on the outside.

** I actually have a head-cannon that most of the half-bloods and purebloods that are sent to Azkaban don't actually stick around enough to serve their sentences. Basically everybody would make something like what Barty Crouch did. Not necessarily with a wife or someone about to die, but like, a muggle under the imperious curse, they could be transfigured/desilusioned/hidden under an invisibility cloak and taken with the family member to Azkaban, them when the family member is with the prisoner they would use polyjuice to make the switch and make sure the person would die (some poison maybe), and them just get out with the ex-prisoner hidden by the same means as the muggle.

The escaped convicted would probably have to stay away of the magical world (for example go to a muggle house in someplace isolated, ward tge hell out, kill or obliviate the owners to forget the place exist), maybe even go to another country and change permanently their appearance, but they would be free and reasonably not insane.
