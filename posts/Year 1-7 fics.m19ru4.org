#+begin_quote
  After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child. For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is. Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
