Like if he is not going back to his original timeline, why does it matter where he came from? Most of the time, its just used to show Harry is powerful and angsty. That can easily be achieved by writing a scene that characterizes Harry as such. And more likely than not, the summary informed us of who Harry is and how he got there already.

So, all in all, it bothers me that there are 10k words before the actually story starts. For me, it just doesn't make sense to include it if its going to save time for the writer and reader.


** Relatively short prologues are fine, but anything longer than that is usually a waste of time, in my experience. And pretty much every scene involving a reaper should be deleted entirely, but that's mostly Reptilia's fault.

Of course, there are always exceptions. linkffn(No Fate by AndrewWolfe) is at 84k words so far, and the time travel is probably still a chapter or two away. But I think the difference is that what he's written so far is a good story on its own, so even if it ended in a twist with the time travel ritual failing and the main characters dieing, it would still be enjoyable.

** The "pre-time-travel" part of the story should serve a few purposes:

1. Show the audience /exactly/ why time-travel is happening. Is there something the character(s) hope to accomplish? What sort of world are they leaving behind?
2. Establish the method of going back - some obscure ritual? An accident in the Time Chamber? The good old Veil of Death?
3. Let the audience know exactly what sort of characters we're dealing with. Does Harry behave as-per-canon if the time-travel is an accident? Is he embittered or desperate if it's a "Voldemort Wins" timeline?

If you can do all of that in a single chapter, by all means. Generally though, I find it takes multiple chapters to establish all of that - which makes the "long pre-amble" you're complaining about not only necessary, but a /good thing/ in many cases.

Of course, if the pre-time-travel chapters have exactly none of that, /then/ they'd be unnecessary and the writer should skip them. I've never seen a story like that though.

*** Most of this can be expressed through context or Harry's thoughts after the time travel. If I'm reading a time travel fic I just usually don't want to read extensive pre travel chapters personally, I agree with OP.

*** A lot of the information that you say is needed can easily be read from the summary. And most of the time, the 1,2,3 isn't novel enough to keep me interested.

All im saying is that a lot of fics can benefit from cutting the jump. Secondly, when the romance is the primary plotline in a story, I'd much rather get to the part with the two characters interacting then whatever is happening before. Also, Harry usually explains where he came from to the person anyhow.

**** I read each story as if I haven't read a million of them, in which case no - the summary, 9 times out of 10, isn't enough if you don't rely on common-trope knowledge.\\
Also, you're supposed to be able to skip the summary most of the time - the summary is the blurb on the back of the book, it's not where all the plot-crucial info goes.

I'm sorry that you seem to be getting burned with Sturgeon's Law when it comes to time travel fics, but the ones I've read, the parts where they're not back in time yet tends to actually be necessary.

When that happens, you're not reading a time travel fic. You're reading a romance that happens to use time-travel as a vehicle for it. And surprise surprise, Sturgeon's Law /especially applies to romance-focused fics/. It's a popular genre to write for newbies, and a bit of a challenge to actually write /well/.

If a time travel fic is bad, it's bad regardless of those few chapters before the time-travel. If a fic is good, it might be /because/ of those few chapters establishing stuff you need to know.

Speak for yourself. I'm sure there are a lot of people who get tired of seeing the same tropes and appreciate novel ideas.

As for your second point

Well if 90 percent of it is crap, and then I make a generalization about the 90 percent who's to say that my generalization was wrong.

You can talk in abstract and say that if written well, it does work. Then I would agree with you, time-travel fics would need a beginning But in this world of HP fanfic where not everything is top-tier, I want the trope to change a bit.

** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is a story where Harry goes back in time to the first war but doesn't go near Hogwarts or his parents. He builds a whole life for himself in the Hogs Head.

So far anyway it's entirely different from the original Harry Potter story. I'm loving it!

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** I have like 25k words before mine, in which Ron travels to first year. And I wouldn't remove them. There are not only characterization, but plot as well. It's still halfway through, but once finished anyone reading it would say the story doesn't make sense without the first 5 chaps.

*** I read and loved your post on the Daily prophet truth thingy, so I have no doubt you're a great writer and have your reasons for doing such.

But a lot of the stories I read don't have plot points structured around the previous time frames. Its just 2000 words on describing Harry going through the veil or him having a conversation with Death after he gets hit with the killing curse. Its like reading Godric Hollow wbwl scenes. Redundant by the 10th time around.

**** I get that, but the fact that you saw some badly written doesn't mean doing it like that is bad. You read some bad because they were written bad, not because the structure is bad. It's just, whenever I see a post like this, I wonder "Would OP have preferred if the books started with Harry arriving at Hogwarts and telling everything else through memories?"

***** Harry Potter doesn't start at Hogwarts because the story isn't about him learning magic. Well, it is, but more importantly its about him escaping a terrible situation and finding acceptance in the world. Similarly, with most HP romances, the overarching plot isn't actually defeating Voldemort and conquering evil but more Harry finding love. Voldemort is just a tool to separate the lovers.

I think our disagreement arises when considering what you read time travels stories for. For me, I'm more interested in the romance than whatever is going on in the background.

So, I think the author's should start with by setting up the romance first. Its why I don't like intros that start with length descriptions of the time travel mechanics. Because I'm much more interested in seeing the character interactions.

I probably should have phrased it better in the title. But I wouldn't have came to this understanding had you not challenge my opinion
