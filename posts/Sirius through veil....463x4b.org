I just realized that I never read any fics where Sirius went to somewhere (AU, crossover, time travel, you understand it) without Harry following and finding him.

Know any?

*** That story was really good. A shame it's abandoned. I would love to read something like that again.

** I'm sure I read one two or three years ago but it was already abandoned. I personally don't think Sirius is a good character for time travel.

  As he stared into the eyes of a grinning, insane, albeit very attractive jester, hoisting a comically intimidating mallet across her shoulders, he realized that he wasn't in the Department of Mysteries, or London, anymore. But he didn't care. Harry checks into the madhouse, and makes himself at home.

** Here is an interesting story

[[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=5117]]

I read it before its pretty good.

Hermione is thrown into a parallel universe where everything is the same but different. While there, she finds another who has suffered the same fate as her, and together they try to find their way back to their home universe. Originally conceived as a gift for nottonyharrison for the GE Fic Exchange 2013.

** I've read a lot of "Sirius escapes the veil" fics with a SBHG pairing. Not sure if you'd be interested in that.
