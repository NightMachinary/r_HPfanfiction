I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry notices stuff and acts sensible instead of clogging his ears and playing chess or goofing with Ron. I'd prefer for it to not be too AU or OP. It could be drabbles and not connected as well. An example of this is Harry finds a way out of the TT or finds out about Pettigrew earlier on in 3rd year and does the sensible thing.

This author likes to bash Ron and replace him with Ginny as Harry's best friend. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], the modified Trio quickly resolved the Sirius situation in Year 3 and finished Voldemort in the Graveyard.
