I really want to write a Grey!Harry fanfiction but I have no idea what would cause him to become that way. I definitely think a 5th year AU is the best place to start. I have plenty of ideas for after whatever turning point in his life makes his morals all skewed but not what causes it. I've tried reading some other Grey!Harry fics but I don't want to steal their ideas and just copy them. Any thoughts? I really need some help here. Ideas or writing prompts would be much appreciated. Thanks.


** He canonically uses Imperio and Crucio, he's already grey.

** I think you need to really clarify to the crystal purity, what you mean by “grey”. Does it mean an understanding that not everything the good guys do is automatically good and vice versa? Does it mean to be independent from both Voldy and the Order? Something about black and white magic (which is both horribly under-conceptualised in the HP canon)? What does it mean exactly?

** I'd assume he'd start going gray once he gets a bit older. Maybe earlier than others because of the stressful Hogwarts years of his life.

** Um, canon? Especially fifth year. I know some people don't like the angst and caps-lock Harry, but I think in this case it's justified. He saw a murder happen in front of him, he was isolated with abusive relatives and no communication with friends, he was slandered in the press, he was tortured by two different teachers (yes, Snape's occlumency lessons were torture) and finally saw a good friend getting mortally injured and his godfather die. All in a single year. It's enough to make a grown man go grey, let alone a teenager.

Another idea is- Sirius still dies and Voldemort escapes, but the Aurors catch the Death Eaters. But at the trials, the Death Eaters are only fined for trespassing instead of imprisoned for being terrorists. So Harry realises that neither the ministry nor Dumbledore's Order are doing anything to stop Voldemort and goes gray. Mind you, I think you will need a new mentor/ teacher/ trainer for Harry if you don't want him to suddenly become op and start killing Death Eaters left and right.

** I imagine it'd be all the stress from finding out his kids are having the same types of adventures he had at their age. Any parent would be sprouting grey hairs over that. /sarcasm.

** Forging the Sword does it by tying Ginny's life to the diary, so that when Harry stabs it, Ginny dies too - and Tom warns Harry of this in advance. But Harry does it anyway, because Ginny would still die if he did nothing, just slower, and then Tom would be fully corporeal and killing people.

** The same thing that turns any man +neutral+ grey. A lust for gold, or power, or maybe they're just born with a heart full of grey.

With enemies you know where they stand but with grey's who knows.

** Harry only has to realize what Voldemort and Death Eaters truly are: Sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums

Then he needs to realize what kind of effort is needed to defeat this kind of scums in our history.

Finally, he needs to realize what ghastly consequences await his loved ones, the British people, and humanity in general, should these monsters ever consolidate their power.

--------------

Once he's clear about these issues, he will know what needs to be done.

** There are so many ways to go about it, really, but one of those I've considered exploring in the past is people that show Harry why fire has to be fought with fire.

Even in canon Harry has all the information available to him, if only he would think things through. Yet he's oblivious to it all or just not mature enough, which is probably much closer to the truth. Seeing how Harry grew up though, it's a bit strange that he goes through his Hogwarts years with major blinders on, a failing that gets him into many sticky situations.

I guess if I were to write a tale featuring a grey!Harry, that's how I would start things off. It doesn't have to be a central figure to the tale. The catalyst could even be some old muggle he meets in a park who talks to him about WW II. There are stories like that already, but the details don't really matter.

I imagine that an adult view of conflict from a person he respects, or at the very least doesn't dislike, could do much to impress upon Harry that not everyone fights wars like 'the Light' does. Once he understands that, he'd also realize that Dumbledore's order wouldn't appeal to him, or get the desired results for that matter, just like he couldn't stomach the Dark side that kowtows to an insane half-blood masquerading as a pure-blood crusader.

That's basically how the many indy!Harry stories started that were so en vogue a decade ago. The only difference I see between indy! and grey!Harry is the lengths he's willing to go to. Personally speaking I always loved a good yarn about a Harry that is willing to kill, yet still feels each action and works hard to overcome the emotional scars he gains.

** I think you could start quite early, around 8 yrs old or before.

You could have him mostly a normal child, wanting to be friends with other children and trying to get kudos from teachers, etc. [Light]

But Dudley and gang are there. Harry can learn that the only way to live is to smash them down however hard is needed to let him live his life. He doesn't have to hate them, just be willing to use as much force as necessary to keep them from interfering in his life. [Gray]

As for what force he uses, accidental magic might be weaponized (seen a few fics like this, having him realize strong emotions can trigger it]. Of if you want to go further out you could have the Scar-Horcrux somehow influence him, to make use of magic like Tom did at the orphanage, but maybe only when Harry feels badly picked on.
