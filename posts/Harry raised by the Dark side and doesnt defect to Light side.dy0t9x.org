Looking for any well written fics where Harry is raised by the dark side or voldemort and does not turn his back on everything hes known just because he meets his parents or gets captured by the light. Would prefer if the fic is Not Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny or Harry/Daphne or Harry/Draco.

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.
