ok so metamorphs can change their genetic makeup we know this because the can change their features so could a metamorph change their entire DNA to copy someone else's using this would it be possible to use someone else's wand or rob Gringotts thoughts?


** I think it's mostly a magical thing not a DNA thing, I always thought that a Metamorphmagus could only resemble people if they really took a good look at their features and then changed them according to memory and that unlike a polyjuice potion they weren't perfect in mirroring a person's looks if they weren't really good at remembering what people looked like. So in my headcanon, an artist for example who draws people/makes statues would be way more effective in matching their appearance to the person they want to resemble as someone who has a bad time memorizing what people look like.

** That would mean that they couldn't change back anymore since they would have lost the Metamorphmagus gene.

*** Not if the ability is stored in your magic rather than genes (like “magical DNA”)

** Magic and science don't really mix. There's no proof metamorphmagi change their genes. Even muggles can change their appearance with makeup, hair dye, surgery, etc, with no change to their genes. I imagine metamorphmagus power just doing that sort of thing but magically.
