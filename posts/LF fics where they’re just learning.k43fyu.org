I'd like some stories where there's no big bad and Harry's just growing up, learning, and falling in love. He doesn't even have to fall in love now that I think about it.


** That sounds very much like linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). It's entering seventh year now, and Voldemort is a minor nuisance, but there's lots of magic and plenty of laughs.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
