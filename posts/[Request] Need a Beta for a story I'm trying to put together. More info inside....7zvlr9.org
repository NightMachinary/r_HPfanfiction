Hi all. I have what I think is a brilliant story idea. I have the whole story plotted out, and ready to write, however I have come across a problem. I really struggle to write conversations. I'm looking for a beta who can go through my chapters as i write them and smooth out the conversations and possibly some of the story if I haven't written it out properly. My story is basically: After 5th year. Harry gets left alone at Privet drive. He discovers infomercials and orders some self help tapes to help him deal with Sirius death, and his lack of self worth. Basically he learns some things during his summer holidays, and starts basically saying to himself "Fook it" and doing things he wouldn't normally do. Punching Malfoy out, kissing girls. Road trips and tattoos. This will be a light hearted story. Including the death of Voldie. No Horcruxes. If any one can assist me, or would like to know more, please PM me.
