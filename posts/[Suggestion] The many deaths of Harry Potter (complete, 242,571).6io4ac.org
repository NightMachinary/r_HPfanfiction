Hey! I just finished this after finding it buried in one of the old recommendation threads and I thought I'd bring it to new light! I really enjoyed it (especially because I haven't read it before.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many deaths of Harry Potter]]

Edit* On request a brief description

Whenever Harry dies he resets to the last important event in his life, as such he develops a rather potent fear of death (it's painful and terrifying.) He shares the Dursley's hatred of the Wizarding world because he's been hunted his whole life and as such develops into a paranoid bastard who feels trapped by his own fame. I won't spoiler, but he's got plenty of deadly challenges coming his way.

** Jared, there's something you need to know.

When you put in your title, 'The many deaths of Harry Potter (complete, 242,571), it doesn't sound like the total number of words in the fic, it sounds like the total number of times Harry has died.

I can't even imagine a fic where Harry dies 242,571 times...unless it involved an alternate dimension full of Harry Potters.

Harry Potter and Harry Potter neglecting Harry Potter after his parents Harry Potter and Harry Potter were killed by the dark lord Pyjamas the Terror. Or, you know, maybe Harry Potter would just be the name of their particular species. /Homo sapiens scarheadus/, anyone?

** Yep, would recommend. I can see the point some are making in that Harry doesnt abuse his power of resurrection (after dying he comes back an indeterminate number of days previous) but I can also see the point that he is in school and finds it ridiculously boring to have to relive stuff over and over so doesn't do it willingly.

He also doesn't know why he's resurrecting so has no guarantees on it happening again.

*** Exactly! If he had no guarantee he would live, why kill himself?

*** There were also a few rather serous IdiotBalls early in the story. E.g. him getting pissed at Quirrelmort and essentially acting out a suicide-by-adult-wizard during a class. And him not intentionally killing himself right after something bad happen to reset and reverse that bad thing.

Still, this story has been completed very quickly --- I think when I've stumbled upon it the last time it was only several months ago, and back then the story was only at chapter ~30.
