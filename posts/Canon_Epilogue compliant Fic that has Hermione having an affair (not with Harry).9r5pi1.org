So, it should be definetly after Hogwarts and somewhere around the 19 years or after them. Hermione Loves her Children and Family, but maybe due to her current situation with Ron, she feels down or neglected. At some time she meets a Man (i have imagined it to be Malfoy, but in fact it can be any other one) and has a Affair with him (either a long time or just a one-night stand) and discovers, that she might be pregnant, because the sign seem positive.

I will leave it to the Author, if the Pregnancy is real or just "false alarm". I would accept both


** Here's a Dramione that's Cursed Child compliant, idk about the pregnancy part though linkao3(8143739)

These two are my favorite (and probably two of the most popular) Epilogue Compliant Dramiones linkffn(7711642) linkffn(7711642) Edit: The one not showing up with the bot is The Deadline by Lena Phoria

  COMPLETE. DRAMIONE.Ten years have passed since Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Draco found themselves in an unlikely team-up. In that time, friendships have grown, marriages have crumbled, the next generation has grown up, and family dynamics are stretched. The story begins with a celebration where a few drinks give friends the courage to confess their long harbored feelings for each other. Visions of the past spanning almost forty years reveal how many events lead to this moment.Post-Canon, flashbacks to Hogwarts era, post-war, and post-CC/start of this story. Reading of Cursed Child not necessary.

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.
