:END:
This is a story from a few years ago. The premise is that he ends up in Forks and Edward turns out to be his mate. Harry also becomes friends with Jacob and manages to unite the two groups. Harry also goes by a different name in the fanfic. One part is that he's still developing his elf powers and there's a scene where he's picking his staff from a tree. He's considered to be young by elf ages. I think the name Jonquin is in the story somewhere.
