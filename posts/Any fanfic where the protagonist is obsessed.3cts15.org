i.e Equal and opossite for instance where Harry becomes obsessed and pushes himself to get what he wants.

Any fandom will do tough if they have such a obsessed protagonist.

thank you


** Eh. Had enough of that reading HBP where Harry stalks Malfoy like an obsessed fangirl.

*** To be fair, Harry /was/ right about Malfoy and was trying to save lives the only way he could. He actually went to the "authorities" for once, at least within the Order, and no one took him seriously. So he did what he could to get solid evidence.

** linkffn(The Weapon Revised by GwendolynnFiction) is the first that comes to mind.

Also, I did one called linkffn(Hallows and Pathos by Perspicacity). The obsessed person is Hermione.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
