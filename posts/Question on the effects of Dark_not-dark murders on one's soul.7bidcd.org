So, we've all heard that +stupid+ weird argument that "There is no dark magic, and you can use a "light" spell to kill, so it's all ok" (not literal, can't remember the exact words of it)

But that makes me wonder, does every murder fractures the soul? Can you create a horcrux by killing someone with an /accio/, or a /wingardium leviosa/.

It's known that dark magic corrupts / is addictive, but can a wizard's soul/brain/essence suffer from using non-dark magic for killing purposes?


** Euthanasia with Avada Kedavra was definitely ok in JKR's world, as the case with Snape showed.

Molly's killing of Bellatrix also showed that killing in self defense and protection of innocents was ok.

There had to be more steps involved in Horcrux creation beyond the act of murder. At least the ritual mutilation of one's own soul was necessary.

That was why Voldemort was totally fucked beyond eternity. I think even Bellatrix's soul would eventually move on after serving enough time in the purgatory.

** We don't actually know how Horcruxes are created (It's one of the last things JKR has yet to ruin with fanservice). However, magic itself is all about the symbolism. Murder is a monstrous act. For Draco to do it, it would rip his soul apart. However, if Snape were to do it, he might not suffer so, as he would be putting an old man out of his misery and saving him from torment. So, it's not necessarily just about the spell itself, but rather how and why the act was done. So, with that in mind, murdering someone by levitating a rock and brutally smashing them to a pulp with it until they're dead might qualify. All the (theoretical) hatred required to cast the killing curse is probably why it works with horcrux creation

*** (AFAIK) it requires a murder, right? Killing accidentally is not enough. (I was going to say "Manslaughter is not enough", and checking on wikipedia, the term manslaughter is said to have first been made by the Ancient Athenian lawmaker /Draco/ in the 7th century BC.)

On the second point, could you get corrupted by a non-dark kill? and what /is/ corrupted? One's soul? Are a wizard's thoughts more dark-oriented once you use dark magic? I assume that Mind and Soul are not the same.

**** It's less corruption and more addiction, I think. And you can get addicted to just about anything. Dark magic, at least in the case of the Unforgivables, requires pure intent to harm, control, or kill. This is most easily accomplished with hatred. It is very easy to become emotionally addicted to such things, especially when it yields the results you want. Then you not only have the raw caustic hatred of another person in your veins, you also have the high of success and righteousness. It's a very potent mix.

** I would think that alot of what the basis for whether your soul would get broken after committing a murder would depend on the reason your killing some one and the feeling behind it. So say if you kill somebody who came at you try to kill you if you went into the confrontation planing the murder or if your happy about it I think that it could split your soul but if it was not your intention to cause harm and you were just try to survive your soul probably would not split. In the end I don't think it matters whether the spell is light or dark just about the intentions of the caster.

*** I second that. It also ties really well with the "remorse is antihorcrux" thing.

** For me, "Dark Magic" is a catch-all term for magic designed to harm others --- it's not at all okay to use it, though, of course. In my headcanon, killing out of hatred (as opposed to noble causes) is what puts a strain on the soul. The Killing Curse is particularly damaging to the soul as it harnesses the feeling itself and amplifies it as the basis of the spell, so a Killing Curse murder is better fuel for a Horcrux; on the other hand, there's no difference between killing someone with /Sectumsempra/ or with /Wingardium Levisoa/, as long as you /meant/ to kill them with the appropriately destructive mindset.
