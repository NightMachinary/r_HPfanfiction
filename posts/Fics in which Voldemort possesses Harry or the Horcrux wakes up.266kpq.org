I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7343470/1/Never-Alone-Unfortunately][Never Alone, Unfortunately]], and in some scenes Voldemort takes control of Harry's body. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running][Hit the Ground Running]] is an excellent one in which the Horcrux wakes up.

Anyone know of any more fics where that happens? Any genre is okay, especially HPLV. :D I absolutely love when they argue in Harry's head and other people think he's nuts.


** Here's a Harry/Hermione story dealing with the horcrux being incorporated into Harry, plus bonus Ravenclaw's Diadem action: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9028035/1/Dirty-Little-Witch][Dirty Little Witch]] By Azrael38

  It's the summer after 5th year and Harry is not a happy camper. With his godfather dead, Harry has nobody left to turn to. Except one. One who has been with him since the beginning...

Rated M, a good deal of sex, but nevertheless enjoyable. I rather wish someone would write a longer fic with the same concept.

*** these kinds of fics always bug me. Favorite pairing check, plot - check, smut - check... then the leads become so evil that it's impossible to root for them and one can only hope someone kills them soon.

** Is there any recommendation for a fic like this w/o the pairing. I find HP/LV kind of icky

*** The second fic I mentioned, "Hit the Ground Running," has no pairings, as it's in Harry's first year.

*** I am halfway through this one, and it seems good. Only obvious effect of the Horcrux combining with Harry's soul is magical power surges (so far).

** I'm currently rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness.]]

/Through an accident Harry and Voldemort's Horcrux begin to interact and Harry slowly begins to change. He becomes stronger & slowly grows aware of the sinister events that have perpetuated his entire life. Dark!Harry eventual LV/HP SLASH/

Harry becomes truly dark and pretty evil through out the story. It has a sequel that is abandoned though.

**** It's really good.

I'm at the stage in my fiction reading timeline where I think I have literally read everything that is anywhere close to good.

I'm always looking for new stories but I feel like it's so difficult to find good fiction anymore.

The only pairing that I don't hate that I haven't read yet is Harry/Voldemort. If you have any recs, send them my way!

** If you haven't read it, check out The Semblance of Peace by Maeglin Yedi [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=13313]]

Summary Voldemort is finally dead, or so the wizarding world believes. Unfortunately, Harry knows better. HP/LV, HP/TR, HP/LV/SS.

One of my all-time favorites & sounds like the type of story you're looking for.

*** I just read it, thanks for the rec! It really has some great lines in it, very enjoyable. Could have done without the SS in there, but it was good nevertheless.
