** There's linkffn(Music Beneath The Mountains by lomonaaren) where he was raised by goblins, considers himself a goblin, and has their respect because he worked hard in goblin school and is considered a promising young goblin.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

** In linkffn(To Become a Muggle by lifebitten), he earns the respect of the goblins for his pain threshold, in large part, but also for his other accomplishments and his reasons for wanting to give up magic.

I've read another one in which he gains their respect once they find out about the basilisk, but I don't remember the name of that one.
