*** Fanfiction just needs to detach itself from this stupid color-coding habit. There are way too many - interesting - shades of grey. Especially when we're talking about Hermione, there are so many interesting directions to take her character in when focusing on ruthlessness or maybe her disillusionment with the System leading to her taking a more direct approach in changing government. There's way more potential for darkness there than immediately jumping to murder and torture.

I think most authors are probably too young, for them 'dark' is just a cool edgy label... like a coat of paint. In some ways that's okay, because I really don't want to read stories with homicidal maniacs like Voldemort as Protagonists, but when your supposedly 'dark' characters are essentially just goth teenagers seeking attention it's kinda sad.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** Any story that includes Powerful!Harry in it. In all honesty, they turn magic into this odd thing, Duelling for him consists of Three Spells the Author came up with, a Protego shield that suddenly blocks Killing Curses due to his Alchemical Research on the Philosopher's stone, and any spells that do threaten to hit him because "his magical core is drained" misses him. It doesn't explore magic, it doesn't make him powerful in a believable way compared to titans like Dumbledore and Voldemort, he's just powerful because the author says so (and he read a lot of books, which I don't understand how that correlates with magical power, but it does). Yet, I still fall for it every time, I always click on it, and read at least five chapters in. What is wrong with me?

**** 1) reading books gives you versatility, comprehension and in some cases power. That said, the majority of power comes from casting spells very, very often. I'm not talking training montage, but someone who devotes an extra 3 hours a day to casting will kick their entire year's ass. A Ravenclaw will always immediately buy all 7 years of books and probably read through two years per year.

2) an expanded trunk is genuinely more useful than any other (common) magical object. From carrying your entire library to smuggling cocaine/weapons in the muggle world. Hell, there's no specific reason you can't live in one as Moody obviously was forced to do.

3) in general I don't think wands have much power except as a conductor/focus. A first year the the elder wand shouldn't be any more awesome than his classmates. However, if someone is immensely powerful, and I believe there was a fic that did this, you can actually set fire to a wand by using too much power through it. Using a wand with multiple cores because you have to /otherwise they explode/ does make sense. Admittedly this does have the combat downside that IF you were disarmed and grabbed someone else's wand, it wouldn't be any use to you.

Personally, I like the powerful Harry ones (obviously), but I certainly feel cheated when it seems like he's powerful because of chosen one crap instead of him putting in way more effort than anybody else to BE that powerful.

Cho Chang showed no real talent during the DA, neither did her Friend. And they seemed to take the lessons seriously. So, no, reading books doesn't automatically mean that you're one of the better wizards in your year. Just like being Ravenclaw doesn't mean that you're automatically smart, if I recall correctly most of the time Ravenclaw is characterised by Creativity, more than a general thirst for knowledge.

Except, Moody needed it because he was an Auror, Harry has no real use for an expanded Trunk. Snape keeps all their potion's supplies, their books/quills/paper are in their bags (as shown when Harry diffindo'd Cedric's bag), unless you have such an excess of books that you need to store them in a house, students don't really need a Gigantic Trunk with multiple compartments, usually people use them for their jobs, Newt and Moody being the prime examples.

That's where Canon seems to disagree with you, as Ollivander himself describes wands themselves as powerful. First when he was describing James' wand, then when he described Voldemort's wand. I think that wands both channel, focus, and amplify magical energy. But power, versatility, consistency, and certain leanings towards magics are all unique to the wand, and in turn, who it chooses, that is the whole point of having Wands. Otherwise, everything written about Wands on Pottermore and in the books are a lie.

That's a fair point, but also remember that there has to be some idea of balance in the world. You can't simply have Ravenclaw always be better at classwork. Hell, the older Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs aren't even named through most of the books.

Well let's be fair here. What does Draco Malfoy's trunk look like? Harry's best friends are the poorest boy ever and a muggleborn, of course they're not going to have nice stuff. Sure, they might not NEED the space, but who, that can afford it, wouldn't want extra space? Also, they don't seem to wear out, so why wouldn't a parent buy one for their child that they'll use in later life?

I avoid Pottermore and have forgotten a decent portion of the books by now. There are some things that fanfiction simply does better, including basically all of books 5, 6 and 7. Ollivander is naturally going to describe wands as powerful, he makes them. He's going to make things sound more impressive because otherwise his job is horribly boring. Also, a magnifying glass can be powerful. With regards to the leaning toward branches of magic though... if the wand is a reflection of the wizard, is it really the wand that's good at transfiguration? or is a wand made for transfiguration picking someone with an innate talent for transfiguration.

#+end_quote

But he doesn't describe all wands as such. He calls Harry's 'Nice and Supple', Lily's 'Good for Charms work', yet he says that James chose a wand with a little more 'oompf' to it. Likely referring to it being naturally more powerful. Then after he talks about Voldemort's wand for a bit, he describes it as 'Very Powerful'.

#+end_quote

I like to think, both. I assume that "Good at Transfiguration" might refer to how fast your transfigurations happen, maybe how easily the wand responds to your imagination for the subject, etc...
