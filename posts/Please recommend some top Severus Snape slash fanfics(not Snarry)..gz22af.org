I hope the fanfics are light-hearted rather than grave or solemn.And any paring except Snarry is OK. Besides, is there any website focusing on Snape centric slash fanfics?

** You can look through older fic request threads on [[/r/hpslashfic]] for more recs for Snape slash, or you can go on AO3 and filter by your preferred pairing and then sort by completion status and number of kudos to get some solid recs that way. I don't know of any websites that are just for Snape slash that aren't Snarry sites
