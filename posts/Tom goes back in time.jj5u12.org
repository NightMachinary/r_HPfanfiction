I have seen harry amd heromine go back in time, but rarely see tom/voldermort go back in time to right his wrongs to be a better dark lord or to stop himself from being a dark lord


** I remember reading one fic where during the final battle when voldie dies, he talks to Death and realizes all the shit he's been doing has been making him insane and it wasn't worth it and Death gave him a chance to go back to the graveyard scene in book 4 and become a bit sane again with his knowledge. Harry is sent back to then as well, but with more years after the final battle (where there was a large war with the muggles) and then Snape got sent back but he was sent back several months after the graveyard scene but with even more years than Harry after the final battle. It was a pretty good fic, but it doesn't go back that far in time
