I just finished Emperor and would love to read fanfiction (from any universe) that has a story as grand and expansive as Emperor is.


** Emperor is one-of-a-kind, I think. But in terms of "grand and expansive", /nothing/ beats the Hero trilogy - linkffn(Sword of the Hero), when you get to the second book.

Nothing even comes /close/.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

*** I'll get to reading it.

I've avoided the Hero Trilogy it since I read in one of the author notes for /Wastelands of Time/ Joe stated that he wrote the Hero trilogy when he was much younger and it was somewhat "subpar" in comparison to his other works. But since it was written by Joe, something he considers "subpar" is better than a significant amount of other fanfiction.

**** It has its flaws to be sure, but it's probably the most epic FF I've ever read, and that includes the Marquis Black ones. Hope you enjoy!

**** Indeed. Joe was a phenomenal writer, even then, it seems. While you can identify some parts of the Hero trilogy that are less mature than the Wastelands, it's still amazing, and outdoes most existing HP fanfiction.

On top of that, I have looked hard over the past few years and not found a single fic that has the sheer scale and sense of "epic" that the Hero trilogy does. It's very well written, especially the second book.
