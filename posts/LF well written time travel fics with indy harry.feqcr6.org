preferably relatively recent and completed, no preference for pairing and got nothing against bashing as long as it's not over the top


** linkffn(Faery Heroes) has most of that. The bashing gets a little over the top at times, and it's not that recent...

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
