Maybe he stops the Marauders from pranking the Slytherins, maybe he realizes that Snape comes from an abusive family and tries to save him. Maybe he destroys the Horcruxes once he hears the Prophecy, maybe he does what he can to stop the corruption in the Ministry, et cetra.

Taking a more active role in general, then what he did in canon, is what I'm looking for.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be set in any Era.

Would love for it to be completed, but if not that's fine.

** There's linkffn(Albus Dumbledore's next great adventure), which places the AD you describe into an AU with the classic "manipulative" one.
