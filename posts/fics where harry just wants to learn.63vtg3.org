you know like a scholar a learner an I try to learn not fight dark lords seven times my age thank you very much that is not my job. you know a Ravenclaw harry where he is actually a Ravenclaw. instead of running headfirst into fights with mage god hiding behind a rock and using a breast enlargement spell followed by a diffindo or reducto or some random obscure spell he found/made. where harry does research on things that won't get him better grades or destroy dark lords like alchemy or even fucking potions. I'm just tired of all the "Ravenclaw!Harry" and "Smart!Harry" when he keeps jumping into impossible fights and treating them like schoolyard scuffles.

** lnkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) kind of fits your criteria, though he does end up fighting Voldemort. Though I haven't read it, I believe linkffn(The Art of Self Fashioning) is also like this.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
