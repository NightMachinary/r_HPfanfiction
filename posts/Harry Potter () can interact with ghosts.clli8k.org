Harry or another male main character is able to interact with ghosts. I remember him shaving off the final bit of skin off of Nearly Headless Nick's neck, allowing him to join the headless hunt. Don't remember much else.

Thanks!


** I believe it is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse by HunterBerserkerWolf)

Decent fic, but it has the misfortune of using the whole 'magical cores' thing. It also seems to be abandoned. Cheers

Ninja Edit: Despite using magical cores (and boy does it use them) this fic has some awesome fight scenes and some really cool magical artifacts. It is worth the read I think.
