I just thought about Harry nicking Dudley's cigarettes, trying them for himself after the Tournament, and using that as his main coping mechanism.

He doesn't show it off, he'll sneak off under his invisibility cloak to smoke somewhere secluded. Its gets bad fast, especially during fifth year. Thankfully wizards created a potion to keep lungs healthy ages ago, but his body shows the signs.

Ron and especially Hermione are worried, they can see the pallor of his skin and he seems much worse than the last year.

It goes on until he beats Voldemort, and Harry thinks he might be able to quit. His friends had found out from the camping trip from hell that he smoked, and Hermione looked sick to her stomach. She'd left it alone because taking away a coping mech in this situation was a bad idea.

But when his PTSD began to rear its ugly head, he fell right back on his crutch. That is, until he went to therapy when Hermione found out he'd been doing it. But he tried, if not because he would be a father soon, then for himself.

Idk, just a sad idea, do what you will. (Ps, you can pry good father Harry from my cold, iron deficit hands.)


** Harry turning to substance abuse due to all the stress could make a really heavy Tragedy story.

*** "GIve me that Harry, you've had enough"

"You want me to give you my "wand". That's no way to ask."

"Oh fuck off with your bullshit, Harry. That's no wand and you know it. I saw you smuggling Death Sticks into the common room!"
