:END:
I read a short fic a while back and can't remember the name. It has Harry working as an auror for a while and things break off with Ginny. He starts travelling for work and eventually meets Gabrielle Delacour in France. They have a fling on and then it breaks off. He ends up as a teacher and then headmaster as Hogwarts and just stops aging. Not a long fic but I quite enjoyed it and wanted to recommend to a friend!

One of my favourite fics
