But I strongly would belive while tom riddle might have had sexual urges he would have considered them a weakness. and on his path to full voldemort would have tried to remove it so he was not like everyone else.

My view point is voldemort, if he had a sex drive would consider sex beneath him and something lesser beings do, he has no need to procreate for he is eternal and who could be worthy of him.\\

Yeah that would suck. But it's very unlikely and the animagus process /is/ noted as being dangerous.

Also St Mungo's might be able to deal with that. Your buddy apparates you to the hospital. Maybe turns you into a brick to stall the damage.
