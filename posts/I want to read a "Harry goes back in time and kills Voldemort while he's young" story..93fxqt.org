Mainly because I want to see if its ever been done. All I can find is harry adopting him.


** Harry goes back in time to kill 5th year Tom Riddle in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]]. It has great battle scenes and some dark humor.

I'm surprised adoption stories are the only ones you have seen. Another common trope is for Harry to end up as Tom's brother, growing up with him at the orphanage. Some examples of that:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369108/1/White-Innocence][White Innocense]]

The most unique (and disturbing) fic I've ever read in the "Harry goes back to young Tom" genre is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5661371/1/The-Abyss][The Abyss]]. It's the Harry Potter fanfic equivalent of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita][Lolita]]/.

*** Really ? My experience is pretty much the same as OPs. Found lots of adoption stuff, never heard about Harry and Tom being siblings

**** I'm on a binge reading every fic on FFN that's tagged with "Voldemort" going from most favs to least. So far the 'Harry & Tom as siblings' fics seem to be roughly as common as the 'Harry raises Tom' fics. I don't want to sidetrack OP's thread, but are there any adoption fics that stand out as exemplary in your opinion?

***** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6715591]]; [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057]])

Whats up with the bot ? In my opinion Boy who lived by Megii of Mysteri OusStranger and Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord were pretty nice (its been quite a while since i read them though, no guarantees)

**** Besides those two, I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] (40 chapters, dead). Rather than time travel, Harry starts out as a boy born in the same orphanage as Tom Riddle. They grow up together (eventual slash). After Harry dies in the wizarding war he reincarnates as the son of James and Lilly. It's an example of necromancer!Harry.

** Not exactly what you want but certainly fits the spirit of things.

linkffn(The last dinosaur's roar by IP82)

Since the bot is out to lunch I'll post the summary:

PostDH. ONESHOT. Harry sets himself on one last desperate quest to prevent the apocalyptic future. But will he have the guts to do what needs to be done, for the greater good? Dark!Harry

Spoiler: One really cool thing this fic does is what Harry does to Albus. Ariana dies, but Harry manipulates it in a way such that rather than hate Gellert, his ire is directed towards muggles, making the wizarding world much different.

Very solid read.

** You may like Altered Destinies by DobbyElflord linkffn(3155057) it doesn't quite fit, but you might enjoy it. It is technically finished, but there is a sequel that is still unfinished. Not sure if it's abandoned or not, but I thought it coulda been really good.

link cause ffbot is down I thkn [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]].
