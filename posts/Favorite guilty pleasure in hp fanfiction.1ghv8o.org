As opposed to things that make you grind your teeth, what makes you secretly excited when you see it in a fanfic?

I have a soft spot for strong Harry, inheritance fics, as well as Hermione and McGonagall hurt/comfort romance fics.


** Time Travel. They are amazing. Even though most start off with the ridiculous potion-spilling-on-Harry, time travel is too cool a thing to not read.

*** Time travel is great because it is an incredibly honest way to write fanfiction. The narrative exists explicitly to fix the original story, while the characters themselves are conscious of it. Good time travel fics are always fun to read.

Any specifics you would recommend? I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783428/1/The-End-and-the-Beginning][The End and the Beginning]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past][Harry Potter and Future's Past]] myself.

** Abused!Harry. But in general I love angsty fics, they're addictive, as long as they're written reasonably well.

*** I hate to say... but me too. It's strange, but I think I like it because I enjoy action and, like someone else said, the vulnerability of it all. Plus, I think it's often (if done well) a more realistic depiction of what Harry probably faced at times at the hands of the Dursleys. Honestly, sometimes I felt like JKR downplayed their brutality, particularly Uncle Vernon.

I know it was a children's series, especially in the beginning, but I still feel like there had to've been more going on than just emotional abuse and neglect.... Maybe that's just me.

**** I agree to this, and while I think the 1st-3rd books are great for kids to read, they need a more mature mindset for 4th-7th. (Especialy 7) Because JK had the books grow with the readers.

I think she could rewrite the 1st-3rd books for more mature readers and up the content of the obvious abuse done.

Your not alone.

***** Yeah, definitely. I don't think it would hurt to revisit the books in a couple of years and maybe re-release them. And I'm sure there are some plotholes that she's noticed by now.

****** Yeah, and things that she could have done with the people, while leading to the same ending, that would have made it a lot more epic of a series for older/able to handle it, people.

**** Oh god the pressure! Um, quite often I just read trashy ones to get my fil and then forget about them, some of the ones I have been able to find are [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2271468/1/The-Problem-With-Cupboards][The Problem With Cupboards]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal_Harry][Brutal Harry]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3164465/1/Shame][Shame]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6066769/1/Identification][Identification]], sorry it's not a lot, and I'm not all that sure of their quality either. If you want more I find that the communities are a great place to look because it sort of allows you to narrow down what you want by themes etc. and their popularity.

****** Oh, sorry! I'd tried to find ones that were mainly just Harry. I know what it's like when you like the plot and the characterisation but not the pairing. I totally get what you mean about the vulnerability thing, but I do love it when Harry's abused and then either becomes a BAMF or when his abuse is revealed and then the Dumbledore bashing begins. I'm a bad person.

** Fem!Harry and H/Hr romance fics. It's just such a cliche set of preferences.... but I cannot get enough of them.

Example: "Yeah, nonjon's stuff is awesome /dammit portkey, load that fic already!/"

Also, Harry/Ginny when Harry's a girl - because girl!Harry totally tops the fangirl. Male Harry and Ginny? Meh. Female Harry and Ginny? Holy balls.

I shall forever deny having mentioned this, by the way.
