'The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.'

Harry Potter - Rated: K+ - English - Drama - Chapters: 1 - Words: 27,424 - Reviews: 85 - Published: 6-22-11 - Amelia B. - Complete

It's listed as Drama but it's very much about Crimes and Law-enforcement. A muggle is killed in the midst of a magical crime and the Aurors cover up the evidence, but the victim's sister seeks justice for his death from a society that regards her as little more than an unruly pet.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]]. It's a Noir-esque mystery/crime-drama set post-DH with Harry as an auror investigating a murder.

** If you haven't read Silens Cursor's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6815334/1/Case-129][Case 129]], you really should. It's short, complete, and... well, just read it.
