Any recs? Needs strong world building, and good writing.


** Are you asking for AO3 stories, or ones that aren't on any major sites? I don't read AO3 much, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has some great dry humour and an excellent Snape redemption arc.

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past was on FFN but was recently taken down for bogus reasons. It's not so much world building, but IMO it does a wonderful job of fleshing out some of the people who were side characters in canon. Ginny and Neville and Luna are right in the thick of things all along, and there's a lot more time in the Weasley home.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

***** It's not abandoned! But Matthew (the author) has/had a medical condition that left him needing 24/7 care; he's still recovering. His wife posts updates on his recovery in a facebook group named Viridian Dreams.

He was going in/out of hospital a few years ago and I think is relearning(?) to stand and walk with aid

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

  When Voldemort had Cedric Diggory killed, he said this: kill the spare. Hannah heard it whispered in the hallways, too, right behind "sheep" and "not smart/not brave/not cunning" and simply "Puff." Potions with Snape was always a treat. He hated Harry Potter, but the black and yellow earned his disdain. Even Flitwick sometimes sighed when Justin Finch-Fletchley just couldn't quite figure out a charm. And Hannah, in her quiet, accustomed, burning way, fumed. We are not spare parts.You think we're your cast offs. You think we're the kids no other House wanted to take.Well, here's a clue for you, suckers. This is a story about choice. The wand chooses the wizard but the wizard chooses the House. When that Hat goes on your head, it doesn't forbid you things, it offers them to you.We are not your castoffs. We're just the kids who didn't choose you.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
