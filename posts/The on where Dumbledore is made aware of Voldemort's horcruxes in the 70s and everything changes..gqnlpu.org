Maybe Slughorn gets more terrified of living in a world ruled by his former student and approaches Albus with a memory.

Maybe Regulus makes a copy of the note he leaves inside the fake locket and sends it to Dumbledore. Hell, maybe he sends Kreacher to Dumbledore.

Maybe someone overhears something they shouldn't and Dumbledore finds out.

Either way, I think it'd make for an interesting fic. I'd be curious to see if he would disclose the information to someone - if anyone, or everyone - in the Order, if it would have changed how he approached the last years of the first War, if it you have any effect on Lily, James, Sirius, Remus and Peter (or Snape!).


** Albus was enjoying one of his rare few quiet afternoons. They had just destroyed one of Voldemort's safehouses and rescued a group of captives, and were now recuperating. He used this time to catch up on some paperwork, and just as he finished, there was a loud /crack/ at the center of the room. Whipping around with his wand pointed, he beheld a disheveled house elf clutching an amulet.

"Bumbleby! Master Reggie, amulet, inferi!"

Now Albus was somewhat used to strange things happening. But a deranged house elf, an amulet so dark the magic pouring off it had already begun to stain the animation charm on his carpet, changing the gentle waves into malicious faces, and /inferi/?

That was extraordinary even for his standards.

--------------

"I have reason to believe he made more than one, Mr. Black."

"Then I'd have..."

"Yes."

--------------

/"Mortuf√¶rnam"/ came the whispered command, and unholy flames licked from the wand held in a white-knuckled grip, forming writhing snakes into the air.

Not allowing them to touch the barren rock, Albus directed them at the locket, watching in satisfaction as it was thoroughly annihilated.

--------------

/I need Ravenclaw's diadem. I need Raveclaw's diadem. I need Ravenclaw's diadem./

Regulus watched as Albus paced before the wall, and nothing happened. "Have you tried-"

"Yes. Shhh!"

--------------

"As Supreme Mugwump, I hereby exact the right of insight."

The goblins stiffened, and threw hateful looks at Albus.

One of them walked over, 'accidentally' stumbled and dropped a heavy gold bar on his foot, then began leading them off toward the branch manager's office.

Inside, the goblin steepled his fingers, looking hatefully at Albus and Regulus over his glasses.

"Which vault does the Mugwump require insight into?"

"That of Bellatrix Lestrange."

"And you are aware of the consequences to your position should the conditions not be met?"

--------------

Regulus paced, occasionally stabbing his wand into the empty air, causing it to ripple darkly.

/"Maledictum. Revelio horriblis. Extacto Malum"/

There was a pop and then a fizzle as the curse finally broke, revealing a small shack overgrown with vines.

--------------

"Don't touch it, Albus!"

Regulus was flung into the wall, shattering it. Albus looked at him like a man possessed, and stalked towards him through the hole his body had created.

"This is the power we've been waiting for!"

"Kreacher, now!"

Behind Albus's incensed, maddened form, Kreacher popped into being, slightly lopsided by the flaming sword he was carrying.

Wreathed in Fiendfyre, the Sword of Gryffindor crashed down on the Horcrux, ending it in a blaze of glory.

--------------

Lucius could only look on in horror as the safe was unearthed by the Aurors.

One of the artifacts within sprung to life and began spewing tentacles of shadow as soon as the door was wrenched open, and he was in disbelief as one of the Aurors, this one wearing a face he knew from... somewhere, fired a spark of Fiendfyre directly into it, then slammed the door shut.

The roaring inferno inside would not die down for days.

--------------

"Stand aside, girl!"

"No, not Harry!"

"Avada Kedavra!"

"And now, my dominion shall finally be complete..."

--------------

Hagrid had just arrived at Hogwarts, and had given little Harry into Poppy's gentle care.

"Albus, I don't know how, but this is a curse scar. The darkest I've ever seen, but the magic is quickly disintegrating. If it continues, it will dissipate in a day or two, then I can heal it up and he'll be right as rain. Well, given the circumstances."

"Don't worry, Poppy, I believe I have found the perfect caretakers for little Harry..."

--------------

"Well, Albus, I have to say - you have a tendency to bring the strangest things to our attention."

"Indeed. I'm sorry, old friend, but you were the best choice. Promise you'll raise him, and don't fill his head with nonsense?"

The other man laughed, stroking his beard.

"Oh don't worry yourself, we may not have cared for a child in about four and a half centuries, but I believe we'll manage."

*** That 's brilliant. Learning about the Horcruxes because of the one Regulus found makes a LOT of sense as a point of divergence.

I am a bit unsure as of why the accidentical Horcrux in Harry did not manage to hold, but I like it anyway. And having the Flamels as Harry 's adoptive parents is a nice little touch.

**** I've always interpreted the accidental horcrux to only be possible because Voldemort's frayed, shattered soul was not drawn into the afterlife, but stayed around because of his other horcruxes.

So if all of them are gone, Voldemort's soul dissipates almost instantly, and doesn't have time to break off another piece.

And even if it did manage to make an accidental horcrux, the process would take longer than it'd take him to dissipate, leaving an orphaned soul fragment that slowly disappears because there is no main shard to tether itself and sustain from anymore.

*** That's brilliant! Thanks for replying to my prompt! So Regulus becomes Albus' companion instead of Severus and/or Harry. I also like the idea of involving the Flamels, although I held up hope that the Potters could have lived in this scenario. Would really enjoy seeing a whole fic based on this prompt!
