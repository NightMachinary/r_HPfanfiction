Hey there! I really love Charlie Weasley (super underrated character) and over the years I've found quite a few amazing fics about him. I rarely see them talked about or linked, so I wanted to share them here.

ffnbot!slim

*linkffn(6959412)* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6959412/1/Here-Be-Dragons][Here Be Dragons]] - Longfic of Charlie Weasley's adventures in Romania, taking place throughout all 7 books. Explores his character, romantic and family relationships and sexuality. Possibly one of my favourite fics of all time. If you don't read anything else from the list, read this.

*linkao3(15604416)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15604416/chapters/36230229][Charlie Weasley and The Department of Mysteries]] - Another incredible longfic about Charlie, lots of gay angst but also a really detailed depiction of mental illness and addiction. Also has an awesome mystery/adventure plot and great Weasley family characterisations & dynamics.

*linkfao3(17928953)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17928953][Amortentia (or How Charlie Weasley Came Out)]] - A sweet 12,000 word fic about Charlie at school, facing bullies and coming out to friends and family. And lying about what Amortentia smells like to him. Contains Hogwarts: A Mystery characters but you don't need to be familiar to enjoy.

*linkao3(28535268)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28535268][This Is Just What Human Means (For Me)]] - One shot where charlie comes out to his parents as Aroace. Bill's super supportive and so is their dad, Molly needs more time to come around.

*linkao3(26319100)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26319100][Because Dragons]] - One shot where Charlie comes out as Asexual to Molly and she is supportive. Really sweet and well-written.

*linkao3(25805497)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25805497][Second Time's a Charm]] - Smut fic that focuses on Ron/Hermione's first time and their relationship but also focuses on Charlie/Viktor and how Charlie struggles with feelings and emotions. Really well done.

*linkffn(8541945)* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8541945/1/Ready-Or-Not][Ready or Not]] - Sweet, friendship oneshot between Oliver Wood and Charlie, told from Oliver's POV throughout school and the war.

*linkffn(8645904)* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8645904/1/He-Still-Couldn-t-Speak-Romanian][He Still Couldn't Speak Romanian]] - Short, sweet gay angst drabble where Charlie reflects on who he is.

*linkao3(12024759)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12024759/chapters/27218016][Of Dragons and Other Difficult Beasts]] - Not completed unfortunately, but a really well-written fic about Charlie at school coming to terms with himself. Featuring nosy brother!Bill and sarcastic bestie!Tonks.

*linkao3(7560259)* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7560259][Wha'll be king but Charlie?]] - Really interesting one-shot song/poem(ish) fic where Charlie's outed and Hogwarts teachers and students stand up for him.

------------------

There's SOOO many more and I have a bunch on my to-read list. These are just a few. Legit ask me if you want more, I got more. Please go ahead and post some of your faves if you have any. I hope this inspires you to use Charlie in your fics too. :)

  Ron is ten years old and Charlie is leaving to go to Romania and start his work with dragons. The bullying from Fred and George becomes too much and Ronnie decides to stow away with Charlie. Part of my Quills for a Cause sponsorship for AIDS research.
