From the recent update time and the stalling nature of the last two chapters, its pretty clear the author is slowing down with this story and most likely will abandon in the near future


** Well a couple of points here. You might say that I am stalling because the last two chapters were meant to be two parts of the same chapter, thus the naming convention. I split them up because I wanted to publish something but due to finals and life I only got like seven thousand words done at a time.

Other than that I'm not sure how developing Harry's relationships (particularly with Daphne and Grindelwald), foreshadowing with Luna and the Hallows, and introducing a major antagonist is stalling. (Though I'd love to hear some thoughts on that.)

Next with the end of the semester came change to my usual pattern. I had to get a different job which keeps me busy and I have a bunch of court dates with a former landlord which keep me driving.

Further, my profile page indicates that I am shooting for a new chapter every two weeks, though I may indeed fail it this time, I am still, despite all of that, not behind schedule.

Not only that, but I am more active in this community than ever.

Next chapter is 4000 words in.

** That seems a little presumptive and negative.

Does the author have a history of abandoning fics or anything else to lead you to bother making this post?

*** No but it's a constant pattern in fanfics, when a story starts slowing down and stops making narrative progress, it usually means it's going to be abandoned

** Speaking as an author myself, stuff happens. I used to have chapters prewritten and could update once a week (so each of my two stories got an update every 14 days). I've run out of those long ago and am now writing and publishing as I get them ready, roughly once every two weeks (so a 4-week cycle). The chapters also have gone from 2.5k words to over 7k (and I have updated the old ones countless times to fix typos, grammar and style).

I also have around 20 plotbunnies on my GDrive, of which maybe 4 will eventually be finished, so that doesn't mean I am not writing.

Lastly, remember that we write for fun, not your pleasure. Writers owe you nothing. You don't like the recent development/update cycle/pairing/lack of harems? There is the door, have a nice day.

** Maybe the author is going on vacation, started a new job, has finals, a new baby in the house, a tree fell on their car, their parakeet died, they got a new puppy/kitty/shark or are having a torrid love affair with a mysterious Spaniard. My point is, you don't know what's going on in their life and it's kind of presumptive of you to assume that their story is being abandoned and then to post about it on a public forum without making any attempt to reach out to them.

Nice.

**** It's no worries, but something to think about. Most authors are totally fine with readers reaching out rather than going all Chicken Little. I don't like to haul around a laptop when I travel, so sometimes I have hiccups in my posting schedule.

** I've talked to him before and I really don't think the story will die off. He has a plan in set, when I write sometimes I'll update twice a week sometimes once a week. It's not like you just make it happen, you need time to develop a chapter or story
