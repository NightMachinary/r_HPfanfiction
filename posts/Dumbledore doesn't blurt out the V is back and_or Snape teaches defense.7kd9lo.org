** I haven't heard of fics like this... I'm interested.

I'm currently writing a story from fifth year on where Harry has disappeared so Dumbledore has to play smarter vs Voldemort as he no longer has a trump card. Snape teaches defence in sixth & seventh year. Harry is the main character, even though nobody knows where he is. I'm trying to do it from his perspective only.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097): no Graveyard Resurrection Scheme, but Dumbledore knew Voldemort was back through Harry's link, and he was quiet about it. Both sides were still preparing in secret as late as the summer after Year 5, although Voldemort had tried one hit on Harry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** The most common problem with this kind of desire is that competent adults means Harry is left twiddling his thumbs. Nothing for him to do as the adults are actually capable of keeping him safe and everything under control.
