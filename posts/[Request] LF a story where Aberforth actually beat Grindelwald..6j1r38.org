I don't really remember how it went, but it's mostly a humor story where Aberforth was the one that beat Grindelwald but gave Albus the credit. Harry ends up doing the same if I remember right.

Edit: I've remembered a bit more. Albus takes Harry to Aberforth so that he can learn how to beat a dark lord or something like that. I think in the end they used simple tricks like poison or something to do it.

** I've seen this once, but I don't remember it being a comedy. Aberforth killed his brother in a fit of jealousy, but he had extreme remorse, and ended up taking his brother's identity, and dedicated himself to reforming, going so far as to battle Grindelwald and exploiting the personal connection Grindelwald had with Albus, but that he himself didn't have.

I had pretty much all but forgotten about this fic until I saw this post, and I have no idea the name of it and it was probably 7 years ago when I read it.
