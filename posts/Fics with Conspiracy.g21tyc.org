So, are there fics where a character uncovers, investigates, and unravels a conspiracy? And can y'all pretty please provide links, should there be some?

Can be whatever kind of conspiracy you think fits the term, but the best comparison I can to help those who might not be sure is 'like the Deus Ex games'. I'm sure most of 'em'll follow the same path: bunch of people are plotting something secret, the protagonist gets on the track to find out, they try to keep them out of it somehow.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development.


** One shot, Hermione-centric story where she uncovers some secrets of the Ministry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13263345/1/We-Are-Many]])

HP-Matrix crossover. Harry discovers all is not what it seems at Hogwarts. Really well written. My personal fave when it comes to crossovers. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality]])

*** Damn. That We Are Many thing is quite haunting. Bolshie really does write creepy shit well.

The first chapter of the Matrix one does look intriguing.

Thanks for the recs!

  After growing concerned about some of his political decisions, Hermione decides to confront Minister for Magic Harry Potter, fifteen years after Voldemort's defeat. All she can hope is that she's overreacting, and that her worries are unfounded. Oneshot.

  Harry has felt for a long time that there was something strange about the Muggle world. But when he begins receiving strange messages from the notorious mass murderer, Sirius Black, he begins to wonder if the Wizarding world is what he believed it to be. COMPLETE!

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g21x3d/fics_with_crimesolving/fnl4y5e/][Perhaps some of the ones listed here.]] Although, I tend towards conspiracies as having a single leader (that recruits) so even where I summarised them using the word "conspiracy" it may not be quite what you're after.

*** Heh. Your other comment is right below this one in my messages list, so clicking that link confused me for a good minute or two as I thought I'd clicked on the wrong thing. :D

Yeah, personally I'd use the word conspiracy for more of a cabal than a single individual, but I suppose it could work if the recruited are particularly involved. If it's one spider behind the scenes pulling the threads of a bunch of individuals who don't know anything about any other members, I'd probably not call that a conspiracy, for example, but if there was more linkage and interaction, then yeah, I'd use the term.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny

** On a little bit of a twist try The Real Us by Seel'vor. It's after the war is over Harry and Hermione come clean and tell the "true" story of their time at Hogwarts. Eg., everything you thought you knew is probably wrong.

linkffn(4605681)

The Baby by Broomstick Flyer has Hermione coming home from finding her parents in Australia and finds a surprise on her doorstep.

linkffn(6137640)

Beauty of a Full Moon by Ares.Granger has harry and hermione discover that Dumbledore is a dark lord and created Voldemort

  "I do wonder how the magicals of Britain will react when they discover that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is now the 'Wolf-That-Loves'." Hermione and Harry become werewolves with some surprising results. So surprising, in fact, that their world turns on its head. Takes place sixth year. Harry/Hermione, AU. I find this story hard to give a summary for...
