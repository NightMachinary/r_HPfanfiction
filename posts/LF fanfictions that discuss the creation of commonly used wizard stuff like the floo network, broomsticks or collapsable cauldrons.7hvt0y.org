** linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist): it isn't the focus by any means, but it has a very convincing idea for how Floo Powder came to be --- it was created by an alchemist during the witch hunt, to be sewn into the clothes of a wizard who couldn't apparate so that when someone tried to burn him at the stake he'd instantly be teleported to safety.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
