Does anyone else feel like the fandom has nothing left to offer you? I can rarely enjoy a story that isn't Harry-Centric, but lately I find myself hating most of the tropes that make up those stories.

In my original draft of this post I had listed several different things that happen in most Harry Potter fanfics I read that bother me. But, after my third or fourth entry I realized the issue is that I no longer enjoy children protagonists. I can't take them seriously, the romances seem over-dramatic and too serious (Honestly so many students finding true love at 13-15), the battles are a joke (I don't care if they spent time training in DA, they are not going to win against organized combat veterans.), and I find the machinations are laughable. No self respecting adult is going to change their major world views and political policies based on the opinions of an 11 year old, even if the 11 year old is a celebrity. In order for the child to win it requires some serious suspense of disbelief, and dumbing down everyone else. I also am not a fan of how the genre encourages the trope of one man defeating dozens of enemies single-handedly.

I entered this fandom over 10 years ago as a Harry, enthralled and enraptured by the magic. I am now a Snape.

Does anyone else feel similar? Any fanfic recs that might push me outside of the funk I am in? I have already read Strangers at Drakeshaugh and Grow Young With Me.


** I think it's this very fact that drives me to read weirder and more outlandish fics. It's not so difficult to take a fifteen year old seriously when, say, he's been [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][living for hundreds of years and repeating his life over and over again.]]

At some point, I'll begin to wonder why I'm even reading fanfiction in the first place, and not just original works.

This doesn't bother me as much as it maybe bothers you though, because the characters aren't necessarily what I consider to be the most important element in a story. Other aspects like lore and world-building which I value more, Wastelands of Time nails completely.

** I don't have any specific recommendations for you but I did go through something similar myself. The way I got over it was by reading some crossovers, I'm a fan of Star Wars, usually these would have an older, adult Harry and are usually great fun to read. I particularly enjoy when the HP magic is used to alter/break the crossover world. Darth Marrs(sp?) has some excellent stories like this. Harry is probably a little OP but for me that is part of the fun.

I hope so! It seems there are a lot of posts on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] for things like "check out this horrible fic" or "what makes you nope out", etc. A lot of negative, focusing on what we don't like. I'm wondering if it's a sign of the times. In the absence of good, new fics the community becomes stale, spending their time mocking the old. Maybe HP fanfiction in general is going through adolescence. Will the genre grow up and put forth the effort to get what it wants? Or will it hunker down in the proverbial parental basement, hoping someone else gets things moving.

**** I want to see more stories like this. Wizards supposedly live 150+ years with ease. Shouldn't "childhood" or at least the parts where you're physically able to care for yourself but legally under guidance of an "adult" be much longer than 11 or 12 (when they're essentially taken from their parents) or 17 when they're legally "of age"?

How about 15-22? Almost every teen has started if not finished puberty by 15, and are both physically and mentally able to understand their place in the world. Unless you introduce some outside mechanic such as needing to be monitored /during/ puberty, it makes much more sense for the serious magical education to be at a highschool-college age. Even if you do need to be closely monitored, introduce primary schools where wanded magic isn't taught, and instead they focus on, I don't know, runes or maths or divination, and still have Hogwarts where the not quite children have adult problems. And 22 is the absolute far end of all "development" of the body and brain. A perfect place to exit school. This also makes quidditch make sense because an 11 year old vs a bludger is insane, but a 16 year old not nearly as much.

Not only is that more logical from a chronological standpoint, it also is more comfortable for the reader and the writer to have barely to somewhat legal budding romance between teenagers rather than definitely not legal romance between pre-pubescent kids. It also allows for situations like the GoF contract to pop up where Harry would be 18, which while still wrong according to in universe standards, at least somewhat makes sense to us as readers. It also adds another four years of incompetence and plotting, as well as opens up opportunities to either stretch the JP/LE romance out, or have their deaths be that much more perverse: If they were murdered at 22/23, they were basically children still, and their 15 month old was an infant, how disgusting and shocking it is for them to be attacked.

I dunno, maybe I'm just ranting drunkenly.

****** That may be the case but it adds a great deal to the story imo. Why is everything so ancient and backwards looking? Well, when you're dealing with 5 generations instead of 2, the old opinions are all that matter. When the oldest person alive (barring Flamel) has seen within his lifetime the most important inventions growths and changes of the world, and can compare it to "before", it's no wonder that resentment will grow. Opinions can change in one generation, but not when the oldest generation, 5, is around to teach history and morals, gen 4 is ruling the wizengamot, gen 3 is ruling the ministry, gen 2 is the working class, and gen 1 is learning that the most important thing is respecting your elders. It adds a whole new dimension to world building when you have to consider what it would be like for great great gran gran to be telling stories about the muggles destroying the country for the eighth time in their life, not the second.

The only thing that /wouldn't/ make sense in that case would be the the Statute of Secrecy to be tied to the Glorious Revolution and not the Magna Carta, or that Hogwarts would be only 7 lifetimes old and not 17. If the magical world is essentially one solid unit for 6000 years (since the end of ancient Egypt), the oldest school in Europe could not possibly be only ~900 years old.

I need to come back to this tomorrow when I'm less drunk and have a better internet connection to google sources.

That assumes that educating children in large schools is somehow an obvious or necessary part of magical culture. Before the founding of Hogwarts, etc. knowledge may have been passed on primarily through families and apprenticeships, same as it was in the real world until fairly recently.

******* It also explains wizards being so absolutely in the dark about muggles, as it has only be a single generation since things like wide spread use of cars, most household appliances like washing machines and even vacuum cleaners. It's exactly like asking those born in the 50s about reddit. Sure, some know, but most have no idea what you are talking about, and don't even really understand the background needed to make the logical leap about how it works.

I think this is why I enjoy time-travel/do-overs so much. At least 30-year-old Harry in his 15-year-old body doesn't seem so unnaturally adult. I mean, yeah, Harry is forced to be somewhat mature for his age, but there's a limit to how mature a teenager is capable of being.

And then when he's NOT mature, he can blame the hormones he's not used to.

This shit right here is why I prefer my fanfics to be post-Hogwarts if they involve romance at all. It's also why I don't buy H/G or R/Hr in canon. How many people actually end up being compatible, long term, with their high school sweetheart? >.>

*** I don't buy R/Hr that much, but H/G had a number of similar experiences and interests going for them, notably the whole touched by Voldemort thing. And their personalities complimented each other rather well in a number of ways, some rather subtle imo.

Of course, JKR did write them that way, for each other, so clearly they would work together. But it's not like she's the first to have done that, and it's not like it doesn't happen in real life sometimes.

Edit: That being said, some of my favorite fics are post-hogwarts AUs in which H/G never met, or don't remember each other, and they instead meet down the line. So... I'm not really sure where I intended to go with this edit now...ha

**** Yeah, R/Hr is realistically a clusterfuck. No way they'd ever stay together if it weren't a work of fiction.

I agree that H/G is /more/ realistic than R/Hr, but I'm still skeptical of the long term prospects of any couple that starts dating at 15/16. I think that if JKR were better at writing romance (and actually capitalized on the Voldie-in-my-head connection), she could have made them a much more believable couple, but I still don't buy it as written. Canon Ginny is just such a non-character. We hear /about/ her from her brothers more than we ever see her do herself. We know JKR can write wonderful and well-developed characters, so it just seems odd for the main character's "girl" to get none of that.

So yeah. Between the high school romance angle and Ginny not actually having a defined personality, I can't get behind H/G.

***** I will give you that JKR is a shit romance writer, not that she was intending to be writing romance, but yes, true.

I don't think, however, that Ginny is underdeveloped for who she was in the books. Oh, sure, I think there could have easily been more. But she wasn't Harry, Ron, or Hermione, so we don't see her as often. However, when she does become the focus of a scene, JKR does tend to do a lot with her.

Now, movie Ginny got shafted, /hard/, because they took all of the good scenes with her out. Plus, Bonnie and Daniel just simply had no actual chemistry on the set (though it's hard to blame them for that since they were cast as kids)... it's best to forget about movie Ginny.

*** Well, my grandparents met in high school, married after 4 years of college in 1940, and stayed that way until 2004.

It's not common, but not that rare either.

Now imagine Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley:

- Both were possessed by a dark power once and survived

- Both fought against evil terrorists bent on killing them since they were 11

- The boy went on guerrilla warfare, while the girl stayed behind enemy lines as underground resistance leader

- The girl suffered numerous torture for supporting her boy, the boy went willingly to his death to save his girl (and other loved ones)

- Finally, after a brief glimpse of the 'heaven', the boy still decided to come back to join his girl, what would the girl think of that?

What stronger bond can you possibly have between two lovers? Your average personality difference almost seems trivial in face of such strong bond.

***** Absolutely, Pathfinder is essentially a repackaging of Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition. After Wizards of the Coast moved on to 4th edition a lot for the 3rd edition rules and systems were open license and a heavy demand remained for more product for the 3rd edition rule system.

Curently I am playing 2 campaigns, one where I play two characters, a native american-esque(Shoanti is the official name for that type of people in universe.) fighter/bodyguard, and a dwarf inquisitor of the god of commerce flavored as a tax collector. In another I am part of a group of people press-ganged onto a pirate ship, in that one I play a Mute-Druid(Gets powers through nature) who specializes in aquatic powers and has a crab familiar.

I also GM(Game Master, essentially running the sessions for everyone else) a campaign about witches and involves Baba Yaga.

All of the games I am in right now are officially published paths, but you can play your character how you want, and Rp between characters and NPCs.
