Isn't it possible for someone to put 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' in the goblet of fire and if his name comes out, he'll have to participate and if he doesn't, his magic will be taken away from him? Just a thought and opinion


** I would quite like to see a crackfic where this happens and Voldemort has to turn up to compete. The tournament would provide a form of protection, so that no-one could arrest him during the events. However, the organising committee would just be ramping up the challenges to absurd levels to try and take him down. It would be an amusing opportunity for him to crack out some really big magic.

Even better if Dumbledore is also trapped into it by Voldemort so that they have to compete against one another.

  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE

 \\
Although, now that you bring it up...what if it backfired? What if someone put Voldemort/Tom Riddle's name into the Goblet of Fire, intending that he fails to show up and therefore loses his magic, but in order to enable him to fairly compete, the Goblet summons Voldemort to Hogwarts and restores him to a physical body?

Possibly Peter Pettigrew could be affected the same way, summoned to Hogwarts by the Goblet but protected from arrest and/or sabotage by the Goblet's magic.

** The only canonically stated thing is that whoever is called out by the Goblet has to see the competition through to the end. The rest is fanon. I'm sure that if things were as simple somebody would have thought of it. Instead Harry had to (temporarily) die in order to strip Voldemort of powers.

- I probably like “Demonic Intervention” by bennybear linkffn(12352826) the most,
- “Harry Potter and the Fourth School” by Dalwyn linkffn(6311075)
- “The Consequences of a Magical Contract” by Vercalos linkao3(30671798)
- “This Tournament Needs Better Security” by Right What Is Wrong linkffn(13182437)
- this one is lovely, “Technicalities” by ChasingAnna linkao3(23107549)
- the one from the Lone Traveller series “Yet Another Goblet of Fire Fic” by Dunuelos linkao3(20284555)
