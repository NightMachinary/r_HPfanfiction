Whenever I read these fics with the trope Dark Harry or Creature Harry they always get Harry a snake ,crow , nandu, basilick? And one of them even gave him three pet Phoenix's . Why, is it that they get rid of Hedwig? And to make it worst the pets never add on to the story they're only there for when he gets a pet . If, so then why get rid of Hedwig what did getting rid of her completely add to the story?


** In canon, Headwig is a symbol of Harry's innocence. In most dark Harry fics, he doesn't have that innocence.

** Because Ron has to savagely strangle Hedwig with his teeth in order for Harry to hate him. Not sure why, but that's how it seems to go every time.

** A pet being killed is a common breaking point for a hero becoming a villain. Usually someone kills their dog, but Harry doesn't have a dog, so an owl will have to do.

** Because angst.

But really, Hedwig is the symbol of Harry's childhood and innocence. It's the same in canon. He doesn't become dark, but it is the point when he becomes a man from a boy. It is also the point where the books completely transforms from children's fiction to young adult.
