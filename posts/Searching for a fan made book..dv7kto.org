:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So when i was a kid my sister introduced me to Harry potter series. They were still in its publishing phase which i didn't knew or understood at that time that all books have not been released yet at that point.

I was so hooked up on the series that i wanted to know what happened next and i searched harry potter books on a p2p application called kaaza if anybody knows.

Anyway i THINK HP6 was to be released and i saw a pdf named harry potter 6. I downloaded that pdf thinking it to be the next book in the series. It was very long book and the story was epic. But unfortunately i lost that pdf somewhere a looonngg time ago to this day the story haunts me. I wish to read it one more time because i can still remember the ending being that Dumbledore was actually the master of Voldemort. It was such a wild story.

If anybody knows about that book please share it here i would really appreciate that


** It's the series written by the author called "Harry Writter". It was written after Book 4, and it has two books: The Order of the Phoenix (the title had already been announced back then) and The Ring of the Ancients. The corresponding Book 7 has never been written, to my knowledge. I put them here:

*** Well there was kind of spell or something that could turn a room into sort of internet where you can interact physically.... And it also involved some rings that harry had to find just like he has to find horcrux And the big reveal that Dumbledore was the master mind all along was at the very end... After harry and Voldemort fight in great hall...

Those are the only details i remember as i read it around 15 years ago
