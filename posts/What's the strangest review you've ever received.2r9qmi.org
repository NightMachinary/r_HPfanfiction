Inspired by [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2r8upj/have_you_ever_left_a_review_that_went_wrong/][this thread]], from the writer's perspective.

Strangest review I ever got was actually on my first fic. Did it criticize my lack of a plot, ridiculous crossover theory, piles of plot holes, poor characterization, overly-long gags or terrible writing?

No. It called me to task for using the term "People's Republic of Hell" because apparently that's some kind of Anti-China sentiment. Merlin's pants, y'all.

So: Strangest review you've ever had. Go.


** I once received a highly negative review of a fic, the main point of contention being that I mentioned there being a dining room in Privet Drive. The reviewer took offence at this departure from canon and declared the fic unreadable because of it.

I made sure to mention the dining room several times in the following chapters.

Most amusingly of all, there /is/ a dining room. They had dinner in there with Aunt Marge in PoA.

** Recently I had someone say my fic is a 'great sequel', asked why I don't mention that it's a continuation of my other fic, and wondered where Umbridge was. They left me reviews throughout the whole thing and loved it.

It's next gen and isn't a sequel.

** I once had someone leave a review on Ch95 of my fic saying they'd skipped chapters 33-44, 47-58, 59-69, and 70-95. They said they couldn't be bothered to read it all.

Then they told me they weren't reading anymore because it was too complicated and they couldn't keep track of what was going on.

** Hoo boy...

So I wrote this line in the midst of the story:

#+begin_quote
  If there's anything obvious to me it is that innovation comes from two sources; the need to solve a critical problem and/or divine (or hallucinogenic) inspiration.
#+end_quote

And the message I got with the line quoted was this:

#+begin_quote
  Congratulations for grasping the Apolitical Communist personality type sufficiently to string 'innovation' and 'inspiration' in the same sentence. It still leaves much to be desired.

  Here is one row of the relevant personality table. The row you are most interested in, as you would call it the 'militant' but actually Wrathful row (or technically, the Negative Value Clarity row). You can think of it as the 'abolishing Evil' row:

  - advisor - changes someone's life
  - teacher - part of society
  - freethinker - thinks of changing society
  - inventor - changes society, insignificantly
  - trailblazer - significantly changes society
  - Father Of: X - radically changes society
  - world-changer / All-Father - radically changes the entire world
  - Transmuter - changes physical reality and/or human nature

  This row is in terms of increasing Clarity. A type of Clarity called Presence but let's not go into it. Clarity is simply /knowing what you want/ and /knowing how to bring it about/. Of the two, knowing what you want is the most critical.

  If you know precisely what you want but not how to bring it about, and you don't have the brains to figure it out, you can recruit others to help you figure it out. If you don't know what you want, you're hopeless, even if you know how to bring it about.

  The level of Clarity attached to 'innovation' is the same as invention, except instead of being in the Wrathful row, it's in the Clueless row. Clueless is worse than Gutless which is worse than Wrathful. Incidentally, 'helping' is the Clueless variant of 'advising'.

  What you call 'divine inspiration' is nowhere. For being a Transmuter isn't about having Clarity poured into your head by a god or any external entity. In fact, the idea that Clarity is out there and poured into people is ludicrous. Clarity is internal, built by the mind. Clarity is a skill and knowledge and is /teachable/.

  Anyways, I've gone off track. Being a Transmuter isn't about being inspired by a divinity. Being a Transmuter is BEING a divinity. A living breathing physical god. There are 27 different types of god described in fiction. None of them has ever been recorded in human history . So they sure as fuck could never have inspired anyone.

  Actually, history records the United States acting /AS/ a god, collectively. That is, the entire population of the United States acted as a single god-entity in recent history. But the Hegemon god belongs to the Moralist personality type which is two squares removed from the Apolitical Communist personality type. So it could not have inspired Lily.

**** The reviewer had developed a complex layout of personality stages divided along paths of clarity evincing a particular level of dedication to a belief category. At first I engaged in some polite discussion but the later reviews all lambasted me for mis-identifying the personality trends when they didn't fit to his labeling scheme.

Honest to God, I think the whole thing was derived from the AD&D Alignment system (Lawful Good - Neutral - Chaotic Evil) but with the names changed to protect the source.

****** He never asked me for money.

While L Ron's writing may have influenced him, I'm fair to certain that the appropriation of terms to specific stages and paths of development was part of his personal grand theory. He sent me some of the materials, and he assured me that several law-enforcement agencies would soon be leveraging it's value in their investigative work.

** I wrote an HP drabble series fic that took place in Harvest Moon: FoMT universe, and the side-story (ish? was more like a conclusion) oneshot that I wrote was about the marriage of Harry (the Harvest God, in my fic's case).

I got a review asking how the church the marriage took place in could possibly be considered a church, as the "God" in question was getting married, and why exactly wasn't he being flung out of the establishment like any other crazy that claimed to be God?

I thought the person meant to say "how could this building be considered a church? The Harvest God isn't God!" to which I was mentally replying, "well, the game called it a church..."

Nope. They were insulted by Harry claiming to be the deity of the establishment, and none of the attendees batting an eyelash in response.

The whole point of the side story was that Harry didn't remember being the Harvest God.

**** Sure. Warning though--it's TMR/HP slash, though nothing explicit. Hints of AD/GG, implied Tonks/Kingsley, one-sided Lily/James, and the briefest mention of Lily/Snape. No magic AU, of course.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9310230/1/Living-in-the-Moment][This]] is the link to the main drabble series (completed), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10382497/1/Living-for-the-Moment][this]] is the link to the side story I was talking about.

Easiest to understand if you read the drabbles first.

** You mean besides Jeremy Crawford?

The only one that sticks in my mind is the one where I was called a "virginfag" because I had a girl pass out from multiple orgasms.

I hate turning off unsigned reviews, but when I don't I end up with lots of people complaining and no way to ask them for suggestions on how to fix what they see as a problem.

Not to disrespect readers, but until you try to write a fanfic, and make it successful, try to remember that this is written for free for your entertainment and you are perfectly allowed to stop reading. If you want to leave helpful criticism on your way out then please do, but flames get ignored almost 100%.

*** I actually remember you being salty about that in an authors note in the following chapter. I thought it was great reading the flames you got on that piece, and I'm always astounded at how many people will flame, go on and read the next chapter, and /keep on flaming/. Why not just stop reading if you don't like it, yes?
