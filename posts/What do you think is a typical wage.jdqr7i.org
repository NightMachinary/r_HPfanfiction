I'm thinking 1 galleon/hour for low skill boring work.


** In the UK in 1990, average salary was about £14k. At £5 per galleon, that would be 2,800 galleons per year (1.4 galleons per hour for a 2,000-hour year).

From there, you need to start making decisions about magical life. Can employers get away with paying less because magic can provide the basics (food engorging, clothing reparo's, transportation by apparition, etc.). Or does everything cost more because goods and services are controlled by pureblood monopolies, property isn't for sale only rent, etc.

My take is that high-skill goods are more expensive than they might otherwise be because of low competition (how many wand crafters or expanded trunk enchanters can magical UK support?), but basics are cheap because everyone uses magic. That allows employers to pay less, and only the rich get the good stuff. So I would arbitrarily divide the above annual salary in half to 1,400 galleons per year (0.7 galleons or 12 sickles per hour).

*** Now that I think of it, Ollivander, unless he provides other services too, at 7 galleons/wand, can't be making too much for an average inflow of forty new witches and wizards per year, mostly in the summer. Let's assume that there are the occasional broken wands or wands that need maintenance or repairs, but how often do those occur? Also let's say that there are some students going abroad and some are homeschooled but those aren't that many since the majority is stated to go to Hogwarts.

But then with competition or people inheriting wands, I am pretty certain Ollivander's yearly revenue is less than 1000 galleons per year. Then you have to subtract fix and variable costs and Ollivander's profits are fairly small then. It's unlikely that he can afford an employee at the salary you mentioned. And he owns one of the most prestigious businesses on Diagon Alley because he sells a necessity for witches and wizards at a very high quality.

** No way. Harry's wand was 7 galleons at Oivander's and Ron ends up with a hand me down wand, implied because of the cost.

I doubt Arthur is making minimum wage at the ministry. And I don't see how a wand couldn't be top priority right below shelter and food. If they couldn't get together 7 galleons (or less? are all wands the same cost or was Harry's more expensive because of its core?) for a wand, I doubt a minimum wage or equivalent job would pay that for an hour's work

Of course Rowling and consistency and math... who knows

**** Obviously, but priorities are generally food, shelter, anything that can be repossessed, everything else. They seem to have food and shelter down - there's never a mention of mortgage or rent or debt or it not actually being their home outright or anything else. They have a house with land, they're not renting a shitty apartment or whatever in the slums. There's no mentions ever of potentially losing it.

1 wand for each kid, spread out every year or two, I think would be next priority. And yet they're bothering to buy full sets of textbooks for several kids instead of having the kids use library copies and share with a friend in class. Sounds like the cost of a wand is very substantial that they're skipping it instead of other things. If it was really “only” one day's wages, I think it would have taken priority over textbooks. Muggle world textbooks are often much more than a day's minimum pretax wage.

**** it dosent fit the image of the Weasleys properly though since we know that a wizard needs a perfectly matched wand to meet his or hers potential.

a wand is arguably the smartest investment all wizards and witches make and they have to deal with hand me downs.

Now if we take the rate that a galleon is worth 5 quid, we get that a family that buys 7 wands pays 49 galleons for them. 49x 5 is a bit under 200 quid, far to little to be of any substansual value over the benefits fo having a properly working and matching wands.

Galleons are probably worth far more

*** I agree it's too high. More fitting with the general price level in the books is a fifth or a fourth, i.e. 4 or 5 Sickles/hour (at 1,800 hours/year on avg.)

Still, wands are too cheap (if Harry didn't get a 95% discount), regardless of what you do. It can't be fixed by tweaking the exchange rate or incomes, because they are too cheap compared to other prices. Say, a textbook for 9 Galleons. You'd expect a wand to be an investment, and that means something rather like a (few) hundred Galleons and up.

Surprisingly enough, though, it's one of two exceptions (the other is the TriWiz money, which is too little as well). The rest is broadly coherent.

** The correct answer is "don't think too hard about it". If you're writing a story that involves a major character working a minimum-wage job, just mention it in general terms, possibly with them occasionally grouching about the cost of things.

** You can build a mostly-coherent framework based on the prices we are given in Canon. The TL;DR is ~1 USD/GBP = 1 Sickle, i.e. Sickles and Knuts are coins, Galleons banknotes. Based on that, I had put Arthur (pre-HBP) at 1,400 Galleons/year.

Incidentally, this means the Weasleys are poor because they have too many children; for a family of three or four, it'd be modest, and you'd have be mindful with your money, but enough if you are; for a single person, it'd be decent middle-class life.

That qualifies as "typical" for me. Minimum-wage kind of work would be 350, maybe 500 Galleons/year. Enough for one person to get by, but nothing more.
