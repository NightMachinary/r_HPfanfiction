A few months ago I encountered [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10517351/1/Beyond-Nature-s-Realm][this gem]] wherein Hagrid breeds schoolgirls with centaurs/unicorns. 99.9% sure it's a sincere endeavor, which is equal parts fascinating and terrifying.


** Well, there is linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart) which starts pretty promising but just disintegrates into a mess plot-wise and has some pretty weird elements.

**** It's Perfect Lionheart - he basically self-inserts into a male protagonist and proceeds to "fix" the world with ease.

***** I was filled with horror when I heard he wanted to inflict that on /Worm/, especially given that he hasn't even read the canon yet. I know he's at least two chapters into his 'fix-fic'

****** Oh he's four or so into that one. The only thing more amusing than how horrible the story is are the author's notes which are pretty much just a soapbox of him talking about how bad he thinks Worm is.

It's hilarious. I hope he finishes, really, because every chapter just makes me laugh so much at how bad it is.

**** Honestly, I liked Chunin Exam Day until the last few chapters. I hate the author and Partially Kissed Hero, but I like that one. I can see that it's horrible. I can tell the plot is ridiculous on a level few authors can take their fics to and actually still think it's good, but I thought it was funny and my inner perve loved the giant harem.

That was me who mentioned that. Yes. That is a thing. It was more that "I have to marry James, have sex with him and then you'll be born out of James' and my love but I do not actually love him like I love you. For you are my soul bonded one and I will love you forever and ever!"

Some people have the strangest plots. It sounds like something out of a weird Japanese anime.

** I don't remember-or more accurately, a portion of my mind is dedicated to suppressing it at this stage. Humanity may not be doomed by its own hand, but we better find a way to hide this shit from any future extraterrestrial civilisations we encounter...

Which makes me wonder if anyone remembered to include 'hide the stash of weird shit' in their first contact scenarios. Tentacle porn alone may be seen as horrendously speciesist if we ever do find a race of sapient tentacle users out there. And don't get started on Lovecraft. That's a whole other can of worms right there.
