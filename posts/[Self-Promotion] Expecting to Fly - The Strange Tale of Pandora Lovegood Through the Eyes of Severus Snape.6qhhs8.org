NOTES: Pandora Lovegood is Luna's mother. Pandora does not have a canon maiden name, so I invented one. I hope you all enjoy my ficlet.

** I like it.

Also, a surname is a /last/ name, not a first name. Pandora is a lovely name.

*** Thank you. I'm very glad to read that you liked it. :)

J.K. Rowling actually named her Pandora Lovegood. I gave her the maiden name "Vale," which is what Severus continues to call her, because he addressed her as such in the beginning (creature of habit, I suppose).

EDIT: I changed it in the above post so it makes more sense. Thanks for letting me know.

**** A maiden name is one's /last/ name at birth, not first name. A first name is often referred to as that, or as a given name. When somebody marries another and changes their last name, their name at /birth/ is their /maiden/ name.

***** Yes, I understand. I don't think I'm conveying my thoughts very well. J.K. Rowling named the character [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Pandora_Lovegood][Pandora Lovegood]]; "Lovegood" is her married name, but Rowling provided no canon maiden name for the character, so I invented "Vale" for her as a last name for this story, which takes place before she married Xeno Lovegood. Severus simply calls her Vale because that's the only part of her name he could remember in the beginning, and he continues to call her that throughout the story.

#+begin_quote
  "Hello, Severus," she greeted him by name while he struggled to remember hers. "Vale...?" he guessed with upward inflection.

  "Close, my name is Pandora, but you can call me 'Vale,' it's my surname so it suits me just the same."

I'm sorry if I'm still not making sense or if this all sounds pedantic; I'm truly not meaning to be, just trying to show you that I understand. Thanks! =)

** I've just read it.

Fanboy on: [spoilers][[/spoiler][Poor girl, that was so cruel. Shame on you. I also wouldn't have accepted in her place, it was playing with fire, and she got burned. I don't know how Sev will fix it. (Unless she'll become a Lovegood, which it may imply that it won't heal)...]] .Fan boy off

Objectively is an interesting and uncommon concept , snape dating someone else in maraunder's era. It's well written and I loved that She's a lot like Luna. You've just got yourself a new reader

*** Thank you so much for your review and your readership. Yes, Pandora is a little too accommodating in that regard, and Severus will have a hard time earning her trust again, for certain. I'm glad to have you as a reader. =)
