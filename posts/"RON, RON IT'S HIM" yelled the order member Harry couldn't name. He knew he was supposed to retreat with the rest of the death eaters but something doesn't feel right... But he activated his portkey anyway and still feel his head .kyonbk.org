Amnesiac!Harry.

Harry has his mind wiped by Voldemort and is made to be a death eater. The order keeps trying to find him but. Voldemort is determined to keep him on his side. what will happen when Harry starts remembering things he shouldn't?

Loosely inspired by Reven from kotor. Except mind wiped to be evil instead of good.


** Yes please, sir may I have some more?

This is just so juicy to think about. Like the way the Death Eaters treat him would be hot or cold and Voldemort being both protective but also just so punishing.

** Actually(ssshually), Revan was good, then was tortured by the Sith Emperor to become evil, and then the Jedi mind-wiped him to make him good again.

Later he spent 300 years playing telepathy chess with the Sith Emperor to keep him at bay.
