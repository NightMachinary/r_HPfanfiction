I know it's a trope but I'm curious to see if there's any good (or at least we'll done fics) with this premise.

Would be okay with another Weasley being a Death Eater, too.


** I didn't know a well written Ron The Death Eater was possible when done straight. I'm very interested in reading one of these fics too.

** I always hated this trope and really just the anti-Ron stuff in general but I would love to see one done well for a change.

** So... I'm just going to link you to the actual trope page's list of fics.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RonTheDeathEater/HarryPotter]]

That should have more than enough for you.

*** linking ALL the fics isn't particularly helpful to someone asking for well written ones, especially in a trope full of terrible writing
