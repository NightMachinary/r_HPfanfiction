So, a Flashbang (according to a very quick google) has some effects (hearing damage and dizziness) that can last anywhere from a few seconds to an hour depending on individual susceptibility. Living in England and well away from any flashbang-worthy activity, I've no idea if this is true, but I'm choosing to take it as a comparative point for my question here.

If a Muggle-Disenfranchised Muggleborn alliance united and invented an Anti-Magic Flashbang that negated all magic (effects and/or ability) in a small radius for a similar timeframe (a few seconds to an hour, depending on individual susceptibility - ie. Dumbledore and Voldemort would be powerless for a few seconds, most magicals would be up to an hour, stronger spells would be a few seconds, weaker spells would be up to an hour, etc), do you think that would allow them to win a war with the Magicals? If the AMF was invented in peacetime, would it lead to a war when Magicals found out? What would be the ramifications of that invention?

Any other ideas you might have are welcome - be they answers to questions I've asked or questions I've not thought to ask. I'm really curious how something like this might pan out.


** I don't think a flash bang is the right idea honestly. From what I remember flashbangs cause such intense noise/light that the body can't react quick enough to close out pupils and it's just loud enough to be disorienting.

*** If you are in the same room (and not wearing hearing/eye protection rated for this), you are guarantied to be temporarily blinded, and deafened. This has a good chance to disturb the fluid in the ear, which messes your balance. Add it all together, and you get someone stumbling around, not knowing what the hell just happened.

This opens up accidental magic, or people panicking and dropping their own stuff. Add in some anti-magic effects, and you remove that possibility.

There's even a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockSilence][trope for this]], which is based on the truth. Call of Duty has the Shellshocked condition which is similar to this too.

*** The flashbang thing is just a comparison of effect time, nothing more. Imagine I'd said grenade instead. Essentially, I'm looking for opinions on what a grenade that knocked out magic in a small area for between a few seconds and an hour would affect in the setting. Would it cause a war, would it stop a war, etc.

** 1. Don't worry about not knowing flashbangs from the personal experience. Give it couple of years and I am afraid (I have friends in Belfast, so I am really afraid) IRA or UVF will make you live presentations. And ask your parents.

2. There was some story where Hermione developed a magical version of a flashbang: version of /Lumos/ of such intensity, that it worked like the one. Not sure where it was.

*** Heh. Quite possible. We in England are certainly doing our best to piss off everyone else we can these days - really taking pointers from the US and all that.

I have, but my English side are all unexperienced in that sort of thing and my Irish relatives haven't responded to anything all day. It's not really the point of my post though, I'm more focusing on the anti-magic part than the flashbang part. Essentially, I'm wondering what would happen if an anti-magic grenade was invented that had a similar boom-flash and effect time as a flashbang. Not a magical flashbang, but an anti-magic flashbang, basically.

** There's a possibility that a normal shield charm might not recognize a bright light and a loud noise as a danger it should block, so a normal flashbang could be quite useful against wizards. A second of disorientation is all it takes to hit someone with a serious curse. Flashbang, then attack curses could be a very good strategy.
