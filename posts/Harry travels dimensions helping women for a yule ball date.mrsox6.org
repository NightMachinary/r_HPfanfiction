:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This suddenly popped in my head and I can't for the life of me remember where I read it or what it was called. Pretty much Harry needs a date for the Yule ball and thinks a damsel in distress is the best way to get a girl so he travels universes helping women in peril, but they all end up hooking up with their Canon love interests (they're all fictional characters I think) It's usually they are in a life death situation, Harry pops in and asks them to be his date, they tell him they have other concerns, Harry fixes it, sometimes saving someone who would of died and they tell him thanks but that's my bf/ partner/husband/wife etc...

If anyone could help me find the fic I'd be very grateful

  Harry Potter has achieved immense power, a large bit of craziness, and a desire to seek amusement where he can. This will be a series of stories of him traversing the multiverse solving problems through ways that amuse him. Various crossovers planned.
