:END:
Hi guys! I'm looking for a fix where Harry lives with Snape for a summer and I think they're maybe working to get Harry ready to fight Voldemort, maybe learning Occlumency? But they discover while they are brewing potions together that Harry can sense the rhythm of the potion (he attuned to the potion) and that's why he has a hard time brewing in class.

  When Severus Snape is left in charge of Hogwarts over the christmas break, he is less than pleased to discover Harry will be one of his charges. Events force him to face that Mr Potter may not be quite what he has assumed all these years. Year 6

** I'm not certain but is it linkffn(13357839) ? Does it involve the trio brewing a potion in secret that gets a bunch of elves sick?

If not I'll try looking again, I've read the story you're talking about, but it's been a bit lol

  AU Harry is abused by the Dursleys. he hopes to be able to save himself somewhat through the use of potions since underage magic isn't allowed. Will Snape help or sabotage him? Set after PoA - Snape as mentor - no slash - Abusive Dursleys - No Triwizard tournament and Horcruxes are not a thing. Trigger warning for suicidal thoughts. Graphic violence. COMPLETE
