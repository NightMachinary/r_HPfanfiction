  MARAUDER MEDALS 2016 NOMINEE! She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. An accident throws Hermione back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now, with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over?

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel, the simplest in definition and yet one of the hardest to follow. It was a rule that came down to measuring one's own influence on a time and place, interacting with absolute discretion... And from her first day with the time turner as a third year to her training within the Department of Mysteries, Hermione Granger had understood this.

Sounds like your regular BS excuse for making a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations]]-following, unoriginal-plot story. Is this a stations-following story?

I remember reading one when the Twins stopped Hermione from studying and made her relax with sex but I can't for the life of me remember where it was.
