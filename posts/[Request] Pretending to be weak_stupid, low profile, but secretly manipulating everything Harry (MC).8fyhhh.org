** Harry Potter and the nightmares of futures past?

It diverges from the 6th book. The war lasts another 10 years and everyone except Harry dies. He uses a spell to send his mind back to his younger body. Because time travel reasons, he doesn't want to reveal just how smart/powerful/etc he is. He doesn't quite play stupid, but he pretends to not know a lot of stuff.

** Harry Potter and the Daft Moron has this as it's premise (Harry has a fake persona for his first 3-4 years). Though the fic starts with him showing his 'real self' and it's not handled very realistically: Everyone is totally cool with having been deceived and maintaining fake friendships for years.

Except for the whole subplot of [[/spoiler][Ron going all crazy assassin on him, and failing miserably.]]

It is unrealistic as all hell though. Very, so very tropey.

** Well, it starts at the point Harry stops faking it, but it might qualify as his history at Hogwarts is investigated:

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
