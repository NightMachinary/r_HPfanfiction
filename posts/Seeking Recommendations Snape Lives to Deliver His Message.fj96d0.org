** I somewhat recall one story where Harry magically slams Snape into a wall, asks him why on Earth would he ever believe a word that comes out of Snape's mouth and then cuts him in half.

**** Hmm, okay. I think this one was where the war dragged on for years, with Harry becoming hardened over time. I think Ron and Hermione also left, with Harry carrying out the fight alone. Don't remember why.

**** Sorry, it was a long time ago and I must've thought it wasn't very good coz I haven't saved it (I've made a point to do this with stories I liked).

** Have you considered [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][the seventh horcrux]]? An insane but generally fun and companionable Harrymort grows up, graduates from Hogwarts, and fulfills Voldemort's lifelong dream of becoming the defense against the dark arts professor. And immortal. Dumbledore is dead and Snape is headmaster. Snape, having to deal with Harrymort literally every day until he retires, hates his life and everyone in it.

This is in the epilogue, by the way.
