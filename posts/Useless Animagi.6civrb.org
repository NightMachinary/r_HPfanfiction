Just wondering how many exceedingly useless animagi fics are out there. Not ones where he becomes an animagus then never uses it, but fics where his form is of marginal utility.

Eg: emu, any sort of fish or marine mammal, reindeer, earthworm, etc.

Bonus points if he can turn into an unuseful/suboptimal "magical" creature such as an ochre jelly.

Of course, the crack potential is amazing. Harry becoming an ochre jelly, then being cut in half and cloned when they/he shifts back is an outstanding "power he knows not." You could even justify a harem fic this way, by cloning another Harry every time a woman wants to hook up with him...

I will stop reading my pathfinder manuals now.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** In linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), Hermione's form is some tropical snake. I am not sure I agree with the sentiment, but she was very unhappy about it, saying it is useless in British climate. And yes, this is just one unsubstantial scene of the story.

In another fic (don't remember which one), Ron discovers, during preliminary meditations, that his form is a spider, and forgoes further training not wishing to achieve the transformation.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

*** Its times like this that i really hate not making a fanfiction account until recently.

Around 2010 there was a decent number of "new marauder's (Harry, Hermione, Fred, George, Neville, Luna) learning to be Animagi" stories being put out. The stories i remember reading all made the Animagus form a very spiritual thing and usually played around with like a pack mentality.

These were a ton of the stories that cemented some of the fannon animagi forms still used today. But i distinctly remember reading about Hermione ripping out someones throat as some kind of big cat, Fred and George sneaking into teacher and death eater meetings as Foxes, and many times that Harry did some form of bullshit with either a magical dragon, wolf, raven, or phoenix form.

Hell i remember reading one fic where Fawks saving Harry overwrote Harry's animagus form into that of a phoenix, after that Harry just started using Naruto level wandless fire magic and essentially became an angel by sprouting permanent wings and (i think) the author started using biblical quotes pretty often.
