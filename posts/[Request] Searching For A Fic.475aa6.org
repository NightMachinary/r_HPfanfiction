What's the name of the fic where Albus Severus is a sociopath, I've seen it recommended around here a few times. I remember Rose Weasley featured predominantly.

*** I don't normally read next gen stuff, but this sounds really interesting. Would you recommend it for someone who doesn't care for next gen?

**** Definitely! It's good writing regardless of era and involves a lot of canon subjects if that's your thing. The trick to finding good next gen stories are finding those with plots and characters that can stand on their own, and the story succeeds in that.

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?
