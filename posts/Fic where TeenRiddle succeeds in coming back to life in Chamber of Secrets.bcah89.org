In Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle's memory succeeds in draining Ginny's life-force and recreating his body. He then has to find a way to stop Ghost!Voldie from finding him, entering this newly created body, and taking it over, since he is the main soul. Possibly ends up helping the good guys and becoming a reluctant ally.

Is there such a fic?


** Sounds like this one

Solace in Shadows by the fictionist [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144]]

When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but “anything” can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

  "Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction" Frankly, Tom Riddle thought this was a bit dramatic. After all, what's a bit of major violation of the laws of ethics and magic between friends? This is a tale of a Diary that was a little more independent, and a little less puppy-murderingly evil, than he was really given credit for.
