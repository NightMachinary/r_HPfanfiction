  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

*** Ugh. Tried to start it but the first chapter is really rough so far. Does the writing improve at all? The speech is stilted, with no contractions, and seeing Lockhart, who I suppose is actually future!Harry by this point?, loudly shouting with a red face at Harry and Ron just feels totally out of whack for Hogwarts. Is that an American thing? Do teachers scream at students in front of the school assembly there? The author also talks about a lot of strange assumptions and incorrect conclusions he has about Britain in the Author's Note. It's honestly really bizarre overall.

**** It gets better after a few chapters. Pretty sure the beginning was written by someone else and he picked it up or something. Though I don't quite remember. I remember it being a fun take on it all after a bit. Him taking on the role as Lockhart fully but still being the powerful man that he really is.

** linkffn(3312486).

I'm presuming it's the case in linkffn(6473434), but I haven't read it yet.

And, somewhere in a one-shots collection, there's a story which ends with Lockhart in the Chamber, petrified and bitten, with the basilisk wrapped around him, dead and, I think, petrified. It's determined that Lockhart would die in pain immediately upon being unpetrified, so they have to leave him like that.

** Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos on fanfiction. It has an actual competent Lockhart, but the story is ongoing, updating weekly. It shows him as a competent teacher but is manipulating people against Harry, he's probably only a second year subplot.

It's a great story and I highly recommend reading it, the only real problem I have is it's pretty slow paced becuase it's full of content, he's only a third through his second year at +300k words

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
