What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like?

** Barefoot is the only one I can remember off the top of my head. Though there was one where 7th year Tonks was teaching Harry the Dark Arts or something, can't remember the name.

Canonically, Tonks wasn't in school when Harry was a First year, she is the same year as Charlie, and he wasn't in school then.

** "Old Friends, new friends" has a really good Hogwarts time with Harry and Tonks and especially the first year is heartwarming. It falls off after the third year but until then it is probably the best early Hogwarts Honks story.

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.

** My story darkness ascendant has them meeting pre-hogwarts and bonding over punk music and east coast rap and a high fiving good time at a hard rock concert. There may be romance between them depending on how the various female friends of harry play out as i write.
