  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

It's just not their cup of tea. I've read good slash fics and bad slash fics. For an example: The Veela!Draco fics where, suddenly and without warning, Harry is realized as his "One True Mate" or whatever BS is stupid and insulting. If it's a gradual thing and they work out their differences that's one thing. Going from bitter rivals and (assumed, granted) hetrosexuality to best friends and lovers in the space of a chapter is just poor writing.

**** Okay but clearly they weren't written properly. It has nothing to do with the characters sexuality when one day harry is bickering with whoever then the next they're full on lovers. It's just a sign of bad writing. slash doesn't equal a good story nor does not having slash make it a good story. My cup of tea is a story with a well written plot, good character development, believable love interests and interactions etc. Some of y'all are so quick to find a slash fic as ooc yet can easily stomach a Minerva/Harry fic. Okay.

There's the problem, right there.

For me, the biggest problems with slash is,

- It's usually badly written. Apparently there are a lot of 13-year-old girls with the hots for the actors.

- Unbelievable pairings. Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape are typical pairings. Why do they always have to pair up bitter enemies?

- Often the stereotypical "male/female" dynamic must be preserved, and then we have dominant/submissive characters all over the place. I'm sure it's a fun hobby, but it doesn't feel right in Harry Potter.

- Suddenly, /everyone's/ gay. There's not a straight relationship to be seen, except Filch and Mrs. Norris.

- Young/old relationships are usually creepy. A good author might pull that off, but there are very few of them writing slash fanfiction.

- MPREG. This shuts out about 99% of all readers.

That should cover about 99% of all slash.

*** I can't speak for others, but for me the problem with slash is the feminization of male characters - including, but not limited to:

Frequent long-winded talks about feelings and relationships, long detailed narration of poorly manufactured drama, characters suffering physical/emotional hurt to make them "vulnerable" (and thus provide plot opening for a pairing) and so on and so forth. All this stuff is so over-used that it usually takes like 60% of the story. And it's dreadfully boring to read.

**** I don't understand why this is considered feminisation of a character though, however, I do agree with you that authors usually do have long winded talks about the relationship between slash characters. In my opinion it is because we live in a heteronormative world and authors feel the need to overcompensate to try and inbue realism into the work by setting up characters into vulnerable situations. Though I also feel that such situations can create depth into relationships and makes clear to the reader why these characters are actually in a relationship rather than forced.

*** It's not necessarily about not wanting to read about non straight characters. Some of the same people who refuse to read about Harry in a relationship with another male will happily read Dumbledore/Male. For some, changing a character's sexuality makes them too OOC. I don't agree (have read and written a ton of slash) but I understand it. I personally can't stand harem!Harry. It really goes against my image of him and no matter how good the story is, I am not going to read about a Harry who is going around collecting witches like chocolate frog cards.
