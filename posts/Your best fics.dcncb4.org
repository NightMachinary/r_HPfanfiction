What're your favourite fics and pairings, I'm interested

My fav pairing is Haphne, I don't know why it just is

Fav fics would be linkffn(Three Black Birds) linkffn(Myrddin Emrys Returns) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game) hopefully they work

What are yours? I would love to know

Thanks for reading


** My favorite fic is Linkffn(Vitam Paramus)

Pairings are the literal devil and should be destroyed.

That being said I'll read anything that involves [[/u/Rpeh]] and Virgil Van Dijk

*** Then you're going to love my upcoming story "Harry Potter and the Champions of Europe".

After serious injuries to Joel Matip and Joe Gomez, Klopp turns to the players in the Academy. Who is this raven-haired prodigy with a touch like magic? Can he prove himself to Liverpool's Dutch giant, Virgil. It's a pairing for the ages - but this is a central-defensive pairing.

** Vitam Paramus has already been linked but is definitely my favourite. Linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) by the same author is also excellent and his linkffn(Ithaca) will be incredible if I can break him of his current habit of writing the ending before he's written the first bits.

My favourite pairing is a good plot and good English. It's an unpopular pairing but it always warms my heart whenever I encounter it.

** Favorite pairings: Snily, Honks

Favorite fic overall: linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) This is the fic that made me like the ship. In hindsight, an unique twist in the (very common) SS Peggy Sue in that it drops him /after/ the events that lost him his friend, and rather than basically turning him into a pseudo-Gryffindor, has him try to show Slytherins an alternative path. I'd have preferred the reconcilation to take longer though, with a bigger focus on Slytherin House politics. As a sidenote, I like the alchemy lessons and would like to see more unique lessons in subjects in other fics, something I very rarely see.

Other fics that stand out for various pairings -- not necessarily my favorite fics, but fics I liked:

Hinny: linkffn(Backwards with Purpose) The second fic I ever read (after HPMoR which I found mediocre) and the fic that got me into HP fanfiction.

Haphne: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Importance of Intent) The most recent fic I read out of these, and the Haphne fic I like the most. Most Haphne fics make Daphne basically a gateway to Lord Hadrian-whatever politics silliness, this one does something different.

HPBB: linkffn(Delenda Est) I like the first half more than the second.

Honks: linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) This is the fic that made HPNT one of the pairings I like the most. Unfortunately, every other fic I've seen with it goes something like this -- "omg, you asked for my true form, let's love each other forever".

Loved the importance of intent it's great no more words

And your Hinny fic was good too when I read it before

** no fics to go with this but my favorite pairings are the one's that are written exceptionally. If the author can write out a pairing in a romantically feasible and realistic way, if they can develop the relationship instead of just claiming it's there, if they can accurately show two individuals fighting and choosing to love and care for each-other in spite of the natural frustrations and conflicts that SHOULD arise if a relationship is initiated, then I will enjoy the story. I don't like daphne/harry too much because a lot of the time it feels forced.

That may not be fair to that specific pairing though, after all, almost all pairings are forced anyway.

*** Actually, i've read a couple of fics that really nail the difficulties and drama of Remus/Tonks. good stuff, providing the author doesn't just wash the character and turn them into a despicable being incapable of redeemable action. What's that? you don't like the idea of Ron and Hermione together? You should probably turn Ron into a racist deatheater that only likes Harry and Hermione for their fame and smarts. Honestly, Ron has enough rationable faults to end a relationship without having to make him irredeemable.

*** I can understand why you would feel that some Haphne fics are forced as most of them use marriage contracts as a plot hole to get them together and BOOM there's your perfect pair, soul mates. It's actually sometimes ridiculous and then Daphne is used for Harry to totally destroy everyone at politics because ”she was taught from birth about politicking” or something similar.

#+begin_example
  Right now probably the best Haphne fic is linkffn(Three Black Birds) and it’s being updated every saturday, I like it because it has a pretty real developing relationship but I do have to warn you that it is WBWL so James and Lily are alive and Harry is two years older than his brother and James and Lily treat Harry like shait at the beginning but are warming up to him

      In all fairness it is totally unrealistic how James and Lily treat Harry but I still like it

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux; Where in the World is Harry Potter?; A Black Comedy; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Bungle in the Jungle; Harry the Hufflepuff; Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them; Timely Errors)

And just because I know these are probably already known too well, here are a few different yet fantastic fics I really think deserve more views: linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan; Becoming Neville; Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue; A Walk in Your Shoes by Spirit007; Innocence and Roses; I know not, and I cannot know - Yet I live and I love).

Unfortunately, his pursuits are about to lead him straight back to the daughter he's neglected for 14 years. Semi-AU. DM/femHP. COMPLETED. 02.18.16.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

  She passes him a note because she's bored during Binns' class. It's funny how the butterfly effect works, because a piece of parchment with some ink on it --- a mere relief from boredom --- will now change the outcome of the future war. The tiniest of actions can have the biggest of impacts. [Eventual fem!Harry/Draco; starts Fifth Year; AUish; Will be a LONG story.]
