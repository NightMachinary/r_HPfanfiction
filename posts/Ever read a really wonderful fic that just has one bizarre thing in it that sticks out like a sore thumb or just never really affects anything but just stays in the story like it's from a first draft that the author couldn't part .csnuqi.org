Just read Patron and I swear the "Year of Exploration" is mentioned like 5 times a chapter, minimum.

If you haven't read it this is the year where everyone in Hogwarts wears super slutty clothes and fucks anything that moves, the entire series the characters talk about orgies and how everyone is going to be absolutely mad for Harry and Ron and basically fucking them senseless every single night. Like /everyone/ talks about it, adults, kids, other schools know about it.

Then after like 300k words you get there and...nothing...absolutely nothing. Ron shags two people and Harry and Hermione are perfectly in love and neither has the slightest desire to do anything despite the fact the story makes it clear it's expected of them and it would be weird if they didn't and it would have a huge fallout.

There isn't. Nothing happens. There's no awkward turning people down, there's no fallout, there's no temptation. It's literally just there to show that they don't want to sleep with other people, which isn't a point that needs to be made by creating an entire hyper sexualised year for minors. Instead it's just dating. That's literally it. I just don't get why so much energy was wasted on it.

Decent story around it like, Hermione definitely kills Voldemort though and no real explanation is given for why the Prophecy wasn't relevant even though it exists, and it's a bit OTT with the weird Patron/politics stuff but really well written and fantastic grammar etc. and a good plot, kinda like the Firebird Trilogy but way less rape and better written. No Lady Thief though, to compare to another of Starfox's fics.

Also really makes me appreciate editors, I imagine there's a ton of stuff like that in most books that never sees the light of day from early drafts (like the Slytherin Weasley cousin that JK cut).

But yeah anyone get bothered by other similar things in fics that just don't need to be there?

Same answer as every other Hermione beats Voldemort story.

  Prophecy shmophecy. Either the Triwizard Tournament was the Power He Knew Not (it led to the the destruction of the Horcruxes, after all) or Hermione was. Or Trelawney was using "he" as the English neutral pronoun, the Grangers had a shotgun marriage two months into pregnancy, and Hermione Jane Granger came squalling into the world at the end of seven months of marriage. Or, or, or. The most fabulous thing about prophecies is that any chain of events leading to their fulfillment becomes, retroactively, the One True Interpretation.

*** Marks as his equal is the real kicker of it though.

No story that uses an alternative interpretation with different characters really does it well.

I have different issues with a couple of Starfox5 fics (I do appreciate the frequent change in narrative and the well-written ensemble cast though), but The Marriage Law Revolution is easily my favorite.

** This is very common in stories that are published in serial fashion. People may build up points and characters or come up with ideas that drop out of the narrative as they start focusing on something else.

In order to fix stuff like this, one would have to go back and re-edit the entire story from beginning to end. Most people once they finish a story on FFN aren't willing to go back and do that.

Case in point: SPEW, the entire classes of herbology and astronomy, Aunt Marge, Piers Polkiss, Fluffy and really the entire third floor Corridor. All of these were relevant in precisely one book.

To be fair that's an incredibly common Children's Book trope rather than a major plot point of the entire series. In Patron it would be like if they stopped Sorting around The Half Blood Prince. It's a /huge/ part of the entire story that just...doesn't happen for some reason.

*** Some things are just there to be background and make a story feel complete. I'm mildly amused at the thought of a long series where /everything/ has to matter deeply, or the opposite, where the author won't even name or describe something if it isn't super relevant to the main point of the plot. Imagine if we got like four core classes and then "his other classes" and "the other teachers" for the entire seven years.

I think what the OP means is when something is specifically said to be integral to a later part of plot (which none of those things were, they fulfilled their function within the space they were given) and then dropped.

** Omg every shit “Harry trains in a time dilation” fic our there. Harry learns all these spells, he learns sword fighting, he learns super rare battle mage magic. And then the big fight comes and he uses a couple reductos or whatever and the fights over literally never uses anything that is talked about in the training just uses the simple basic 4th year spells he learns in cannon. Even the well written versions of this trope have the same problem. Also the whole he learns how to wield a katana but then never uses it like why even add that there's a sword already included in cannon just have him carry that around and never use it and you get the same effect.

** One of the bizarrest things I've read in fanfic was from the Serpensortia series linkao3(4913998). It's a well-written fic with lots of thought put into the characters and personalities, but then the weirdness steps in.

In an alternative sorting AU, Harry is put into Slytherin and makes friends with Draco and Adrian Pucey, the Slytherin quidditch team Chaser. The weird part comes up when Adrian, for no explanation at all, turns out to be an Asian girl the whole time, and no one in Slytherin bats an eye at it. Her mother was a Chinese Death Eater, she lives with her very Asian auntie who berates her on her grades, and everyone in the story accepts her existence as normal and nothing out of the ordinary. Which I couldn't suspend my disbelief over, because the defining point of Slytherin House is that they're prejudiced. And in canon, it's not just against blood, but they're sexist and /racist/ racist too.

#+begin_quote
  Angelina, Alicia and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team---who stood, shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.

  "Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?" shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. "Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?"
#+end_quote

.

It felt like an obvious OC (donut steel plz) shoehorned into a canon character's place, and it didn't work for me. It was as jarring as one of this fics where Draco (or whoever) comes out as part-Veela and needs to mate with Harry to fulfill his special Veela soulbond, and everyone within the narrative accepts it as a normal part of worldbuilding.

**** I don't want to open the can of worms (lmaooo) but I do personally believe Pansy's insult came from a place of ignorance and ethnocentrism, and if you don't call it racism, it's at the very least some flavor of xenophobia-based intolerance.

Why did Pansy insult Angelina's hair? Because it looked different. Would she have insulted Angelina had Angelina worn her hair in a straightened, or as they call it in the hairdressing world, "relaxed" hair? Probably not.

Idk, but I just don't how someone, past the age of 10 years old, can look at a black person with cornrow-braided hair, make a deliberate insult comparing its appearance to worms, and have it not be a racist thing.

***** Harry Potter as a series very specifically avoids any real world racial or class issues with Blood Purity as the stand in for all of it. The entire point is that there's no real world discrimination so that all kids from all backgrounds can read it and learn why discrimination off things you can't control are irrelevant.

There's absolutely no way JK would put that in as a racial thing. Also in the UK in general people are less overtly racist like that, I just think it's an insult and one I could definitely see kids using because she has weird, to them, hair rather than an attack on her race. Frankly i'd be more confused by it being a racially motivated thing.

**** It exists as the year teenagers are encouraged to explore their sexualty in a safe and consensual way. Not as some mandatory orgy or wide-spread debauchery. Some will indulge in casual sex, some won't, and most couples will just continue their relationship, as was the case for Harry and Hermione.

Basically, the point for them was to realise that they and only they decided what they would do and don't - and with whom. That was important in a story about caste structures and marriage restrictions. It was not about the sex but the social pressure, imagined or not.

That's my point though. That social pressure does not exist. Not in any meaningful way outside what already exists normally with dating. Frankly it would have been more powerful if there was someone actually interested in Harry just as a normal person and that caused issues.

It also doesn't work when it's built up like that with the slutty clothes and hypersexual society. It makes no sense. Like an orgy would happen regularly if only because people are told it does, it's like in school when people have sex because they think everyone else is except here everyone else actually is.
