** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Dumbledore did the heavy lifting in this war, gave Harry a very enjoyable childhood, and mentored him well.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** Meh I don't see that happening. The moment he brings the stone in the school he endangers all of the students thus he already failed.
