I've been rewatching Torchwood and was wondering if anyone knows of any good HPxTorchwood crossovers (as crossovers seem to have a much higher percentage of badly written fics).

Complete is preferable, no issues with slash (would be hard to avoid with our dear captain Jack) master of death Harry could be particularly interesting with Jack in the mix too :)

  The Torchwood team have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Set between Adam and Reset. Rated T because of Jack Harkness, swearing, mature themes, slash etc... it's Torchwood!
