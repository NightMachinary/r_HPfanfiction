I recently reread Coming Back Late, by alchymie and was wondering if anybody new any fics that were similar?


** I'll look into it. I love "Coming back late" but I can't think of any other involving Harry coming back later.

*** Thank you! And it doesn't even have to be him coming back late. I think one of the things that makes that story so good is the fact that everybody thinks that he is dead, and how he enters back into their lives.
