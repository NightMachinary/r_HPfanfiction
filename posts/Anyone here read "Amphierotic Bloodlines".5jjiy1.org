Is it any good? Reason why I'm asking is that it's pretty much the only larger work of a less popular pairing, so there's really no way of telling whether it's not that popular due to it's quality, or the unpopularity of the ship. I'm also a bit apprehensive of 200k+ fics, because many of the ones I read seemed to have a bad case of /the plot dissolves/ rather than /the plot thickens/

** Well, I had never heard of it prior to your post, but now I'm almost done and really enjoying it, for some reason (I never read slash).

If you want to try it, go for it!
