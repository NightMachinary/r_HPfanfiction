I'd like it if he was a competent wizard. Stories like "forging the sword" for instance. I've read stuff by jbern and things such as "the Lesser sadness" or "the one he feared" by taure or Harry potter and the Unlocked Knowledge by kmfrank.

My other requests are that it not be slash, have good English, no bashing and a darker Harry would be preferred but is not necessary. Thank you!!


** Hm. I'm not sure if I would say that it has a "dark" Harry, but linkffn(Emperor by Marquisblack) certainly has a very ruthless Harry, but he isn't dark in the "lulz-I'm-evil-and-it-feels-good" sense that I see in far too many fics, but more in the ends justifies the means when it comes to pursuing his goals.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  At age six, Harry Potter learned that he can't truly depend on anyone but himself. At age eleven, he was invited to join a world that wasn't quite expecting what it got.

** Lets see if i used the ffbot correctly. The denarion trilogy is a gritty imaginative indy harry story with great fight scenes. Harry's morals are somewhat loose :D. Should be read in the order i posted, not the order the ffbot posted them in.
