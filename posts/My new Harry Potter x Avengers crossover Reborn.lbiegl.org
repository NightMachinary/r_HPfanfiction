SUMMARY: After losing everything he held dear in the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter isolates himself in solitude, survivor's guilt engulfing him. Decades later, we witness the renaissance of a battle hardened Harry Potter as he is reborn in another universe and Fate again gives him the chance to be the hero he truly is.

**** FFNs purpose is to make money, and has even began putting ads in the middle of chapters. They've blocked fanficfare from using their website, because that lowers traffic and therefore ad views.

AO3 is an archive, ran by a non profit. It's really a no brainer.

There are other reasons too, involving author protection, how they respond to DCMA notices, and the like. But the bottom line is money.

***** On a side note, you can use the Android app. I have been using it for five years. And there are no single apps.
