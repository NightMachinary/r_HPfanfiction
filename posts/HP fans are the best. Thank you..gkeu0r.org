I have a popular ASOIAF (Game of Thrones) fanfic on AO3. I am floored and so very honored that people are so into it, but sometimes they're super rude. They'll comment on my HP fics to “get back to Martin” and most of the criticism people leave is ridiculous. It has nothing to do with my writing and more to do with nitpicking things like “this couldn't happen because so&so only had this many men as is seen on line 45 of page 789 of book 5”. And it's not just mine. Some of the comments on ASOIAF fics are ridiculously rude and none of it is about the writing! Criticize the grammar or the world-building or character-building, but don't leave a scathing thousand word comment complaining how it doesn't line up with canon! That's not the point of fanfic.

I don't have any popular HP fics, but I've never gotten anything of the kind on the couple I've posted. Even comments on other fics are really nice when they're criticizing something. I remember reading one on another author's that said something like “hey, I've seen you reposted this, and while the rewrite is better, I see you haven't touched on any of the issues your readers addressed before. This has the potential to be good if you take those into consideration” (and other comments said pretty much the same thing). I thought it was a polite, instructional way of helping another writer.

So thank you all for being awesome! I think it might be one of the reasons there are more HP fanfics than other fandoms.

I'm not in any other fandoms (not enough for fanfic, anyway), so is ASOIAF an outlier and everyone is super nice everywhere else? Or is HP the outlier?


** HP Fanfic is old and popular, it's calmed down with distance from the books I assure you.

** I'd say "super nice" is a stretch, but ASOIAF is 100% the outliner. I've jumped from fandom to fandom more times than I can count, and the asoiaf one is not pleasant at all, especially on twitter.

*** Once on Reddit I explained why Sansa wouldn't wear a hair net to Joffrey's wedding and somebody yelled at me and said it wouldn't make sense. I was thinking “and how does it make sense for only one person in the history of the show to wear a hair net”. Good times.

** Haha, yeah that doesn't surprise me. ASOIAF fans are very protective over the canon.

Whilst I think fans reading HP fanfics are more fanfic fans than HP fans.

** I the ASOIAF is definitely more nit-picky. They want certain characters to be 100% canon and nothing else will do. It's very strange.

*** One of the top fanfics on ffnet is just pages and pages of battle statistics. I don't understand why anyone would want to read that

** ASOIAF world is crazy complex, keeping track of what canon events do to the world is hard; imagine with a fanfic. I think that the only way to enjoy a ff of this world is to ignore the huge world building that will be probably ignored, and it goes against the canon setting.

I just don't think the ASOIAF books are a good area for fanfiction.

** Would you mind linking your ASOIAF fic? I'm just curious. I definitely think the Harry Potter scene has gotten a lot calmer in the last few years, whereas ASOIAF/GOT fanfic has gotten a lot worse due to the extreme reactions to season 8

*** Honestly I couldn't bring myself to write anything because I was so disgusted with the whole affair.

Here's the link. I'm more interested in HP nowadays but I usually try to update like once a month or so. I'm halfway through the next chapter right now.

** I didn't last one month in the ASOIF fandom, between the hardcore fans the books and the fans of different characters. I realized it made me hate the universe more than liking it. So I would say they're more extreme. Some fandoms are like that tbh and others not. /Wink/ star wars /wink/ .What's good with HP is that it's been years since the release of the books/movies so all the tensions decreased a lot. I'm glad you don't get comments like that in your HP fanfics and sorry for the unfair critics you get on your others fics.
