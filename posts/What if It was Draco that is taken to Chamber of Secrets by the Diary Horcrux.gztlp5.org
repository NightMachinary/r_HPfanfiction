Lucius Malfoy fails to plant the diary in Weasley childrens school supplies. He tasks Draco to do it in his stead at hogwarts. Dracos progress is too slow for diaries satisfaction however, and the soul piece in the diary decides to posess Draco instead. Ron and Harry manage to save him at the last minute, Twarthing Riddles plans.

How would this influence the dynamic between golden trio and the slytherin bully? Furthermore, how would it change Dracos relationship with his family?


** Either that's the point that Lucius turns his back on Voldemort or Narcissa divorces Lucius on the spot.

*** I know people love the fanon image of "Narcissa Black", consummate defender of Draco Malfoy, eager to punish Lucius for his mistakes but we just don't see this in canon.

#+begin_quote
  “Don't you dare --- don't you dare blame my husband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.
#+end_quote

Here, she eagerly defends her husband to her sister, even though his failure has led to his putting Draco's life in danger and has resulted in Lucius's reputation being destroyed among the death eaters. Narcissa loves her family, which includes her husband.

#+begin_quote
  “It's all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
#+end_quote

Another example of Narcissa being as quick to defend her husband as her son.

Even more evidence is that Narcissa remains loving to Lucius, even when Lucius threatened the safety of her son in canon with the diary. Though it wasn't Draco in the chamber, he was still at risk of petrification and death.

I find your first statement far more likely that Lucius and Narcissa would turn neutral or turn to the order. That said, if Lucius continued to support Voldemort, not unlikely given their fear of him, I highly doubt Narcissa would leave him. Lucius didn't know about what the diary would do, after all. Complexities of intentions and unknown information may elude many people, but I doubt Narcissa is one of them.

**** I was thinking of the scene in one of the later books where she basically begs Snape to figure out a way to make sure her son doesn't become a killer. She's willing to turn against the Dark Lord in what ways she can if it involves her son being in that much danger. I'd think if Lucius tried to justify it, which I already kind of doubt, she would turn against him too. It took a lot for her to go to Snape and say "get Draco out of this." But if his life were in danger, that could definitely Bea breaking point. The only question left would be if Lucius were with or against her.

** Do Ron and Harry /really/ go to save Draco?

#+begin_quote
  Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole.
#+end_quote

They wanted to do something in canon, so they intended to go to Lockhart and tell him of their suspicions on where the chamber of secrets is. They did not intend to go and rescue Ginny from the start, and that's Ron's sister! They found out Lockhart was a fraud and so then they marched him to Myrtle's bathroom. Now if it's Draco, I find it very unlikely to the point of impossibility that Harry and Ron would ever risk their lives to save Draco in this situation. The risks and unknowns are immense.

This indicates a clear difference between CoS and DH where Harry does save Draco. Note that Harry is older, is in a better position given Harry's knowledge of fiendfyre and is on a broom, and knows the room, and Draco has shown that he is enough of a coward to try and redeem himself.

I think what happens next is that we find out what happens when Draco dies early on.

** "We have to go save him" Harry groaned.

"Do we?" Ron asked in dismay "Do we really?"

Harry paused for a moment before exhaling through his nose and running his hand through his hair "unfortunatley mate, he's a prick, but no one deserves to die like that."

Ron pinched his nose "Fine," he pointed at Harry "But we are going to rub it in his face after!"

Harry chuckled "Hell yea we are"

** I think Narcissa would be furious with Lucius, but I also think he would be just as upset. They are awful people but they seem to care about their son. I think it would be enough they would to try and stop Voldy from coming back, but not change their views. They just will realise that their blood status won't protect them from a crazed dark lord.

** Draco ends up in the Chamber in Survival Is A Talent (by Shanastoryteller) but not on purpose. So it's not the same scenario as you're painting, but there is the scene afterwards with Lucius and Narcissa.

"No, no thank you, I think I'll stay here in this forest..."

"But, my Lord...!"

"I /felt/ Narcissa Malfoy's rage two years ago, horcruxes can't save me now."

  A simple question from Harry during his vault visit in book 1 changes his life, as Harry accesses a family vault. And a stone there that will change his life, even more than finding out he is a wizard did.

** Not quite on point but similar is the second story in the Fates Gambit series. FG2 - The Trio Hit Hogwarts by RobSt. It has Draco given the diary by lucius to plant on another student. However, he fails to do so and decides to write in the diary (for a different reason) and meets Tom. After that it's quickly downhill for Draco.
