** Despite that, James was part of the Gryffindor quidditch team, and IIRC Sirius was a bit of a ladies' man. They were still pretty cool by teenager standards, but obviously they weren't a quartet of 007s, by any means.

** They were teenagers. It is an extremely common thing to have groups of friends and even have nicknames for each other. Even a little talent behind each, in the magical world you just happen to turn into animals.

Sirius Black is really what you mentioned in the title. Pre-Azkaban he was supposedly cool, suave, and a bit awesome. I tend to believe that. His weakness was that he always wore his ego on his sleeve. He couldn't resist seeing Harry off or taking that last duel.

The rest of them aren't like that nor does the story paint them that way, that is just fanfic authors jumping attaching one man to a group of 4.

** You're right that fanfiction authors use this as a license to make them resident badarses with little evidence to justify this characterization. But I think canon is to blame, not fanfiction. Something about the Marauders just doesn't sit well. It feels like JKR is trying to force a conclusion on the reader.
