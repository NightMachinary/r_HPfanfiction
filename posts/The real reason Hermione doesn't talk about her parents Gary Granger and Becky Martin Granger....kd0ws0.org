They may be dentists but they also run Camp Chippewa during summer breaks.

** Hermione doesn't talk about her summers, and for good reason. Her parents may have an over-the-top chipper attitude and passion towards youth recreation, but thankfully, she, does not.

The summer of 1993 is different though. She meets a girl with a weekday for a name who can tell Hermione is not like the rest. They start a unique friendship over more, ahem, alternative topics. Ms. Granger gushes about myths and old books that border the line between muggles and wizards (nothing to directly infringe upon the Statute of Secrecy, mind you) while the weekday girl whispers advice on dealing with mortal foes and how the human body reacts to fear.

When Hermione returns to hogwarts, she's changed. Still her know-it-all self, but sharper, more assured. She doesn't hesitate with her solid left hook to Malfoy's face, lacks any moral qualms about keeping a fraud of a reporter in a jar, like a pest, for months, and while she is cautious about adding the jinx to the DA's sign up sheet and dismayed that she was right, she was vindicated by its success in alerting them to their own Judas.

Years go by and Harry poses the question he's thought about but never really put weight into asking. He knows Hermione pens letters to regular correspondents, but he was never able to figure out who would use a giant black vulture. The creature was imposing, to say the least, and not a common bird used for wizarding communication. When prompted, Hermione merely replies it is from a friend from her summers back home. Her mumbled replied was off, but Harry didn't push, for whatever Adams she was talking to on Wednesday was her own business.
