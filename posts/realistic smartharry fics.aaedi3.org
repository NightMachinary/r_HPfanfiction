Are there any fics where Harry's intelligence is a focus which aren't unrealistic or OP Harry? canon Harry isn't exactly erudite or massively into schoolwork, but he's pretty bright and seems to be capable when he pushes himself. I like the idea of a fic going into Harry's potential and how that might've been smothered by the Dursleys or perhaps a touch by Hermione & Ron's influence, but most of the fics that feature an intelligent Harry have him be an unchild-like prodigy who starts inventing new forms of magic at age 12, or where he goes to the library once and skims like 3 books and miraculously finds the exact spell to solve his problems. are there any fics where Harry's intelligence is a major theme which still keep him as a relatively normal child? perhaps with him taking a different subject in 3rd year and becoming interested, or someone noticing his potential? the problem of potions by wyste I think does this in a way I like. harry's got a reason to be into potions, and isn't a super-genius or unrealistically talented, he just works very hard and has passion. linkao3(10588629)

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

****** Well, it does have one obvious problem: the sequel isn't finished yet! 9/10, will recommend.

I haven't read Cursed Child, but I'm guessing Snape was named godfather and that's why his memory returned when he heard that Tom and Bella were dead. So he wasn't really lying when he said Minny was his, and in the context of "Do I have to go hunting for her parents?" it was true, but he was deliberately misleading.
