I always thought he would elect to enlist in the military to get away from the Dursleys as soon as he could.

** When I was at school we watched this series of kids growing up - they filmed them every 7 years and asked them questions about life, it was a sociological documentary. There was this one kid that said "I like having adventures and travelling, so when I grow up I'm going to be an astronaut, or a bus driver." I don't know why, but it's been my headcanon that Harry said something like that to his teacher as a seven year old.

*** I tend to think that Lily would have wanted her child to have a connection to the Muggle world so she would have been sure he was registered at birth, and everything else presumably would come from that. Even if the Dursleys refused to give him his birth certificate, I imagine Petunia at least kept it (tucked very deep away where no one will stumble across it accidently, because she realises it's important but like hell does she want it /found/) and I expect Harry would probably steal it eventually.

The Dursleys probably didn't bother ever getting him a passport; baptismal records would depend on whether Lily and James did it and, if not, whether Vernon and Petunia would think him worth it; but I don't doubt they made sure his NHS registration was sorted because there was no way the Dursleys would spend any penny on his healthcare that they didn't have to. The custody issue I don't know enough about to say.

I'm curious as to how things might have changed between Harry and the Dursleys if Hogwarts wasn't an issue. Stonewall High was a state school, so Harry would have been at Privet Drive, living with Petunia and Vernon during the school term, while Dudley was away at boarding school. They still wouldn't have liked him, obviously, but I do think not having Dudley around all the time is still going to change the dynamics of the relationships between everyone.

Personally, I think Harry would aim for uni rather than the military in order to get away from the Dursleys. As soon as he realised university was his way out of Privet Drive he'd have started researching what he needed for it: grades, money, etc. When it came to matters of cost, he'd have (a) studied hard in hope of getting a scholarship, (b) found out everything about loans and what he might be applicable for, and (c) started getting jobs ASAP. I can imagine he might keep the military as a back up option if university doesn't work out, but for some reason I just can't see it as his first choice.

**** I thought the same but my headcanon is him going military first to pay for university. Not sure how it works in the UK but in the US there's the GI bill that will pay for service personnel to attend university.

***** It's possible we've got something similar, but our fees are cheaper in general. Also, I don't know if it was in effect in at the turn of the century, but by the time I went to uni in '07 we only had to start paying back students loans once you're earning a certain amount a year. As such, the money issues probably wouldn't be such a big deal to him as they seem to be to US students.

**** Only problem with uni (other than money) is they don't usually offer housing over summer, even if you're taking summer classes. Well, in the US. Getting enough funding for tuition, dorm fees, books, personal needs, /and/ summer sublet would be a real challenge.

The military would provide housing until you left, so that might have more appeal.

***** From what I recall of my own shortlived uni days, students weren't allowed on-campus housing in the summer, but this was primarily given towards first year students anyway. Second year onwards you were generally expected to live off-campus; uni's tended to have low rent housing in the vicinity that were geared towards students, and it wasn't uncommon to move in as early as immediately after your first year. I distinctly recall at least one day in March/April when the student union was out on the campus giving information to first years about that kind of thing. Friend-groups tended to rent together, and if not there was likely to be someone who had a room they needed filling and another housemate to split the rent with.

I may be wrong, but I think UK student loans do gear towards tuition AND housing. I have a feeling those loans might be dependant on family income, in which case Harry will have trouble because the Dursleys seemed fairly well off, but if not then I don't think he'd have too much trouble. He'd probably still go for a job to keep some money in his pocket, and once someone points out any benefits he might be eligible for then I think he'd take full advantage of them (and once he's over 18 and can say that the Dursleys have kicked him out and he's essentially homeless, as they undoubtedly would, he'd probably be eligible for more), but he wouldn't be in as dire straits as I gather a poor person in the US is when it comes to higher education.

I get the idea of a military job being a source of income to help out, and its definitely a possibility, but as [[/u/waylandertheslayer]] said, opinions in the UK towards the military vary. Harry's opinion towards it would largely depend on the Dursley's opinion -- namely, it would probably be the complete opposite of whatever the Dursleys felt.

****** At the moment, you can get enough student loans for the course + student accomodation with a little left over (even if your parents/guardians are wealthy) - if you have either a part-time job or don't spend much you can easily get by, and if your parents/guardians make less than I think Â£40k per year, you get extra money including some grants. Student housing still works pretty much the way you described it.

****** Well, if thinking of how much loan funding he'd be eligible for, I don't recall if I heard of this in the UK, but, in the US, you can declare that your family will not support you and be evaluated in terms of your own finances. While this can definitely be helpful if you're estranged or own your own (and has the potential for a loophole if you like, but... who does that?), it can also go the other way. Some families have really messed up their kids by giving their income levels to estimate how much financial aid the kid would need, then left the kid out to dry when it came to pay the actual bill, leaving them to scramble.

I'd like to think that Harry would've snuck out to fill out his financial paper work and applications (military or no), partially out of fear (and some logic, frankly) that the Dursleys would do this.

*** I'm not sure how the vital records office works in the UK. But if Harry had any ID (a big if), with his name and birthdate he should be able to get a new copy of his birth certificate.

Providing he wasn't born at St. Mungo's, of course.

** You mean what he had planned? Basically nothing. Nothing against him, as he was an abused 10 year old, but if he hadn't gotten that Hogwarts letter he would have kept on trudging through life, living under the stairs, until either flipping out and shooting up a school, or killing himself.

*** Yeah, I don't think he had any plans for his future. Harry's not that type of person in general and also he was a child. I think he would have trudged through Stonewall and then ended up with a job by pure accident. I could see him doing well in a pet store or some sort of animal care.

** I don't think he'd enlist. It's a possibility, but in the UK there's different attitudes towards the Army than in the US, and (I think) more support for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, with more affordable University loans and free healthcare, for example. A lot of answers seem to come from US culture, which will skew what you'd expect.
