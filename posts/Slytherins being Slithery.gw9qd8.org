"Umm. What are the houses at Hogwarts?" Harry asked, shyly. He didn't want to come off as ignorant but he felt that he should ask. A lot had changed for Harry in a few days time and he wanted to be prepared.

"Well." Ron said, pausing to gulp down his sandwich. "There are four houses. Gryffindors are the house of the brave; Hufflepuff is the house of the loyal; Ravenclaw is the house of the knowledge seekers and..."

"Honestly, Ronald." Hermione butt in. She had already read Hogwarts, A History and knew that it wasn't as cut and dry as Ronald Weasley was making out to be. "The four houses point to a particular trait does not mean..."

"And Slytherins, mate." Ronald grew serious and as his eyes grew somber. "They are something else." He remembered the twins and how they no longer cursed Slytherins or pranked them.

"No matter what Harry." Ron grabbed Harry's arm and a smidge of sandwhich crumbs stuck to Harry's long sleeved t-shirt. "Don't talk to them. Don't meet them. Stay away from them." Ron said quickly as he remembered how the twins had changed. He knew his brothers for ten years and in just two years at Hogwarts, they had completely changed.

"Slytherin is the house of Ambition." Hermione said, irritated at being interrupted. "It does not mean..." Just then the door slid open and in came the blond boy with his two lackeys - Crabbe and Goyle.

"I heard that Harry Potter is in this compartment?" Draco inquired politely. Not quite used to the Slytherin conditioning, he was rough around the edges. He should've knocked first but after so many carriages, he grew frustrated.

Harry waved his hand, feeling embarrassed.

"Thank you for your sacrifice." Draco repeated the phrase automatically. He had practiced this before and was pleased that he said it without a hitch. "I know it must've been painful to grow up without parents. But your effort saved many lives."

"No. Don't listen to them Harry!" Ron exclaimed as he saw the visible effect Draco's words had on Harry. He moved to close Harry's ears and proceeded to speak loudly.

"They're just words Harry. They lure you in with words!"

Draco's lip curled up in disgust but then he remembered the manners he had been taught and smiled benignly.

"Red hair. You must be a Weasley." Draco said ignoring the slight against him as no one had introduced themselves to them. To be fair, he hadn't introduced himself. He blamed Weasley for that as he was just about to do so.

"Yeah. What off it?" Ron got up aggressively.

"Well, its good of one of you to be in our year." Draco automatically said, struggling to say something positive. The next words came out on their own.

"You know, personally I don't identify with the family's philosophy but I guess we all have something that we believe in." He was momentarily proud of coming up with something like this. He attributed this to his upbringing.

"You have something against what my father thinks?" Ron said, somewhat cooling down from being confrontational.

"What I mean is that I'm glad that you are in our year. A lot of people died and there haven't been a lot of kids my age. I just had one or two friends growing up. It would've been so nice if there were more." Draco was proud of how he handled the confrontation and saw the aggressive politeness doctrine work first hand. "Say is that a rat?"

"Yeah. What of it?" Ron said defensively.

"Good on you mate. I don't even have a pet." Draco gave a compliment. Ron's shoulders relaxed and he gave an involuntary smile feeling pleased. He suddenly recoiled, growing horrified.

"No. No. No!" He said clutching his ears. "I won't be influenced by you!" He shouted.

"Ron! You're being rude!" Hermione said. "They've been nothing but nice."

"Thank you, Miss." Draco bowed his head, looking bashful.

"Granger, Hermione Granger."

"Well, I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Draco Malfoy and I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. I hope we all make our houses proud, where ever we end up." He turned and gave a look to everyone and left the carriage.

"See you Harry!" Crabbe waved as he exited behind Draco.

"See you Weasley." Goyle said as he gave a short nod and closed the compartment door.

"They seem okay." Harry muttered, looking strangely at Ron.

"No! That's what I'm telling you. They... They..." Ron shut his mouth as he saw the two people in the compartments were not paying attention to him. "They use words to get at you." He said softly.


** Slytherins, but they are actually cunning

** Ok, good prompt, but when I read it, the first thing I imagined was Slytherins slithering about like actual snakes. Not like they're snake animagi or they metaphorically "move like snakes," I'm talking straight-up ordinary human Draco Malfoy inexplicably sliding around on his belly for no goddamn reason. /Why/ my brain went there, I have no idea.
