Looking for some FanFiction with a plot of the bad guy as just background, not really paid attention to. similar to linkffn(make a wish) or really any like RorschachÂ´s Blot works. Doesn't have to just be humor or parody, I would like Completed works only, and if there is romance then no slash please. looking for something around 90k+ words Don't mind bashing, or redemption stories. No Dark!Harry please.


** For Clarification:

Do you want a fic where there is no main "evil" or conflict? Or a fic where that evil is not Voldemort?

*** It can have evil, or conflict, just not the big focus of the story. Id rather read Harry roams around having zany adventures.. then oh crap i forgot about Big Evil #X hold on a sec bang ok done lets get back to wacky adventure now. Something that has good character building/ world building/ new way to explain magic.

**** linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force; I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) In Havic, Harry's contact with the Big Bad amounts to killing his apprentices and ramming a bludger in his plan, while ISHFWILF has him only doing the latter, only with even more bludgers, like, enough to turn an invasion fleet into space wreckage.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** In linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor by Achille Talon), he kinda sorta gets trapped along with Quirrel on the way to get the Philosopher's Stone in the first year. It's not completed, but it's pretty slice-of-life and being written at a good clip, so just pretend that it's several completed books.

** I don't remember it right now but if you're interested ill go find it, but there's an Avengers crossover where Harry gets taken in by Natasha as a kid. Theres a smattering of plot taking place during the first Avengers movie but a big part of it is Harry training with Natasha, and his friendship/pseudo parent figure relationship with her and Hawkeye. Then in the very last chapter there's a super quick recap of Harry going undercover at hogwarts, killing Voldemort and a few death eaters, then going back to his life with SHIELD

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** Nope! Harry is struck blind by the killing curse, so Dumbledore doesn't accept him to Hogwarts when he turns 11. However, he ends up using magic to see early on, so he just experiments on his own instead. Hermione joins later in the story and he ends up coming to Hogwarts as a visiting student later.

It's very magic-as-a-science though, which I know isn't too everyone's taste
