Rules. Goes through order of the Phoenix and beyond

Set during the quest to kill torak when they are in the land of daemon worshippers

The belgaraid characters end up in the Harry potter universe ( belgarion belgrath polgara ce nedra and silk)

They join the order

Garion and ce nedra end up going to Hogwarts The sardion must come into voldamorts possession at some point (someone suggested it become a horrcrux)

The ministry is still corrupt and therefore does not recognize belgarion or ce nedra as royalty

Harry must still be the one to kill voldamort

Parrings are up to you (no slash though)

Optional voldamort becomes a sorcerer If so harry can gain the elder wand earlier in Canon Nice helpful snape

Sirius lives

Other than that have fun! I really really hope someone does this challenge because it's something I've been wanting to read for a long time and people seem interested in the idea :)
