I dont know if this sort of fic already exists, so sorry if it does (please link it if you can). The idea is a young Harry finds himself completely separate from other humans, and so goes on a quest to understand what it is to be human. He could start anywhere, and do anything really. A few ideas: he goes to a war torn place and asks a soldier/terrorist/freedom fighter if fighting is what it is to be human. He could meet a spy and ask if being deceitful is what it is to be human. Etc. Etc. The ppint is that he changes lives as he moves along, slowly discovering what it is to be human. In the end he could do whatever you want, I havent thought that far ahead. Please discuss your ideas for the prompt!


** For some reason this make me think of an old movie.

I imagine that this story starts with Freak hearing the story of pinochio, he wished to love and be loved like a real boy. But no blue fairy came, no jiminy cricket. He probably missed the memo. He'll just have to look for the fairy himself, so he could ask how to be a real boy.

Aunt and uncle doesnt like questions, maybe others will tell him how to be a real boy or where to find the blue fairy. He probably have to stray from his path to school first.
