I'm looking for a fanfic I read where Lockhart's memory charm works and Harry loses his memories. The first chapter starts with Harry talking to Snape and becoming reluctant friends because Snape doesn't treat him in a special way.

Let me know if I should post this elsewhere. Thanks in advance! Have a lovely day!
