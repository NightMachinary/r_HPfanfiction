I swear I read one a while back and it was really well done - wasn't overt (just subtle references to orange tanned skin and and entertainment career.. the 'big reveal' of his name isn't until towards the very end) and the fic itself was really well done and I remember I enjoyed reading it. Does this ring a bell for anyone?

I can't imagine this is a popular tie in, but any other HP fics where Trump is president? Help me assimilate this horrible awful news the best way I know how (by immersing myself in HP fanfic)

** [[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afanfiction.net+potter+%22donald+trump%22][Google]] tells me that a number of people have been writing fanfics that include Donald Trump in some way in the past year. Just skimming a few, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11434413/1/Love-Trumps-All][this one]] popped out at me:

*** hmmm, yeah the focus wasn't on Trump at all, it was just that Harry had to interact with global muggle political leaders due to the crisis and it just /happened/ that Trump was pres. It wasn't the focus.
