i thought that Harry and Narcissa were both leading their Family Business and start at some Point meeting, possibly discovering common interests and so having a Business Relationship. If they stay just Business Partners, that would be fine, but im interested, if they start to be attracted to the other and get intim.

​

This can happen in Canon as well, but i would be more (or also) interested in Time Travel or dimension travel fics that have Harry meet Narcissa either Younger or as a different Person (some similarities might be still there).

A "not evil" Bellatrix that sees Harry as attractive and flirting with him or even more is also welcomed by me. If they do it just once or more doesnt matter. If Narcissa would catch them at some point, she wouldnt mind, as their Realtionship would be just Business...atleast to a certain Point.

​

However, whether both of them or just one develop deeper feelings for the Partner or it just stay on Business (attractivity and possible sex should be included) i would be fine with both.


** These are some Harry/Narcissa ones: linkffn(Purebloods and their tedious traditions; Your love is all the magic I need; The house of healing souls)

And there are more Harry/Bellatrix fics than I've had hot dinners. Linkffn(Stepping Back; Delenda Est) If you want more just shout.

Edit: I just started reading one of those and some are definitely NSFW.

  Before Harry can get rid of many of the irrelevant traditions that hinder the magical world, first he must embrace them. Harry/Narcissa/Daphne. Contains smut and a little bit of Ginny bashing.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** i dont mind NSFW and Harry/Bellatrix doesnt matter either, but Harry/Narcissa should stay in the Focus as in my Request. Harry/Bellatrix would just be an option, but its not necessary.
