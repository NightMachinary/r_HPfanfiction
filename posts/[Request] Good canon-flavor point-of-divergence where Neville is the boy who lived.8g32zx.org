I've looked around for anything where Voldemort turned left instead of right and made Neville the target of the prophecy instead of Harry, but so far all of the summaries I've seen seem to have some other premise, like being a Dark!Harry or focusing on him ramping up a particular obscure magic or stuff like that. I was wondering if there was anything out there that just focused on saying “what would most likely happen as a result of this?” And focuses on how that changes the canon story while preferably following Harry as he goes to Hogwarts and gets caught up in the plot anyways? Sorta along the lines of how Weasley Girl handled its own AU, so to speak.

#+begin_quote
  -COMPLETE- One morning Harry wakes up in a different world. His parents are alive and Neville bears the scar. Things are different and Harry starts to like that the weight of the world isn't on his shoulders. Neville may not be able to bear that weight.
