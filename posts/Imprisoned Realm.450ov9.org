Go read this. Seriously, it's awesome! If you like war fics, Harry-centric, dimension-hopping, unpredictable-Voldemort, new takes on Overpowered-Harry, or light-on-romance fics, you'll really, really, really enjoy this. Not to mention that the writing is top notch. So wait are you waiting for? The next fanfic to suck you in is only a click away!


** I don't mean to give the wrong impression here, because I'm still sort of actively reading this fic as it comes out, but be warned.

This fic is extremely grimdark, and goes to some really horrible places. Rape, murder, and treachery are literally the name of the game here.

*** Very true. Sorry, I thought the warning in the fic would suffice.

**** Oh, they do, it's just a case of me, being willing to read a lot of stuff, has had to put this fic down and come back to it later a few times. I would normally disregard that warning in most cases.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry and a war hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

What is "M" the equivalent of? NC-17 or NR?

*** You know, I always assumed M was NC-17, but I don't actually know.

*** Not really. She's alive, but it's very minor up until the last few chapters.

Honestly, you could argue that she's done the sensible thing for someone in her position.
