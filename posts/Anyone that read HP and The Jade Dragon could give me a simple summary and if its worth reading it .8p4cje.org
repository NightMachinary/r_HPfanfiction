My fav pairing is Harry/Daph, so if this is a bad one, I wouldn't want to read.


** Not a lot of actual Harry/Daphne present, save for some scenes and a single chapter. As for the story, Harry and Hermione basically go to "magical college", if you consider Hogwarts highschool.

So all the content is original a long with a washlist of OC's. There's a lot of fluff, the writing is in my opinion a bit uninspired.

As for relationships, it's basically some sort of upcoming harem, with Hermione taking the center stage with possible up to like 5-6 girls on the side.

I found the story interesting at first, but these days, I only skim through new chapters in a minute or so.

*** Oh, well, that's sad. I've run out of nice and romantic stories to read, considering I do have a limited filter. I just can't read H/Hr or slash fics, so my fic pool is quite limited.

Been looking for those fics that I had previously thought to be either bad or not appealing to me, and Jade was one of those that poped up.

**** I know that feeling, I'm the same, no Slash/HHr and I'm not a big fan of H/G..
