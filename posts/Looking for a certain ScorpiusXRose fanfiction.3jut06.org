I read a good fanfiction a long time ago, which I recently felt like rereading. But I can't find it... could you help me out? I vaguely remember some things:

- it was a second-gen fanfic, with Rose and Scorpius as the lead characters.
- it was probably rated mature, as there were some sexual scenes.
- It's fairly long.
- it started out on hogwarts, but I'm pretty sure Rose gets her own apartment at some point?
- there was one scene where one of them, I think Rose, decides to learn to play the piano? Because the other one already does it? Not sure here.

If you have any idea, even it it's vague, hit me up. I might misremember something, and besides, I'm always up for something new to read.

Thanks!


** No clue about your ISO, but the Stygean trilogy by Slide is outstanding.

*** Aw, too bad. I'll take a look at the trilogy, though.

** I'd probably start the search over on harrypotterfanfiction.com - that's where most of the good next gen fics are.
