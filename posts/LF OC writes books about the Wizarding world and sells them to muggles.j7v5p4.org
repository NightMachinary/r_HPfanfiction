:END:
So, I'm looking for this one fanfiction I've read some time ago and I'm not sure where to find it. Basically it's about an OC (who thinks they are a muggle) that writes about the Wizarding world and is brought in front of the wizengamot because of the statute of secrecy. And somehow it turns out they aren't a muggle but a squib or something? It could be a SI story as well, but I'm not sure.

If you know it, please help ~ Thanks
