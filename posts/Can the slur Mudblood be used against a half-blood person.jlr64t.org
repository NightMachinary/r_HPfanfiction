** I don't think so. I mean, I suppose someone could, but I don't think anyone in canon ever used the word to refer to a Half-blood.

Interestingly enough, I don't remember any Half-bloods being called "blood traitors" either.

*** That's why I was wondering about it. I don't remember it being used that way, but hypothetically, it could work? Since it's about having "dirty Muggle blood"... I also think "blood traitors" should work, I guess? Do you think using it in a fanfiction would be correct? I'm a bit hesitant about it being wrong... Would it bother you if you read someone calling a half-blood Mudblood?

**** Well, it wouldn't bother me, per se, but it's commonly assumed that the word only refers to Muggleborns; using it for a Half-blood might suggest poor knowledge of canon (unless, of course, there is some sort of explanation in the text as to why the character chose to use this particular word).

There has actually been a discussion here a couple days ago about what insults might be used against Purebloods and Half-bloods. I remember "mongrels" being suggested for the latter; personally, it reminds me of Gilgamesh a little too much, but I suppose it's an option.

***** Thank you for your opinion. I agree with you, it might sound like a mistake ... hard to find some adequate insults. I went to look at the discussion you mentioned, and it was really helpful! Yeah, I'm not much into "mongrels" too, but I quite like "mutt", as I feel it's more agressive while still fitting well to the idea. Will definitely sound harsh in a fight. Thank you very much!

** You can use whatever slur you want against whoever you want, if you're trying to insult someone. If its remotely close to on-target, its a more powerful insult.

Calling a half-blood a mudblood is a very accurate insult- they've got half-blood and half mud, so they're a mudblood.

Plus, you've got to take into account the person who would be saying something like that. Would they really be concerned with how correct their words are, or would they just be spewing vitriol and hate?
