I came across a challenge fic where the author was self inserted and woke up as Gilderoy Lockhart courtesy of this sub's recommendations. It got me wondering what the most challenging POV to wake up in and try to help things along would be (while, of course, not getting caught out as a dimension traveler.) For instance, I suspect that waking up as the diary form of Tom Riddle would be a very uphill struggle for existence.


** Hermione's mom, just after the first time her daughter performs accidental magic at age seven.

Full memory of the books and movies, and of your past life. Nothing of Mrs. Granger's life. Because they just Oblivated you, poorly, and now you are someone else and you don't even know what your (her) husband's phone number is. Or even his name. Or your name, because that wasn't in the books. But you do remember your daughter's accidental magic and the wizards who screwed up casting that spell on you. And an entire other life.

You also don't have any magic. You are really and truly a Muggle. And no one will ever, /ever/ listen to you in the magical world. You only have your daughter's connection to book events for now. There's a problem, though.

You don't /feel/ the emotional link to your daughter; you don't remember Hermione growing up or her birth. You have a great deal of affection for her /as a character/ (you were a fanfic reader and shipped her /hard/, which is now really weird). You do have a chance to rebuild a strong, emotional connection while caring for her as her mother, if you don't screw it up. But you aren't there yet. And she's /very/ smart and will quickly notice you don't actually know or care for her. A crushing emotional blow to a seven year old.

Your husband, who loved Mrs. Granger very much, is also a complete stranger. And sort of a widower, in a way. The old Mrs. Granger is, effectively, dead, but from his point of view you are her and crazy or badly injured.

Oh right. And you were a man in your past life, but now have the body, hormonal balance, and sex drive of a woman. Unlike most shitty fanfic, this isn't shown as some sort of a horrible curse or a bitter trial or something. Being a woman isn't /bad/ or inherently negative.

But it isn't what you were before, and the change is psychologically devastating. That doesn't mean your personality is totally changing, just that you've got to deal with the possible gender dysphoria. This is sort of the reverse of the usual IRL, where someone is dissatisfied with the body they were born with, feeling they would be happier as a different sex. As you have memories of happily being male, but are very definitely in a female body with normal hormone levels, the decision is a little foggier.

You're going to have to deal with all that while making your cunning master plans. Do you shatter your family by refusing to be married to a man who loves the person you were and trying to get gender reassignment treatments, in the UK, in the late '80s/early '90s? Do you pretend to have feelings for people you simply don't have while attempting to live a lie in a body you don't know or, at least initially, like?

To top it all off, you can't do your job any longer because you can't remember how (you aren't a dentist), so your family's standard* of living is taking a nosedive. And you can't remember any of Mrs. Granger's friends or family. So your Muggle life is completely screwed up.

But you /do/ remember Harry Potter's address. And the address of a certain grim old place. And the general location of a hidden pub that you might be able to find with your daughter's help. There's also the name of a small town with a dark history and a very significant graveyard.

And you have four years to help a little girl who doesn't remember she can do magic, but has the potential to be the greatest witch of her age, get ready to go to school with the Dark Lord as a teacher. And then a basilisk. And then a crowd of soul-sucking demons.

Eventually, the magical world will start attacking Muggles like you at will. They'll then begin rounding up Muggle-born like your beautiful daughter. Unless you do something starting /now/, you don't really have a chance long-term. You can't ride out canon events. Canon Hermione's mother was /almost certainly/ not severely mentally ill -- which is what she and everyone else thinks now, regardless of what choices you make.

Good luck.

*** You don't pull punches, do you?

That said, I think that the best you can do in this case is to contact Dumbledore; give him a Pensieve memory dump of what you know; have him or McGonagall tell Hermione the truth, because it's the least bad option [1]; and wash your hands of the matter; also, maybe see if Dumbledore can hook you up with some magic for the body and mind issues, in either direction.

Of course, this assumes that you are, in fact, in Potterverse, so, for example, Voldemort's horcruxes are where you think they are.

Now, you might ask,

#+begin_quote
  "turbinicarpus, I just wrote that 'no one will ever, ever listen to you in the magical world'. If you try to so much as acquire a postal owl before Hermione gets her Hogwarts letter, you will be Obliviated at best."
#+end_quote

To this, I answer,

#+begin_quote
  "Go to Privet Drive, and look for the house with all the cats. Therein, you will find Arabella Figg, who has a direct and confidential line to Dumbledore."
#+end_quote

Because, honestly, you are not smarter or more powerful than Dumbledore; your only advantage is information, and Dumbledore can make better use of that information than you.

[1] This might be a suboptimal move, as it might lead to a Dark Lady Granger by giving her a grudge against the wizarding world ("Hello. My name is Hermione Granger. You effectively killed my mother. Prepare to die."), but, again, considering how unpredictable the consequences of /any/ course of action with respect to Hermione are, again, it's probably the least bad option.

**** I hate those "ask an evil gene for wishes and I'll shit on them for fun" types of things, but I don't think you've thought this one through.

The pensive clearly uses magical memories. Those memories can be stored in a jar, and are extracted without a spell, simply removed from a magical person's head. I'm just a Muggle. I don't think that will work. Otherwise, Hermione would have used it as at least a backup on her parents, just in case her spell wasn't as reversible as she thought.

It isn't even clear that Legilimency works on me. Harry doesn't know how it works, and he used it back at Snape without even casting the spell. That /strongly/ implies that there is something magical going on in the /receiving/ person's head.

My brutal-world view (and what anyone rational should consider) would be that it might not work on Muggles, and you can't risk your life based on the idea that it would. Maybe once Hermione can verify a few things...but that comes /years/ from now.

--------------

Also: you are a Muggle. If you show up at Mrs. Figg's and boff it, you might get Obliviated and forget your daughter is a witch until she's eleven. And if you forget /everything/ about and related to magic, you. Are. *Fucked*.

Even if you succeed, you might be fucked. You simply can't risk the very real chance that Dumbledore will listen to what you say, tell you he either can't confirm it or he'll do his best, and then (AS REQUIRED BY LAW) Obliviate you again.

You can't risk another Obliviation. Who knows what it would do.

#+begin_quote
  Because, honestly, you are not smarter or more powerful than Dumbledore; your only advantage is information, and Dumbledore can make better use of that information than you.
#+end_quote

Ehh...Dumbledore might be more /knowledgeable/ than I am, at least about magical things, but I'm much, /much/ more rational than someone spouting things like "for the greater good" with a straight face. He might, even in canon, simply be going senile. You just don't know. I also suspect he has a strong "wait and see" bias, which doesn't help you. As well as other biases.

For all Dumbledore's talk, he doesn't seem to have any Muggle or Muggle-born friends, even amongst Muggle-born students' parents, does he? I expect that even in the best case, you'll get shut out instantly, simply for being a Muggle. And likely Obliviated of the dangerous knowledge of the horcruxes.

--------------

I simply do not see why getting an early start on killing the horcruxes before year one is worth risking your life, just to put things into he hands of a man who suspected horcurxes for /fifteen years/ before acting. By looking up old student records.

What if Dumbledore really, really believes in the prophecy, and simply won't allow anything to mess with it? Certainly not a crazy Muggle woman. Dumbledore in canon is clearly not evil or grossly incompetent, but he might be patriarchal, secretive, domineering, and just as bigoted as the Weasleys about Muggles. I love all the times Hermione's parents are invited over in...oh, wait...

***** These are all real risks. However, every single possible course of action carries risks. Maybe you will mess up with Hermione and be killed by a burst of Accidental Magic like, say, Dumbledore's mother was; or get hit by a car. Perhaps I am insufficiently imaginative, but I simply do not see a course of action with a better expected outcome (or, if you prefer, higher probability of an acceptable outcome). You've stacked the deck against the SI (as requested), and I would argue that you've stacked it to the point that, yes, going straight to Dumbledore is the least bad approach.

On the actual probability of these risks, I think that there is no plausible interpretation of Dumbledore's character that would hear "horcrux" from the lips of a Muggle and wouldn't, at the very least, take a moment to inquire as to how said Muggle learned of such things. His beliefs on the prophecy are stated in canon: he believes that Voldemort gave it power by choosing to act on it. And, on passivity, he did not hesitate to go after horcruxes when he knew where they were.

Now, mind you, if you actually found yourself in such a situation, you would probably want to first ascertain that you were, in fact, in canon Potterverse. For example, if you were, in fact, in HarryCrowverse, you probably /would/ get Obliviated by Dumbledore, so you might want to, instead, see if you could get Hermione adopted by the goblins, because it's the only way she's getting any sort of agency. Not sure how your actions would be affected if you were in WitchQueenverse instead.

Fair enough, though it's more likely that she simply didn't have a Pensieve handy. Still, look on the bright side: it's a reason for Dumbledore to not Obliviate you.

#+end_quote

Nah, that's fair. Except, of course, that's my shitty memory if I am at fault, not my rationality. Maybe I'd make a better Dumbledore than you might think. I might forget to check on a little orphan for a decade, too.

Anyway, if I remember correctly, he rejected /his boyfriend's/ greater good, the one that involved ruling over Muggles with a magical meritocracy and force, if needed. Not the doctrine as a whole. Harry certainly didn't think so.

From the letter to Grindelwald in book seven:

#+begin_quote
  We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)
#+end_quote

Same book:

#+begin_quote
  Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?"

  A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

  "I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione.

  "Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?"

  "Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!"
#+end_quote

Harry says, Dumbledore didn't tell him to hide, because "sometimes you've got to think about the greater good."

Dumbledore's brother and even Harry seem to think Dumbledore thought of the greater good. It is clearly not something anyone believes he rejects wholly. At this point, Harry /knows/ he's been set up by Dumbeldore. The lies of omission and the projectile heading towards Voldemort's heart that is his life is clear.

/Hermione/ doesn't buy that Harry had to suffer and be put in danger for the greater good, but that poor girl hasn't been right in canon since puberty hit its stride. She's a little soft for wartime, and hardly ever talked to the man before he died. And is also a female character in a JKR novel. Poor thing.

Harry has spent his entire time at Hogwarts talking to Dumbledore. He knows what's what. And he doesn't deny that Dumbledore might do something for the greater good. In fact, he /defends/ the idea immediately.

Canon Dumbledore quite clearly still believes in the greater good. Just not as a whip or a sword. But instead as both personal self-sacrifice and as the necessary morality of inaction in the face of pain easily wiped away by possibly intrusive action. He doesn't abuse Harry himself, but he let the situation where he was neglected happen, just like with Tom, because he was not willing to take action.

Because powerful people taking action instead of letting the little people work things out themselves might mean you make a mistake and hurt people. Like your sister.

At last, I give you this great line from OooP:

#+begin_quote
  'Five years ago, then,' continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, 'you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. *Thus far, my plan was working well.*

That said, my prior probability that I would be in the Potterverse would be vastly higher than that I would be in a Potterficverse. Still, here's an SI full of moral dilemmas: you are the Granger parent of your choice. You even get to sift through their major categories of memories and keep things like dental education.

*** Nice setup. Though a talented writer like you could no doubt make it work, I can't help but think that this would be one of the most depressing stories ever.

I think if I were the SI in these circumstances, I'd plan to enroll Hermione in Beauxbatons and just let England burn. At that point, I'd have no emotional ties to anyone in the magical world (though would expect to build them with my child over time) and sometimes mucking one's hand is the only way to play it. The only involvement with the canon world I'd consider might be an occasional, anonymous note delivered in the Muggle post to Harry or Mrs. Figg. There's no reason for a Muggle to willingly involve herself in a dark, dreary world that despises her.

I would think that the sexuality thing would sort itself out eventually. Sexual orientation is a physical thing, not a preference, and following the initial shock, one would expect the protag in the body of a heterosexual woman to possess the same orientation. Not the same affection for the stranger sharing her bed, of course, nor even the prospects of salvaging that non-relationship, but at least a preference for outies over innies.

Might work. It isn't clear it would be possible, though. You could teach her French, get permanent French citizenship, the whole deal. But it isn't clear if they even let Muggle-born in. There are hints that Europe is even worse about blood prejudice than magical UK. You might be running into a worse situation, and there is no real way to scout it out.

I see a greater than 20% probability of simply being Obliviated again and having your daughter's magic sealed when she becomes of age, instead of getting an invite to Beauxbatons. We know this magical sealing is possible, and not fanon, because it is in OooP as a threat after wand snapping.

I think you're right there. It's still really jarring. And there's a chance you'll have some sort of induced disorder out the other end anyway. Sexual dysfunction is very likely, as is depression.

***** To be fair, in canon, she doesn't bother to mention her parents' given names, either. Such is the fate of a supporting character. I don't see how that we know next to nothing about her parents is evidence of memory charms.

A much more benign explanation is that Accidental Magic usually emerges in times of stress and desperate need, though there are exceptions. If Hermione had a relatively low-stress childhood, there would be very few instances of that, many of them not very noticeable or easily explainable. (E.g., if Hermione walks away from a car accident that should have killed her, who's going to bother doing the math to notice that the forces involved and the (lack of) injury suffered don't add up?)

Or, maybe Harry's magical core is just that much bigger. A lot of writers really like that explanation. :P

*** Well, like I said in response to being Voldemort: Why not just stop being evil?

You just need x amount of soul juice, so simply stop taking over Ginny (even if you knew how) and get lots of people to write in your diary in secret.

It took about nine months to take over Ginny in canon, and that was with weeks where she refused to write or threw you away. Just ask her to keep writing and that it'll all work out okay. Then in a few days, ask Ginny to loan you to Hermione to help figure things out.

Tell Hermione you woke up stuck in a book, are afraid magical researchers would take you apart and kill you to find out how you work, and that you need (at that point) about four more person-months of people's emotional energy to escape.

Hermione will have you out in a week, tops. Harry is your safety net: he won't let you be confiscated or left trapped in a small place, with no hope of escape. And Ron will like your promises of knowledge and power too much to tattle to his brothers or other adults.

Now you're out, in the body of a dashingly handsome sixteen year old with absurd magical abilities, and have a future history of the magical world in your head. Time to hunt some horcruxes.

Getting matriculated back into Hogwarts is a good idea, if only for the hot, barely-legal Seventh Year co-eds. Rawr.

**** What you described here is pretty much my initial plan in my head when I posited the what if to myself.

Much later, I wondered how difficult it would be to "eat" the other horcruxes starting with the one in harry, or if simply possessing Wormtail and forcing him to confess might work. How much 'Soul-Juice' is in Harry's scar? If I have access to Riddle's memories up until the murder of Myrtle, can I later memories from incorporating later horcruxes. Do I even want to remember Voldemort's rise to power from his own POV? I'm rather attached to my own sanity after all.

In my mind it all boils down to the part where Dumbledore takes one look at you and then the world goes black, roll the credits. How do you convince him that you're on the up and up while looking like Riddle? A Riddle who's apparent age and very existence confirms that Voldemort had horcruxes. And thats ignoring that you can't actually know if you're in the canon verse where he's iffy at best or one of the fic-verses where he (or Snape, the Weasleys, etc) may be worse than Moldyshorts in terms of your own survival.

*** Good point with Piers. Talk about SI hard mode. Piers being a muggle would prevent him/you from doing anything directly. You would have to work entirely by giving Harry ideas and then waiting til the next summer to find out what, if anything, happened. Tho a story told from his point of view, consisting of a series of conversations over the summers as he and Harry grow up could be interesting.

There's a very good, complete novella by Ecmm called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]] that does exactly this, though through the eyes of an OC, Piers's younger sister. It's worth a read if you're interested in this sort of story.

*** Where's the challenge? You just stop being evil. Just...stop.

/Worst/ case, you are a shade between 1982 and 1991. Send a nicely worded note to Dumbledore, and done. No wizarding war needed. Dumbledore let a wizard /literally worse than Hitler/ get away with his crimes for at least a decade. He thinks you are insane, but if you start doing stuff differently, genuinely differently, his own moral code won't let him do anything less than give you a second chance. Once you prove you are quite literally not the same person, he will have no choice but to excuse Voldemort's past excesses.

Tell Dumbledore exactly what's going on and ask to use his friend's philosopher's stone to get a body again. Help him destroy your horcruxes, if that's going to be an issue, and give him an idea that maybe allowing Harry to be kept in a cupboard isn't a great way to handle things. Then start chewing apart the pure-blood bloc in the magical government.

Hell, if you swing it right, you can be "Tom Riddle" again, upstanding citizen. Hardly "nightmare difficultly mode".

***** Ouch. Not sure what the obsession is with demagicing people. Not part of the trope. But sure. You remember nothing Voldemort does and therefore can't do magic; because it's so hard, eleven-year-olds need an entire week to start picking it up.

On the other hand, I do remember the incantation of every Unforgivable. And none of them have wand movements, just a jab. So...exactly how much emotions do I need to cast them? And how angry am I at being suck as Voldemort? How much do I hate racist, murdering bigots, and want them to die?

That'll do pig. That'll do.

--------------

Regardless, I think you still simply stop being evil...and run. It is clear that your "soul" (whatever the fuck that is) is not Voldemort's, but you need to make sure the horcruxes don't get activated, releasing a "real" copy of Voldemort onto the world -- like the Diary almost did.

This also means you likely aren't immortal. Sorry.

Have Bellatrix retrieve your locket horcrux from the now-defenseless (or mostly so) Black family townhouse, leave the cup horcrux in her vault (which a password is now required to even be taken in a cart to access), tell Lucius nothing, and just scarper to South America. Or maybe Australia.

Bellatrix worships you, and will continue to do so even if you never cast a spell again. Take her with. Just dom her some -- christ, you do know how to do that, I hope? Not /50 Shades of Didn't Even Read the Wikipedia Article/, but real S&M stuff? Real dom isn't about displays of power or even pain (even if Bellatrix is into that, too), it is about control and trust games. Do that, or get some books to learn how; buy some nice whips; let her do a nightly rapist-trap walk through the docks to get some Muggles to torture who actually deserve it; and she'll keep purring like a demented little kitten forever.

And if I really /can't/ use magic, why do I look like that if I'm not magical? If I am actually magical, and I just don't remember how...well, I've got a demented, obsessed, childless woman to teach me horrible dark magic. Sounds like a win-win to me. I'll be in São Paulo with crazy-pussy, the Death Eaters will be collapsing in on themselves, and Harry might actually get a decent year at Hogwarts for once with Scrimgeour in charge and not being murdered by me.

With me gone, there is no other plot.

Now, I wonder if I can work out a way to do this whole horcrux thing, just without the human sacrifice. I hope Voldemort kept notes. Do brainstemless clones work, magically aged with a canon potion? What about people on their deathbeds, hooked up to machines and in horrible agony? If it is an emotional thing again: what if I became hardcore vegan, and made myself feel really, really bad about killing a cow?

Point is, you still have volition and a powerbase to ransack before they figure out anything is wrong. Not that hard.

*** OOOOH. The sphinx one could combine nicely with a time loop. The catch being that you're ONLY allowed to ask him a riddle. What riddle can you posit to Harry, who's not fantastic at solving them to begin with, that by its nature or answer, leads Harry to a better path? I picture the later loops being Harry finds a sphinx lying on the ground with its paws over its face "Just move along kid, I can't deal with this today, I'll see you next loop."

The good news: You get to keep both Dobby's memories and powers and your own, somehow reconciling them; your personality and values come out on top.

The bad news: It's 1991, you belong to the Malfoys, and whatever magic compels house-elves to follow orders and self-harm when they act against their owner's interests is still in full effect. Making plans to get yourself freed probably counts.

Have fun.

** Dobby, while enslaved. Actually, that doesn't need to be a self-insert at all to be interesting. Learning how Dobby struggled against his bonds and disobeyed his masters would be interesting. There would be a process of learning subtlety and things like it. Perhaps he eavesdropped to learn Slytherin cunning from them. Maybe he and Draco were close at first as he raised him, then they grew apart as Draco sought the approval of his father (might be too cliche). How exactly did he develop his obsession with Harry Potter? All neat questions to explore.

*** I started reading it and, honestly, it's terrible. The author uses it as a soapbox to preach about their religion (I'm guessing LDS). They like to go off on tedious--and often dumb--monologues. They take extreme liberties with canon for no apparent reason other than power fantasy (all the memory magic stuff). And I felt I was just being trolled when [[/spoiler][we're told Nicholas Flamel is Gargamel and the Philosopher's Stone is made from smurfs]]. It's not even believable as a true self insert. The author doesn't spare a moment's thought for the life they left behind and just storms off to fix everything they think is wrong with Harry Potter.

**** Oh I agree, tho, in defense of the author, that MAY have been on purpose. Considering that we basically are our accumulated experiences and memories, and the main character started out by incorporating Lockhart, I have little trouble imagining the end result ending up with a lack of morals, a massive ego, and a tendency towards lengthy monologues. Think: Lockhart as a door to door LDS guy.

Now obviously I don't know if the author /meant/ for that, but it was how I ended up reading it. He even notices other odd traits cropping up as he incorporates other people's memories, but iirc he mostly notices when he has conflicting impulses. I only made it about halfway through it tho.

**** God, right? Not to mention the giant gaping plot holes of um, hey, how the fuck did Lockhart get all this knowledge again? Like, they brush on it with talk about how he might have gotten information from dark creatures, but this character just barges in and demands things and people just accept it without questioning where the knowledge came from. Which is, you know, usually the entire point of these kind of stories. Such potential, but such a shitty follow through.
