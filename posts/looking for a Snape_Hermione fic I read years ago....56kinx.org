linkffn(Chasing the Sun by Loten)

SO, what you did is read both of these stories, and combine them. Tenebras Lux is an adult friendship turned romance, and is where Hermione and Snape figure out a cure for the after effects of the cruciatus.

Chasing the Sun is where they're still in school (kinda) and where Snape is undercover and Hermione finds him after a death eater meeting. Both of these fics are incredibly long.

**** Oh no problem, I love both of those fics. Chasing the Sun is really nice when you want action, but as far as quality and character, Post Tenebras Lux has it beat.

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape and Hermione Granger deal with traumas past and present and find they have more in common than they realize as they prepare for the ultimate confrontation with Voldemort. SSHG pairing. Not HBP compliant. This is a novel length story.
