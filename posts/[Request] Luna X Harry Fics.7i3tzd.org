I'm looking for some stories that have a Luna/Harry ship. Would prefer them with minimal bashing. Also please no slash. The only one I can think of right now is linkffn(Broken Chains by Darth Marrs), but I've definitely read quite a few.


** Thank you for supporting this pairing! Let's see... let me give you a top five (well, technically, top six, but two of these are connected):

"A Boy, A Girl, An Owl, and A Train Compartment" / "Somehow You'll Just Know" by BrokenWingsHealed - these stories can be read separately, but are best considered as companion pieces. Published earlier this year, so you may not be familiar with them yet.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487457/1/A-Boy-a-Girl-an-Owl-and-a-Train-Compartment]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12499983/1/Somehow-You-ll-Just-Know]])

"Unspeakable Beauty" by QuirksnQuills - my favorite H/L multi-chap I've ever read, although it was abandoned five years ago.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7680982/1/Unspeakable-Beauty]])

"The Spell of the Moon" by michelle-31a - it's difficult to pick just one story from this author, but I really like this one.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1920513/1/The-Spell-Of-The-Moon]])

"A Little Push" by JJ Rust - again, hard to narrow it down to a single fic, but this one's great and includes a prominent co-starring role for the Weasley Twins.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4236132/1/A-Little-Push]])

"Peeking Angels" by XSpike4evaX - now this one's just plain cute.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8986346/1/Peeking-Angels]])

Bonus for the Christmas season: "Christmas Nargles" by MuggleBeene

*** Since no-one else has said it, thank you. These are some pretty good suggestions, and I didn't read them until now. So again, since no-one else has said anything(even the op which is kinda rude) thanks.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

** [[http://mujaji.net/repository/viewuser.php?uid=18][Antosha]] has a good number of Harry/Ginny/Luna stories, a lot of them are smutty. Most of them disregard DH. You need to register to read them in that archive, but it only takes a second.

His H/G stuff is high quality, nothing like the usual garbage and he writes Luna passably well.

**** I used FanFicFare to download from that site succesfully just now. Just enter the url of the first chapter from the story you want (I used [[http://mujaji.net/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173]]), then your username and password.

Also, maybe try updating your Calibre and/or Ficfare?

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
