:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Female harry with hermione. I only remember I couple of specific scenes. I think she's brought up by Pomfrey and McGonagall, goes skiing with hermione and meets a god (of love) and gets armour from them.


** Perhaps "Yule Ball Panic" and its sequels? Although those ocus on Veela, not god of love, I think.

  fem!harry. unless you just need words in a row, i'd read something else. Harry is left with the Dursleys, despite Minerva's objections. Harry sees his relatives doting on other children, and in an attempt to earn acceptance accidentally physically changes himself to a girl. AU, H/HR, featuring responsible adults. stupidly overpowered harry. i'll fix it after red headed is finished
