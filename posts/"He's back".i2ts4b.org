"You-know-who is back" Cedric said as he cradled Harry's limp body.

--------------

Prompt: Harry Potter was the one that died on the third task.

Cedric Diggory tries to pick up the pieces and save the wizarding world.


** Plot twist 1: Voldemort only killed Harry's Horcrux, and Harry woke up after being brought back.

Plot twist 2: Wormtail actually killed Harry, and Voldemort's Horcrux woke up after being brought back. It took some time for him to get settled in, but he decided he wanted to be the dark lord, not that snake face.

***** Tell me about it, in ASOIF the prophecy of the prince that was promised for example is so open to interpretation that it could point pretty much to any of the characters. Even the term /prince/ isn't enough to take /anyone/ out of the run as prince and princess are said the same way in the language the prophecy was made.

In the end most of us decided to just ignore the prophecy in it's entirely and then just act properly surprised when the GRR Martin finally cut the chase and give a BS explanation that only makes sense in hindsight despite the fact that it could be used to describe anyone depending on how far we are willing to stretch it.

Really, most cases prophecies are just used as a generic excuse for plot-devices.

******* I on the other hand frankly prefer to either make divination a developed enough art that we can get an actually reasonable explanation for how the prophecy came to be while creating a standard level of either how much it is relevant (must it be completed as said or not? Is the exact wording important or just the general idea? Can it be circumvented? Is it self-fulfilling? Etc).

Play it for shit and giggles by using it to make situations progressively more ludicrous until reality can't take it anymore and quits.

Or just do away with it and make up some other excuse.

F. ex.: Voldemort went after Harry because the date of his birth -the last day of the seventh mont-/ his linage/whatever could be used in a ritual to boost his powers; Lily's ritual messed it though and made it so they share their total magical power instead of it being all Voldemort's, so now he have to kill Harry to go back to his full-power.

Harry originally had all his growing power plus Voldemort's until Voldy comes back and pulls his half back into himself plus some more; as Harry always relied mostly on Voldemort's power he now has to actually build his own reserves to the point of being able to fight Voldemort while playing what amounts to tug of war with his enemy (who is much more experienced in such things) over their shared might.

Voldemort on the other hand has to deal with having an unstable grip on his magic which prevents him from doing things he previously would think nothing about -such as fighting singlehanded a large number of skilled opponents or dueling Dumbledore one-on-one- until he can kill Harry to get back to being almost invincible.

Other things could also play a part in their rivalry, such as the blood protections rendering Voldemort unable of taking an unlimited amount of magic from Harry or truly killing or gravely injury him directly and through his DE until he reaches seventeen years of age.

P.S.: Was just trying to make an example of how to circumvent the prophecy entirely but then it kind of grew beyond control and I liked the overall idea, will make a prompt with it

*** Forgive me if I'm wrong, but from a canon point of view isn't the actual importance of the prophecy debatable. Dumbledore seems to indicate that the real value is that 'Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy', a phrase that indicates in itself that the prophecy isn't inevitable. Furthermore, the prophecy runs:

#+begin_quote
  /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.../
#+end_quote

Whilst one might interpret 'the one' as an indication that no-one else could it could also be interpreted as a sign that Harry is the one with the /power/ not necessarily the only person who could. The main import of the prophecy is that /either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives/. The phrase 'neither can live' is interesting here, it doesn't seem to suggest that once one is dead the other is invincible, but that (given that both are technically alive for large portions of time) whilst they live their lives will be consumed by this battle.

Harry is uniquely positioned to defeat Voldemort, but I am not certain that it is set in stone that he is the only one who could ever defeat him.

Anyway, I do agree it would be interesting to see that scenario.

**** Dumbledore is saying that the prophecy is completely true, but the thing that makes it true is the people involved. There's nothing that the prophecy says that isn't blindingly obvious to anyone. It was totally self-fulfilling. In other words, it's not predestination, it's just saying the obvious after it made the obvious happen.

As soon as Voldemort heard the prophecy, it was guaranteed to play out that way. Voldemort was always going to try to kill whoever he thought could beat him. Lily would never have abandoned her son to go be Snape's widow waifu. Therefore Harry would always have the blood protection. Therefore Harry would always survive, with a massive grudge against Voldemort that would ensure he would never peacefully coexist with him. Voldemort's pride would never allow him to let his defeat stand without publicly murdering Harry. Therefore they were always going to fight until one of them died.

The reason Harry is the one with the power to defeat the Dark Lord is because the Dark Lord has to publicly be seen to kill him. If that weren't the case, Harry would have died ten times over.

**** I do agree with you on the point that Prophecies aren't set in stone. Prophecies by themselves are somewhat a very confusing and complex thing, according to me at least.

Let's start by /assuming/ that Prophecies are true, word of god, bound to happen whatever. But the gist of it is, what they predict happen. So assume it as case 1. In case 1, let there be subcases:

1. Voldy takes the prophecy seriously, decides to go ahead with his murder plan, kills the Potter parents. Basically, what happened in canon. Now in this case, the prophecy was self fulfilling. The prophecy existing is what lead to Voldy failing to kill Harry. It's almost as if it's guiding events so that It happens the way it has predicted to happen. This is a scary thought because this shows us that no one is in complete control of their actions.

2. Voldy thinks the prophecy is fake, and decides to ignore it. Keep in mind, we have still assumed that the prophecy is "the truth". In this case, there are a hundred other ways through which the prophecy could be fullfilled. Hell! Even this one single line can be interpreted in a lot of ways.

#+begin_quote
  *"Born to those who have thrice defied him"*
#+end_quote

Defy could mean a lot of things. If someone were to disagree with Voldemort on what the best ice cream flavour was, or say they debate against Voldy three times in school or something, then that is defying, innit? Then, somehow, another candidate for the prophecy would arise. Again, the prophecy is self fulfilling.

The gist of case 1, i.e. when the prophecy is true is that it is so uniquely worded that it is open to millions of possibilities.

Now, case 2. Prophecies don't predict the future per se, but the most likely possibility, or the most possible reality, if you will. I personally think this is the case. Voldemort had three choices that night, kill the Potter brat, get rid of the Longbottom brat, or do nothing. At least this is what he believed were his choices at that time, after putting two and two together. we can further condense these two choices into - To Kill or not to kill.

From case 2, the most logical conclusion would be that many factors, I repeat, many factors lead Voldemort to make the choice to Kill. However, there was still the small chance that he would have decided not to kill.

The prophecy, or whoever/whatever commissioned it knew that killing was the most likely choice, it also knew about the small chance of killing not being the choicd, and thus the prophecy was tailored in such a way that it would push Voldemort to go for the former decision. (To kill)

That leads us to question - What if, even after knowing the first half of the prophecy, voldemort decided not to kill? My answer, and my belief would be that then the prophecy wouldn't have existed in the first place, or it would have been worded differently

In the magical world, anything is possible. If time travel is, then so could be the concept that time isn't an endless stream flowing in one direction (unidirectional), but is in fact an endless cycle. We believe the past to influence the future or the present. However, if we take the above mentioned concept/theory that time is an endless loop, then it is possible for the future/present to influence past events, but just not in a very straightforward way.

***** I absolutely agree that prophecies are confusing and complex, if you take any historical prophecy they're practically intended to be so as they tend to exist within a living political discourse (although that naturally has a complicated relationship with fantasy fiction).

The thing is though that I think it would be justifiable to argue that there are multiple forms of 'true'. A prophecy can be true without necessarily coming true in an explicit sense. Evidently within Harry Potter they can be pretty precise (as in the case of the Wormtail prophecy). However, it should also be noted that there's no guarantee that Harry will be the last child born at the end of the seventh month (whenever that is, September, July, something else) whose parents have thrice defied Voldemort. There's no particular reason to be certain that the cycle won't start over again given Voldemort's paranoia and sense of self-importance.

I generally agree with you. The prophecy does whatever happens push Voldemort to kill or try to kill, and perhaps more importantly it aligns with his fundamental nature. However, I don't think that there's anything within the prophecy actually means that Voldemort becomes permanently immortal should he defeat Harry.

Time as a loop, or a simultaneous moment of sorts is an interesting possibility as far as the prophecies go, and in fact as far as any prophecy goes. Does the past echo in the future or the future in the past?

If you think of it like that, the prophecy is effectively saying Voldemort will ALWAYS be defeated. With the only possible way for Voldenort to ensure he cant be defeated being to successful conquer the entire world and enforce a global calendar with less than 7 months. Otherwise there will always be a reoccurring loop of children being born that have every chance of being capable of defeating Voldemort. Particularly when you consider how loose a term 'defy' is, and that there is no given time limit on WHEN Voldemort has to mark them as his equal (he could technically mark someone as his equal literally seconds before he defeat)

Hell, the prophecy doesn't even say that the kid has to even be magical. Power doesn't only refer to magic. That means there is an average of 360,000 babies born every year (UN stat of average births per day worldwide) on the 31st of july that have the potential to stop Voldemort.

And that is only based on one version of a Calander.

***** I really dislike it when prophecies aren't objective truths. They exist, they /will/ happen, just in the way you least expected it. If you work against a prophecy, you will only hasten its arrival. The way these work is not by controlling the future, but by being so open-ended that they can literally refer to anyone. They give a truth, but the question of that truth being worth anything is at the very core of every prophecy myth.

This is why I dislike both those "Harry is cool and edgy and ignores dumbledork and his shmophecy" and those "harreh m'boy I've been controlling your entire life to bring about the prophecy" interpretations. Those aren't how prophecies work. You can't defy them, and you can't influence them. They will happen, one way or another. All you can do is try to save as many people as possible as they play out.

The struggle against Fate is one of the core principles in literature, and one of the oldest philosophical concepts.

*** No, it simply states that one of them will kill the other. If Voldemort kills Harry, then he is no longer subject to any prophecies, and anyone can kill them once they get rid of his Horcruxes.

*** Well even further, Harry would be immortal as well because Voldemort is tethering him to life by creating his body with his blood/keeping Lily's protection alive. That's why Dumbledore has that look of triumph in his eyes for a moment when Harry comes back from the Graveyard.

In reality, the way this would go down is Harry awakens alone in the middle of Little Hangleton graveyard. Everyone is gone and he has to make his track back to Hogwarts.

*** Easy enough - the prophecy specifies neither the year, nor the method of defiance, nor even which calendar-system's seventh month. Between the lunisolar Jewish and Chinese/<other east-Asian> calendars, the lunar Islamic, and the various other traditional calendar systems of Asia and the Americas, we have tons of 7th months floating around throughout the year.

Furthermore, for the lunar and lunisolar calendrical systems, where the new month is based on the New Moon, the "seventh month dying" could be stretched to mean "as the moon whose rebirth will herald the seventh month dies", which /does/ add in additional death/rebirth symbolism, which adds the days around the new moon at the start of those seventh months.

And all of that assumes we're talking about literal birth, and not some kind of rebirth, by adoption, religious conversion, naturalization, gaining a title or degree (e.g. someone gets their PhD in some obscure field that happens to perfectly detect/counter Horcruxes somehow, and their PhD advisors are Squibs who have thrice written scathing rebuttals of Voldemort's goals)

Even if you say that the month is tied to the prophesied one's background - why, that merely opens up some kind of heartwarming multicultural hodgepodge union where, for example, you have Goldstein born on the last day of Elul, Cho born at the end of seventh month on the Asian calendar, Prof. Vector (via PhD), Cedric (born prematurely, at the end of the seventh month), Hermione (adopted at the end of her seventh month of life), the Patil twins (naturalized as British citizens at the end of July), etc.

Of course, they have no idea, they're just doing what's right - but it works.

  If we are sticking with canon events, this would mean Voldemort would be immortal thanks to the prophecy.
#+end_quote

If Harry dies and Cedric lives, then by definition we aren't sticking with canon events, so we can't really say whether or not the prophecy makes him immortal.

However, in the setting, the prophecy is a prediction of one, specific, person who may have the power to defeat Voldemort. It doesn't preclude someone else---or a team of them---from doing so. It would be very difficult, of course, and probably uglier than what happened in canon.
