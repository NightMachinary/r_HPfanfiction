** Look up 18th century British names and roll with them, eventually they start sounding "normal".

** I usually just think of an English sounding name that I like or use fitting words but translate them from other languages like Latin (Yandex) or Japanese (Google Translate)

e.g. Nescio - I do not know - Could be used for a character that isn't sure of who he is, maybe a time or dimension traveler.

Nix - Nothing - Could be used for a character that wants to act unnoticed.

Mortua Sabbata - Deathly Hallow - Currently using this name for a time travel Harry.
