It's such a little thing but it always stops my reading flow : during breakfast sausages and bacon are served with pancakes (or waffles). Maybe there are some people in the UK that do eat this combination but it's a very American thing to do especially when the pancakes are described as stacks... Most people I know eat their pancakes with sugar&lemon or Nutella. Not with savory items. Sausages and bacon belong with toast, egg or in a fryup.

Am I alone with this pet peeve?


** I am very sad and a bit salty that I have never encountered a fic which mentions pancake day (Shrove Tuesday). If you're that desperate to put pancakes in a fic, then that's a perfect place to do it and yet nobody ever does.

*** When we were in London in 2016, we ate at a place called "Diner" that went to great lengths to be American style, down to the blueberry pancakes. Of course I had to try some. They were all right and I'm trying to remember if they were served with butter or not. I don't think they were. And, they came with /real/ maple syrup, which is quite different to what most of the US uses on their pancakes.

Our "blocks" are rarely the exact same size, and are often irregularly shaped, so saying someone went two blocks is basically like saying someone went the average distance between any three consecutive stoplight.

Having been to London, I can confidently say that I would use blocks as a measure of walkable distances in the inner city.

Another fun fact: we usually say stacks of pancakes or waffles in reference to getting them at a restaurant. It's not really how you're describe making them at home.

The closest thing that people in my country eat at breakfest is sliced ham or bologna, sometimes (if you have enough money, cuz its expensive as fuck) you can find salami. Its almost universaly used here, bread, butter, margerine (way more than butter because, butter is expensive and way fatter) maybe creamcheese (though its diferent from what is actually called "creamcheese") and mussarella cheese (usually because its the cheapest cheese, even if its rather expensive by itself.).

In my family we tend to have a fryup with sausages on special occasions (boxing day, Easter Monday etc) and then it's more brunch than breakfast.

*** Sausages are a traditional and common part of a cooked breakfast, typically a full english (most, but not necessarily all of: sausages, bacon, fried egg, fried bread, toast, black pudding, fried tomato), though in cafes and such a sausage sandwhich is also an option.

Of course a cooked breakfast is both fairly unhealthy and a lot of hassle so we're much more likely to go for a bowl of cereal or maybe some toast.

Cooked breakfasts are mostly reserved for a weekend treat or eating out (especially at a hotel, bed and breakfast etc.)

*** Even though I started this thread I want to assure you that I would never do something like that. If I don't like a fix, I drop it. And I never leave negative reviews. I will roll my eyes, complain in my head and move on. It's annoying but no real big deal.

**** I actually turned it around and used it in the story. I had Harry suggest pancakes for Lily Luna's birthday breakfast and she replied that her teacher Ms XXXX ( the reviewer who a lot of people know) didn;t think it was okay to have pancakes for breakfast. Harry assured her it was fine and that they wouldnt tell her teacher, It was all good, the reviewer thanked me for putting her in the story!

*** I /have/ had pancakes for breakfast, normally on a lazy Sunday (with sugar and lemon). It isn't unknown, it's just particularly the type and so on.
