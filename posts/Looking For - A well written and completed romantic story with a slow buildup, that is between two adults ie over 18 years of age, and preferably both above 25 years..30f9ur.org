I don't care about the pairing give me canon, au, slash, next gen, marauders era, whatever, but the story must be:

-Completed (or I guess abandoned if it's really good, just not one that is updating because I tend to forget to finish reading them.)

-Preferably over 40,000 words.

-Feature two adults.

-A slow build up i.e. Not falling into bed in the second chapter.

-Not drag on too long once they do get together.

-Written in 3rd person perspective.

-I do like stories that feature Snape is some way, but this is not necessary a deal breaker if he's not in it.

-Well written. I don't mind a few spelling or grammatical errors, as long as the story isn't riddled with them.

I think that's it. Cheers guys.

Edit - Thanks for all the suggestions guys. Judging be the opening chapter in a few of them it looks like I have a couple of really good stories to choose from. Thanks!


** Here's a canon compliant story that's one of my favourites: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]]. It's completed and a slow build with two of-age adults.

No Severus, sorry, but I think it's pretty well written and it has the benefit of being completed and of meeting your length requirement.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]] (HG/LL) is about them remeeting in university after Hogwarts, and depicts their intellectual struggles with learning how to understand each other. IMHO both characters are far from OOC, and the fic just hits the right amount of fluff for me.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8788107/1/Another-Dream]]

Another Dream is a SS/HG. Post war. Hermione is out of school at this point. I really like this one because of how Severus is portrayed. He realizes that he has this second chance at life, and he's trying to do it better.

Hermione is also mature but still Hermione. She bright, fun and positive but without coming across as too young.

40 chapters, a nice story that just feels real. Two people who become acquaintances, who become friends, who become something more.

Sorry I'm on mobile if the formatting seems off. Hope you enjoy!

** I just finished Turn. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852?show_comments=true&view_adult=true&view_full_work=true#comments]]

On mobile, sorry for lack of formatting. It's Harry/Draco, post-epilogue, with Ginny /Blaise as the secondary pairing. I can't recommend it enough. It's a long, detailed journey and everyone is in-character. I'm really sad that I finished it, and it forever changed my personal canon. It has my vote for most believable slash fanfic (and the best HP fanfic I have ever read).

I tend to stay away from fics with OCs as the main characters, so I've never read that one. How big of a part does this twin of Harry's play in the fic?

******** Hm, it's been a while. I'd say he's a minor, but present character. I don't really remember much about him (I didn't really like him all that much), compared to this fic's Harry, Draco, Snape, and Pansy (all of whom I liked quite a bit).

That fic has been discussed on this sub quite thoroughly by far more intelligent debaters than I... but I will say that it definitely has a lot of unique, creative intrigue that make it worth a read; it's weak points, too.

As a reader, I really wanted to smack Harry for making the same mistakes over and over again. This was the biggest draw for me. There are critiques against characters acting OOC and about the fic being angsty for the sake of angst... but I was able to overlook this stuff for the shear novelty and fascination that I had with Lightning's world. Just one examples - the pureblood dances/lore was fabulous. It's definitely a part of my head canon.

I think the learning curve for the fic is, unfortunately, the first two books. A lot of the plot points that instinctively grated against me in the first book were satisfyingly answered in the second, which allowed me to finish the series with great relish.

Ok, I blame the length of this comment on the beer I'm drinking (5 o'clock somewhere and all that jazz), so I'll stop now. (:

** SS/OC SB/OC RL/OC

The "whole Again" series is AU and starts after the prisoner of azkaban, before the other books were released, so it's more AU because the author didn't know where the story was going. It adds three new OC characters, which I know can be awful, but they're not Mary sued. There are three main stories and an epilogue all completed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/540183/1/Whole-again-Severus]]

--------------

SS/OC

The visitor is another strange AU that's very popular, and very long. Sort of has the same premise as life on mars if you're familiar with that show. A woman who is a fan of the books gets attacked knocked out and ends up in the harry potter universe. It's mostly canon compliant. /very/ long build up to romance

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor]]

--------------

HG/SS A Murder of Crows is a well written intrigue filled story. SS was in a kind of Stasis after being bitten. About 15 years later he awakes. Sounds awful I know, but it's really good and again popular. Not AU in any other way, other events carried out exactly as in the books.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4407394/1/A-Murder-of-Crows]]

--------------

I'll add more if I remember them. You said you liked SS so most of these are him. None involve time travel or under age shenanigans. The visitor is probably the most popular on FF.net, the whole again series is a bit weird but probably the one I'm most attached to as I read them before I finished the books or read much other fan fiction, and a murder of crows is probably the most interesting well written story, very addictive stuff.

Hope that helps.

** - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] - my favorite HP romance story, it's Molly/Teddy/Victoire. It has a love triangle that's realistic--messy and destructive with a genuine sense of impossibility to it. Full of family drama and clever observations.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332461][the earth and the sky]] - Draco/Astoria (long) oneshot, covers years and years of their relationship, told in moments.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309456][With All Things]] - George/Angelina. Abandoned, but doesn't really hurt from it since it's all slice-of-life. Angelina's PoV are told from Hogwarts years, and George's PoV in post-war years (which are the better years, I think).

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]] - Harry/Draco, where Harry experiences dreams that seem as real as an alternate universe. And in this universe, he's dating Draco. Funny, surreal, and heartbreaking.
