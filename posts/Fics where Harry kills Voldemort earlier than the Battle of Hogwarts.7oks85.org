** Define "death". Is it fine if he's in the state as in 1981, his body destroyed but mind still wandering around as a wraith? Because without an AU that's the only thing that could have been accomplished in Malfoy Manor or at the Ministry, you do realize.

*** Sure. Or Harry figures out a way to end him without destroying his Horcruxes. Or Horcruxes just don't exist.

**** But if the Horcruxes don't exist, then it's an AU, isn't it? And you stated quite firmly in your original post you didn't want any AUs.

***** I don't want it to be AU before that divergence point in Voldemort's death. Horcruxes don't really affect the story before the 6th book, so if Voldemort's early death happened before then, it wouldn't really make a difference in the first five books. Suppose there's the fact that Voldemort survived the Killing Curse rebounding, but that can just be ignored as do many fics started before Half-Blood Prince came out.

****** The Diary though. Also, I was talking about an AU from a watsonian perspective, of course.

******** Hm. But again, though it stays true to the /text/, what you are proposing is an extremely AU world indeed. It would require Voldemort's biography to have been very different, for one thing, and a completely different mechanic of how a disembodied soul may retain life...

********* How is it an extremely AU? Just don't go over the explanations? Leave it like the books left it before Half Blood Prince came out. It doesn't need an explanation. Harry kills Voldemort before or right as the war breaks out, go to the aftermath. Who cares about the details in Voldemort's death? Plenty of fanfiction skips over Horcruxes and it goes just fine.

Having the details of the explanation behind his survival and death ignored is not creating an extreme AU. That's absurd. You're looking into this far too much. JK Rowling leaves out plenty of explanations for things. So can anyone else, and so they have many times in fanfiction.

********** We're talking about two different things, I feel. Because it has "universe" in the title, I see the term AU as referring to changing the fundamental nature of the world --- so that a single-point-of-departure like "Petunia never married Vernon Dursley" wouldn't really be an AU, but a world where Goblins have wands or magic can create food out of nothing or Magical Britain is a kingdom /would/ be.

And so fundamentally changing the backstory of Voldemort and the way magic works is very AUish for me, even if the narrative of the first five books remains unchanged. Like... like how in a sci-fi story, you would still call a dimension where Mars was an inhabited planet, /but/ Earth history was exactly the same, an alternate universe.

*********** Yeah, I think we are. I see AUs as both of those things. Never really saw another term for the type of story where Petunia wouldn't marry Vernon. Just divergence, I suppose? Oh well.

************ Well, yes, those /are/ rather different things --- one being something that supposedly could have happened in the canon universe had some event gone differently, whereas the other, because it changes the /setting/ altogether, is more like a reimagining.

** It's too AU to count, but in When In Doubt, Obliviate, Gilderoy Lockhart successfully over-obliviates both Quirrel & Voldemort at the end of first year, leaving them catatonic and easily kept in custody.

Heck, it could be earlier; Quirrel might be spotted or otherwise identified during his break-in at Gringotts, leading to Aurors apprehending him and Voldemort's pre-Quirrel vessel.

Aside from that, without making the Horcruxes work differently, I can't think of a way for Voldemort to just be killed early, only apprehended, without an AU possibly involving time travel. Or maybe he could be petrified by his own basilisk after he gets the idea of raising one of his own (after all, the one in the Chamber did alright).

*** I probably should have just said "Harry takes Voldemort out of the picture" instead of kill. That way, it could be petrifying, Draught of Living Death, magical contract, Obliviating him like your example, removing his limbs and locking him up, throwing him so far into space that once his body finally dies, he'll either have no idea how to travel back to Earth or it'll just take forever, etc etc.
