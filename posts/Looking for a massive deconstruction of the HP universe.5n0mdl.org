** The whole series is rife with racism; wizards have themselves established as a 'superior species', with the dozens of other intelligent species that would normally be equal citizens in other fantasy (house-elves, centaurs, goblins, Veela, etc) being unrepresented in the Wizengamot and forced to follow wizarding laws.

Elves are the victims of mass enslavement, giants are the victims of extermination and being pushed into mountains, centaurs are isolated, goblins have fought several wars to keep what rights they do have, Veela are sex objects, the list goes on and on.

Despite this, wizards still invent racial differences between themselves, calling each other 'pureblood' or 'half-blood' or 'muggleborn' depending on where they were born and raised, and discriminate based on that. A madman calling himself Voldemort managed to exploit those feelings, and the desire of giants/werewolves/etc to have power back, to lead a reign of terror that was only stopped by freak chance.

Furthermore; false memory charms and obliviations can be performed by any wizard just out of Hogwarts without special training (ask Hermione, or Tom Riddle), the Imperius isn't particularly hard to cast (ask McGonagall) and is hard to detect (ask Rosmeta), and Polyjuice Potion is apparently really easy to brew (ask Hermione and Barty Crouch, Sr. and Jr.); despite this, in crime investigations, the Ministry of Magic is willing to lock-up first and ask questions never (ask Sirius, Hagrid, Marvolo Gaunt, Barty Crouch Jr, or Harry).

Not forgetting, of course, how the political system is vulnerable to bribery and backroom dealing, and has little-to-no oversight (ask Umbridge).

The whole wizarding society in Britain is an epic clusterf█k of inequality, injustice, and corruption.

*** Yes, the government of magical Britain is a shining beacon of bigotry, corruption, cruelty, ignorance, incompetence, injustice, malice, and stupidity.

The scary thing is, that magical Britain might actually be one of the more progressive wizarding societies. MACUSA, as shown in FB, was even more fucked up than the British Ministry.

Saying 'Durmstrang doesn't admit muggleborns' doesn't mean very much when, in the bigger picture, Hogwarts doesn't admit goblins or house-elves or various other species as students, unless they have some human blood.

But, this is because Hogwarts is a school that teaches wand-usage, and non-human races aren't allowed wands in Britain.

So, what if Durmstrang were willing to admit muggleborn students, but for legal reasons they were prohibited from doing so?

Considering the sanctions that were placed against muggleborns right after Voldemort took over the British Ministry, I wouldn't put it past a foreign ministry to discriminate against muggleborns, whether or not they were ruled by a dark lord.

Character development wise, that could have a fascinating impact on the relationship between Durmstrang and Hogwarts/Beauxbatons; instead of having sneering pureblood ponces, they might be amazed or politely confused, like if regular wizards (not supremacist purebloods) at Hogwarts saw elves or goblins or full-blooded Veela or centaurs or whatnot learning.

This is going into my to-do list; the Durmstrang students, unused to the idea of muggleborns learning magic, are astonished by the likes of the studious Hermione Granger and the shutterbug Colin Creevey, as well as the muggle-raised Dean and his obsession with muggle sports.

Some are snobbish, some are xenophiles, and some wonder 'Why aren't they allowed to come to Durmstrang?'. And when they go back home, they start asking questions and causing a little bit of social unrest.

And, in his office, Dumbledore clasps his hands together, "Just as planned."

********* I have no intention of rereading it, or of finding the posts I made on other websites where we quoted the fabulous outfits and descriptions of moon and sky and eyes for our own amusement, since I doubt this will be productive. I'm definitely not hunting the thing for early chapter stuff where he appears to have either misread things or not ever read them in the first place, and then didn't check before putting it in his fic.

I do understand the point of HPMOR: it is a polemic for his ideas, and it got a bit out of hand. He had to become more familiar with the source material as he went, and also (taken in conjunction with various things he has said about himself and his work) revealed rather more about some sad aspects of his own self-conception and experience than I hope those who recommend it realise. Decipher that as you will: I feel squicky explaining it.

You love the thing, you started reading it at a very young age, and you don't see the prose. I am happy to assume that the early chapters are full of masterful prose rather than the overblown hilarity of the later ones: I don't need to reread an old fic. Many people enjoy purple prose: that's why it ends up everywhere.

I did enjoy the experience of the end of HPMOR, though. It was like a piece of performance art, taking me back to the wonderful days of Fandom Wank and all the fic-writer cliches. Demanding comments to continue! Claiming to have various endings ready, depending on the suggestions, and then clearly using those suggestions in the following chapters! I even took a peek at the dedicated subreddit, and people there were talking about things like "guys, what if when the hat tried to sort Harry it put him in some special different house: let's imagine what that would be like", as if they had never heard of Sparklypoo! Everything was new again, and nothing hurt.

Taken in context with the other comments, asserting that you are specially able to assess whether he is pretentious and writing purple prose on the basis on you being oh so very smart. You know a single IQ point isn't a significant thing, right? The way you have used IQ in this discussion (such as when you were talking about all those 105s) suggests you think of it as some very fixed, very precise thing, and that you have a strangely fixed mindset that discounts all learning effects. It would be entirely possible for someone who happened to score a 105 on an IQ test this morning to also write better than you, using a wider vocabulary in a more sensible manner.

If you don't understand that you have been trying to present yourself as smarter than the people who disagree with you on the merits of a fanfic, maybe you need to go on a social communication jag?

#+end_quote

Wait, you're arguing? Okay.

You're clearly very upset about this, and all I can really recommend is that you go and read the sort of posts that actually get posted on [[/r/iamverysmart]], and then reread this thread. I kind of do assume you're a troll (a less good one, at this point, than you were initially), because you really cannot be this lacking in self-awareness.

And based on the evidence of the writing you have shown here, I know plenty of people who test as 'average' on the sort of test questions you and I do well on yet who write more cogently than you, making much more intelligent use of a wider vocabulary. You don't have to have a lot of working memory to read a lot and be observant, which is what grows your vocabulary and gives you guidance as to how it should be used.

Again, you have a very fixed mindset, or your persona does. This will hold you back.

There are hundreds of people who regularly use this sub, and they will obviously skew to the higher end of the IQ range. You should assume that any given person could well be as smart or smarter than you. People will assess your intelligence based on what you actually do, not on you telling them that you are smart and sticking in a load of words in the wrong register for the conversation.

Incidentally, I would guess you were thinking of "sod off", and combining it with the phrase "toss (something) off", informed by the knowledge that a "tosser" is a wanker. Or maybe you misheard "sod off" and thought it was "toss off". I don't judge people's value on this sort of thing, so that doesn't matter to me, but you might want to bear that in mind if you try this again.

And I know he has said a lot about how uniquely amazing and important he and his work is. But I seriously question whether he makes any legitimate contribution to robotics or AI. What has he contributed or written that people outside the Less Wrong bubble ever reference?

Especially since I seem to recall various weird statements implying that he thinks he is deliberately, or unintentionally, withholding from making various advances for whatever reason.

What raises a lot of his writing to iamverysmart level is the way he assumes that his insights are both obviously right and yet noteworthy and unique. Have you ever read his thing about time travel? He literally describes exactly how time travel works both in the Harry Potter universe /and how space-time works in Catholicism/ as some special insight he has had. It reminds me of stuff I would write at 15. There is no reference to this being an established thing, no sense that he is aware of other people having come up with these ideas centuries ago and discussed them at length, not even any sense of having strayed into more interesting or less obvious scifi.

**** I'm of two minds about it to be honest. On the one hand, yeah there's nothing explicitly incorrect about the analysis but on the other, it's incredibly hard to build a world and consider each and every tiny minute detail, especially for a magical fantasy universe. Putting that much detail nto a childrens/young adult series would have been both painful and pedantic to the extreme. If the series had taken ASOIAF levels of time and effort to write or had LotR's or Discworld's lifetime of worldbuilding, it would not be the series we know and love, it would not have finished in 2007, and the movies would have never happened.

We do love HP and JKR, too, or at least the best of us do (I'll gatekeep that one all day) and that's part of where I think the analysis is misunderstood or misused. JKR was and is not a perfectionist but she did write a story that enchanted and captivated the better part of two generations. That's an accomplishment that can't be denied. Picking over the life and death of any series is always going to turn up plot holes and better choices especially when you're doing it from the point of view of a fanfiction reader/writer a decade after the fact. To use that sort of analysis to say JKR is a bad writer (which it does not itself do) is pretty disgusting, yet it happens.

I do think it has a uniquely positive place in the fandom. Analyses like that one and the other essays and worldbuilding that try to explain JKR's universe or provide their own rules to govern a fanfiction series/universe provide an excellent look at all the subtle and often not so subtle changes you can make to create your own fanfiction. If you're especially gutsy, you can even use that sort of mindset to consider all the possible plot issues in building a world that is completely of your own creation. The main issue is when people misinterpret it and use it to shit on an amazing series and incredibly kind and generous person without acknowledging how fantastic they really are.

**** I agree too, but I feel the need to defend JKR here:

Would the story be more or less entertaining if JKR put in as much realism as possible in her story?

The first two books were intended for children, so the plot definitely wouldn't stand up to close scrutiny. I doubt other children's stories have been put under similar scope. But if they were, they would probably be picked apart even more thoroughly.

The imperfect/imprecise/incomplete world building by JKR is what allows fanfictions to flourish. It gave writers enough room to use their own imaginations and interpretations. For example the Goblins, we have everything from them being super helpful to super evil, and I think that's what makes fanfictions so much fun!

Maybe it was by design not to make her story/world too perfect, but to focus mostly on emotional and wonderful aspects.

***** It's not about realism, it's a fantasy story which needs a huge amount of suspension of disbelief. The big problem with the stories is that JKR switched target demographics in the middle of the entire series.

The analysis implies something similar, in that it's really easy to write a fanfic about HP as opposed to other series. The thing that struck a chord with me is how the first few books being children-early teenager books then transitioning into young adult books didn't hold up. The first few books were fun and you could excuse the cliche/plot contrivances as light hearted but when the target demographic for the books changed it opened up too many holes in the story. Things that could be taken as light hearted in the first few books take on a more sinister look when you read the later books (everything with Dumbledore, Dursleys, Hogwarts etc etc).

**** I think the problem with the whole love potion thing is that the wizarding world is so blaze` about them. Romilda Vane poisons Ron with them(obviously meant for Harry) yet she faces no consequences. Molly Weasley mentions them to Hermione and Ginny in a 'girl talk' type conversation as if love potions were common place. Then you have Merope Gaunt who used a love potion and raped the dude. IIRC the Weasley twins sold love potions that lasted a short time at their shop too. So you can't really blame FF authors for taking creative licence for something that was already in canon.

  They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.

** There's a good fic by The Sinister Man that's over on Fanfiction.net. It's entitled "Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin." It's currently on the third book "Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace."

Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated since.. Dec 2016, I believe.
