I was wondering if there is a thread here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] or somehwere else on the interwebz where you can adopt people's fanfic ideas or prompts that they've offered up?

Looking to write some HP fanfic but can't come up with any ideas I like on my own. If there aren't any places, and there's a plot bunny you'd like to offer me with all the usual burnt offerings and animal sacrifices, feel free to leave a comment or PM me. Thanks!


** Whelp, I don't feel like making a thread for my crazy crossover idea. Nor do I have that thing in my brain that others who can sit down and plan out and then write a story have. But here is my guano-loco idea for a crossover.

We know that Neville has a Great-Uncle Algie. Algie is generally taken as short for Algernon. Most people think then that Neville's Great-Uncle is Algernon Croaker, the Unspeakable. But is there anything else that Algie could be short for? Yes there is. Algie could be short for Algernop. Who has the first name of Algernop? [[http://i.imgur.com/VhpYw11.png][This guy]].

[[/spoiler][Harry Potter/Archer]] crossover.

  ‘What about you, Neville?' said Ron.

  ‘Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,' said Neville, ‘but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages. My great-uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight.

  'Great-uncle Algie came round for tea and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great-auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased. Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great-uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.'

Sounds legit.
