As an exmample, I recently finished Harry Potter's New Mother linkffn(13718923) after passing it by while scrolling because the fic's premise at least to me screamed Indy Harry fic, where Harry becomes some half dragon god. I ended up clicking and reading it since i ran out of things to actually read and was pleasantly surprised to find the fic not what i expected at all.

  By some twist of fate, the Hungarian Horntail takes an interest in Harry Potter, and thus, it decides to become his new mother, after hearing how badly he was treated at the Dursley's and also at Hogwarts. Nothing will ever make him feel unwelcomed or unwanted again. Not on her scales, and she would make sure of it! [Harry x Mother Hungarian Horntail]

** I've started avoiding fics with Daphne Greengrass as a main character. She seems to always be the exact same person in every fic, as if she was copy-pasted from another fic down to the same lines, and pretty much guarantees Lord Hadrian Too-Many-Titles Potter.

*** Not so, try linkffn(The Uprising by Captain Cranium). It has an interesting Daphne and a frankly too-weak Harry (which is a pleasant change from Lord Hadrian, though).

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

** This is why I always at least start the first chapter when I see a fic that looks potentially interesting: if it turns out better than I expected, great, but if not, it's still somewhat disappointing, but at least I haven't invested too much time into it.

*** Oh I know, but years of clicking on fics that I thought were interesting based on the description and then getting "Lord Hadrian Potter" and a shit ton of bashing have made me alot more finicky about what i read based on descriptions.
