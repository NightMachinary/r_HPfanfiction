I am not a particular fan of either the trope itself nor of its comical subversions but I was wondering if you know of a fic where Lord Hadrian Potter-Black is the usual Lord Hadrian Potter-Black but as he gets closer to the top he realizes that he is surrounded by opportunists, suck-ups and gold diggers and the only people that cared about him are those whom he shunned (Dumbledore, the Weasleys, Hermione).

I would like to see the tragedy of someone who is very lonely at the top while trying to fend off constant back stabs from his new "friends" while leaving with the regret that the people who truly cared about him no longer want to have anything to do with him.

Any suggestion is welcomed. Thank you!
