On fanfiction.net there are around 810K fanfictions on Harry Potter which is almost 4 times the second in the list. Certainly the website does not have all the fanfictions ever written. Even then, it is safe to assume that in terms of number of fanfictions, HP beats any other book perhaps by a huge margin. Why do you think is the case?


** Honestly, I think it comes down to two factors.

1) Harry Potter is very popular and influenced a lot of people's childhoods

2) At the same time, Harry Potter has a very narrow focus that only really develops a few of the introduced characters and has several elements in the later parts of the story. This gives fanfic writers a lot of room to explore and develop the world on their own.

So, there are a lot of people with nostalgia for the series and lots of wiggle room for people who want to try writing stories in the world. This makes it a good universe for writing fanfiction.

Then, there are people like me who enjoyed HP when they were younger, but see it as massively flawed. As a result, there is another category of authors who want to try fixing or changing canon into something they find more palatable.

*** I think the recent rise in the number of fanfictions is also a factor. There may be other books which could have been popular for fanfictions if written in a different time.

*** I'll add 1a) The stories are enjoyable enough that the readers can grow up to be adults and still enjoy rereading them. I think that's important, because getting into a series while you're young makes you more attached, but it's when you're a little older that you are in a position to write fanfiction - especially fanfiction worth reading. So that wide audience age range greatly strengthens its position.

** [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] in particular happened to start around the time Harry Potter was taking off. So the people writing about those new HP books went to the new FF.N site, and over the years new writers came to the place where so much HP fic had already accumulated.

There's also the matter of HP being a huge global phenomenon unmatched by almost anything else. People of every age and every background all around the world read the books. When the series was incomplete, everyone everywhere was speculating about how it would end. When the series was completed, everyone everywhere daydreamed about what might happen next.

It was a perfect storm.

I wonder if we're going to look back and think of this as the biggest ball-drop in media history. Imagine if Cursed Child or the new Fantastic Beasts movies were good. Could it have been as big or bigger than the MCU?

**** and unlike starwars

harry potter had no content

with starwars, there was books and videos games since the 80's

harry potter there after the deathly hallows part 2 came out, there was nothing

Plus the harry potter world is quite small focusing on a single country and its easily divided into years with a basic plotline already filled out so harry in a different house most of the story beats are already done

*** This doesn't hold against archiveofourown.org which shows the exact same phenomenon ... HP fanfics beat every other with a huge margin.

I think much more important is the nature of HP universe ... being seated in our current (or more or less current, certainly more than LotR) world, but yet different enough to allow escapism and fantasy to work, it provides ideal ground for fanfic stories.

** Harry potter is a great starting point due to JK Rowling's unique ability to tell you literally nothing and somehow get a world out of it.

The currency value fluctuates, dates are often wrong, and the world is left unexplored to an almost criminal level aside from what she explicitly tells you which gives you names and faces but no real substance allowing you to give them your own and it fits completely naturally.

*** I completely agree, but would state it much more generously as "JK Rowling builds depth via allusion". Oddly specific names, books, dates etc. give the world a feeling of depth without every actually exploring the world in depth - which would distract from the story she is trying to tell.

** Harry Potter was a magical series that had all the kids hooked and with the rise of the movies after the books were published a younger generation could enjoy the series as well. This the series that had kids wishing that the whole series was real and they could get a letter to go to Hogwarts. I wasn't yet born when the 1st book was published and started following. No, my series was Avalon the Web of Magic. I somewhat similar magical kids series to follow. This series also had a following but the main readers were teenage girls. The HP series on the other hand connected to a broader audience.

** I've always thought that HP is largely what kickstarted fanfiction itself. Sure, it existed prior to that, but in a more limited way, not globally popular like now. So, most people who ever write or read fanfiction had wrote or read HP fanfiction before. That's where big numbers are from.

*** Honestly, you may be right, but idk how much that has to do with ffnet going up around the same time? Before people's fanfic were on independent, private servers. Also, It was fiendishly difficult to find fic, because google was still pretty much in its infancy. And even up until like, I wanna say, 2005ish it was still super difficult to find anything (even if you knew exactly what you were looking for). So ffnet going up (went up around when PoA released, I think, or not too long before it anyway) not only provided an easy-to-find place for fanfic, but it also coincided pretty darn perfectly with when our favorite HP characters were turning into teenagers.

TLDR; it really was a perfect storm of convenience, timing, and the frightening power of teenagers

**** Actually I remember that before FFnet, there was a similarly huge site for HP fanfiction. It was called fictionalley and it doesn't exist anymore. I've ve had very longbreaks from fanfiction over the years, so I'm not sure when it stopped existing. Either way, fictionally was huge, but HP-only.

** 1) The main characters are teenagers (and were played in the movies by attractive actors)

2) The setting is both relatable - a high school - and fantastic, allowing for plenty of escapism

3) Harry Potter was (and remains) a huge phenomenon with huge numbers of fans. The size of the fanfic community means that more people will read your fic if you write. It means that you have more works to turn to for inspiration. Success breeds success.

** There are five main elements to this in my opinion.

1. The story was written in such a way as to be readable and enjoyable for children, but have enough depth for adults, giving it a fan demographic of everyone 6 and up. Most other properties don't have this, or at the very least don't have a reason for people to come back to it once they're older. The reason why this matters is that it pretty much quadruples the opportunities for all the other reasons to spawn a new author.

2. The world of Harry Potter is written in such way that it has a near perfect balance of the familiar and the unfamiliar, allowing people to immerse themselves in it incredibly easily, but without compromising the depth. The series conveys enough information to create a foundation for building on, but without either overloading the reader with information or cutting off avenues of creativity and curiosity by explaining every detail. (LOTR has this problem, there is easily five times the depth in middle earth as there is Harry Potter world building wise, but Tolkien got so in depth that He didn't leave much mystery or blanks to fill in, thus limiting avenues of fanfiction.)

3. Harry Potter has a wide variety of content, it can be a coming of age story, it can be a comedy, it can be a romcom, it can be power trip, it can be a gritty take on war and terrorism in a fantastical setting, it can be a touching romance, it can be a thriller, it can be a psychological horror, it can be a classical hero's journey, it can be a slice of life, it can be any number of schoolyard adventures ranging from young kids to near adults, it can be a political commentary, the list goes on and on. How can be all these things? Because at one point or another it contains every single one of these elements. (Perhaps not power trips, though one could argue that some of the Quidditch games could count as specific examples of this.) Harry Potter is a massive series of books (measured at over 1,200,000 total words), a franchise of 8 mainline movies, contains 2 spinoff movies with a third in the works, and has a plethora of expanded material online. The volume and variety of source material means that there is quite literally something for everyone.

4. The characters are diverse and interesting. They have unique personalities and traits that make them memorable, recognizable, and fun to wonder "what would they do if..." about. Not only are they well developed, but there are a lot of them, plenty of material to write a story about.

5. The snowball effect: When people think of fanfiction, they think of three things, twelve year old girls writing about famous people who have never so.much as talked to each other professing their undying love to each other, random anime characters doing pretty much the same thing, and Harry Potter. Harry Potter fanfiction has grown to the point that people write fanfiction, about Harry Potter fanfiction. It's a snowball rolling down a hill that will only continue to get bigger and bigger until it eventually slams into something that it can't handle and shatters. But until that moment we're all along for the ride.

** The worldbuilding is intriguing, and you can genuinely imagine that some of the weird people you encounter might be living in a magical world just to the side of this one.

But there are so many lackluster moments that you want to improve them.

The characters are very deep and go through coherent growth arcs.

But they're also kind of assholes, and you want to show them why they're wrong.

The magic system is very open and even the slightest bit of imagination can take it in wildly differing directions.

But it's also so /goddamn stupid/ that you want to show off the weird implications.

There's a lot of 'demonstrate your inner uniqueness' moments - getting a wand, the Sorting, Animagi, Patroni, Divination, special magical talents, etc.

But they're barely ever explored to our satisfaction.

Basically it's because it's good enough that we want to see it done better, so we roll up our sleeves and do it ourselves.

** For me, it's self-perpetuating. I'm inspired to write by what I read - by what I want more of, or what I'd like to see done differently. So when there's so much great HP fanfic out there, it inspires me to write for HP in turn.

As a book series, HP is nowhere near the top of my list. I would never say it's one of my favourites. But the fandom is another thing altogether, because of the sheer volume of quality content for me to read, be inspired by, and hopefully contribute to in turn. The HP fandom is easily my favourite, followed by Naruto - which is coincidentally another of the biggest fandoms out there - even though I've still never even watched more than the first few arcs of that.

At least for me, the fandom makes the fandom, far more than canon ever could.

** The closest in terms of pure numbers isn't Twilight at 219k but Naruto at 427k.

The similar link between all three is the fact that they all have a solid framework for building something yourself. Harry Potter has age variety, different houses, an unrifined so very moldable magic system, and a ton of characters to make a story for. Naruto has age variety, different clans/villages, a nicely defined chakra system but built in variety, and a ton of characters to focus on. Twilight has not so much age variety but they live potentially forever so you can set the time to be whenever, different covens and characters with unique beliefs and abilities, multiple species, and a sizable cast to work with.

** FanFics are always more written when people dont actually like a small part of the story but love it over all.

Second, the series kept up the momentum as it has a nice flow in the story. Only after reading a lot will you start noticing some things which dont add up or should stand up more.

The lore was not very stringently defined as it was written in a first person view. This allows multiple possibilities.
