Lucius Malfoy has really started to interest me recently, he's such a mixed character. He cares about his wife and son (though... he does shove all the bigoted stuff into Draco's head), but he does care and was worried about him during the final battle.

His relationship with Snape is interesting. He's a darker character with some diverse character traits and a lot of possibility

NO Weasley and Dumbledore bashing please. I don't want all Slytherins to be good and everyone else to be bad plot line.

He doesn't have to be the main character, he can just be in the story.

He can have a redemption (as long as it makes enough sense), but if he doesn't, that's fine too.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)

NO Over abusive Dursley's please, have just gotten really tired of it.

No rape/non con please.

  Coming together is not always an easy feat, but the rest of the time, things fall apart. As Narcissa and Lucius navigate whether or not to trust one another, the Wizarding world begins to bend to the power of a Dark Lord and everything they've ever known starts to unravel.

** Yes! I recommended these a while back on a different thread looking for Lucius/Narcissa stories but I think they all fit the bill of what you're looking for.

Under Obligation would be a good one to start with, it's one of the oldest and most popular Lucissa stories. It was written before HBP and the Black Family tree came out so some of the details are no longer canon (age order of the Black sisters, extended family names, etc) but I still think it holds up well. A lot of Lucissa seems inspired by this story in some way or another. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2078117/1/Under-Obligation]]

If you enjoy that but would like something lighter or, conversely, more serious, the authors who collaborated on Under Obligation each wrote their own really excellent stories. Tainted Love is darker and more complex but incomplete, and Lessons is fluffier and finished.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1329152/1/Tainted-Love]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2025248/1/Lessons]]

A more recent, canon-compliant story is Vacillation. A lot of Bellatrix and Rodolphus in the story as well. It's very long and in-depth about their feelings towards each other growing over the years, bit of a commitment.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26862214/chapters/65540506]]

If you're looking for something brief but beautiful, Goodnight Little Dragon is probably my favorite one-shot of the family. So sweet and touching.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2999761/1/Goodnight-Little-Dragon]]

Again on the flip side if you'd like a truly, deeply disturbing one-shot... got that for ya too in Paterfamilias. It's only rated T but it will mess you up and you'll need to read through it twice to bring all the pieces together... be warned!

Enjoy!!

** Unforgiveable is a one shot set in 1981 that focuses on Narcissa with lots of Lucius from an interesting perspective.

*** This is great. I think it did a good job adding bits of humanity to the Malfoys while not whitewashing them. As well as capturing Bellatrix's insanity and devotion.

  December 1981, and Bellatrix Lestrange is going to increasingly desperate lengths to bring the Dark Lord back, culminating in the infamous attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom. Narcissa Malfoy steps out of the shadows and discovers just how far she is prepared to go to protect the ones she loves.
