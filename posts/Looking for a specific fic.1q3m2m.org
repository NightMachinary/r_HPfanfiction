** How long was it? Was it a short one-shot type of thing or a feature-length story? Was the bet with the Harpies the main part of the story or was it just something that happened along the way?

**** And I'm assuming you don't remember what the main plotline of the story was? I spent quite a while searching around yesterday, but without stumbling across the specific scene you remember, I'd be lucky to find the right fic.

****** It's not [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/]["A Cannon's Harpy"]] Is it? It's the closest thing to your description that I could find, but without reading the whole thing, I'm not sure it has the scene you specifically mentioned.

** The only story I can think of when I hear about Quidditch and a calendar is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/][The Original Naked Quidditch Match]]. It's happening at Hogwarts though, so this is probably not it.
