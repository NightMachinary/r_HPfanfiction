Stuff I remember:

- Lily + James are both alive

- There was a chapter where Lily and James find a diary and and the writing in it switches between the Harrys.

- Harry that is subsumed universe has severely mentally disabilities.

- It's not that one where he takes over some future guy with a diary and a horcrux lake.

Edit: It's *not* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6738586/1/The-Sun-Dog][Harry Potter and the Sun Dog]]

Edit 2: It's *not* Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool.

**** I can't quite remember but I think disabledHarry is effectively killed but there's a bit of back and forth in the diary entries where sometimes it will be disabled in control and sometimes the invading harry.

  Bereft in a new world, one seemingly absent of a known danger, he must make a new life; haunted by both his past and by familiar faces acting in strange new ways. Yet, there is a lesson he must learn. That all good things come with sacrifice.

  Some men were born average and went on to live an average life. He was not, had never been, and would never be one of those men. With his ancestry, it was hardly a surprise. Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel. Darker themes: war, politics, questionable morality, and etc.
