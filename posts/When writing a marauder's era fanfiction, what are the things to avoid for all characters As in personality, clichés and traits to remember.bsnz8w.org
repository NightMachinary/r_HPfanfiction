** Try not to reduce the characters to one or two traits. James is more than a talented, arrogant prick. Remus is more than an angsty werewolf. Sirius is more than a rebellious womanizer. Peter is more than a talentless hanger-on.

Also avoid Mary-Sue-ing Lily. Or making her a white virginal doe, etc.

Snape in the Marauders' era is probably almost exactly like Snape in the books, just perhaps a bit less bitter.

Horace Slughorn is an interesting character. He's quite reasonable and has strengths as well as weaknesses. It's always interesting to see him actually trying to stop his House from being recruited by Death Eaters.

The story doesn't /have/ to have romance as a focus, either.

**** Sirius is (or was pre Azkaban) very attractive, and there was pictures of girls on the walls of his rooms. Also someone probably wrote a succesfull Lady man Sirius (some say "A Black Comedy" but I don't know if there was one before or not), and as all the successfull trope people began to copy it.

I'm not really convinced by the caracterization. I mean Sirius may be against Blood Purity, but he is still a Black. In Snape worst memory, he completely ignore the girls looking at him. As for the pictures of girls on his wall, the simple fact they are Muggle pictures make me convinced it was more a passive aggressive move against his family that a true obssession with the fairer sex.

Then he wishes to do things they did before to live on the glory days but gets told off to grow up when he only wants to reconnect. It causes him to spiral into depression until someone came along and redirected his self loathing to blaming others for Everything that went wrong. Then he crosses the line.

That by the time he realized shit he's far too deep his self loathing makes him think he deserves this punishment, that nothing will ever be the same, he'll never be forgiven and he has nothing. Nothing to lose,nothing to gain so he just follows through too scared to die, but also too scared live by himself, with himself so tries to rationalize a meaning. I gave up everything when he followed LV if he backed out now, everything he gave up will be for nothing, James death will be for nothing. He has to see things through.

** Don't make the Marauders some kind of pranksters like Fred and George. The Maraudeurs were not really focused on pranks, but more on doing what they wanted. Some "activities" are the same for both (like Hogsmeade's contrebande), the Marauders didn't spend weeks developping joke products, and seemed to prefer exploring the castle and the ground. While they may have done some pranks, they were also the kind of person to call what they did in Snape's worst memory a prank (while it's completely bullying).

Don't have Sirius or someone else sticking their tongues out at teachers then run off as a prank(idk I've seen it in several fics), avoid prank wars. One or 2 pranks can be fine but don't do more unless it advances your plot. I believe they are said to be troublemakers not pranksters so do with that as you want.

** Traits to remember that are clearly shown in canon are some of the following:

James is supposed to be unconditionally loyal to his friends and to trust them and he's supposed to be overly fond of himself, his quidditch skills and the way his hair looks. He's funny (Rosmerta calls him and Sirius a double act) and he has an on-going feud with Snape that becomes less public in seventh year.

Remus's lycanthropy 'got better' in fifth year when the others became animagi. He says in PoA that it used to be incredibly painful to transform but that being around the others as animals helped him. He has a muggle mother and a wizard father who studies dark creatures and indirectly was responsible for him being bitten. Tons of fanfiction potential there, I think.

Sirius is consistently descrbed as arrogant and carelessly handsome in the canon school memories. A personal pet peeve of mine is making Sirius the vain one of the group, as the evidence (I think) points to James being more focused on how he looks. Sirius potentially comes from an abusive home (overly used in fanfiction, but it seems canon compliant so whatever) and presumably he has to have really strong beliefs because of the family he came from and the way he cut ties with them. He ran away from home rather than being thrown out by his parents. Sirius and James are said to be the cleverest students in school, and if we believe Pottermore James is supposed to be particularly good at Transfiguration and Sirius at Charms and non-verbal magic. Sirius seems to get easily bored from what we see of him, and he states that he doesn't have to practice for his OWLs. He was definitely mean to Peter in the memory.

Peter is shown to be an intiguing mix of good and bad at magic. The animagus thing like people mentioned, and the way he blew a whole street to pieces with one curse later on. In Snape's memory we also see him say that he wasn't sure of the physical appearance of a werewolf was, which the others mocked as he has seen one with his own eyes and therefore should know. Canon is inconclusive on his talents and intelligence, but fanon all-too-often makes him into an idiot, as others have noted. I think canon points to him being bad at writing down and understanding magic (basically bad in school) but still a powerful caster of the spells he has mastered.

Lily is supposed to be witty and charming and cheeky and very good at potions. She's clearly courageous enough to stand up for Snape while they're still friends. She says her other friends don't understand why she's still friends with him in fifth year, so presumably this is when Snape starts becoming too into the dark arts and becomes close with people who are bullying muggleborns and who are aiming to become Death Eaters. Sirius insinuates in OotP that she had already stopped hating James and started having feelings for him before seventh year, when they get together.

  By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.

  *‘Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,' he heard Sirius say. ‘I'll be surprised if I don't get “Outstanding” on it at least.'*

  *‘Me too,' said James.* He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch.

  ‘Where'd you get that?'

  ‘Nicked it,' said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.

  They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.

  Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open.

  Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn't tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge.

  ‘Put that away, will you,' said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, ‘before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.'

  Wormtail turned slightly pink, but James grinned.

  ‘If it bothers you,' he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.

  ‘I'm bored,' said Sirius. ‘Wish it was full moon.'

  ‘*You might,' said Lupin darkly from behind his book. ‘We've still got Transfiguration, if you're bored you could test me. Here ...' and he held out his book.*

  *But Sirius snorted. ‘I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.'*
#+end_quote

This scene clearly shows that Lupin needs to study unlike James and Sirius and they still feel confident that they know the material and will receive excellent grades. Not to mention that other characters mention multiple times how Talented James and Sirius were even when Sirius was still thought to be a criminal. There isn't really a time where Lupin was mentioned to have been very talented as a student. Also Remus being insecure about being a werewolf doesn't mean he becomes delusional, he would reember how good he and his friends were at magic compared to one another.

**** My thoughts exactly. Though I thought it would be prudent for me to stay quiet on this particular subject. Besides, that animagus business seems like something that simply requires a lot of patience (carrying that leaf in your mouth) and not something terribly complicated. It's not easy, certainly, but since students in Africa also learn this, if I remember correctly, it's not so impossible. Besides, where exactly do you draw the line in this competition of who's the smartest? Those two might end up being shown to be smart to the point where it becomes a bit unbelievable. And Irefuse to believe Remus wasn't as smart as those two, since he actually cared about his studies and worked hard. If he didn't manage to achieve the same marks by studying, then there's something wrong.He became a teacher later and taught all 7 years, that means he must have been skilled in da da at least. OK, sorry, it's just that we know so little about this that it doesn't seem fair to say that Remus didn't have their level of inteligence. of

** I was going to mention chocoholic Remus, but someone already did. But please, please don't do pre full moon sexual drive thing! Also, I think Sirius's abuse can be overdone, at least I think it is. And if you want to focus on it, then you should also show how it affected him.I somehow never believed canon Sirius suffered the level of abuse fanfic authors love to write about in their fics. I also think that it's important to show Peter was also their friend. While it's true they might not have noticed him if it hadn't been for Remus, he did become their friend. Yes, we do see that one memory which shows him as that hanger-on, but if it continues throughoutthe whole fic, you might start thinking that they should have suspected him from the start since he wasn't their friend after all. There are also relationships within the group. I've seen my favourite author choosing to portray Remus and Sirius as having,well, maybe a deeper relationship which to me personally seemed odd since James and Sirius were like brothers. But that might be a matter of opinion. I just never got the impression that Remus and Sirius could understand each other on an emotional level whereas James couldn't support Sirius emotionally. I guess the moral of the story is that you can't please everyone, because no matter what you do or how you choose to portray these characters, there will always be people who like and dislike your choices. I've seen someone praising the author for showing that deep relationship between Remus and Sirius, for example, because they thought it was better than canon. People also like it when other characters, who later became order members, aren't in the same year as the marauders.

I mean, how do you explain this change of heart then?I did love that fic, but if there's that deep emotional connection, there should be trust between them. I'm sure those who use this idea have an explanation for it, but it surprised me that the author thought Remus can understand Sirius the way James can't.
