Due to his Origin of Severing and Binding, when Kiritsugu shoots a Mage with the bullet, it fuses the circuits together and prevents them from being used. As Magic Circuits are part of the Soul, and Voldemort splits his Soul... would it also apply to his ability to use Wizard Magic, making him a Squib, would it end up like Orochimaru, where he could just die and get a new body that can use Magic, or would it screw up his Horcruxes too by binding the Soul?


** The obvious problem with that question is that there are no magic circuits in the HP universe. Its not an energy they use, its more like an ability everyone /could/ use, but only a select few humans are able to perform (I suspect it a brain condition rather than any genetic inheritance).

Additionally, Voldemort isn't using his original body, its a homunculus of sorts that he created through the revival ritual to house the main soul fragment. Even if he were able to be hit with an origin round from Kiritsugu, worst case scenario is he could create a new body to transfer his soul too. He is a genius after all.

**** Here is how I see it.

1. Who can and cannot use magic does NOT seem to be related to blood per say (though it does appear that those with magic who have children more often have magical children).
2. Magic is not an energy or power that exists within them or any magical creatures. It never exhausts them or grows weaker unless the caster themselves is in some physical, mental, or emotional disability.
3. So there is something /different/ about wizards/witches that lets them use magic at all, while non-magicals cannot. But magic can still affect the non-magical and be observed, so its not some inter-dimensional invisible thing: its effects are tangible.

My conclusion from this and other parts of canon is that there is something intrinsically different about all magical creatures, and particularly wizards/witches, that lets them use magic. But it is not magic itself that is different in them. All wizards /theoretically/ are capable of being Voldemort or Dumbledore, but their intellect, personal history, and psyches limit their capabilities in one manner or another.

The only feasible conclusion I can draw is that /wizards/witches can use magic while muggles cannot because there is something different about how they think/. Perhaps even how their brains and minds work. This would explain why some people are born with the capability, while most are not, almost like they have a form of disorder like ADD. It would make sense, magicals would need to be more open to the impossible, open to the idea that magic can break practically any barrier in reality (with only a handful of exceptions like death, which even that is tenuous at best).

Keep in mind though, my /conclusions/ are simply based on the observations I listed above, and are nowhere established as fact. Rowling was pretty on the nose about blood-purity being entirely false, but she deliberately did not give any reason for why one person can use magic while another cannot (except possibly being related to someone who could).

***** 1) is incorrect. Everyone with magic is descended from others with magic. Even Muggle-borns are descended from Squibs, who still pass on the genes for magic.

2) Magic is an energy within wizards. Ollivander, for instance, explicitly says wizards channel their magic into wands, and can channel their magic into almost anything. It's just that magic is not an exhaustible fuel, there doesn't appear to be magic exhaustion.

3) Sure the effects are tangible, but the ability to use magic us stated to be completely hereditary. Newt Scamander does mention that magic affects muggles slightly differently though.

That's what I recall from canon, anyway. Hopefully I didn't misremember anything, heh.

** Well, maybe all of Voldie's horcruxes go kablooie as a result? That's a likely outcome. Oh, and severing the linkages means no familiar, wand bond or mark of affiliation tied to Voldemort anymore.

The whole no magic outcome from F/Z is unlikely, but losing his immortality, wand and hold over his followers, willing and otherwise, would effectively end his career as a Dark Lord.

Bonus points-if his new body is just another horcrux it effectively disembodies him again.

*** That's the outcome I'd like to see. Voldemort ends up Magicless in that body, but that body acts as a Horcrux, and all the others are severed, so he ends up with 1 life left, and comes back with scarier backup (Like a Servant), but is perfectly mortal enough that a sniper round through the skull would kill him for good

** Magic circuits are part of the body, not the soul. So at best origin rounds would force Voldemort into redoing his resurrection Ritual potion.

*** "Magic Circuits reside within the magus's [[http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Soul][soul]]." Is literally the first sentence describing their mechanism. And what is found on the body is just a physical expression of them.

Also, "Because organic activity is necessary for the operation of Circuits, it is a common mistake to think that they are literally a part of the magus body."

Unless, of course, the wiki has been wrong for years and no one was bothered enough to correct it.

**** The Type Moon wiki seems inconsistent on this, as you can see in the article on Magic Circuits:

#+begin_quote
  Magic Circuits (魔術回路, Majutsu Kairo?) are a pseudo-nervous system that spreads itself through the human body and what qualifies a person to be a magus.
#+end_quote

Not huge into the series (the games were always a hassle to get), so maybe I missed something obvious.
