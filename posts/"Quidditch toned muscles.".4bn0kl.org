** You definitely need a lot of core body strength to play Quidditch.

You aren't just using your arms and pointing the broom around, you use a combination of your knees, thighs and core muscles to tilt and steer the broom, doubly so when you have the Quaffle/Beater's Bat/Snitch to worry about and you can't use your hands on the broom.
