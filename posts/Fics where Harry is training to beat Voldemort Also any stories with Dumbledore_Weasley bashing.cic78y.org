** There are tons of Weasley/Dumbledore bashing fics, but hardly any of them are worth the time it takes to read them. Most are just angsty Harry screaming at Dumbledore or super political Harry.

But if it's not just screaming matches they can be ok, for example linkffn(Help of a Seer). That's legitimately the only good one I can think of right now.

For training, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change by lorddwar) is the best one I can think of (may also have some Dumbledore bashing, I can't remember, it's been a while since I read it).

** Bashing isn't too popular here. Writing characters as more competent than canon instead is preferable.
