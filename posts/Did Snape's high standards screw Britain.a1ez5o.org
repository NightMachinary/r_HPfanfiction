In HBP we hear that Snape has vastly different standards to Slughorn.. How badly did this mess with Magical Britain's society at large? Most obvious thing to me, is the lower number of Healers and Aurors during Snape's tenure at Hogwarts


** It's a reasonably common assumption that pops up all the time in canon. Between his high standards and his abysmal teaching practices, there's likely to be significantly fewer NEWT potions students in Britain, resulting in a smaller hiring pool for jobs that require that NEWT.

Even so if you look at hiring practices IRL having a degree is nice and it shows a level of competency in a subject, but if you can demonstrate a similar level of skill through other means (portfolio, past employment, recommendations) you will still be hired, usually with a slightly lower salary compared to someone with a degree but not always.

** There should be fewer qualified wizards for everything from Britain, thanks to Snape. I think all of the important jobs require OWLs or NEWTs in the subject, even things like curse-breaking (gotta know your potions in case some ancient booby trap gets you!), or magizoology (you'll need antidotes).

Even worse is the fact that since Voldemort cursed the DADA job, there must have been fewer and fewer students getting passing grades in this subject as the quality of teachers dropped. See: Molly Weasley, gifted with household charms and so forth, but unable to banish a boggart, something Ginny learns to do in her second year. If you want to be good at Defense in a post-Voldy curse world, you have to be driven enough to learn it alone. In hindsight, this was really clever of Voldemort. Most people were not qualified to fight against him when the war began.

** To counter some of the top comments in this thread: it is well established that canon is written from Harry's perspective, who is not the most impartial of observers. Snape always loathed him -- and that loathing probably impacted his teaching -- but did that really have any effect on the other Houses?

He might have been snappish toward Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, but I don't believe there's any specific notion in canon that he taught them /unwell/. Slytherin, of course, isn't even considered here.

Also, Snape is -- as far as we know -- much better at potions than Slughorn. He is, in fact, a genius potioneer, and the book that he corrected /in his fifth(?) year/ shows this. It is highly likely the students that he favored actually benefited from this and turned out very well qualified.

***** You're right, Harry's account is biased, but we do have some canon info that points to Snape having a negative effect on number of NEWT potions grads. For one, Snape only accepted O students into his NEWTS class while Slughorn and most other professors allowed E students in. This alone would have reduced the number of NEWT potions graduates, thus reducing the employee pool for Healers, Potioneers and Aurors. For another, teaching is its own specialty skill set - being a potions genius does not make Snape a good teacher, so that doesn't actually qualify as an argument.

From a common sense perspective, it doesn't sit right that Hogwarts would have a bad teacher for such an important subject, but with Binns, Trelawny and various DADA profs as examples, Dumbledore's hiring practices do seem to be more about politics and war and less about actual teaching credentials.

****** These are good points. I'd specifically agree with the faculty; one of my thoughts was that -- if Snape was indeed causing such harm -- then surely someone from the Board of Governors or the Ministry would have noticed, brought it up to attention...but indeed there are many questionable faculty members, although that's probably since such a topic simply lies outside the scope of the series.

For the O vs. E, it's reasonable to assume that Snape' standards were simply higher. An argument could be made that as potions is such a critical area for healers/aurors (where any mistake could lead to death), Snape wanted to cut away those with lower knowledge as not only would they pose a higher risk to both themselves and others, but it would let him focus on the best and brightest.

It's debatable, of course.

When I think of Snape, however, I always remember the first speech that he gave about potions: "...there is little foolish wand waving here...I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron...the delicate power of liquids...bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."

That is poetic. That is a man who loves his subject, who is, in fact, deeply passionate about it. And this is only underscored by the fact that he's very well versed in other magical areas as well, those that do involve "foolish wand waving" as we see later on, when he's able to successfully fend off McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout at the same time.

I believe that such an individual would be thrilled to share this knowledge, but most of the students he teaches aren't able to comprehend potions as well as he does or are not motivated enough to (they're "dunderheads") and this irritates him to no reason.

So this then leads us to question whether he's an abysmal teacher to students outside of Harry's friend circle. The answer is: we don't know. It's conjecture. What we do know is that he significantly improved many areas of potion-brewing, which would probably pass into the notes and lectures he gave, which probably improves the knowledge students gained.

Additionally, I /would/ argue that the students who make it into his NEWTS class -- the ones who are not "dunderheads" -- would benefit deeply from the secrets he shares, which would turn them into high class professionals.

There's something implicit in statements like this that many people may not appreciate. Of course in large countries, with multiple schools and universities, filtering out students of lesser ability is a sign of prestige and distinction. Many American universities publish their acceptance rates, as if to show how exclusive they are. In smaller countries, especially those small enough to only have one university, or even sharing a university with multiple member countries, the priorities are somewhat reversed. They share the priority to identify and reward excellence with the priority to graduate enough qualified individuals to keep governments, hospitals, schools and private businesses running.

Hogwarts, as far as J K Rowling has shown, is the only school in Magical Britain. Snape's potions class is the only potions class. Thus he has the responsibility of not just acting as gatekeeper, but also to see that enough graduate his class to go on to do important work, not just directly related to potions, but beyond it in law enforcement, medicine, etc. To give a real life example, I went to a regional university with multiple member countries. What they did was make it relatively easy to pass a class with a C, but very difficult to get an A (or an O in the magical world). So exceptional pupils are distinguished from mediocre ones by their grades, but are not filtered out as ruthlessly as they would be in a more exclusive university. They don't need every doctor to be a MacGyver, ER superhero, someone needs to be treating colds and broken bones too.

With such a tiny population, I would argue that they have enough problems getting *any* class of professional at all, let alone worrying about getting high class professionals. Slytherin is also the house of pureblood prejudice and favoritism, and Snape displays favoritism towards Slytherins multiple times throughout canon. I have trouble believing someone so partial and biased would have such high minded ideals behind his high standards for NEWTs.

More likely I think is the explanation that he had a natural antipathy for teaching, and so tried to reduce his teaching load whenever possible. Dumbledore's hiring decisions were never made with actual education in mind, so he didn't intervene. That Snape could claim to Voldemort later that he ruined a generation of potential aurors and healers would seem to be a nice bonus.

******** This is a very thought-provoking comment. Admittedly, I did not consider the exclusivity of potions at Hogwarts.

However, there is a fantastic post lower in the thread by [[/u/lunanight][u/lunanight]] pointing out that Snape's acceptance rate into his NEWT classes is actually quite high: 25% of Harry's year. That seems to dispel the notion that Snape was wary of his teaching load; most likely, he simply did not see the need to educate those who were unable to achieve outstanding marks. At this point, especially in the upper classes, the burden of education would lie with the student; after all, Hermione, whom Snape did not favor in the least, managed quite well in potions...why? Because she was willing to put in the time.

Also, he was very eager to each DADA throughout the year, which signifies that he was not averse to the notion of teaching.

Now, don't mistake my words for the argument that Snape was a fantastic teacher. A high part of an educator's role is to motivate the student, make them eager to learn, and we all perfectly know that, in regards to Harry and his classmates, Snape failed at that, and failed miserably.

However, what we don't know is whether he treated the other houses in the same manner. But I've stated my position to that above.

********* I read that comment as well, and it made several excellent points using canon. It is suprising that 25% of Hogwarts students managed an O in their Potions OWL. It does give persuasive evidence that Snape can't be that bad, except I still think it unnecessary that he only accept O students when Mcgonagall accepted EE students.

Transfiguration is also portrayed as a difficult branch of magic and Mcgonagall portrayed as incredibly strict, yet EE students were allowed in the class. It makes me wonder what those students sacrificed to get an O in Potions OWL knowing that that was the NEWT requirement while other subjects were less stringent.

It would be better if we got an idea of the rest of the grades. What story would it tell about Snape if 25% of his students got O's but 50% got P's or worse? If he really just wants to identify and propagate only the best students, then what happens to the rest who are mediocre? I think his treatment of Harry and Ron could be indicative. But now I'm going into speculation and I'll stop before I'm accused of bashing.

********** You raise some good points there. Honestly, it would seem logical to me that potions would be a critical area for healers and aurors both, and I'd expect that a potions NEWT would be required too.

I'd say, however, that the pass percentages are still very pertinent. The fact that teachers like Umbridge and Snape are passing students with O's speaks not to their low qualifications but -- just as you pointed out -- to the independent study of those students. The way I see it, Hogwarts, due to the small teacher-student ratio and the specialisations that students begin to seek in their latter years, highly promotes self-study. As there are no magical universities that we know of, students after Hogwarts get sent straight into the work-force, which means that by year 5, they're already looking at potential careers and that those careers demand. Which means they are motivated to study and excel in the fields they need, while dropping subjects they have no interest in (It would be doubtful, for example, that an Auror would need divination).

So, essentially, what that means is that about 25% of Harry's year feel they /need/ a Potions (or DA) NEWT -- and are consequently motivated enough to seek it.

I'm not sure about that - there is a reason a lot of prodigies go into research rather than teaching. Teaching is its own area of interest and being really good at something doesn't automatically make you a good teacher. Lupin is not said to be particularly gifted in any area of magic (more of a jack of all trades) but he's presented as a great teacher. Snape likes research and is interested in teaching DADA - anything about him liking to teach potions is conjecture not supported by existing canon. I love baking and I'm good at it - but I don't want to teach it and actually only like to bake when I have the kitchen to myself without anyone bothering me. I did support myself during uni by tutoring math which I was average at.

Having said that, IF I was Dumbles, I would hire a junior professor to teach the first four years of potions and leave Snape to only teach the older students once they have the basics down.

He clearly believes that practically everyone will accept that he is giving extra lessons to a student he hates.

This leads me to believe that under normal circumstances, despite his massive work schedule (seriously have a look at whitehound's meta about how many hours Hogwarts teachers work) Snape might be willing to offer extra tuition to students who want to take Potions at NEWT level but don't quite make the grade.

Sure, someone with lower grades may have done well enough to graduate. But historically it was judged that the level of work needed for those students to be successful vs what was lost for the other students wasn't worth it.

I disagree with Snapes methodology (assuming that this was his methodology), but I can understand it. An OWL is considered the qualification to be a Wizard. Having an OWL in potions should mean you can go out and pick up some ingredients and instructions and make the common potions needed by the average wizard.

Magical Britain does not have an equivalent to the police. Each branch of the civil service also enforces the law that it is responsible for. Arthur drafts laws regarding Muggle artefacts and enforces those laws. Civil servants from Creatures conduct hearings and also perform enforcement. Etc.

The closest thing to the police is probably the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

If you had to make a real life comparison for Aurors, I'd probably classify them as bounty hunters on retainer. They need to know potions because it's an extremely useful branch of magic both for themselves and for the individuals they are trying to catch. They need to understand how to recognise and counter potions than their enemies are using as well as take advantage of potions themselves.

The point some people have made (and which I'm just trying to build on) is that Aurors could easily be organised into teams of specialists. As a Dark-wizard-catching unit I think this makes sense.

In situations like when Sirius was apprehended, a full team of Aurors would have shown up. In this case they should all have advanced defensive/duelling abilities and some of them can have specialist knowledge, such as Potions, curses, artifacts, etc. thereby making up a fully functional team that can deal with different situations.

For smaller cases where only a single Auror or pair would be sent, this could be done by someone whose job is to triage; they are more of a generalist with knowledge of various topics. If they then find they need someone more specialist, they call for backup.

** I think the implications would be much broader. As well as the ones mentioned, I imagine a steady rise in potion prices due to the lack of specialists. And I mean all potions slowly becoming unavailable to larger and larger portions of populations, which unproportionally enriches those who sell them, drives the prices of ingredients down because of reduction in sales and market overflow, and, worst of all, increases the number of accidents related to black market potions of shitty quality and to attempted home-brewing. And that would increase the need for healers, as well.

The ripples terrify me as someone who studies management and economics. If Snape continued teaching for another couple decades, he would have single-handedly driven Magical Britain's law-enforcement, creature breading, ingredient farming (or whatever it's called), medicine, and science (Department of Mysteries, I suppose) sectors into the ground.

** Snape's standards had no effect whatsoever on the number of Healers and Aurors during his tenture. Why? Because when we see Harry and Ron take NEWT Potions, they are the only ones who didn't have the appropriate textbook required for the class. There were a total of 12 students in that class, yet two of them lacked the book needed.

What it actually implies is that Harry and Ron were the only students there who had Exceeds Expectations. Everyone else in Slughorn's class earned an Outstanding on their Potions OWL because they already knew they were taking the class and met Snape's standards. Meaning that even after the standards of NEWT Potions were lowered, 10 out of the 12 students taking NEWT Potions were students who already met Snape's standards for an Outstanding. The only students who were actually impacted by Snape's standards in Harry's year were Harry and Ron. The rest of Harry's year either got an Acceptable or lower on their OWLs (which is still lower than Slughorn's standard and the standard for other NEWT subjects), or they were already taking NEWT Potions since they got an Outstanding (i.e. Hermione, Draco, and everyone else in that class except Harry and Ron).

Also, given that there are at least 40 students in Harry's year (since Rowling specifically listed 40 students as a minimum), the fact that 10 students out of 40 students got an Outstanding means that 25% (or one-quarter) of the students in Harry's year met Snape's standard. Let that sink in: 25% of Harry's year achieved the wizarding equivalent of an A or A* on their GCSE Chemistry exam. Its also implied (but not explicitly confimed) that very few students actually failed the Potions OWL, if any at all. Even in the case of Neville, we don't know if he failed the Potions OWL. All we know is that he didn't get an Exceeds Expectations or higher. Same goes with everyone else who didn't take Potions during HBP.

Also, there is another misconception that should be cleared up: NEWT Potions is NOT actually required to become an Auror. McGonagall recommended DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology and Potions as the best subjects to ensure that Harry is qualified enough to pass Auror training. But the actual Auror requirements are just having any 5 NEWTs at Exceeds Expectations or higher. Aurors don't needed Potions or any of the aforementioned subjects. It wouldn't surprise me if many Aurors never even studied DADA at NEWT-level, given Dawlish's incompetence at dealing with Hagrid despite having several other Aurors as back-up. McGonagall mentioning those five subjects as the best subjects to be an Auror would be like saying that you need to study History to become a historian. It isn't actually required, since one could study Journalism, English, Politics, or Law and still acquire the required skills needed for being a historian. However, studying History just makes understanding the job easier than doing a completely unrelated subject (i.e. biology).

*TL;DR: Snape's standards didn't affect Britain at all. Its a common misconception that Snape's teaching standards negatively impacted Magical Britain due to him being an easy character to vilify. Another misconception is the idea that Potions is needed to be an Auror.*

*** While interesting, some of this is false. You claim Potions and the others were merely recommendations to become an Auror, and that any 5 NEWTs would do. This is incorrect. Harry received 5 OWLs that would get him into the NEWT course (DADA, Transfiguration, Herbology, Charms and Care of Magical Creatures) and yet identified his lack of an "O" in Potions as spelling the death knell to his dream to be an Auror. This shows that, yes, Potions is required as are the others. Otherwise Harry's reaction made no sense, he had the required number of OWLs if what you were saying there was correct. Just look:

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret. . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn't, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.
#+end_quote

Now for the longer one. You make a big deal about the pass percentage but that doesn't seem to be much in context. In the NEWT DADA class Snape taught, Harry mentions that "at least half the class" could cast a Shield Charm already because Harry taught them in the DA. The exact number isn't mentioned, but the named students in the class (in that chapter anyway) are:

Parvati, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Ernie and Draco.

Now ignoring Draco, we know that means Snape's DA class was at least 16 people (plus Draco). 8 of those at least were taught the Shield Charm by Harry. So that means nearly half the class (ignore the DA members) passed the DADA OWL despite the surely shit teaching that Umbrige did. I'm too lazy to check for anything more precise about the number of students in the DADA class that year (I'd have to comb HBP to see if I missed any), nor to see the other classes, but my basic point is that JKR clearly didn't think through the math on pass rates and high achievers. If Umbridge's non-teaching still managed to get through nearly as many people as Snape (she passed 9, he got 10 prior to Ron & Harry), and more if we counted the DADA members (which would be silly, but I can't get a more accurate number right now), then it surely doesn't count for Snape to have passed about the same number. Her pass rate is either just under or even higher than 25% and that's before the DADA are counted.

But mostly, I think my first response is really relevant because the answer is certain there. Potions and the other subjects are specifically required for those careers.

  Snape's mouth wrinkled under his nose in an expression of disdain. "Few things in this world annoy me as much as dunderheads who uncritically compare the most subtle science of potion-making ... to cooking. Unfortunately, the reason that comparison annoys me so much is because it is substantially correct. The essence of potion-making involves understanding what ingredients to use; how to properly chop, dice, crush or otherwise prepare the ingredients before adding them to the cauldron; and how long to let them brew and at what temperature. If you understand the fundamental techniques and can follow directions and above-all have sufficient patience and attention to detail, you can brew nearly any potion simply by following the directions, just as a reasonably intelligent Muggle can follow the recipes in a cookbook to prepare any dish. But, just because any imbecile can cook a grilled cheese sandwich doesn't mean he can just as easily prepare a Beef Wellington."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "My point, Mr. Flint, is that the there are no new techniques that are tested on the Potions NEWT that will be introduced in Years Six and Seven, which focus instead on advanced techniques offered as preparation for a future Potions apprenticeship. You already know every technical skill you need to pass the exam right now. The only difference between the OWL and NEWT exams lies in the increased number of potions you are expected to either brew from memory or via written instructions. That is why my practice from Day One is to write the brewing instructions on the blackboard and give little further direct instruction to the entire class -- because that is how the OWL and NEWT practical exams are given. And while my students may whine endlessly about my teaching techniques, they have borne fruit in the form of a fifteen percent increase in the number of Hogwarts students who pass the Potions OWL compared to my predecessor, as well as a twenty percent increase in the number of students who eventually complete a Mastery."

Dumbledore allowed DADA education to fall into a pitiful state without seeming to do much about it. He tolerated the presence of people like Quirrell, Lockhart and Umbridge. He couldn't tell that Moody was Crouch Jr in disguise.

Dumbledore was brilliant in many ways, but I do think the matter of Voldemort/Tom Riddle really drained his energy for many other things. It doesn't surprise me at all if the consequences of Snape's biased teaching and harsh standards were something Dumbledore felt to be addressed later.

****** Honestly I think those things happened and Dumbledore allowed them bc.. it's a kids book and they needed to happen, narratively. Obviously if it was real he wouldn't allow that to happen. The consequences of high standards of high school education on the wider workforce of Britain isn't something that exists in Harry's World bc it's a kids book and he's a child and most fans aren't going to care bc they're supposed to be like 9. I think it's just unreasonable to hold the books to the standard that you should be able to derive those wider consequences from what to most kids will be just a teacher being really mean when that's not something that was ever covered or discussed in the books and wasn't meant to be, if you know what I mean? it's just a completely different playing field when it comes to childrens' literature

** It definitely would have led to lower numbers of healers and Aurors.

However, the question is more... was it significant enough to actually play a role in the "war" against Voldemort or not. In my view, the numbers lost would not have been enough to really change anything major in terms of the 2nd Voldemort "war" if you will. I don't forsee enough extra healers or Aurors each year being added over the course of Snape's tenure, if Snape was not teaching, to make a difference in the grand scheme of things.

Might the extra numbers have helped save a few people, or delayed certain things? Perhaps. But at the end of the day, the problems that led to what was occurring within the British Wizarding world (specifically in the last 2 books) would have wiped the slate clean if you will in terms of any effect Snape would have had on the future Magical Britains society long term. A rebuild would have occurred either way.

I guess my point is, It certainly had an effect, but the reality is that effect was not impactful in any significant way to Magical Britain going forward.

*** Say that 5 people each year wanted to join the Auror's but only one of them got the grades to go into the NEWT classes. That'd effectively remove 4/5th of the potential Auror's. Now, for simplicity's sake let's do a decade. Meaning we've got a total of 50 students that's wanted to join the aurors but only 10 of them have. Now we have about 5 named Auror's and no number on how many there are. But I'd think there'd at least be 20 of them and not more than a hundred. So either way you look at it another 50 is a boon.\\
Now what would that mean for the war effort? Well for one, more manpower means more operations going on at once. It also means more defensive projects can be done at once as well, as they are likely to be time consuming.

**** While I understand your point, you are making significant leaps with regards to number assumptions. A couple points:

Point 1:

Just because 5 people wanted to join the Aurors each year, doesn't mean they would all make it, even IF they were allowed into NEWT classes. I would imagine based upon what knowledge we have about the Auror corps, that the application and training process weeds out quite a few potential candidates. This means that another 50 over 10 years is HIGHLY unlikely because that would be a 100% acceptance and auror graduation rate. Looking at real-life numbers for comparison when it comes to similar types of elite units, the reality is of those 50, likely only about 10-15 would actually make it.

To shore up this point further, we do know that via info from Minerva McGonagall and Tonks, that not a single Auror had been taken on by the Ministry of Magic for 3 years prior to 1995. This means that even the few that made it past snape, did not make it into the Aurors. Tonks graduates to full-fledged Auror in 1994 meaning she would have been the last candidate taken on (in 1991)

Point 2:

We know there are a significant number of Aurors because while we only hear 6 named ones or so, there are multiple occasions where we hear about Aurors stationed elsewhere. We can also extrapolate that its unlikely Harry would know every Auror via a connection, and then by looking at how many students are in Hogwarts and realizing there may be homeschooled students or possible foreign applicants, we can make some estimates. Taking this route would lead us to the assumption that the Auror force is likely no less than 50 strong, even after losing many in the first war. Tacking on another 10-15 is unlikely to make much of a difference, especially since its also likely that many of that "possible 50" die in the 10 years we are discussing. Meanwhile, Voldemorts forces are quite larger later on, and he has corrupted some of the Aurors, and has his fingers in the ministry via Malfoy and others. This further weakens the Auror forces.

At the end of the day, even if we were generous with the numbers and said 25, I don't see that making much of a difference in the war itself from what we know about how it goes if for no other reason than Voldemort could have taken a significant number out singlehandedly.

Dumbledore still wore three hats at over 120 years old, and Madame Marchbanks was even older, and still working. It's not unlikely that Healers would continue working up to and over 100 years old. So a fully staffed hospital from 50 years ago would likely still have many of the same staff. The community is too small to demand many healers, and too long-lived to demand a high intake.

** His requirement is only one letter-grade above Mcgonagall's and his subject is more dangerous to students, so I'd say that his requirements are not entirely unreasonable. It is also not unreasonable for a teacher to require a certain grade before allowing students to take an advanced course - remember that the NEWTS are not a required exam like the OWLS and are in fact, optional.

Requiring that students attain a good grade in their subject is a way for Hogwarts teachers to make sure that only students who can cope with the coursework are accepted into their classes - as Mcgonagall explains to Neville when she refuses to allow him into her NEWT-level Transfigurations class.

Additionally, Snape's teaching methods, while unpleasant, were undoubtedly effective since all his students achieved a passing OWL in his subject.

He offers Remedial lessons as well (in OotP he clearly thinks that Malfoy will not question his story that he is giving Harry remedial Potions lessons, and Draco doesn't, which means that at least some students believe that Snape will offer remedial lessons even to a student he is known to despise) so it's not exactly a leap of logic to assume that under normal circumstances (which by Harry's fifth year they certainly were not) Snape would offer remedial lessons to students who would like to take NEWT Potions but don't quite have the marks.
