I had no idea this existed and I'm genuinely interested, does anyone have any good examples?


** /Limpieza de Sangre/ is the most famous one, , and I believe the author is working on a sequel at the moment. I recently finished /Thunderstorm/, which I really enjoyed. Lastly, there is /Power Is Control/, the most.../explicit/ of the stories I've listed. I personally couldn't finish it, but it's there if you want to read it.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** OP, these are like the only good ones, I literally just linked Power Is Control the other day, but I know it's definitely not for everyone.

However, it's the most believable one IMO. femTom is sexually obsessed with Harry because of Horcrux, forces him to submit to being with her, and then Harry just kinda does his "saving people thing" by trying to use it to mitigate damages. It's a decent story if you can put up with (or enjoy) the smut.

** This is the only decent-ish one I've ever seen:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9666689/1/A-Beautiful-Collision]]

(I can never remember how the bot works.)

Edit: Forgot to mention that it's more-or-less abandoned. The author got three chapters in and hasn't updated in years, but they're still active on the site, and they've expressed interest in returning to the story at some point, so it's not a lost cause.
