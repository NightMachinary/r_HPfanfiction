For instead of Voldemort rising out of the cauldron, it was something much, much worse.


** The... /thing/ that now lay within the cauldron wasn't human. It wasn't even close to human. It tried to rise, then seemed to lose its strength, flopping its body against the side of the cauldron, hard enough to make it tilt and topple over. /It/ spilled out across the unkempt lawn of the graveyard.

Whatever it was, it was very small, and still soaking wet, enough to make its orange fur matted and glistening in the moonlight. It stirred then, rolling over away from where the full moon had shone on its face.

‘Merlin,' it said sleepily. ‘I hate Mondays.'

** Harry strained to see through the mist shrouding the form slowly standing up in the large cauldron. It looked vaguely humanoid but something about it felt off. There were two nubs protruding from its head; were they horns? And it seemed to have long hair coming in two flat bunches down the back of its neck...and the nose looked more like a snout...

Then the mist began to dispel and Harry screamed in horror. Those were not horns - they were eyestalks! And the hair was just two fleshy...ears? Were they ears?

The thing started to climb out of the cauldron, but as it brought the second leg out, the tip of a wide, three-toed foot caught on the edge, causing the monster to fall flat on its face with a loud shriek. It clambered to its feet, still not looking at Harry. Then...it spoke.

"Robe meesa," the monster demanded in a horrifying nasally voice.

Wormtail scrambled to gather the robes lying on the ground. The monster waited until it was clothed and then turned slowly to face Harry.

"Ani? Is that yousa?"

** A large, hunched, seated figure rose out of the cauldron. The mist shrouded most of its hulking form from Harry's view, but there was no mistaking the dim light reflecting from the two soulless eyes, covered by a mask.

The /thing/ splashed around in the cauldron for a few seconds with its arms, much like a child in a kiddy pool, though Harry was pretty sure kiddy pools did not send waves of caustic liquid over the edge to hiss on the fire below and wither the grass around them.

One rubber-gloved hand gripped the edge of the cauldron as it hauled itself up to a standing position. Harry shrank back in horror from the hefty monster as it deftly climbed out of the cauldron. Two black boots hit the ground, and Harry's eyes gradually moved up the soot-stained loose-fitting trousers held by a black belt and wide suspenders, to the dull thick shirt, to the odd cylindrical tank strapped to its back, to the dark mask covering its entire head. The mask. Harry vaguely remembered it from a primary school unit on old wars. It was supposed to protect the troops from gas attacks. However, on this /thing/, it looked monstrous.

The figure held out its hand and Wormtail shakily waved his wand at another gravestone, and a big yellow object floated out from behind it. This object looked a bit like a mad scientist's musical instrument...perhaps one that Willy Wonka would have devised. It had three main bell-shaped tubes at one end, with a smaller one attached to one side. These tubes wrapped around a grey nozzle of some sort, which was itself attacked to a big pink globe with a valve at the top of it. Two hoses connected the backs of the tubes to the globe.

Harry had no clue what this was, but the monster clearly did, as it suddenly clapped its hands together and jumped in obvious excitement. The monster skipped over to the instrument and clutched it close to its body for a few second, hugging it tightly, then held it out in front of it. /Rainbows/ suddenly sprang from the bell tubes at the end and burned the gravestones in front of it, leaving a wide swath of charred stone and foliage in the rainbows' wake.

The rainbows suddenly disappeared, and for the first time, the figure turned to face Harry.

"Hudda hudda huh!"

** The result was pink, spotted, and featured a clownesque face that remained unmoving as it spoke the words "Blobby blobby blobby" over and over again in an unnervingly unnatural voice.

Harry vaguely recognized the figure from a TV program that had given Dudley nightmares once. Dudley had spent a particularly rainy day in front of the TV, the summer after Harry's second year, and had ended up watching a program called "Noel's House Party" out of sheer boredom - which turned out to have been a mistake, as that day the pink abomination featured heavily in the program.

Of course, the nightmares were promptly blamed on Harry's "freakishness" and he'd gotten in trouble for it, undeservedly - the Dursleys refused to admit that their son had been frightened that much by a character in a TV show.

None of which prepared Harry for the reality of the figure that had, with much difficulty, managed to crawl its way out of a cauldron that seemed much smaller than any part of its body, and was now screaming "Blobby! Blobby Blobby!" at the uncomprehending Death Eaters that had gathered in the graveyard.

(For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of watching one of the more popular TV shows in the UK in the 90's, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blobby][This abomination]] is what I'm talking about.)
