** A bit confusing towards the end but linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King) have quite a sophisticated language, especially by third year.

I'm not quite so sure about this one given that I haven't reread recently but I believe that linkffn(too young to die) can be what you are searching for. The beginning is extremely confusing but don't worry, all the plot threads and AU elements are addressed sooner or later.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** Oh, and I just remembered this one but IIRC you might like linkffn(with strength of steel wing).

And of course I would be remiss if I didn't link one of the better written crossover. Knowledge of the Fate/ series and the Nasuverse is helpful but not necessary at all, there are some pretty good explanations, linkffn(10918531).

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

** This is a self-rec so I make no claims to quality, and it's slash, so if you're typical of most of this sub it won't be your thing. But if you don't care either way, it's a short Dumbledore/Snape one-shot with a background of Snape obsessing over Harry. The AD/SS is more of a dynamic than a relationship, and there's one fairly explicit blow job that's primarily about their contest of wills. The POV is Dumbledore's, and the language was chosen to reflect his intellectual flamboyance, with an eye to the fact that he was raised in an era of more formal speech patterns and heightened vocabulary.

I tried to keep Snape as close to canon as possible, so if you're looking for a sympathetic Snape this may not be for you. The story was inspired by the "You disgust me" scene on the hillside, so Dumbledore's not exactly the soul of kindness here, either.

The ending needed a sequel to make sense, but I wouldn't recommend reading it, as it's about Snape's moral despair carried to its disturbing conclusion.
