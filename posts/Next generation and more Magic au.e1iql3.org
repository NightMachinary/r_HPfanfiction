I legit need input:

So I'm writing a AU fanfics where the fall of the Dark Lord and his followers and subsequent winning of the light, forces Magic to act on her will. She unlocks magic that had been restrained, forgotten, and disgarded as the wars between Light and Dark restricted everyone's power. All children born during and after the last war have magic great and beyond what is being taught. The thing about my fanfic though is that it's got a lot of K-pop characters involved as well as different children of the Golden Trio. Should I make a version of this fanfic without the kpop characters to accommodate for people who don't follow or care for KPOP, or keep it as it is and let it be as it was meant to be as I'm writing it?

Also, when writing fanfics and it's au at, should you make multiple versions if you want to include different fandoms?
