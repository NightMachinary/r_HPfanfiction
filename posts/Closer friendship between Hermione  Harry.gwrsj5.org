I'd like to see a fic where Harry and Hermione are closer, with more interaction scenes of just Harry and Hermione (maybe after Ron gets jealous in Goblet of Fire?). Preferably no Harry/Hermione romance, but if it's realistic/well-written I'd be happy to read it. Thanks!


** there was this one story in wich harry saves hermione from the troll with the help of slytherins bassilisk. later Snape adopts them making them actually brother and sister. Sadly i cant remember its name.
